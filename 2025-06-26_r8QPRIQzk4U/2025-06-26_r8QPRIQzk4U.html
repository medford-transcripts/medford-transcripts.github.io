    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=137.188s">One</a>  moment.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=149.853s">Okay,</a>  first item on the agenda is, I will also say that our last two meetings, if anyone has participated in those, were a very long meeting, so I'm going to try to do my best to move things along more expeditiously, and I would ask for everyone's help in doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=167.823s">Keep</a>  your comments as concise as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=173.226s">First,</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=175.598s">move</a>  to approve the minutes of the meetings for both June 18th, 2020, as well as July 16th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=183.183s">For</a>  June 18th, 2020, do board members have any questions, comments, or edits?</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=194.771s">Andre,</a>  this is Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=195.571s">I</a>  don't have any comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=197.072s">I've</a>  read them, and I wanted to make a motion to approve the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=200.454s">If</a>  I can for both meetings in one motion, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=203.016s">If</a>  not, we can do it separately.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=205.046s">Let's</a>  do one at a time in case there are comments on the July minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=209.647s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor to approve the minutes for June. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=213.188s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

Just mute if you're not speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=231.212s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=231.632s">There's</a>  some feedback there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=235.678s">So</a>  the roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=237.439s">Deanna</a>  Peabody?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=297.715s">David</a>  Blumberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=299.096s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=299.956s">And</a>  I'm an aye as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=300.877s">6-0,</a>  the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=302.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=305.94s">Next</a>  item on the agenda, we have an A in our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=309.542s">It's</a>  also, for the members of the public, an approval not required plan for review at 73 to 79 George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=317.087s">So</a>  the applicant here owns two adjacent lots along George Street and is proposing to create three lots, each one <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=324.004s">5,000</a>  square feet in size, with 50 feet of frontage along George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=330.969s">With</a>  A&Rs, board members know, members of the public may not know, A&R stands for approval not required, and that's exactly what this is, and the board must approve as long as it meets the minimum zoning requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=346.841s">The</a>  lots appear to do so, they've been reviewed by the city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=352.713s">and</a>  building commissioner and that they're satisfied with the requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=360.68s">Board</a>  members, you have the chance to take a look at the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=364.444s">Any</a>  questions that you might have? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=370.609s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion to approve the A&R plan?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=383.204s">Hi,</a>  this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=385.064s">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve the A&R plan.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=387.725s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=389.365s">There's</a>  a motion to approve the A&R plan for 73 to 79 George Street.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=394.666s">And</a>  Andre, I just want to correct the record there that the building commissioner reviewed this, not the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=400.047s">Yes,</a>  I misspoke at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=401.647s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=405.448s">Is</a>  there a second to the motion?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=450.557s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=454.499s">Next</a>  item on the agenda is a continued public hearing for 278 Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=459.342s">This</a>  is the proposed gas station at the BJ's lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=464.927s">continued</a>  from June 18th, 2020, as well as July 16th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=470.293s">The</a>  Community Development Board is the special permit granting authority for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=476.32s">So</a>  let me reread the public hearing notice.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=484.048s">One</a>  moment.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=487.468s">Andre,</a>  this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=490.71s">I'm</a>  not sure if I should do this before you read the notice, but I did want to disclose that I work for Stantec. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=499.175s">And</a>  I just learned since the last board meeting that Stantec has been hired by BJ's to provide environmental consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=508.64s">So</a>  with that new information, I am going to abstain from reviewing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=515.965s">and</a>  participating any further in this review. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=519.446s">So</a>  I am going to mute and stop my video for this portion of the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=526.329s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Christy, appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=531.711s">Public</a>  hearing notice that was first opened on June 18th, 2020 of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=538.11s">The</a>  Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=542.591s">That</a>  was continued into July and to today at 6.45 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=548.192s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit site plan review application submitted by BJ's Wholesale Club to construct a self-service fueling station within a portion of the existing parking area 278 and 0 Middlesex Avenue and allowed use in an industrial zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=565.569s">The</a>  site is currently occupied by an existing BJ's Wholesale Club with associated surface parking and site improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=572.212s">The</a>  proposed facility will be comprised of a 200 more or less square foot kiosk gasoline attendant facility with canopy of 4,525 square feet and a six dispenser service pump island. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=586.779s">A</a>  copy of the application may be viewed in the office of community development room 308 or on the city's website at <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=593.609s">www.medfordma.org</a>  backslash departments backslash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=604.814s">This</a>  time I reopen the public hearing and I would like to invite the proponents to present their revised materials and speak to their progress since our last meeting.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=622.138s">Uh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=622.98s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=626.385s">Attorney</a>  Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer Bronstein, representing the applicant BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=632.543s">a</a>  few folks with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=633.824s">Could</a>  I just, before making any presentation, could I just ask a procedural question? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=640.268s">I</a>  know you have a seven-member board, and I understand a board member is elected to recuse herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=647.132s">Are</a>  the remaining six members present? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=651.335s">I</a>  didn't know if you were... <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=655.13s">How</a>  many board members you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=656.951s">The</a>  reason I ask is I know there's a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=660.113s">So</a>  therefore, I believe we would need the quantum of vote would be five out of the remaining six. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=668.037s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=668.858s">So</a>  I just wanted to just understand if you only had five that would be present or?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=678.143s">Yes,</a>  there'd be five voting board members at this time.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=685.253s">Okay,</a>  so one member is absent this evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=688.656s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=692.7s">So,</a>  I guess I'm just wondering whether it would behoove us to continue the hearing if the board were willing just, I know this is all happening in real time right now, but since we wouldn't have a full board and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=712.837s">already</a>  lost one board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=718.019s">Just</a>  thinking that that might be appropriate in this instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=722.42s">Otherwise,</a>  we would likely need to have a unanimous vote of all five. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=731.304s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=733.224s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=733.905s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=736.065s">And</a>  that is, we're happy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=738.826s">If</a>  you'd like to request that at the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=741.463s">If</a>  you would also like to take the advantage of the time that we're all here to present your revisions and progress, we could also do that before continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=755.047s">Might</a>  be helpful to see if we've gotten the issues that were raised addressed.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=762.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=763.31s">With</a>  the understanding that the board member not participating tonight would be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=771.7s">watch</a>  a tape of the hearing to be able to participate at the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=774.981s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=776.081s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=776.281s">Because</a>  I think everyone's been at each of the prior two meetings, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=780.062s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=780.822s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=781.303s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=783.903s">So</a>  I guess I would, I know we have my client. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=788.544s">If</a>  we were there in real person, I would look over at my client and just confirm that that's acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=793.946s">But</a>  I think that's appropriate to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=801.276s">go</a>  forward, but I don't know, Patrick, do you, or Austin, just would like to get their input.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=812.022s">Annie,</a>  can you unmute Patrick? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=820.007s">I</a>  think you're unmuted now, Patrick.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=823.449s">Somehow</a>  you're still muted on your end. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=825.21s">We</a>  can't hear you talking.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=826.931s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=827.511s">There's</a>  too many mute buttons in the Zoom life that we all live. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=831.828s">That</a>  is fine, Mr. Chairman, with the understanding that Mark outlined in terms of the individual who is absent being able to participate in the next hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=839.592s">We're</a>  happy to go through what we've put together for you tonight, and we can take it from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=846.016s">So</a>  yes, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=846.556s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=848.037s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=850.192s">I</a>  just want to sort of comment procedurally that Annie and I just discussed that we actually haven't had it happen in her memory for a Community Development Board, but I will state that our Conservation Commission and Zoning Board have both felt that somebody could read up on the minutes and come up to speed on a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=870.108s">And</a>  now that these are being recorded, it seems obvious that they could watch the recording and actually fully come up to speed on everything that transpired at the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=881.698s">Yes,</a>  and I think that's what Attorney Vaughn would like the board member to do, and we'll make sure that happens.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=891.066s">Okay,</a>  is there any question that that can't happen with the Community Development Board? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=896.11s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=901.75s">Okay,</a>  so sorry for all the procedural questions here, but so now I guess to the substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=907.715s">So</a>  I don't have much to say, Mr. Chairman, you'd probably be pleased to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=912.759s">I</a>  think that we did submit some revised materials a couple of weeks ago to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=918.884s">Again,</a>  I think everyone here is familiar with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=923.427s">It's</a>  a retail gasoline station that BJ's is looking to provide within its parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=931.093s">We</a>  have shown that, you know, the parking supply would be more than adequately met from a zoning in a practical perspective even with this utilization of a portion of that parking lot for this use. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=944.726s">There</a>  were some questions that had come up at the prior meeting or meetings that we had that we have tried to incorporate all of that feedback and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=954.414s">and</a>  put it into the revised plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=956.435s">I</a>  think what I was going to do was ask Austin Turner, who is with Bowler Engineering, to present to the board what changes we have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=967.359s">And</a>  I guess the only thing I would mention is, so again, to remind the board, the project is under zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=975.021s">It's</a>  allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=976.142s">So</a>  the use itself is a by right use. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=979.023s">But</a>  as a major project, quote unquote, it does require <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=982.844s">a</a>  special permit with site plan approval by the Community Development Board, which is why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=988.507s">But</a>  I think the use is very much consistent with the surroundings in terms of what's in and around that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=996.791s">I</a>  hope the one thing that does come across is that we have tried to be very attentive and responsive to the feedback that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1005.336s">And</a>  I think it's made for a better plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1008.902s">as</a>  opposed to being repetitive here, I will turn it over to Austin and he can walk you through that if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1015.408s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1021.993s">Hold</a>  on a moment while we get you unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1023.775s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1025.597s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1026.237s">Annie,</a>  thank you for allowing me the pleasure of my voice in the virtual world. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1032.444s">So</a>  as Mr. Vaughn mentioned, we've made a number of updates based on all the feedback that we've received from these hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1041.03s">And</a>  frankly, they've been very productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1042.651s">And</a>  I think you'll see that the site plan has been improved as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1046.374s">So</a>  I'm gonna share my screen if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1050.417s">And</a>  I will show you what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1054.62s">Can</a>  everybody see that okay?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1063.121s">It</a>  says you've started screen sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1064.843s">Oh,</a>  there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1065.523s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1066.264s">Come</a>  up now.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1067.325s">So</a>  I've got what you're looking at here is an overview of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1072.109s">I'll</a>  give you kind of a big picture, and then I'll dial into some of the specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1076.213s">But</a>  we've made a number of different site plan updates and improvements resulting from these conversations, as I had mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1084.691s">As</a>  you can see, we're introducing some changes and some improvements to other portions of the site which aren't directly related to this specific set of improvements associated with the fueling station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1096.221s">One</a>  of the most significant, and I believe, I'm just gonna zoom in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1102.086s">So</a>  I believe it was member Blumberg who mentioned the queuing and there were some questions about how that functioned and specifically, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1113.918s">asked</a>  some questions about how we had it, if you recall, an intersection, if you can see my cursor circling, we'd had an intersection there, which was going to be a two-way traffic intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1124.95s">And</a>  he had expressed some feedback, some candidly very, very good feedback that we've incorporated in response to that, we've made an improvement to the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1135.101s">So</a>  what we've done <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1136.662s">is</a>  this driveway here that I'm pointing to was originally a two-way access drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1140.784s">It</a>  could accommodate inbound and outbound vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1144.026s">We've</a>  eliminated the outbound movement from this driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1146.987s">It</a>  is an in only now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1149.449s">And</a>  really what that does is it further exaggerates the queuing and the vehicle flow through the fueling station that was already as part of the plan, but it reinforces the one-way circulation pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1164.715s">And</a>  you can see here as the fueling station is arranged, vehicles come in, move to the right, and then can filter into any number, any one of the fueling positions of which there are 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1176.0s">There</a>  are six pumps and 12 fueling positions, which really is intended to benefit the customer, provide for an efficient fueling operation where you don't get queuing or stacking at pumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1188.626s">Now</a>  that proceeds in a counterclockwise fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1192.787s">So</a>  as you come through, you take a left, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1194.672s">again,</a>  in a one-way driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1196.814s">In</a>  the previous version, you would be able to come out, take that immediate left again, come out, and then exit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1203.72s">Now,</a>  as was expressed, there was some concern about this intersection becoming a little bit cumbersome or perhaps having conflicting movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1212.008s">In</a>  response to that, we've closed it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1215.877s">And</a>  really, we put in a very, very large landscaping island. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1218.859s">So</a>  that has the benefit also of further defining and reinforcing the intended queuing and vehicular travel movements, but also provides a fairly substantial additional landscape on where we've all seen and we were talking about earlier, did not exist in this parking lot before. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1235.628s">So</a>  there's an added benefit beyond just simply the vehicle flow movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1241.571s">So</a>  that was a substantial upgrade that was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1246.705s">You</a>  can see we've added and continued to maintain the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1251.751s">So</a>  we are maintaining and incorporating the pedestrian connectivity from Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1257.379s">We</a>  heard some feedback about that not being <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1262.869s">as</a>  pedestrian friendly necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1265.25s">So</a>  what we've done is we've introduced a landscaping strip in front of that sidewalk to provide some additional buffering from the parking in the drive aisles to that sidewalk, and that will be planted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1276.597s">So</a>  you get some buffer both from a landscaping perspective, it also puts the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1281.039s">sidewalk</a>  a bit further separated from vehicular traffic movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1286.041s">As</a>  has been previously discussed, our limit of work for this project remains entirely within the paved surface that exists today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1292.364s">So</a>  that sidewalk would not extend beyond the curbing that is out there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1299.507s">With</a>  respect to the front door here at the entrance, as you recall, there was a significant amount of discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1307.586s">related</a>  to the driveway, trying to improve the geometry. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1311.247s">So</a>  we're reconstructing the sidewalk along the project frontage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1315.609s">We're</a>  improving the accessibility features there and bringing that in conformance with current standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1322.491s">And</a>  then internal to the parking lot and on the perimeter of the parking lot, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1326.584s">what</a>  we're doing here is adding a number of different landscaping features. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1330.667s">I</a>  think the most substantial and beneficial of which is going to be some significant improvements to the boundary of the property between Woodruff Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1342.275s">Everybody</a>  I'm sure is familiar with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1344.516s">Vegetation</a>  that's out there doesn't appear to be thriving. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1347.558s">In</a>  fact, some of it appears to be dead, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1350.48s">And</a>  where a buffer may have existed once upon a time ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1354.124s">we're</a>  going to reestablish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1355.345s">So</a>  we're putting a number of different plantings in here to create a dense vegetated screen on the outside of the fence, which is still on the property that is retained and is part of the beach haze program. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1367.492s">But</a>  not only will it screen the fence, it's going to create a nice vegetative buffer between Woodruff Avenue and the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1378.038s">What's</a>  also shown on here, and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1380.483s">I'm</a>  going to turn this over to Sean Kelly from Vanoss in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1386.666s">The</a>  applicant is committing to the inclusion of approximately 1,300 feet of improvements to Middlesex Avenue related to the inclusion of bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1397.13s">We</a>  had heard a lot of discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1400.811s">And</a>  I think one of the words that we heard at our last discussion was holistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1407.394s">And</a>  we had taken that to heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1411.075s">not</a>  only are we making some substantial improvements here on the property, which are going to have a benefit to the community, including the enhanced pedestrian connectivity, the screening improvements, but something that has resonated with us and has been discussed at length, both with the board and the technical professionals who are involved in this project were improvements to Middlesex Avenue and the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1436.029s">you</a>  know, community's desire to try and improve this corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1440.45s">So</a>  Sean's going to speak to you in a second, and I'll keep my screen up when he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1443.891s">I</a>  have an exhibit on my screen, which is going to show the extent of those improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1447.852s">But</a>  this is approximately 1,300 feet of offsite improvements that the applicant is agreeing to implement, provided DOT, of course, is comfortable with those improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1457.867s">And</a>  it's really providing a substantial link in the proverbial chain, if you will, of the corridor improvements that we know the city has been working on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1469.035s">So</a>  we think that's a pretty significant benefit and something that we're excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1474.899s">I</a>  know Mr. Netriba has also been working very, very closely <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1480.202s">with</a>  the owner of the property, with his counterparts at BJ's with respect to some potential other improvements related to electrical vehicle parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1492.666s">I</a>  think he's come to an agreement there and I'd love for him to have an opportunity to talk about some of the things that he's been able to accomplish there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1505.049s">And</a>  if you could unmute Patrick for a moment, please.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1517.836s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1518.237s">I</a>  think I'm back on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1520.942s">Thank</a>  you, Austin. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1521.603s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1523.426s">Yes,</a>  in consideration of the things that we heard from various members of the board at our last hearing, we've <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1531.359s">made</a>  an arrangement with a charging company to offer EV charging at this site, whereby we will have several stalls for folks to come and charge their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1545.527s">We're</a>  working out the details with that entity right now, but we would like to add that here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1550.731s">And</a>  we think that will be a real good <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1553.645s">a</a>  good benefit to the community and something that'll really make Club No. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1558.989s">1</a>  here for BJ's in Medford shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1560.971s">And</a>  like we said at the beginning, that's something that we take a lot of pride in and we want to make sure that this is as close to a flagship store as we could make it, given the fact that it's 30-something years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1574.241s">But</a>  with that being said, Austin, I'll turn it back over to you for the rest of the details.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1581.507s">Thanks,</a>  Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1583.067s">So</a>  before I flip it over to Sean Kelly to talk about some of the specifics relative to the bike lane improvements and some of the additional analysis that he's done in response to some of the feedback that we received at the last hearing, I'd like to ask the board if there's any specific questions or thoughts you'd like me to address immediately with respect to some of the things I just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1612.997s">Hearing</a>  none, should we flip it over to Mr. Kelly to talk about some of the traffic items?</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1619.142s">I</a>  don't know, Andre, if it makes sense to talk now or to wait till the end for overall comments.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1623.925s">Yeah,</a>  why don't we wait till the end of the presentation, and then we'll take some board member questions and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1629.129s">We're</a>  going to have a curtailed process tonight anyways.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1632.832s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1634.153s">So</a>  I don't know if you already have, but Sean Kelly is probably eagerly awaiting the power of the unmute button.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1642.537s">I</a>  think I'm muted, if you guys can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1647.58s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1649.441s">Again,</a>  Sean Kelley with Van Assen Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1652.882s">So</a>  I think the first thing I'd like to speak to tonight is a plan that we put together in response to comments we received from the city's Traffic Engineering Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1661.849s">It's</a>  a plan to provide bicycle lanes or shared bicycle vehicular accommodations along Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1674.366s">If</a>  you can see the plan here, is my cursor active, Austin?</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1679.69s">I</a>  have control over the screen, but if you want to share the screen, you can, John.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1684.672s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1685.472s">So</a>  basically the plan, and we worked with Todd Blake from your engineering department to get some feedback as to what he was looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1693.394s">And</a>  the plan essentially, as you can see, is from the city line to the north to have a buffered bicycle lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1700.576s">exclusive</a>  lanes with the painted, you know, buffered area that would extend to 1st Street and then from 1st Street down to 5th Street, do a share road accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1712.224s">And,</a>  you know, we've agreed that as long as DOT is on board with these, you know, these provisions, we're more than happy to provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1723.219s">So</a>  I think, you know, we'll advance the design as part of our highway access permit application. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1728.325s">And</a>  if they're on board, we'll, you know, we'll certainly look to implement this measure and, you know, fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1736.254s">The</a>  other, I guess there was also some discussion, you know, at the last meeting, there were some concerns that were raised by <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1744.153s">the</a>  opponents of the project relative to the traffic engineering and how we came up with our projections for traffic flows and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1753.217s">We</a>  have since then gone out and done some counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1757.178s">Went</a>  out to an existing facility in Stoneman, Massachusetts and did some counts during the morning peak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1762.432s">during</a>  the evening peak, during the Saturday midday peak, because ultimately we wanted to get a handle as to what the actual traffic at these BJ's facilities, you know, ultimately perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1773.403s">What</a>  we found was that the morning traffic was actually lower than what we projected. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1778.688s">It</a>  was quite a bit lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1779.549s">It</a>  was about 30 customers an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1783.103s">The</a>  evening projections were almost dead on within three to five cars, customer trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1790.612s">And</a>  then Saturday was a little higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1793.234s">It</a>  was in the order of about 50 cars, 50 customers per hour higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1798.821s">We've</a>  gone through and redone the analysis, calibrated all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1802.944s">works</a>  with the higher customer traffic and ultimately didn't change the findings of the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1808.226s">But</a>  ultimately, I think that the important thing is that the data we collected in Stoneham showed that the traffic generation rejections were accurate, that the internal capture particularly in terms of how much was coming from customers that were already at BJ's was accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1824.214s">It</a>  was in the 45 to 55% range. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1828.301s">And</a>  ultimately, even though Saturday was a bit higher, we rerun those analyses and it shows that the final analysis is still valid, the impacts are minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1841.568s">So</a>  in terms of traffic, I think that's really the thrust of it tonight is that we've responded to the city's comments relative to the improvements on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1851.472s">And</a>  then we've looked at the traffic generation at similar sites and it's confirmed the findings of the initial study. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1858.188s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions anyone has. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1861.975s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1863.397s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1864.379s">Is</a>  there anybody else on the project team that is going to be speaking?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1870.402s">No,</a>  I think that's it for now, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1872.823s">Certainly,</a>  we're here to answer any questions or comments you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1876.403s">But</a>  again, just to conclude, this is Mark Vaughn for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1881.544s">I</a>  hope that you can hopefully see from the totality of what we're talking about, we did listen intently to what we think the board's desires were to see what we could do to provide some more global improvements to the area, recognizing that we <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1898.728s">You</a>  know, we can't, you know, fix everything that's out there in terms of, you know, traffic or whatever it might be on Middle Six Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1905.511s">But</a>  I think that was acknowledged early on that, you know, that wasn't something that we were going to be in a position to have to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1912.454s">But</a>  I think certainly there's a significant improvement overall that we're providing here to the total site and the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1922.217s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1924.118s">Certainly</a>  appreciate your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1926.179s">Is</a>  there anything in the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1929.178s">letters</a>  by city department heads that you believe you're not going to be able to comply with?</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1940.385s">Mr.</a>  Chair, this is Austin Turner from Bowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1943.587s">With</a>  respect, I know we received the engineering letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1946.549s">I</a>  didn't see anything in there that we haven't already discussed with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1950.672s">McGivern</a>  already. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1952.553s">And</a>  many of those things are seeming like suggested conditions rather than they are anything that we can't <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1959.36s">commit</a>  to or aren't willing to do already. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1961.442s">So</a>  with respect to that, no, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1964.384s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1965.545s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1966.186s">And</a>  I do know that city engineer Tim McIvern is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1969.989s">So</a>  I'm wondering if he could just take a moment to provide us with his opinion about these revisions.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1978.717s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1978.897s">Yeah,</a>  basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1981.48s">From</a>  the initial review letter, everything's been satisfactorily addressed when it comes to the site utilities and requests that I made for some design changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1990.148s">So</a>  I converted all of the remaining open items into conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=1996.654s">And</a>  they're just reasonable conditions that are based off of conversations that we've had with the project via the letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2005.883s">The</a>  only thing that we're waiting on now is just resolution on the traffic related items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2011.666s">And</a>  just to, Todd Blake is here, you could talk to them, but I believe we just want a little bit more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2018.61s">And</a>  the fact that they're requesting the continuation is definitely acceptable to us too, so we can make sure that we have a full understanding of the proposal.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2027.195s">Okay,</a>  would Mr. Blake like to say anything at this time or will he hold the next month?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2033.538s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2035.61s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2036.09s">Oh,</a>  there he is, there he is.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2038.971s">Yeah,</a>  I'll hold for official, but it does seem like a vast improvement to the before, and it does seem like they tried to address a lot of the concerns we had and a lot of suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2049.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2050.817s">Looks</a>  pretty good.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2052.817s">Let</a>  me open up to questions and comments from board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2056.579s">And</a>  just as a heads up, I think after the board members give their questions and comments, we'll close the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2064.137s">the</a>  hearing at that time, since we're going to be continuing it to � I won't close it, but we'll continue it to September. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2074.325s">Klaus,</a>  I know that you wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2076.587s">Why</a>  don't you go first?</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2082.171s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2083.873s">I</a>  think my biggest suggestion, concern, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2091.647s">Is</a>  the location of the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2093.248s">I</a>  think it could probably be in a better location instead of their front of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2097.969s">I</a>  mean if you're trying to Portray a good entry and Standing in Medford having the first thing you see when you come to the site being there and I know it's I know it's landscaped around it, but that never quite does the trick and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2117.935s">I</a>  think now that you have that traffic island on the left side of the post, you could probably put the dumpster there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2123.237s">It</a>  might be a bit of a challenge with how the truck will maneuver, but I think it's a much better location.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2133.401s">We'd</a>  be happy to take a look at that as part of a forthcoming update. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2136.663s">That</a>  seems like a more than reasonable request.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2141.765s">Thank</a>  you, Klaas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2142.425s">Are</a>  there other board members that would like to comment?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2148.495s">Yes,</a>  Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2149.796s">This</a>  is Jackie Patato. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2150.997s">I</a>  just wanted to just reiterate what has already been mentioned by other board members as well as the city engineer, Tim McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2160.425s">I</a>  just want to thank the proponent for one, for even considering trying to rectify the nuisance conditions and provide additional benefits to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2170.247s">the</a>  community in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2171.528s">While</a>  we recognize that not everything could be done, not every proponent would have taken it that seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2177.791s">So</a>  at this point, I'm sort of, I'm also very thrilled that this has been, is going to be continued so that we can look at the resolution on the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2187.195s">That's</a>  where my main concern has been, but just with everything else, again, I just wanted to just thank the proponent for all of these efforts.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2197.26s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2198.883s">Other</a>  board members have comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2204.968s">Okay,</a>  hearing none, we need to continue to a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2212.314s">So</a>  let's figure out what that will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2214.656s">I</a>  believe we have, so we have September 10th, 16th, 17th, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2226.788s">are</a>  all possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2232.269s">Is</a>  there a preference among board members or are you inclined to do September 10th? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2245.331s">Alicia</a>  and Annie, any thoughts?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2249.772s">Annie,</a>  do you wanna talk about scheduling and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2255.444s">other</a>  agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2257.808s">So</a>  basically, if the board would prefer to start breaking things up and having two meetings in a month so that things aren't all the same night and quite so long, then the 10th would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2271.653s">Um,</a>  the board is likely, well, I think actually we now know is going to be required to have a meeting later in the month because there's another item coming from the city council with one of those required must be advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2285.644s">We</a>  can't get it advertised for the 10th, um, must be heard before a certain date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2292.249s">Um,</a>  so it's going to need to be heard during the later weeks of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2296.873s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2299.63s">would</a>  uh so i'm just putting it out there the 16th would be fine as long as we get the advertisement in tomorrow is that correct annie i know any was having trouble the 10th would also be okay with the ad in tomorrow the 10th and the 16th are the same advertising dates so okay and if we were to do the 16th would we be able to catch the other item that you were referring to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2321.648s">Actually,</a>  it sounds like you could do it the 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2324.911s">I</a>  misunderstood Annie earlier when she was giving me the dates for the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2328.654s">It</a>  just means that she has to put the ad in the newspaper for the other item tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2333.137s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2335.639s">Of</a>  the board members, are you able to attend on the September 10th, the Thursday?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2344.806s">Do</a>  we know anything about the scheduling for the board member who's not present?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2352.426s">Do</a>  not.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2354.668s">I</a>  do not.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2358.03s">Andre,</a>  if it has to be a date, sir, and I'm not available on the 10th, but I can become available. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2362.834s">It's</a>  just, it's sensitive for me right now.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2366.956s">Would</a>  the 16th be better for you?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2369.138s">Definitely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2369.739s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2371.96s">How</a>  does the 16th sound then for everyone?</p>

    <p>[Deanna Peabody]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2376.343s">Sounds</a>  good to me.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2378.757s">Okay,</a>  let's go with September 16th then. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2381.198s">So</a>  is there a motion on the floor to continue the public hearing on the BJ's project to Wednesday, September 16th?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2394.684s">This</a>  is Jackie Patato. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2396.005s">I</a>  propose a motion to continue the Middlesex Ave BJ's gas station proposal project, proposed project to hearing to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2407.263s">Wednesday,</a>  September 16th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2410.324s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2428.85s">I</a>  know, well, Christy is recused, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2433.092s">Was</a>  that a yes?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2464.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2465.42s">Good</a>  night. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2466.601s">You</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2470.682s">Next</a>  item on the agenda is another continued public hearing for the Winthrop Estates Definitive Subdivision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2479.124s">And</a>  it is a combined public hearing for the definitive subdivision approval and special permit for site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2486.566s">Let</a>  me read the public hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2500.753s">Okay,</a>  the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a combined public hearing on Thursday, July 16, 2020 at 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2516.284s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a revised definitive subdivision plan and special permit for site plan review application submitted by Waypoint Development <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2525.85s">The</a>  project includes the creation of a roadway and 10 lot subdivision as shown on plans entitled Winthrop Estate Subdivision 541 and 551 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts, prepared by Design Consultants Inc., dated February 8th, 2019, and revised June 24th, 2019, September 5th, 2019, and March 20th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2546.758s">An</a>  earlier version of this application was denied by the Medford Community Development Board at a hearing on September 11th, 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2553.07s">but</a>  upon appeal has been remanded to the community development board in light of additional information submitted by the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2559.313s">Plans</a>  may be viewed in the office of the city clerk room 103, the office of community development room 308 or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash department slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2577.804s">Thank</a>  you again, if anybody would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2580.733s">Members</a>  of the public wish to weigh in remotely, they can email questions and comments to OCD at Medford-MA.gov or via phone to 781-393-2480. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2592.901s">That's</a>  781-393-2480. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2593.161s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2607.337s">now</a>  reopen the public hearing and would like to ask the applicant to present the additional information that's been submitted since the last meeting.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2618.643s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2619.064s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, members of the board, my name is Ed Champion with Waypoint Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2623.226s">We're</a>  the owner of the site, Winthrop Street Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2628.129s">One</a>  item to address is that we did submit to the board care of <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2634.751s">the</a>  acting director, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2636.211s">Hunt,</a>  for a name that we thought was appropriate, and it particularly came up during a neighborhood meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2644.953s">So</a>  we've requested, excuse the background noise, so we've requested a change of name, and that's been formally submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2654.756s">Mary</a>  Kenny O'Sullivan was an activist in the labor movement back in the early 1900s. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2661.017s">We</a>  had originally thought Mary Kenny O'Sullivan, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2664.046s">when</a>  you look at the apostrophe and all the letters, the final submission was requested at Mary Kenny Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2672.411s">Kind</a>  of, you know, play on words with the way, so to speak, because I think she lived the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2678.695s">So</a>  anyways, that was one of the things that we submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2682.957s">For</a>  tonight, there are a couple of things that we left our last meeting with that I thought we would address. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2689.101s">And</a>  one of which, which I think is the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2691.293s">I</a>  don't know if it was the largest item on the list, but after leaving the meeting, it probably stuck with me the most, which was when board member Kloss had mentioned that it's up to us to show what the vision of the property and not people to read a plan in plan view and understand what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2714.766s">So</a>  we'll share those drawings and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2717.978s">and</a>  renderings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2718.639s">We've</a>  done them to scale so that there's no interpretation, and I think that they give an accurate depiction of what we're trying to accomplish, and hopefully they'll calm some of the concerns in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2731.909s">So</a>  there were six different areas in total, and in trying to be brief, one was the pedestrian issues, and that comes with walking traffic and whatnot and concerns with the neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2743.75s">that</a>  we've been working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2745.27s">Both</a>  Tim given entire were on a neighborhood call yesterday with Mrs. Mayor and that was discussed, and we've agreed to not only do the sidewalk on the crosswalk to connect the corner of Lorraine Road over to, um, the Western Street side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2758.533s">We've</a>  also agreed to work with the neighborhood to try and make a safer pedestrian way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2762.634s">Temporarily</a>  while ever sources doing their work so years ago, we <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2773.256s">I</a>  think it didn't help the problem, but I think we learned from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2775.579s">So</a>  I think we can do a better job this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2778.601s">So</a>  with that, that's the pedestrian issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2781.164s">And</a>  I think Todd and Tim are much more equipped to talk about it than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2785.688s">But</a>  we're happy to help and work with the team, coordinate any way we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2791.033s">Next</a>  would be the renderings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2792.534s">And</a>  I think the best way to do is to show them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2794.476s">So</a>  if I could share a screen, I can put them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2810.992s">I</a>  think I'm almost host disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2814.576s">I</a>  can work on some other things in the meantime. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2820.162s">You</a>  should be able to share now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2822.364s">Yes,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2823.245s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2832.074s">Can</a>  everyone see the rendering?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2834.261s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2835.962s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2836.042s">So</a>  this is a cover slide, and it'll back off a little from more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2840.183s">If</a>  this is considered 1,000 feet, let's say the next one's going to be at 6,000 feet or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2844.905s">I'm</a>  using numbers just as a guide, not necessarily as specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2848.726s">So</a>  this is the site itself, where the right-of-way easement extension would be right in here, wraps along the site, and services both 553 and 555 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2864.314s">The</a>  cut in the site runs around the perimeter and there's a vegetated slope as well as a <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2874.103s">and</a>  there's vegetative slope in the bottom and vines growing over. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2877.384s">I'm</a>  gonna move to the slides, because they'll show it better than my explanation.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2880.666s">Mr.</a>  Champion, could you just, well, since you had mentioned the pedestrian improvements, could you just point them out with your cursor on this?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2887.548s">Sure,</a>  so they're not drawn in here, but there'll be a handicap ramp and a sidewalk right in here, and it will connect right across the street, and it connects into the sidewalk on the other side of Winthrop Street, and that's part of our plan and the definitive subdivision plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2903.075s">As</a>  part of the other neighborhood concerns, it was running, it was walking down this section here towards the gas station, where it's a little bit depressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2913.405s">as</a>  far as, you know, it's concave from the edge of the road and it stores water after rain to a certain extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2918.787s">So</a>  the idea was that although Eversource is gonna repave and there's a bigger plan for sidewalks in here, it was gonna be that we're willing to, and of course it would require the approval of DPW and the engineering department to either put some temporary walkway in here of some sort, whether it's a asphalt binder or something that would just allow <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2940.408s">to</a>  give a dry or a space that's outside of the watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2945.972s">Again,</a>  it's something that we've agreed to do with the neighbors if it's something that can be done, but we're not making the engineering decision on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2954.478s">We're</a>  just offering to work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2957.3s">This</a>  past couple of weeks, we actually put some screen up on the fencing as a request to the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2963.655s">We</a>  engaged some younger local workers to actually start cleaning and weeding the sidewalk, and we had them go all the way from the high school, all the way up past our site, and they'll continue through this section on towards Smith Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2981.139s">I</a>  think it's Smith Lane or Smith Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2982.519s">It's</a>  up on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2984.28s">We</a>  also talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=2986.642s">you</a>  know, again, our willingness to do it, and it's a coordination of engineering and DPW, is if some temporary asphalt, if it's helpful to lay some sort of extension here so that there's a walkway towards, apparently from Smith Lane to Lorain, there's some concerns that, you know, when people are walking with strollers or walking on the street, that they end up getting <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3007.995s">derailed</a>  into traffic a bit during, if there's a rain day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3011.94s">I</a>  mean, of course, this summer there hasn't been too many rain days, but I think that with the fall coming, we'll probably see more of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3018.427s">Is</a>  that sufficient? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3020.049s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3027.513s">This</a>  is a, we expanded the view just to give some vision of where it is, where the site is, the soccer field that's behind it and the high school itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3037.921s">And</a>  this is the area where the sidewalk, where we're starting here at the entrance to the high school and running down, and this is the Smith Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3044.666s">So</a>  we're gonna, we've committed to the neighborhood that we will take care of that section of sidewalk from now until we're completed with construction totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3054.766s">The</a>  replacement of the sidewalk will be from the lot limits in front of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3059.61s">Of</a>  course, if we damage anything, we would replace it beyond that, but we don't anticipate being anywhere beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3069.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3071.278s">Okay,</a>  so again, we're getting into the renderings now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3074.64s">It's</a>  a 10 lot subdivision, and I'm going to pass this slide because I don't think it adds to the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3081.5s">So</a>  this is the general site. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3083.461s">We</a>  did actually draw the houses and after working with the architect and they took a shot at the modern farmhouse design, we started thinking that it was, it started exciting us a little bit, to be honest with you, about what the site could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3100.473s">There</a>  is a slide in here that has no homes on it, so that the perspective that Woodward McLeod asked for will show up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3110.215s">This</a>  is the view from Lorain Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3113.317s">On</a>  the left-hand side, running up this is where the extension of the right-of-way is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3119.281s">The</a>  street trees and whatnot block quite a bit, but they're a requirement and they are as proposed on the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3125.946s">And</a>  you can see the view from the Lorain Road side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3132.41s">This</a>  is the view from Lorain Road if there are no houses and no street trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3137.634s">I</a>  refrained from putting the street trees on, even though they're part of the road design, because I didn't want to cover it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3143.016s">And</a>  so it shows a change in elevation with the stone wall, which we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3150.259s">And</a>  I have some more detail to add on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3152.08s">The</a>  change in elevations that would be yards or grass or plantings or whatever people choose to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3157.903s">The</a>  vegetated slope, which is a one to one or one to two, depending on the area that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3163.825s">And</a>  then from at the top of the vegetated slope, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3166.817s">there's</a>  the Shark Creek wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3169.878s">And</a>  growing down from the Shark Creek wall is some sort of vegetation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3176.979s">And</a>  it's the expectation here is that we're showing like a three to five year growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3184.301s">We</a>  think that we won't, you know, the houses will be sold and done in the three year time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3190.243s">And</a>  we think it'll be grown in fully at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3193.403s">If</a>  you work your way around, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3196.648s">this</a>  section of ledge, and I'll show it later with the houses, we zoomed in on it and we gave a height, it's approximately 40 feet tall from the very bottom, and that's including the vegetative slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3209.331s">And</a>  then you work your way around and you can see where the right-of-way extension comes in and drops into what we'll call Mary Kenny Way for the time being, and then allows that traffic to come in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3222.774s">I</a>  think it's gonna be a benefit when we've talked to one of the neighbors <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3227.268s">and</a>  I'll call her Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3227.968s">Shreya,</a>  because I can't, her last name is extensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3232.331s">And,</a>  you know, she had mentioned that driving on and off Winthrop Street from their current right of way, that getting out onto that road is tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3241.436s">So</a>  we think this will be a big benefit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3244.257s">And</a>  we've supplied the documentation to the neighbors for the easement, allowing their council and whatnot to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3251.961s">But</a>  they have everything they need for the right of way itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3259.592s">This</a>  is if you're traveling east, which is a similar direction that we showed in the sketches. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3264.257s">However,</a>  we think this is a better way to depict it as far as showing what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3269.042s">This</a>  section of vegetation in here is something that we are gonna make part of the HOA, which is adjacent to the sidewalk, so it'll be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3281.55s">This</a>  is the view facing west. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3283.693s">This</a>  stone wall has been a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3286.296s">I've</a>  got some landscape plans that add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3288.879s">And</a>  what we did on the landscape plan is we called out two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3292.223s">One</a>  is what we kind of want it to be, which is a medium-sized stacked wall of some sort. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3298.21s">We've</a>  also wanted to reserve the right to make a natural stone, depending on how much flat quality stone comes out of the blasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3307.456s">But</a>  what we also did was we denoted what it could not be or what it would not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3313.151s">And</a>  without using a brand name, right, it's a big block wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3316.574s">Like,</a>  you know, the big commercial style, even though they have a rock face to them, they look very industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3321.477s">So</a>  we qualified that it's got to be below like an 18 by 36 size. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3326.1s">So</a>  you could get two foot by one foot blocks or whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3329.183s">So</a>  that it would fit within the scale of a residential environment, especially we're so close to the sidewalk, we think the size matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3338.009s">And</a>  that is on a plan that was submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3339.75s">And</a>  the notes that I'm describing are on the plan as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3342.816s">I</a>  believe they were clouded and called out so that it would be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3349.881s">This</a>  is driving into the cul-de-sac itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3352.884s">There's</a>  the island and the houses surrounding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3357.207s">The</a>  house straight on is the one that's adjacent to the ledge that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3362.775s">So</a>  this, and I'll show that slide in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3366.457s">This</a>  slide shows a couple of cross sections that we're showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3369.938s">And</a>  these cross sections were primarily done to show what the wall would look like if you were perpendicular to it and if you were in a cross section. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3380.222s">Although</a>  it's a bit of a view that you would normally take if you were a professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3385.104s">I</a>  think it was based on the conversation with the board last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3390.527s">I</a>  think that this makes, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3393.256s">This</a>  answers a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3395.358s">So</a>  when we go to page 10, we're gonna see this cross section. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3400.622s">And</a>  we go to page 11, we're gonna see this cross section. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3404.405s">And</a>  this is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3405.666s">Shria's</a>  house right here, 555 Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3409.529s">And</a>  this is 553 Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3415.214s">So</a>  this is the cross section in the backyard of lot five. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3419.197s">The</a>  expectation is a patio, small grass area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3423.599s">low</a>  retaining wall under four feet, vegetated slope, the wall itself, and the hanging lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3430.063s">And</a>  this is the cross section of where it ends up going. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3437.668s">This</a>  is the cross section, which is 90 degrees from there, where 553 Winthrop and 555 Winthrop are directly to the left. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3446.913s">Actually,</a>  553 Winthrop is right where my carousel is up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3451.436s">The</a>  expectation is that <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3453.435s">there'll</a>  be, at this point, is that you're looking, you're seeing some rooftops, but you're actually not looking into the buildings themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3461.279s">And</a>  there's a little bit of distance between this fence, and then there's a right of way, and then there's the front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3472.325s">What</a>  I did here was Medford, based on the zoning, has allowed the height of the building, and the building commissioner, of course, would have to approve the plans and whatnot, but it's a 35 foot mean height of the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3484.103s">I</a>  believe, and so that roof probably stands, the peak of the roof probably is at 38, 39, or 40 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3490.764s">And</a>  if you go from that same top of retaining wall up to the top of the ledge wall of Shaw Creek, it's 40 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3499.406s">So</a>  scale-wise, again, the building is gonna be equal to that height. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3503.947s">Of</a>  course, you'd be 250 feet away from it when you're looking at it, unless you actually lived in the house, then you'd be much closer.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3511.809s">Just</a>  a question, Mr. Champy. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3514.87s">I</a>  don't see in this, and this just could be because it's not there, is the fencing at the top of that ledge?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3521.152s">It</a>  is up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3523.333s">You</a>  can see it in here.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3524.693s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3529.995s">So</a>  it could just be at the angle we're at.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3531.715s">We're</a>  looking right over it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3533.076s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3536.057s">But</a>  it will be at, it'll be close to the edge, I'm assuming, of the ledge?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3542.552s">Can</a>  you see the site plan here?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3545.473s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3546.134s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3546.814s">So</a>  the, the, the fencing itself is set back from the, from the very top because there's like a, there's a small slope prior to getting in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3555.478s">So</a>  you, there's a small slope they were here prior to.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3561.16s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3562.801s">And</a>  there's also a guide rail that's coming down around the, on the right away itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3570.608s">And</a>  then this is a close-up of behind lot five of what the wall will look like when you're sitting in the back patio. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3583.696s">The</a>  vegetative slope, the wall, I mean, we've been clear in the HOA documents as well as the discussions with <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3591.464s">Mr.</a>  McGibbon on what the requirements are for what's being maintained by the HOA versus the homeowners, and this vegetative slope is within the HOA responsibility and is enforceable. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3606.61s">So</a>  that's the renderings themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3616.133s">The</a>  wall itself and the landscape plan, and because I think this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3621.75s">that</a>  we're going to show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3622.55s">It's</a>  not going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3623.13s">Duplicate</a>  and but at the same time, I want to show it just to make sure that we're understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3626.852s">So</a>  there's this fence that's on the top here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3629.032s">We</a>  anticipate that being by owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3630.853s">It'll</a>  be part of the package that we're selling, especially if we're building the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3634.654s">This</a>  segmented wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3635.695s">This</a>  is where it talks about limitate limiting this the size of the stone so they don't end up being too large. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3641.757s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3644.458s">This</a>  This is part of landscape <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3651.835s">than</a>  it is appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3655.177s">And</a>  this was one of the segmented wall, typical installation of what we see as far as the size of the stones being, you know, these in this case are probably six or 12 inches high and maybe 30 inches long. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3666.263s">So</a>  we want to make sure that it's adequate and reflecting that it's a residential subdivision.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3679.91s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3681.775s">Okay,</a>  I think that covers the, we did submit our blasting plan, and I think during the neighborhood meetings and even in my private conversations with neighbors, blasting has been a, is a big topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3696.441s">So</a>  we've talked about expanding the pre-blast survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3700.423s">We've</a>  got numerous extra names on the list, and we're gonna adhere to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3705.485s">There's</a>  a few other things relative to the blasting, which is, you know, seismic meters and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3710.67s">So</a>  they are already placed around the site when you're doing the blasting, but we've agreed in a couple of cases to actually put some extra meters out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3719.496s">Last,</a>  we're planning to be at half the legal limit, which allows to make sure that we never approach the legal limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3728.301s">And</a>  that's what we've done prior to, so I'm not suggesting it's gonna be any less, it's just we are explaining that it is a controlled environment and we have a fair amount of control over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3739.489s">neighbors</a>  that are immediate 525 went through approaches just to the right was the closest probably to any of the blasting and we haven't we haven't heard from that neighbor but we've done mailings and whatnot but I think it's a rental so it's not the same amount of participation that we'd expect from homeowners and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3760.341s">We</a>  had a neighbors meeting last night where a group of neighbors came on, as I mentioned earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3764.722s">And</a>  then lastly is the right of way, which we've submitted to the neighbors for 553 and 555. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3769.944s">There's</a>  been interaction between attorneys on 553 Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3774.166s">And</a>  Shreya and I have talked many times and we talked again today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3778.187s">So</a>  we believe we're in good shape.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3784.149s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3785.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3785.788s">Well,</a>  these visuals, I think, are very helpful, and I appreciate your efforts in getting those done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3796.47s">So</a>  we have a few things to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3798.831s">I'd</a>  like to open it up first to the city engineer, Tim McGivern, to provide his overall opinion and comments on <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3814.492s">on</a>  the project and what's been presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3821.276s">So</a>  at this point, after... And touch on any outstanding issues that you think are maybe there? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3828.219s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3828.56s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3830.04s">So</a>  basically, after three rounds of going back and forth with information and discussion, the most recent <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3838.92s">memorandum</a>  that I put together for the board, boils everything down to a set of conditions, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3846.802s">The</a>  items that the board may wish to discuss further that were on here, but weren't necessarily discussed to a close-out level, I didn't feel, were any additional pedestrian accommodations up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3863.245s">It</a>  was discussed, but there was really no conclusion on it, so I just left it in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3869.95s">Then</a>  I put a recommended condition in here regarding what the homeowners association is going to have control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3878.113s">And</a>  I just would like to note that I believe one was just brought up that I did not have on my list and that was the vegetated area between the driveway, the private driveway going through the site and with the tree itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3890.917s">So</a>  that should be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3895.881s">A</a>  lot of conditions regarding construction and inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3900.185s">So</a>  just so everybody knows, one of the things I'm requiring of the project through condition is a detailed inspection schedule based off of this board's regulations for subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3910.793s">So</a>  the city needs to provide a reasonable level of inspection for the utility installations and the roadway installations. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3920.581s">So</a>  that's something that will have, all that will happen through this board as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3928.744s">Anything</a>  else outstanding? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3930.186s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3931.487s">There</a>  was one, every single plan revision except for one was made, and it may have just been an oversight, but the sewer services for 553 and 555 Winthrop Street, I requested that they be placed on the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3946.421s">They</a>  were not placed in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3947.882s">The</a>  final set of plans should have those services on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3952.843s">I</a>  don't think that they need to be relocated or removed, they just need to be protected during construction, unless they're in a spot that isn't shown on the record plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3961.65s">So</a>  just that, they need to be protected, so we need to know where they are, so they should be on the plans that everybody looks at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3968.475s">One</a>  second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3979.442s">That's</a>  about it regarding conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3983.345s">And</a>  you know, a lot of it is just basic stuff like they need the contractor installing the utilities needs to be a licensed drain layer in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3993.673s">They</a>  should submit a road control plan to the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=3999.678s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4002.795s">The</a>  only other thing I think is worth saying is that the set of plans that I reviewed this final round only included revised sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4009.04s">And</a>  I believe they're also working on the landscaping sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4011.562s">The</a>  final set of plans should be all of the sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4016.926s">And</a>  then also another thing that's worth noting, I think too, is the cut and fill analysis is gonna be a large part of probably the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4022.89s">So</a>  anytime there's a request for a bond reduction, they should do a refresh of the cut and fill analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4030.676s">So</a>  basically, so I don't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4032.905s">And</a>  we're using the same numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4033.886s">And</a>  I can just double check the numbers, sort of a quality control type check. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4043.652s">Besides</a>  that, like I said, everything else was turned into a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4047.955s">I</a>  think I got 22 conditions in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4056.348s">So,</a>  and I know there was some communication received today about one of those conditions regarding the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4063.415s">And</a>  I do also understand that there's a couple of questions on the table for me regarding things like building permits and timing of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4071.882s">I'm</a>  more than happy to talk about those now or later, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4075.045s">But</a>  probably the condition having to do with the easement and the private driveway is worth a discussion.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4087.066s">So</a>  on, and Mr. Champy, do you anticipate any issues with compliance with any of the matters that Mr. McGiven has raised in his letter?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4100.17s">I</a>  don't, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4101.73s">And</a>  I appreciate the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4104.251s">A</a>  lot of it, to be honest, we would expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4107.212s">So</a>  I think it's normal course of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4109.653s">The</a>  pedestrian route to the high school, which Mr. McGiven had mentioned, wasn't quite closed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4115.31s">You</a>  know, we did look at it, and if you'd like, you know, essentially that would put a path either between 525 Winthrop and us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4127.34s">And</a>  if you'd like, I can share a screen showing where that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4130.563s">Or</a>  it would give the right-of-way access on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4139.05s">And</a>  I'll show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4142.262s">So</a>  we're concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4144.283s">We've</a>  been doing development for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4146.504s">We're</a>  putting a path in an area like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4150.725s">It</a>  would be putting a path running up this side of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4153.526s">Let</a>  me see if I can zoom in one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4156.347s">In</a>  order to get to the high school, you would be traversing across the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4160.528s">You</a>  get into areas where they're not well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4163.71s">There's</a>  only so much space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4165.07s">We</a>  would be literally probably trying to get a neighbor to coordinate with us to create an easement in their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4171.684s">So</a>  we just think it's difficult to execute, and normally we're asked not to create five foot long, nowhere to go paths and walkways. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4190.32s">And</a>  I think running it up the right of way to actually, this is private property in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4199.083s">And</a>  there's just, when we looked at it, there were a couple issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4201.785s">I</a>  think if it was a 25-yard path that cut off a quarter mile, the kids would find it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4207.348s">But</a>  my point is, I think this is a fairly lengthy, aggressive path to put in, and it would probably end up having to traverse through the fells in order to be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4217.093s">So</a>  we're open to discussion on it, but at the same time, we think it's kind of a cool idea, but executing-wise, I think it's super tricky.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4230.175s">Yeah,</a>  personally, my preference is not to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4234.357s">But</a>  I don't know, do any of the other board members have an opinion about that?</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4243.243s">Are</a>  there any other paths that cut through from the high school into basically not down the driveway?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4251.087s">There's</a>  a fence that's through here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4253.789s">There's</a>  a fence that we don't own that's already up in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4260.536s">So</a>  we didn't notice any cut-throughs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4263.297s">There's</a>  a small house up in the back here, and the road to get to it runs right next, is kind of where the gate to the Fellsway, so to speak, is, and it wraps up around here and tucks in, and then there are a couple of homes fronting Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4279.62s">At</a>  one time, we had all this land under agreement, so we have title searches on all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4284.861s">When</a>  we were up there watching the sites and whatnot, we didn't see it.</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4295.282s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think it'd be a nice to have, but I don't think it's completely necessary.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4306.751s">Any</a>  other board member have an opinion?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4312.715s">This</a>  is Christy that I just I agree with place I it would be nice to have but <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4320.817s">I</a>  don't think it's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4322.097s">I</a>  think it does appear from what Mr. Champy explained that it would be pretty challenging and probably impact abutters maybe more significantly than intended to get that done.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4337.161s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4348.269s">Let's</a>  try to move through some of these other items that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4355.251s">Maybe</a>  one we can dispense with up front is the suggestion around the name of the street, which we have to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4366.314s">That's</a>  a discretion of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4369.374s">So</a>  we have a <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4373.024s">recommendation</a>  that the street be named Mary Kenny Way instead of Winthrop Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4377.968s">And</a>  part of the issue was to not have a street name that sounded like other street names already existing in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4385.674s">And</a>  this Mary Kenny Way does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4388.096s">And</a>  it also gives some recognition to a local resident who has had an interesting history. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4397.623s">And</a>  I don't know if anybody who knows more about that history wants to say anything about Mary Kenny.</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4404.899s">see</a>  if I can just stop there you go so I can see everybody great I guess the only thing I would say about that is I think it's I'm pleased that the name came about from a dialogue with the neighbors so I think I think you know <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4430.656s">In</a>  my mind, that's the right way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4432.757s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4435.698s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4435.939s">We're</a>  going to unmute Chris Donovan, whose name is listed as user, to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4444.483s">It</a>  was actually his recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4447.144s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4447.604s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4454.627s">He's</a>  talking, but he's on mute.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4456.869s">Yeah,</a>  now you're unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4458.63s">Go</a>  ahead, Mr. Dunneman.</p>

    <p>[SxgiOOMwDHY_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4460.811s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4461.131s">I</a>  think we have Doug Carr on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4462.512s">I</a>  think they did a little bit of sort of history deep dive on that, which I don't know if now's the time necessarily for that, but we're really kind of excited to maybe tie in a little of that history, gives it some personality. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4472.676s">I</a>  was listening to a little bit earlier and I thank Ed for kind of championing some of the things that are gonna be happening in that neighborhood, even as far as that road that you were talking about as a cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4483.163s">I</a>  think if we did something really beautiful on Winthrop Street, that whole walkway up to Medford High would be more grand and more fun to walk up right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4491.209s">It's</a>  really kind of a tough walk in that whole neighborhood, including the sidewalks that were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4496.292s">So</a>  I think that road, that sort of cut through road sounds nice, even as a local to cut through the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4502.136s">none</a>  of the main doors for the high school are on that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4504.538s">So</a>  unless the visioning committee for the high school kind of saw some value in that, I'm not sure if that little side road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4510.781s">So</a>  these are the things that come out of sort of a neighborhood understanding of that, say example path, not that kids wouldn't use it and it wouldn't be fun, it may not be good, but the high school would have to sign on for that as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4522.929s">But</a>  I think through some of the initiatives that Ed was, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4527.296s">promoting</a>  that we can kind of do through these beautification project is to get the winter street beautiful and get that that that that that's frontage to be something where the kids are proud to walk up that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4537.968s">It's</a>  see and be seen kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4540.39s">So</a>  there's a lot of talk that we had last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4542.933s">I</a>  won't bring it into this discussion because it doesn't necessarily have to do with 551, but I think there's really good things going on between Eversource, the city, DPW, and we made a lot of forward strides. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4553.963s">So</a>  that's why I'm championing a little bit of what Ed and Waypoint are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4558.546s">I'm</a>  glad you're holding them to feet to the fire for safety and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4562.95s">uh</a>  blasting and zoning etc but as far as the neighborhood i've seen we've seen some changes and we're really you know happy to to um at least me and some of the people that were uh in some of these meetings to thank ed and the mayor and and tim and todd for meeting with us last night to moving some of this forward so the ultimate goal is when this is finished have a beautiful neighborhood um you'll be dealing with the parameters and the sizes and the shapes and the zoning that's what this is about tonight but <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4588.164s">As</a>  far as the neighborhood, I think we're pretty happy that we want to get this thing cleaned up and all these advances are happening soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4594.569s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4598.552s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4602.775s">Doug</a>  Cards, do you want to say anything about Mary Kenny?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4609.241s">Could</a>  we also get Chris's name and address for the record?</p>

    <p>[SxgiOOMwDHY_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4614.144s">It's</a>  Chris Donovan for Lorain Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4617.187s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4621.388s">All</a>  right, Doug, you're unmuted, so name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4626.289s">I'm</a>  Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, Westminster. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4629.229s">I</a>  don't have anything to add about the historical figure you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4633.17s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4633.25s">I'm</a>  afraid that's something I don't know much about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4635.511s">I'm</a>  eager to learn more.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4638.111s">Sorry</a>  to put you on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4639.251s">I</a>  figured you might have something to say about it.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4641.852s">I</a>  wish Ryan Hayward was here from the commission, because I'm sure I could tell her her entire life story.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4647.393s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4648.233s">Well,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4650.398s">I'll</a>  just add Alicia Hunt, the acting director of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4654.842s">Administratively,</a>  I did check sort of name lists of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4659.125s">We</a>  have official lists of all the names of roads in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4661.928s">There's</a>  nothing else that starts with Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4664.59s">I</a>  had the opportunity to run it by our fire chief who has been with the city for an extremely long time, just asking if operationally he would like could foresee any confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4678.077s">around</a>  such a name and he thought it was perfectly fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4681.18s">Just</a>  that we kind of checked those boxes for the board.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4686.405s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4687.626s">So</a>  it seems like a, I think a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4691.63s">Do</a>  any board members have any concerns or questions about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4695.353s">Okay,</a>  seeing none, let's move on to the next item. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4700.418s">Let's</a>  talk about the blasting plan for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4707.227s">So</a>  we did see your blasting plan, Mr. Champion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4711.49s">I'm</a>  wondering whether you would be able to either provide the city with a schedule of dates on which the blasting would or could occur, or alternatively provide a three day notice to the city when they're going to occur, just so that if any, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4735.062s">anybody,</a>  residents in the city or neighbors, you know, call that the city's aware that this is going on?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4743.188s">Yes,</a>  of course, and we'll email and flyer, and we'll be working very closely with Shria, who's adjacent to the property.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4751.214s">Okay,</a>  so do you prefer, which of those two approaches do you prefer, just giving a three-day notice before it's going to happen, or do you think there'll be a calendar, an overall calendar you'll be able to provide?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4765.172s">I'm</a>  thinking, just thinking through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4766.972s">I</a>  think that we can, I think we'll provide both. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4769.993s">So</a>  I think what we'll do is we're gonna provide a blasting schedule, and then weather's gonna augment that on us, and we'll update the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4777.515s">So</a>  we will, you'll always have at least three days notice, but the schedule will be moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4782.636s">Right,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4783.796s">I</a>  just wanna be clear that that would notice would be provided to the city, such that if the city wanted to use the reverse 911, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4792.198s">system,</a>  they could do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4795.24s">If</a>  the school was in session, we would want to be able to notify the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4799.963s">And</a>  frankly, people are working up there even if you know school is remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4804.506s">That's</a>  our administrative headquarters for the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4809.168s">So</a>  that we should arrange that there's somebody official at the city that is notified with the intention of that <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4817.443s">notifying</a>  the school and doing a robocall to the broader area.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4823.067s">And</a>  Alicia, would that be coordinated through your office or do you recommend somebody else?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4829.492s">Instinctively,</a>  I think that we can, that we could perhaps have Annie be the point person. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4836.317s">We'll</a>  just want to make internal arrangements for how that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4842.381s">But</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4845.052s">So</a>  let's say notice to the director of community development.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4848.575s">Or</a>  her designee.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4849.496s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4855.902s">And</a>  just to be clear, that's not necessarily coordination. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4858.824s">I</a>  understand you're coordinating that with Shreya and with others in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4865.75s">It's</a>  just notice so that everybody, we can ensure that people are properly noticed.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4871.095s">Fair</a>  enough.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4876.463s">Any</a>  board members want to weigh in on the blasting plan or does that sound like a plan?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4883.668s">The</a>  next item- With the blasting, there was, sorry, I always like to let the board members ask or speak first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4892.453s">The</a>  plan was a very extraordinarily detailed or long, but not detailed in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4901.478s">when</a>  it would happen like it talks about between certain hours on weekdays but not how many times a week minimum or maximum not times of year anything like that do we have that information yet so so yeah there's the</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4921.674s">There's</a>  two scenarios, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4923.535s">There's</a>  one is what's the blasting plan for main drilling and blasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4926.558s">And</a>  then, yes, we do have more detail on the blasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4929.82s">So</a>  when I send you the schedule for the dates for blasting, it'll have that we have and <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4937.963s">I</a>  believe we have, let's see, the 25% of the days, there'll be two blasts, and 75% of the days, there's gonna be one blast. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4946.61s">So</a>  when I send you the schedule, it'll depict that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4948.572s">The</a>  blasting plan that you sent is more of a regulatory-type document, which is probably why it's so long and says so little. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4956.839s">But</a>  we can get more finite with the information we provide, with the dates of blasting, and then the notice on a three-day window.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4967.592s">And</a>  was there ever a request from the city that the high school be on the pre-survey list? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4974.659s">I</a>  note that it is extraordinarily close, but outside the 300-foot radius.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4981.767s">We</a>  didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4983.008s">We</a>  did not have a request.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4987.818s">I</a>  apologize, that was sort of something that I realized yesterday when I was reviewing the blasting plan, just how close this actually is to our high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=4999.184s">Would</a>  you object to adding the high school to the preschool?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5003.286s">No,</a>  I don't object. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5005.587s">When</a>  I see the aerial of the size of the building, my heart skips a beat a little bit, but I don't object.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5011.13s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5011.97s">Because</a>  I don't know what the exact, what they'll do to survey a building like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5017.182s">But</a>  I don't have any objections, we don't want to cause any damage to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5021.787s">So</a>  I'll talk to Main Drilling and Blasting and find out what that inspection entails and then work with someone on getting in and through the building because I have a feeling, my gut would be that the survey of that building alone will take more than, will take a couple of days I would imagine.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5039.219s">If</a>  it's any help, we do not have any current plans to put students in that building at least the end of September, I believe the end of October at this point.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5051.324s">Okay,</a>  I'll put it on the list, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5056.666s">Great,</a>  thank you, both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5058.627s">Moving</a>  on to the next item that we should discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5070.016s">So</a>  the city engineer, Tim McGivern mentioned that the right of way issue is still outstanding in terms of, you know, sign off from those, the grantees of those easements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5086.563s">And</a>  so I'd like to, Mr. Champion, you mentioned that you've been meeting with the abutters and can you just tell us a detail where that stands?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5100.299s">So</a>  with 555 Winthrop, which is the easier of the two discussions, Shreya had mentioned, she sent me an email back saying, we'll review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5110.862s">And</a>  I think it actually said, we'll review it and sign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5114.964s">But</a>  if she has questions, we'd answer them, of course, and make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5118.165s">But</a>  she's comfortable with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5119.605s">I</a>  talked to her earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5122.766s">And</a>  so I don't anticipate any challenges whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5127.127s">So</a>  that's the easier of the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5130.578s">553</a>  Winthrop has a little bit of history with the site because the gas line feeding that house and the water line was traversing the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5139.042s">And</a>  it's registered land, so there's no adverse possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5143.305s">So</a>  when we requested that they move the water line, we ended up in Superior Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5148.327s">The</a>  prior city solicitor was also brought into the legal dispute, and we ended up in Land Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5156.631s">Land</a>  Court wrote a <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5160.705s">It</a>  wasn't an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5161.725s">I</a>  submitted it to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5163.966s">The</a>  land court had written back pretty much from what we viewed in it, that it was supporting the effort that you can't have adverse possession in registered land. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5175.989s">So</a>  we sat with the prior city solicitor in his office with three lawyers, a developer, and a neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5185.096s">And</a>  we agreed to relocate the waterline for the homeowner with the expectation that they would support the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5195.72s">And</a>  then it was discussed that it wasn't anything that was in writing and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5200.682s">So</a>  about two months ago, we ran a new waterline for them and we connected their house with anticipation of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5210.388s">And</a>  then when we went to ask them to review the easement and the right-of-way extension, their response was slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5220.497s">And</a>  then at the end of it, what they suggested was, well, get it approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5225.682s">And</a>  I'm paraphrasing, but I believe these words are specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5229.365s">Approved</a>  by the planning boards, and then they didn't want to sign the right-of-way prior to the planning board approving the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5238.248s">So</a>  we tried to encourage that it could be subject to the planning board approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5243.291s">And</a>  they thought that it was just as easy to make the planning board approval subject to their approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5247.114s">So</a>  we ended up on a dance.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5250.756s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5252.737s">And</a>  I think we have the email that came in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5259.582s">Lorena,</a>  would you be able to read that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5261.243s">Do</a>  you have that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5268.845s">from</a>  Maria C. Mangini and Stephan F. Amato. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5274.548s">Is</a>  that the one that you're referring to?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5275.849s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5280.371s">We</a>  live in 553 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5284.773s">We</a>  kindly request that as abutters and part owner to the right of way in the proposed plan, our statement regarding the proposed Winthrop Estates be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5294.479s">Recently,</a>  we were approached by Waypoint Inc. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5297.292s">along</a>  with their attorneys and asked to sign an agreement that enables modifications to the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5303.574s">While</a>  these proposed modifications appear to provide a positive safety-based benefit to us, we are not comfortable agreeing to any changes in writing at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5314.956s">We</a>  are also optimistic the state of the undeveloped land will change soon, as it has been an eyesore to the local community for well over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5326.594s">However,</a>  we remain concerned and are frustrated with the communication from Waypoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5332.036s">Our</a>  consternation having originated in 2016 when their work team inadvertently cut our water lines and subsequently declared that they would not repair the damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5344.601s">This</a>  left our family of five with the youngest, one years old at the time, without either drinking or cleaning water. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5351.792s">The</a>  Massachusetts Department of Public Works stepped in to restore our water supply, and we remain entirely grateful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5359.096s">But</a>  there is still concern four years later, simply because we do not trust the Waypoint organization, nor do we trust their attorneys. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5367.04s">During</a>  the last discussion in mid-2019, Waypoint stated that they would move the water pipes at no cost to us <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5376.374s">as</a>  long as the development got the green light to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5379.896s">That</a>  was the last communication on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5382.558s">Toward</a>  the end of May 2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tufts Construction showed up at our home with the same person from DPW who had assisted us in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5395.625s">The</a>  project lead at Tufts asked if we were aware of the proposed work starting that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5403.17s">There</a>  was no notice from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5405.558s">Over</a>  the course of two weeks, from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5407.998s">to</a>  4 p.m., we had Tufts construction on our front lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5412.119s">They</a>  were entirely respectful, but blasting through Granite and Boulder to cause a noise to the level that both my partner and I could not meaningly participate in any work meetings for two weeks again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5423.981s">During</a>  the pandemic, where we were working from home, it's not nice to have <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5435.424s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5437.886s">During</a>  the pandemic, where working from home is not a nice to have, but a requirement, we are relieved that the waterline is no longer the issue at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5447.534s">However,</a>  after the work was done, we were left with a front lawn that is unleveled to a point of representing a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5455.961s">We</a>  had our landscape company provide an assessment and share that the front yard will require significant leveling since tufts simply tossed their back on top <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5465.825s">and</a>  it has settled rather unevenly over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5469.947s">We</a>  didn't hear from Waypoint throughout the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5473.89s">Again,</a>  we look forward to seeing the development move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5476.691s">However,</a>  in terms of coming to any agreement to modify the right of way, we will need Waypoint to propose a solution that includes compensatory damages for our front yard and beyond that, a solution to properly shield our property from the housing development work to come.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5505.226s">Thank</a>  you, Lorena, for reading that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5511.79s">And</a>  I believe we've also received comments from the other grantee along the right-of-way at 555 Winthrop Street, so Lorena can read that as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5522.297s">So</a>  it's from Shreya Bhattacharya. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5530.147s">I</a>  am a resident of 555 Winthrop Street and have been in dialogue with Mr. Ed Champey, the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5536.751s">I</a>  wanted to list some of the items that need to be done in this area before, during, and after the construction process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5544.115s">Install</a>  temporary sidewalks from Smith Lane to Lorain Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5548.817s">Chris</a>  Donovan can elaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5551.178s">Install</a>  Jersey barriers from the gas station to Lorain Road prior to and during the blasting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5558.449s">A</a>  smooth sidewalk beyond the Jersey barrier would be helpful to pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5564.132s">Street</a>  sweeping and sidewalk cleaning has already begun in front of the construction site, thanks to the collaborative efforts of Mr. Champy, the Medford Vocational Technical High School, and Chris Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5576.94s">It</a>  would be great if this were to extend all the way to the front of the high school for the sake of neighborhood sidewalk beautification. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5584.904s">Blasting</a>  of the site <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5587.265s">Some</a>  neighbors, including myself, were concerned about the blasting of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5592.349s">Mr.</a>  Champy has offered to put in additional seismic monitors on adjacent properties like mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5599.454s">He</a>  also has agreed to share the safety plan approved by the company's geotech engineers and the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5607.72s">Pre-blasting</a>  survey, the developers will work with <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5612.075s">individuals</a>  who want to get their houses surveyed prior to blasting, as well as families who were not happy with the nature of the survey conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5621.238s">And</a>  post-construction, Mr. Champy has agreed to pave the private way that extends from 553 to Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5632.082s">There</a>  is a dirt road that extends beyond this road and connects to Franklin Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5637.165s">Mr.</a>  Champy has offered to fill in this road with gravel as long as the property owners agree to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5645.929s">Thank</a>  you for your time and the opportunity to voice our concerns and requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5651.571s">And</a>  then I have one last comment from Rob Casano and family. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5658.174s">They</a>  didn't see that, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5666.068s">They</a>  didn't include the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5672.29s">I</a>  would like to weigh in with my thoughts and feedback since I did not attend this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5677.912s">Just</a>  as a friendly reminder, many of us signed a petition back in 2019 regarding the 541 to 551 Winthrop Street development project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5688.556s">It</a>  clearly shows we all oppose the construction of the site and blasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5693.44s">We</a>  also did not appreciate the lack of transparency from the developers and ever getting a straight answer from the city or the developer on what the actual development plans were. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5704.468s">Unfortunately,</a>  the city engineering department approved the blasting, and now Tim has approved the new road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5710.713s">The</a>  developer believes that because the road is approved and that they have gone with the first phase of the blasting, that the neighborhood has no choice but to approve this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5723.078s">My</a>  suggestion is the developer should be able to build a maximum of four homes and donate the rest to the city as a park or some type of community slash open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5735.56s">How</a>  about the fact that with all the blasting and trees that need to come down to make this happen, how much the local wildlife, hawks, deers, bunnies, woodchucks, et cetera, is going to be displaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5748.363s">One</a>  of the nice things of living in this <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5750.896s">part</a>  of Medford is the animal population. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5754.077s">The</a>  city already has a major rat problem going on due to all the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5759.338s">This</a>  project will most likely add to that problem that is ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5764.539s">Additional</a>  issues are parking, traffic, blasting, snow removal, amount of cars to get up the road and pest control. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5773.32s">With</a>  the morning traffic caused by the high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5777.821s">open</a>  parentheses. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5778.721s">I</a>  know we are in different times right now with COVID, but eventually let's hope things will be back to normal with students attending school, close parentheses. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5787.046s">It</a>  is already a daunting task to get out of our driveways and drive on Winthrop Street safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5793.309s">What</a>  will happen when this development adds more than 20 cars up that hill and they need to get out of their development complex every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5802.714s">It</a>  will back up traffic and create even more congestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5806.188s">We</a>  have enough from those commuters avoiding Route 93 and cutting through Winthrop from the surrounding towns and cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5814.934s">Additionally,</a>  I would hope we do not want another traffic light on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5822.359s">When</a>  all is said and done, this development will tax our infrastructure that is already depleting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5828.223s">The</a>  developer will be far gone with money in their pocket, while the residents will be left without <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5834.616s">with</a>  the fallout of more traffic, trash, noise, pollution, and flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5838.797s">If</a>  every developer is going to come to Medford and continue to deforest the area and overbuild, we will lose the character of the city and change the entire landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5849.899s">We</a>  must be patient and stick together and not approve this project as it will stand out like a sore thumb. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5856.861s">The</a>  last time the blasting occurred, I lost my entire heating system and the developer was nowhere to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5863.799s">to</a>  be found or assist with my inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5866.421s">I</a>  had to call National Grid multiple times to help me, but everyone pointed the finger. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5871.825s">With</a>  the size of a project, we should demand accountability and make the developer pay an amount that can be held in escrow for future issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5883.273s">I</a>  had asked multiple questions during the meeting last month, and they never were addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5888.835s">How</a>  are me and my family supposed to be on board with this when valid questions are not being addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5894.36s">The</a>  fact that this entire project from the get-go has left us out of the conversation and is still not addressing many outstanding questions or concerns for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5907.931s">I</a>  would appreciate a reply on my many concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5911.674s">I</a>  know Chris has been working to bring us all together on this, but I also don't support things <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5917.388s">proceeding</a>  until all voices are truly heard and addressed.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5923.011s">Thank</a>  you, Lorena. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5924.411s">Mr.</a>  Champy, do you want to respond to any of those comments?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5928.613s">So</a>  I do recall the gentleman, I think it was at the neighborhood meeting or was at the last hearing, talking about the system repair and I had given my phone number and email for them to reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5942.57s">And</a>  to be honest, we've got enough flyers that have gone out to the neighborhood that I'm surprised they couldn't reach us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5947.253s">But</a>  I don't think he didn't get a return call. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5949.635s">I</a>  don't think he called us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5953.519s">So</a>  with respect to some of his questions, I mean, I think some of them, I understand the sentiment and the history of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5961.125s">And</a>  it's unfortunate how it transpired without reliving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5971.898s">I</a>  wish it didn't take place as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5974.6s">With</a>  regard to Shreya, I think that her comments speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5980.124s">So</a>  we're a regular dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5982.386s">And</a>  every time she's called us or we've called her or emailed or whatnot, it's worked out really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5987.29s">So</a>  what we're seeing is some neighbors that when, I don't think this is a difficult conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5994.255s">I</a>  just think someone has to call us for us to know to call them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5998.512s">With</a>  regard to the Amato's, I think it's just going to be a matter of, you know, their attorney was active in the conversations in City Hall that took place with the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6009.058s">So</a>  he had suggested that we get approved and it's pending as a condition to get them to sign the easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6018.424s">And</a>  I think that that's the process we're going to have to take.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6024.707s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6024.947s">And</a>  I'll just make a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6027.973s">based</a>  on the comments that we heard from residents that were read. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6033.636s">One</a>  is that there are certain parameters that the Community Development Board needs to act within legal parameters. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6041.239s">So</a>  we cannot be responsible necessarily for whether development happens on a private parcel or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6050.803s">We</a>  are just tasked with making sure that all procedures are followed and that the design is as <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6057.736s">strong</a>  as it can be, you know, protecting the safety of the community and trying to get as good a quality product as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6068.599s">And</a>  then the second thing I would say is that we, neither can the board get in the middle of a private issue between a property owner and the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6083.484s">So</a>  just to be clear, what the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6087.052s">that</a>  the public understands what the scope of what we can do and what our role and responsibility is in this whole process.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6099.802s">I</a>  also wanted to correct the record that that comment mentioned that Tim McGibbon had approved the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6105.206s">And</a>  I just wanted to correct the record that that is not something that has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6111.53s">And</a>  maybe if you would like to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6115.818s">I</a>  think we have a member of the public who's been unmuted, Robin.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6118.239s">Good</a>  evening, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6120.62s">My</a>  name is Robin Stein and I'm with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6123.001s">We're</a>  special counsel to the board, so it's good to meet everyone this evening.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6127.724s">Thank</a>  you, Robin.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6129.084s">I</a>  had one question on, if it's okay, maybe you can just clarify for me, on this access easement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6136.768s">Is</a>  the relocation integral to this approval or is it just something that the applicant and other folks would like to see happen for safety reasons?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6147.1s">I'm</a>  gonna, so I think too, for one fold, it's an extension of the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6152.281s">And</a>  we think it's a benefit safety wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6155.722s">And</a>  I'll let Tim speak to your other question too.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6160.923s">Yeah,</a>  and I will say just Robin, just so you know, the board has asked, you know, did ask for some modifications to that right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6168.304s">So</a>  to increase safety so that it wouldn't be coming out into the main road, but rather into the subdivision road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6175.189s">and</a>  to grade it and improve the surfacing.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6180.713s">So</a>  I guess the question I have, is it going to be a, does it need to be, or is it will be a condition of the subdivision approval that it get relocated?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6189.239s">I</a>  believe it has to be so that, I mean, I don't think the project can move forward without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6199.747s">Someone,</a>  Tim.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6205.386s">If</a>  this board approved the subdivision, which is the creation of those lots, and the board would condition that approval on that agreement, then, you know, I understand we want it to get done, but if they don't get the agreement, then, right, you've conditioned the approval on the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6225.651s">So</a>  while, and my condition is sort of written that way too, and I admit that, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6232.605s">If</a>  nothing were done and the right-of-way wasn't moved, you basically are going to have a situation where you have an existing right-of-way that doesn't get relocated and it remains in the unsafe condition that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6247.887s">that's</a>  what would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6249.308s">The</a>  idea is that while we're building this road and we can fix this problem, let's fix it and make that recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6257.973s">But</a>  we can't force two private parties to make an agreement with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6261.715s">So</a>  I think, you know, after sort of having that discussion today, realizing that if you put that on a condition, then <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6272.237s">then</a>  you're kind of getting put in the car before the horse a little bit because right they're saying that that we're okay with the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6279.082s">And</a>  we want to see it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6281.643s">But</a>  we want all these things that are the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6284.797s">but</a>  then if we condition it or if the board conditions it, then it's forcing that private party to then make that agreement prior to your approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6295.503s">So</a>  I think, you know, the do nothing approach seems to work here on this particular matter with the understanding that the preference is to have that right of way fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6305.349s">And</a>  I think both homeowners that use that driveway would agree that the way it is now <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6311.418s">is</a>  not good, and the way that it's shown on the plans is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6315.901s">So</a>  I think they seem to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6318.662s">It's</a>  just a matter of tying this board up with something that it doesn't want to be tied up in.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6324.986s">So</a>  that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6325.826s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify, because as you said, it's possible that it could not happen and that this project would go forward without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6333.05s">And</a>  so I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6335.952s">So</a>  that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6336.692s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6343.761s">So</a>  do you have a recommendation, Robin, on how to word that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6348.903s">I</a>  mean, my preference is just that we're preserving through the plan the access of those abutters to the roadway with improvements.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6367.528s">So</a>  as I understand it, though, it's not going to be a condition of this approval that it get relocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6375.65s">Everyone</a>  would prefer that it get relocated, but this approval is not going to require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6381.731s">It's</a>  not integral to the approval, correct?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6388.853s">That</a>  may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6391.373s">I'm</a>  not sure.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6391.813s">I</a>  think that's what Tim was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6394.599s">Tim,</a>  is that?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6395.299s">What</a>  I'm doing is I'm acknowledging the issue that was brought up today, that the board may not want to get involved in a private issue, which if you condition this development on that, then that's exactly what you're doing.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6411.669s">So</a>  I think if the applicant, I mean, I think you could simply say something along the lines that there'll be no interference. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6424.663s">Understanding</a>  that the board's not requiring the relocation, you just want to make sure that folks' interests are protected as they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6431.505s">I</a>  mean, you could say nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6436.806s">If</a>  the board was inclined to, it could say something along the lines that, you know, there'll be no interference with any existing private rights in the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6447.869s">But</a>  I wanted to clarify what the board's goal was with the condition itself, which I think Tim has done.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6455.099s">Hi,</a>  this is Christy Dowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6456.28s">I</a>  just want to repeat back what I'm hearing as a board member. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6459.522s">I'm</a>  hearing that the present condition of that access is not in an ideal safe state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6471.388s">And</a>  it's not the development that's creating that condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6475.13s">But</a>  by way of the development, it would improve that condition and maintain access to those houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6482.895s">So</a>  is that accurate?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6491.565s">I</a>  think that is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6492.605s">I</a>  think the question is how to word it, whether we should be silent on the issue or to include language that was mentioned about not interfering with existing rights.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6510.656s">Well,</a>  is it enough to say that the development, the only condition is that it maintains access to the</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6520.532s">The</a>  thing I would want to add is that it, yes, it maintains access, but the big thing about the right-of-way to me was that it was emptying onto Winthrop Street, and now it's emptying onto the new road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6536.575s">And</a>  I think that's, to me, that's the most important component of this, and that's the language I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6542.616s">Like,</a>  do whatever you want, but this right-of-way can't continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6551.449s">but</a>  I don't know how we would do that.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6555.171s">Well,</a>  that goes to my point, sorry for just jumping in, Andre.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6559.233s">No,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6561.654s">You</a>  know, the board didn't put the driveway there, the driveway is there, it's an easement that was granted at some point in the past, I believe it was a very long time ago, in order to provide access to those houses up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6575.621s">So</a>  there becomes a question of what the board can and can't do in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6580.595s">I</a>  mean, that becomes relevant, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6584.239s">So</a>  while we all want that to be relocated and put on our new road, can we somehow stress that that's what the desire is, but without tying the project up? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6600.008s">with</a>  that private to private agreement? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6603.95s">Because</a>  that's what's going to happen if you put that as a condition of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6608.972s">And</a>  does the board even have a right to do that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6611.193s">I</a>  mean, that's also a fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6614.774s">So</a>  right now it's a driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6615.795s">It's</a>  not a, people use the word right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6617.756s">It's</a>  a shared driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6619.417s">It's</a>  not a, what do you call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6623.378s">A</a>  paper street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6625.139s">There's</a>  no way parcel associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6627.612s">So</a>  it's traversing over private land for a private driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6631.534s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6632.455s">So</a>  right now that's on Winthrop Street and it's not ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6637.938s">But</a>  the subdivision framework is basically allowing the creation of a brand new public way with the 10 lot building parcels, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6650.324s">And</a>  we wanna bring that driveway in on that to make it as safe as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6656.609s">but</a>  it becomes down to one private company and one private landowner abutting each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6664.811s">And</a>  the city has a stance of, yes, please do that, that is safer, but even can the city do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6672.074s">So</a>  I think I've talked enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6673.734s">There's</a>  probably a way to frame this and make it work.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6677.555s">Excuse</a>  me, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6678.695s">So</a>  through the, oh, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6680.836s">I</a>  think there's an important point that it has a domino effect because <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6684.417s">If</a>  you look at sheet C1.0, the existing driveway interferes with the proposed wheelchair ramps at the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6693.305s">So</a>  the two wheelchair ramps, one crossing the new road and one crossing Winthrop, may not be able to be designed appropriately if the driveway remains where it is today.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6706.117s">So</a>  through the chair, can I ask a question of the applicant?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6710.208s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6712.289s">If</a>  the applicant Robin, actually, could you just could you just state again your full name and affiliation so that the public sure.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6719.45s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6719.67s">My</a>  name is Robin Stein. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6721.491s">And</a>  I work at the law firm KP law and we are special counsel to the board in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6728.333s">So</a>  we're a lawyer for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6732.274s">I</a>  guess my question before making this too complicated, because I was just trying to understand the board's goal with the condition, is whether the applicant's willing to have the condition say that the applicant needs to arrange for relocation as shown on the plan.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6754.055s">a</a>  little bit prior to answering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6756.856s">So</a>  we regrets putting a $40,000 waterline in without getting this in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6763.898s">And</a>  now when I took notes, we're hearing this compensatory damages and we have to shield their property from the future development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6772.54s">So</a>  I would have no problem with the requirement for that with our neighbor at 555 Winthrop, which is Shreya. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6783.092s">But</a>  I think that if I, what we're agreeing to now is incredible amount of leverage against our company. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6790.115s">And</a>  that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6791.455s">I</a>  mean, the letter itself pretty much states that they want it, but they think that there's more for them to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6798.118s">And</a>  we are open to doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6800.638s">We've</a>  been on the plans for, I think, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6805.1s">And</a>  our neighbor has been at the meetings for those three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6810.662s">This</a>  is not new, Robin, just to, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6813.285s">give</a>  an explanation of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6815.886s">We're</a>  willing to, I think that, you know, if we wanna say that the developer is willing to put this in as long as it's agreed to within a certain period of time, I think that the neighbors would gladly sign it knowing that it's got an expiration date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6832.854s">And</a>  I would do that rather than being at a negotiating table with someone who's just written a letter, which I wouldn't put that in writing personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6842.946s">that</a>  pretty much says they're gonna hold out to get a little more.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6854.478s">So</a>  Attorney Stein, do you have any recommendation for how to proceed in this matter?</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6859.742s">Well,</a>  you know, I think that those are fair comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6865.106s">And</a>  that certainly, you know, so long as the board understands that ultimately, if they can't accomplish the private agreement, it's not going to get moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6873.532s">And</a>  that they may have to come back for modifications if there's something that implicates that, you certainly could put a condition in it just says that the developer shall relocate the easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6884.079s">I'm</a>  just looking at I want to get the terms right that the developer <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6889.664s">shall</a>  as part of the project accomplish the proposed relocation of the access easement shown on, and I think it's sheet S2, subject to agreement of the easement holders, but that there should be no interference with the existing private easement rights, if that's something that everyone thinks is a fair condition.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6918.956s">That</a>  seems reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6919.976s">What</a>  do you think, Mr. Champy?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6921.637s">So</a>  what happens in the event that 553 just decides that they're going to hold up?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6938.341s">Attorney</a>  Stein, I'm going to throw that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6939.921s">It's</a>  a legal question.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6943.642s">If</a>  it's not a requirement of the approval that it get moved, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6948.125s">then</a>  it doesn't move. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6951.087s">And</a>  that's why I asked, and I think Tim already addressed this question, is this an integral part or is it something that's preferred? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6957.331s">And</a>  I understand from Tim that it's something that's preferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6959.992s">So</a>  if it's not a condition of the approval, everyone just understands that it may not happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6967.016s">And</a>  if there are parts of this design that are dependent on that happening, they might have to modify. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6972.9s">But</a>  I can't really guess at that right now.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6975.561s">We</a>  would agree to that.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6978.159s">Did</a>  you say you would yes, I'm sorry that the zoom just got okay, so Something along the lines that the developer shall relocate the easement Shown as I'm just going to write this up proposed relocated access easement a1 And then we can always proofread it later on Plan sheet <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7011.244s">s2</a>  and we'll say subject to agreement of the easement holders yes oh i lost my page i'm sorry subject to the agreement of the easement holders and shall and shall not <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7040.898s">interfere</a>  with existing easement rights?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7046.68s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7048.781s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7049.041s">So</a>  something along those lines, something to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7052.182s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7052.342s">If</a>  that works for folks 10, if that works for you.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7055.703s">In</a>  the event that it's a stalemate, we replant a crosswalk.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7060.652s">That</a>  all makes sense and that's where my mind was headed to, that we're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7065.436s">And</a>  just to be clear, if for some reason agreement falls through and we all don't get what we want in the situation, then it would have to be approved through a field change, through the board, a redesign, how we make that crossing work from Lorraine and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7080.409s">So,</a>  definitely people.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7083.172s">Sorry,</a>  Tim, could you explain that process again if we're moving the crosswalk?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7087.402s">I</a>  would say that if a plan set gets approved tonight, and that agreement doesn't go through with the private-to-private agreement there with the grantee, then you would have to submit for a field change for a redesign, leaving the driveway where it is, and then seeing what we can do about that, carossing over to Lorraine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7107.693s">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7108.813s">Okay,</a>  yeah, that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7110.334s">So</a>  it would be a field change. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7111.635s">And</a>  just to be clear, we think it's a better project with the extension on the right-of-way.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7117.608s">Yeah,</a>  I think we all kind of agree that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7119.73s">I</a>  think the grantees also know that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7121.811s">It's</a>  just a matter of the business of doing business per se in this world.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7125.934s">We</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7130.473s">No,</a>  no, I was just recognizing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7132.013s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7133.114s">Sorry,</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7133.874s">It's</a>  so hard on Zoom to get attentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7137.635s">I</a>  just want to make sure that I'm being accurate in what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7140.515s">It's</a>  just the area identified as proposed relocated access to A1, where it says extension of right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7147.417s">Is</a>  that already there?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7148.337s">It's</a>  not already there.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7152.898s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that the condition is clear as to what the developer has to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7157.359s">Maybe</a>  you can help on the engineering side of that.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7159.853s">Sir,</a>  it's the extension of the right-of-way is the new area.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7165.135s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7169.156s">So</a>  you're getting rid of the 955-foot proposed relocated access easement and creating the extension of the right-of-way.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7179.62s">I</a>  don't follow you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7181.861s">Can</a>  you share your screen, please?</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7185.692s">I</a>  can't because I'm on, I can tell you it's, I can't because I have it on a different system than the Zoom, but it's sheet S2.0. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7194.595s">I,</a>  let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7201.858s">Maybe</a>  you can share it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7203.838s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7204.959s">You</a>  know what, I don't have, I have the sheets that I was supposed to pull because it was a Dropbox link.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7209.102s">Do</a>  you think we could, I think we all agree on what we're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7214.065s">Do</a>  you think we could wordsmith the final language? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7219.387s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7220.768s">Yeah,</a>  we can make the final decision just subject to the chair's final review and approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7224.31s">I</a>  think we're all on the same page about what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7226.551s">And</a>  we can clarify it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7228.412s">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7229.333s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7229.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7230.413s">I</a>  appreciate your counsel, Attorney Stein.</p>

    <p>[Robin Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7235.476s">Happy</a>  to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7237.417s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7238.032s">All</a>  right, thank you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7239.373s">So</a>  a couple of other issues to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7246.117s">The</a>  fire chief had a conversation with community development staff and myself about a couple of concerns and recommendations that he was making. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7257.823s">So</a>  I want to just acknowledge those and try to address them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7262.966s">One</a>  was he, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7266.768s">reiterated</a>  that he'd like that right-of-way to be as wide as possible and paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7274.728s">I</a>  think you mentioned that you were intending to pave it now, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7278.79s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7278.99s">Assuming</a>  we get the extension, we're paving it.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7284.633s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7285.733s">And</a>  then, obviously, he had recommended sprinklering each of the houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7292.956s">Now,</a>  you are not required to do that, so that's just his preference that he wanted to weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7299.379s">And</a>  then the final thing, which is probably his strongest recommendation, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7304.232s">was</a>  to get rid of the island that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7308.834s">He</a>  has concerns about the turning radius and being able to maneuver fire trucks in there, especially if people are parked in front of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7320.418s">So</a>  could you address that issue?</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7323.9s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7324.32s">On</a>  the island, my <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7327.291s">From</a>  my understanding, the subdivision rules and regs require it for the road for the cul-de-sac, so I think it would require relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7335.996s">So</a>  what I would suggest in that case would be that if we can approve the plan in its current state, I'll reappear for the relief to remove the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7350.625s">Therefore,</a>  that way if someone appeals it, I'm not stuck in appeals court because of an island.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7359.996s">We</a>  don't believe that that is a requirement to have the island.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7367.322s">Well,</a>  then that would be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7368.323s">I'll</a>  take it right off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7369.704s">I'm</a>  almost, I'm, Wayne Kiefner is on the call and he's muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7376.97s">He</a>  may know it's been on there so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7379.191s">I,</a>  to be honest, I, I forget, but so I guess we can make the, if it doesn't require relief, I'll remove the island.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7387.558s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7389.285s">There</a>  may be some middle ground with that.</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7391.826s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7393.747s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7394.167s">I</a>  was about to say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7395.888s">I'm</a>  wondering if there's a design for an island that would satisfy both the fire chief and the fact that I think it looks a lot nicer with the island.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7410.153s">Yeah,</a>  it looks like the overall diameter is 80 feet of the largest circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7415.175s">So</a>  it's similar to roundabouts that are on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7418.557s">And</a>  in those cases, the median could be, the center island could be reduced with a multiple piece to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7426.36s">So</a>  it's kind of a hybrid.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7428.141s">Yeah,</a>  so we could do like a paver that ramps up in a three foot section around it with a planting in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7434.384s">To</a>  be honest, I don't have a, I think that that would be kind of cool, but I don't have a position on it.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7444.88s">You</a>  know we drew the road so they would adhere to the specs, but I really when it comes down to it I'm open to anything So and obviously I I communicated to the chief to that I thought aesthetically the island looked better, but he did feel that That he'd have some some issues with this with his trucks, so I want to take that as <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7471.264s">of</a>  that seriously.</p>

    <p>[zMDmsK0LIsU_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7472.925s">What</a>  kind of issues were they, Andre? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7474.305s">Because,</a>  you know, there are like programs you can use to, you know, like it's called auto turn and you can just show the chief that.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7485.75s">His</a>  largest ladder truck is huge.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7491.833s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7492.033s">This</a>  is something that might require a separate sit down conversation with the chief at some point to go over these kinds of design issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7501.245s">which</a>  I would be interested in doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7504.026s">But</a>  I think for tonight, it would be hard to get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7511.129s">So</a>  I guess, you know, if there is, I like the idea of having some kind of, you know, treatment where you can see, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7521.444s">you</a>  know, would not just be 80 feet of or so of asphalt, but it would have some treatment in the middle that would make it more aesthetically pleasing, but would not interfere if necessary with a truck that would have to make, you know, that might have to drive over it.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7538.878s">So</a>  I'm open to whatever the, wherever that discussion lands, I'm fine with it.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7546.364s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7548.903s">So</a>  is there agreement, though, that, you know, Tim, I think you, there's no requirement, as far as you know, to have that island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7556.904s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7558.585s">Yeah,</a>  I looked into it.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7559.325s">It's</a>  on a graphic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7560.785s">And</a>  it talks about widths with an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7564.866s">So</a>  I'm pretty sure they're minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7567.246s">So</a>  it could be interpreted that the regs don't require it, like you were saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7572.447s">I</a>  didn't see it explicitly in black and white that said an island is required.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7578.312s">But</a>  it's in the diagrams, right?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7579.913s">And</a>  in the diagrams, I mean, that's a valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7582.634s">So</a>  someone could interpret it as it's shown in the diagrams, therefore it's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7586.536s">So,</a>  you know, point taken.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7591.118s">But</a>  we're flexible on that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7592.719s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7593.159s">Yeah,</a>  we have not required islands, particularly because of the, you know, the fire chief has often weighs in in this way on such projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7603.844s">So</a>  we don't anticipate a problem, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7607.108s">I</a>  think if we could word it in such a way that we could say there could be some kind of treatment in the middle that would not obstruct emergency vehicles, that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7627.265s">And</a>  then we can kind of leave that for the design afterwards for you guys to work out.</p>

    <p>[TdrPH5HfJeg_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7635.562s">So</a>  if we could word it so that it's stated that the island can be reduced in size, almost down to, can essentially go to zero, but at that point, if there's still a concern, it's not our concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7654.753s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7656.213s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7657.494s">There</a>  could be, maybe we should word it that there could be no island, but that there will be, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7666.218s">you</a>  know, further discussion with the fire chief and the city engineer about a mutually acceptable, you know, treatment for the cul-de-sac. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7679.93s">But</a>  not requiring anything to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=7683.534s">So,</a>  you know, worst case, there's no island.</p>
