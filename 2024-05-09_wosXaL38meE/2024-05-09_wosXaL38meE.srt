1
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:05,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:11,074
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you're good to go.

3
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

4
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:16,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just give everyone a minute.

5
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: 123 cool.

6
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: hi there.

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay i'm going to go ahead and get started and.

8
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,098
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can meet you later.

9
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't rename yourself?

10
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I do not see the opportunity to rename myself.

11
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:24,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that.

12
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

13
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:31,309
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't been on Zoom in a while, huh?

14
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I like defaults to this.

15
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, because I feel like I keep changing it.

16
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And whenever I get on my personal computer, it just, that's what it wants.

17
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:38,675
Okay.

18
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to read the meeting notice so we can get started.

19
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Please be advised that on May 8th, 2024 at 6 p.m.

20
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: there'll be an MSBA Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

28
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny Graham here.

29
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Maria Dorsey here.

30
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicole Morell here.

31
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:03,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening to my spreadsheet here?

32
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:04,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little cranky.

33
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa Desmond here.

34
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Marissa.

35
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Dalton here.

36
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And Luke Preissner.

37
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see Luke yet.

38
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:22,501
[SPEAKER_01]: He just emailed looking for the Zoom link, so I think he'll be with us any second.

39
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

40
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:28,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so our agenda for the evening.

41
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:34,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We have just a handful of things to talk a little bit about.

42
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:44,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially all of this information will feed back into a report that I'll give to the school committee on May 20th.

43
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:58,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So the goal for tonight is to sort of hash through these things in sufficient detail that we can then bring them to the school committee so they understand some of the objectives that we're pursuing from a communications and community engagement perspective.

44
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:11,557
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, there were like 104 or 105 people who wanted to be on the building committee and they were all like very qualified for any number of reasons.

45
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can't have a committee of 105 people.

46
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:20,106
[SPEAKER_04]: or actually 115 by the time it's all said and done.

47
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:28,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think people are rightfully excited about the project and they wanna know how they can participate.

48
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:35,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that goes not just for the folks that applied for the building committee and were not selected, but also just for the community at large.

49
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:40,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if you sort of tune into what you're seeing, people ask about,

50
00:05:42,157 --> 00:06:06,138
[SPEAKER_04]: you know again we're sort of in this like paperwork phase where we have a lot of like legwork to do before we get to the exciting stuff that is going to answer the questions people really have like where will it be and what will it look like and will Medford High be renovated or will it be new or will it be some sort of thing in the middle and and how much will it cost and when will it be done so all of those are like the real exciting questions that I think people

51
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:13,950
[SPEAKER_04]: want to get to, but we've got to sort of make our way there over the coming months.

52
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think just talking through some of that I think is important for us tonight.

53
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:25,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to take notes and then firm it up for the larger group.

54
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:39,621
[SPEAKER_04]: you know this is a small group so I want to make sure people just feel like they can participate and we'll just sort of plug away at the agenda one piece at a time and hopefully we will not need two full hours to do it.

55
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:40,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound good?

56
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay cool.

57
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing I wanted to talk through a little bit was the first draft of the website.

58
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:54,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tom is actually going to give us a little bit of an update on that and

59
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: just where we're at and what sort of his vision is.

60
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:00,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Luke, how are you?

61
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:07,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And talk a little bit about like where we are in terms of the formation of the website.

62
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:10,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tom, I'm gonna turn it over to you to give everyone an update.

63
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:20,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm assuming this group may have some suggestions or thoughts to help inform that first vision.

64
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thanks Jenny and hi everyone.

65
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:45,766
[SPEAKER_01]: To start with just a little bit of background about how we kind of approach the Medford Public Schools website in general, we use a, lets us build out a lot of really nice web pages.

66
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,066
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been to MPS 02155,

67
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:51,552
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have seen this website.

68
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,493
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been updated.

69
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the school department built a completely new website about two years ago.

70
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a nice fresh website.

71
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:11,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be building the building project website on the same architecture and actually as part of the same project.

72
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:16,961
[SPEAKER_01]: the same web platform.

73
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about my connection.

74
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try turning my video off, see if that helps.

75
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:26,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great, great.

76
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:27,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave it off then.

77
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with final site.

78
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:43,407
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual website work gets shared among a few different people, but the two primary actors are me as the communications lead for the district and our colleague, Lisa Miller.

79
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:50,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa Miller is the web design and computer programming teacher on the vocational side at the high school.

80
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's a full-time teacher, but she also has done a lot of really good work

81
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,035
[SPEAKER_01]: building the new website.

82
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:05,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, she's kind of the web design, the web architecture expert when, you know, putting the two of us side by side.

83
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:13,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So I rely on her for a lot of the kind of engineering support on the website and together we build things.

84
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:21,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason we don't have a draft of the building committee website ready is just because of her limited time.

85
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,477
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're hoping to iron that out soon.

86
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:36,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will share my screen so that I can point out a couple things on the existing website to let you know what I'm thinking about as we start this process.

87
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,868
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

88
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:38,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

89
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:48,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you able to share, Tom?

90
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I should be able to.

91
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

92
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:56,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a minute to decide if it's going to let me.

93
00:09:58,174 --> 00:09:59,274
[SPEAKER_01]: As these things tend to go.

94
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:04,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

95
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:06,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.

96
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So is everyone able to see my screen?

97
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

98
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

99
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the school website.

100
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:23,905
[SPEAKER_01]: We did secure a domain for the building committee website.

101
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:24,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It's buildingmhs.org.

102
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:42,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we picked up that domain, it's ours, we own a couple of the adjacent domains.net.info to make it, you know, harder for unscrupulous people to make copycats to try to misdirect people.

103
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have buildingMHS.org.

104
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the

105
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:52,607
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the URL will read when you're on the website.

106
00:10:52,707 --> 00:11:04,031
[SPEAKER_01]: But to show you an example of some of the things I'm thinking about, we're going to go to the school committee page, because I think there's some good models for kind of what the initial draft of the website can look like.

107
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:09,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I see it, there's kind of three big things that we want to accomplish right away with the website.

108
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:16,636
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, given the activity of this committee and the flurry of meetings that we have,

109
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:19,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important to set up a meetings page.

110
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:30,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would look a lot like this, where we'd be able to list meeting dates, include links to agendas, Zoom links, any associated documents with the meeting.

111
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important just from a transparency perspective.

112
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:39,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to make it easier for members of the committee, because if you

113
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:45,961
[SPEAKER_01]: are jumping on a meeting, you need the agenda, you need the Zoom link, they can all be kind of in one place.

114
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:50,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this will be a really important thing to get set up right away.

115
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:57,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we can basically copy the format of the school committee's meetings page, that'll be set up no problem.

116
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely have a news tab pretty quickly.

117
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:07,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, our building committee news is still in school committee news.

118
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:17,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It might remain there and get duplicated over into building committee news, since the building committee is kind of an organ of the Medford School Committee.

119
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,004
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this would be a place where any of our news updates could all be kind of found in one place.

120
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:28,187
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a press release announcing that we had the first meeting

121
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,269
[SPEAKER_01]: of the building committee last week.

122
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like that would have a home there.

123
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:38,378
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely going to need a space for documents.

124
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:42,963
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different documents that the building committee is obviously developing.

125
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:46,587
[SPEAKER_01]: As they're ready, we want to be able to share them with the public.

126
00:12:47,388 --> 00:13:02,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, in the interest of transparency and also to kind of document, um, the work that we've done so far, um, that might look something like, uh, one option certainly, um, would be to kind of look like this budget page, um,

127
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that basically gives us a limited file navigator.

128
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:15,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could have folders for different categories of documents and then links to the documents pretty readily available.

129
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it could look a lot like this page.

130
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:23,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final thing we'll need to do, all of you have submitted really nice bios and photos of yourself.

131
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:32,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think it's valuable and important to list out the membership of the committee with those bios.

132
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,312
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of put a face to the work of this committee.

133
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:39,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the very fast version.

134
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can stop sharing, I think.

135
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,138
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I'm thinking about it.

136
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:58,665
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first things we need to get through are a meeting page, documents page, news page, and a kind of about the committee page that includes the list of the members and their bios.

137
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:04,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke, did I see that you had a question in the chat?

138
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,440
[SPEAKER_09]: A recommendation.

139
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, go for it.

140
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:18,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen many of these websites, and occasionally when they load, the browser throws errors.

141
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:19,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

142
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Suggesting that they're not secure.

143
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:25,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not common, but it happens.

144
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:28,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Somerville is the one example.

145
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,633
[SPEAKER_09]: that I have on my mind, but I think there's others.

146
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:38,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas others, Belmont stonems, they load normally, they don't throw any warnings.

147
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:48,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think there are basic best practices and I just wanted to bring them up so that they're not forgotten.

148
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still early, we're setting this thing up and we just wanna have that in mind.

149
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,551
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't wanna throw errors

150
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:02,801
[SPEAKER_09]: suggesting that this website has been compromised in some way.

151
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,143
[SPEAKER_09]: We want people to feel like they're seeing the truth.

152
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good point, Luke.

153
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:18,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly the MPS main website uses HTTPS protocols, the secure URL protocols.

154
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely make sure that building MHS.org is also going to be kind of fully secured and not raise any flags in that regard.

155
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Because yeah, I agree.

156
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,531
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the really important functions is to

157
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:37,619
[SPEAKER_01]: not only to be the official repository of all this information we're gonna get up there, but also to look like.

158
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that matters a lot.

159
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:41,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thanks.

160
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead, Nicole.

161
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Jenny.

162
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:55,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one thought I had, this looks great, and I think all these tabs make sense, just to Jenny's earlier point, is their thought is like getting a basic FAQ up kind of right away.

163
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:04,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of the frequently asked questions are already addressed or at least partially addressed on the MSBE website, whether we can pull those in or just even have, you know, five to ten like

164
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,259
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

165
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why are we meeting?

166
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are people meeting?

167
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:14,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, very kind of basic stuff, since this is a little bit, not to say it's an opaque process.

168
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:17,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's on the website for MSBA, but most people don't know how this works.

169
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:18,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Understandably so.

170
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

171
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:24,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would make perfect sense to build out in the kind of initial spec.

172
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:36,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, MSBA has so much information already available and our peer districts have already answered a lot of these questions too.

173
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:44,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'll review some of the FAQs that MSBA has available and maybe that other districts have available, see what we want to pull over.

174
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:45,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

175
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke.

176
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:55,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of along those lines, I've been thinking about what do you need at the start, you need an idea of what community wants to know.

177
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,792
[SPEAKER_09]: FAQs that are the responses to that.

178
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:06,875
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought to myself, what if we conducted a canvassing for some period, two weeks, three weeks?

179
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have time, right?

180
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:09,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Our clock just started last week.

181
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:19,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We just canvass the community and we say, we put out a questionnaire, whether it's through a SurveyMonkey thing or through a Google doc, and we open it up, see what comes in.

182
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,201
[SPEAKER_09]: We may get a lot, we may get a little.

183
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,742
[SPEAKER_09]: If we get a lot, it's actually pretty easy to process a lot.

184
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:29,385
[SPEAKER_09]: And we see kind of what the most common questions are from our community.

185
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:37,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we kind of cross check that against FAQs from other building websites, from the MSBA.

186
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:49,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that way we're addressing what our community wants, as well as, you know, maybe some of the process stuff that other websites have already addressed.

187
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,983
[SPEAKER_09]: it would kind of dispel the whole cut and paste feel.

188
00:17:54,003 --> 00:18:04,987
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if we see the exact same FAQ responses here as we do on the LSBA side, you know, it makes it feel like an empty gesture.

189
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:14,631
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we, I think if we canvas the community and we ask, I think it will add a lot of, you know, goodwill to it.

190
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And plus we'll have an understanding of what the community really wants to know.

191
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:21,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

192
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that idea.

193
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:31,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually goes to sort of one of our other agenda items, which is like, what are those community engagement opportunities?

194
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can definitely do that.

195
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:50,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I think keeping it simple obviously makes it easier to execute on, but based on what you're saying, Luke, the two things that I captured in terms of like what we would want to know is like, what questions do you have about this

196
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,509
[SPEAKER_04]: building process?

197
00:18:53,430 --> 00:19:01,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are you looking for in a reimagined Medford High School?

198
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:02,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

199
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:10,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, are there other questions that you think would be important to pose to folks?

200
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what do you want to know about the eligibility process?

201
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what we're doing right now.

202
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a mission.

203
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:30,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, we have a strategy that is going to get us to a high school, but we actually have a tactical mission, and that's to complete this year with entry into feasibility.

204
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:41,542
[SPEAKER_09]: There are aspects of the eligibility process that are unique to that process.

205
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:47,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Once they're completed, you know, move on, but people may want to know about what do we have in front of us this year?

206
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:49,986
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we need to do as part of eligibility?

207
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So that I think should be a question.

208
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what do you want to know about the eligibility process?

209
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:56,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

210
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny, I'm one of their questions.

211
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:05,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to actually I just realized I'm not sharing my screen.

212
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm I'm capturing all this as we talk.

213
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me share my screen.

214
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:14,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see my screen?

215
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, OK, perfect Maria.

216
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:30,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, one thing that I would like to see possibly is a statement about why we're undertaking this project, because I've heard some people say the building is only 50 years old.

217
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:35,224
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of buildings in Metro, a lot of houses that are only 50 years old too.

218
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:42,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think possibly a statement about what exactly the reason is that we're doing this project.

219
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,331
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the failures of the building, the inadequacies,

220
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:58,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that might be helpful, and especially in light of our current situation with funding, how we're going to go about this when we're facing all of these other shortfalls.

221
00:20:59,196 --> 00:20:59,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

222
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a great point.

223
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Thomas and I had talked a little bit about like

224
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:11,119
[SPEAKER_04]: pinning like a welcome on the page to just say like, welcome to this page, this is what you can find here.

225
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all really excited about this.

226
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:24,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we could do, we could pull that like why into that landing page so that people can hear some of that as well.

227
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we'll get a lot of those FAQs in terms of like,

228
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,021
[SPEAKER_04]: how will we pay for this?

229
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:39,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think some of those answers are gonna start to like flush out really quickly, you know, in terms of like, how will we pay for the feasibility study?

230
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:50,272
[SPEAKER_04]: All those answers are gonna come really fast because we actually have a short window to set aside our feasibility money here in Medford because free cash will be available only until June 30.

231
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:53,354
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will need to get that done before June 30.

232
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we will have,

233
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:08,106
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if the plan continues to be to use free free cash, we will have to get a favorable vote from the council to move that money earmarked into this into the

234
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, what's the word I'm looking for?

235
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:16,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Sustainability fund.

236
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, it starts with an S. Stability fund, thank you.

237
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:25,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the stability fund before June 30 so that it is there and ready to go.

238
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Stabilization, yes, thank you.

239
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:33,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think there will be a lot of good questions about that along the way.

240
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do like the idea of like,

241
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:48,841
[SPEAKER_04]: asking people what they want to know before we push out like just a pile of FAQs, because I think we can anticipate reasonably the questions people have.

242
00:22:48,881 --> 00:23:03,395
[SPEAKER_04]: This committee is 25 people, like I think we have a good sort of perspective on that, but to the point of community engagement, I think I want to hear from people first before we start telling them what questions we think that they have, right, so.

243
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:12,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think that helps just keep the number manageable too, because if you're putting down like 30 FAQs, people just check out and can't find what they want anyways.

244
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

245
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have three questions.

246
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,700
[SPEAKER_04]: What questions do you have about the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee?

247
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,182
[SPEAKER_04]: What questions do you have about the MSBA eligibility process?

248
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not a full question,

249
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:42,051
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to see in a re-imagined MHS?

250
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:44,352
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

251
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:47,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

252
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:54,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we wanna know, you know, we do a lot of surveying where we're collecting demographic information.

253
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:54,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

254
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:02,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the last one, I like the spirit of it, but you're just gonna get a lot of answers.

255
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:25,030
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the FAQ, and I think that's a question to ask, but for the FAQ, maybe frame it as, you know, like, what questions would you have about the re-imagined high school, right?

256
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we want to produce questions.

257
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I might be hyper-focusing on

258
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:52,598
[SPEAKER_04]: think we can probably do both ask like try to inform the FAQ and start to get people excited about yeah like what might this look like in the end like I you know I was able to take a tour of Arlington High School and um they they just had stuff that like

259
00:24:54,141 --> 00:25:03,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly I didn't have when I went to high school, and MHS doesn't have like they had this discord, they had a room they called it the discourse room and had like discourse on the wall.

260
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:10,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like a shared classroom space where multiple classrooms could convene together.

261
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:17,731
[SPEAKER_04]: do things like have debates and it was it's set up in a fashion that sort of facilitates that.

262
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:29,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the principles like here's the one thing I don't like about this room, but in general, it was like the idea of like collaboration space for classrooms to work together.

263
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:38,087
[SPEAKER_04]: was I was just like, oh, if you ask me what I wanted in a building, I never could have described that because it's beyond anything I've seen.

264
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:40,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't work in schools every single day.

265
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:53,740
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's stuff like that where like, I think asking people what they want to see is going to give us like some like really fascinating ideas because people in Medford have been everywhere and have all kinds of different experiences.

266
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might just give us some good food for thought to help us inform the

267
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:05,164
[SPEAKER_04]: educational profile, like ask as well, which I think is pretty exciting.

268
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm tracking now.

269
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:13,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now I'm starting to imagine the questionnaire as a two-way communication, right?

270
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:22,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're asking you community for questions that you have about all this, but we're also going to ask you a question.

271
00:26:22,827 --> 00:26:23,607
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to see?

272
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:24,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

273
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:29,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you structure it that way and almost break out the third question as a separate thing, here's a question to you.

274
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that could work and I think people would really enjoy that.

275
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:51,920
[SPEAKER_09]: And some people that really just want to talk about what they want to see and they may not even give us any useful questions, whereas you might find these other sort of like, I don't know, more procedural process driven people who have a lot of questions about how are you going to get from point A to point B to C and so on.

276
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:04,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And so structuring that way as almost two separate sections in a short questionnaire could be really effective in getting like broader engagement.

277
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:37,893
[SPEAKER_02]: something like this.

278
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,595
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks awesome to me but um what are others on the committee think?

279
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:59,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there's one yeah there's one possibility and not to narrow it um right out the gate but we could do multiple choice right?

280
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we could

281
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:05,553
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, poll kind of broadly about what the community priorities are.

282
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:09,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the priority a sustainable net zero emissions building?

283
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:14,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the priority a building that includes community spaces?

284
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:18,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the priority, you know,

285
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:23,497
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really big vocational spaces that allow us to expand voc programs?

286
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:32,468
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be one kind of question, but I also see a lot of value in keeping it open-ended, so I'm not married to that, but wanted to raise it as an alternative.

287
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:43,601
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I think people may ask right off the bat is what is a comprehensive school?

288
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:46,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people do not know what that is.

289
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:49,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're calling it this comprehensive high school.

290
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:52,105
[SPEAKER_08]: How could they even answer the question if they don't know what that is?

291
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can give it a little bit of a preamble.

292
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:28,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can include a link to the statement of interest as well if somebody really wants to dive in.

293
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:34,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's true.

294
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:36,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think a lot of people know that's available.

295
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:41,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, some do, but I don't know if there's broad awareness that the SOI is now posted.

296
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just the SOI.

297
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,405
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like the results of the environmental building conditions survey.

298
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:51,109
[SPEAKER_09]: There were like two separate studies done there, which was actually really important.

299
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,731
[SPEAKER_09]: That helped the SOI tremendously.

300
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:53,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

301
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of that is available.

302
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:58,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think people should know that it's there.

303
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:04,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And when they see this survey, that might be the first time that they realize, oh, I can go and take a look at this.

304
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

305
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:06,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole.

306
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:20,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I think this looks good and I think it's just helpful to think of as far as like the whole ecosystem of stuff we're going to do for engagement and asking these questions because it's just like if this is just like our preliminary or first pass.

307
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great and we don't it doesn't have to.

308
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,994
[SPEAKER_03]: address every single thought.

309
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this was like spurred by the idea of FAQs and then we kind of it's already evolving but then just thinking like are we you know how many other surveys or other outreach things are we doing so just like we don't have to necessarily have this address every single concern question we have right now but also understanding how many more or what other ways or what specific topic-based surveys or outreach we'll be putting out there.

310
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's a good.

311
00:30:58,312 --> 00:30:59,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are good questions.

312
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:01,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I

313
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:29,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

314
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Click any of these that apply.

315
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

316
00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:47,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

317
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

318
00:31:53,277 --> 00:32:02,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the other sort of question sort of to zoom out from like the survey, which I think is a great idea to start to get people familiar with what's happening.

319
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to talk a little bit with this group about other things we should be thinking about doing during this eligibility phase to draw in and keep the community informed.

320
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:24,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody has thoughts on like things they've seen other committees do in this phase or ideas.

321
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think, you know, the obvious thing is like, I think at some point we should offer some tours of MHS because there's plenty of people who have never been inside MHS.

322
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's plenty of people who have been inside MHS, but it's been, you know, many years or, you know,

323
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,810
[SPEAKER_04]: or something else entirely.

324
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So we may wanna sort of think about some tour dates of Medford High School.

325
00:32:52,832 --> 00:33:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that necessarily has to be like in the next like gauntlet of 60 days, because the next 60 days are like very sort of brutal in terms of calendars, but we could even schedule them for the fall and think about what do we wanna see in those tours.

326
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just like one thought that I had in terms of like obvious engagement things.

327
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't sure if anybody had any other thoughts about that.

328
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you say this phase, this is the phase that goes until January.

329
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:31,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, like I said, my big goal is that we're done long before January, but even if we are like, there's no building before January, so we have time.

330
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:50,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we could ask some of those, the media tech students to do some video tours that could be attached to the website and show them some of the spaces that, you know, cause a lot of people can't get in there, especially older people that building isn't,

331
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:55,678
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't handicap friendly, so maybe video tours as well.

332
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,340
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great idea.

333
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nicole's got her hand up, but then I want to go afterwards.

334
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:03,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't figured out how to do the hand raise and zoom.

335
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the reactions.

336
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the reactions.

337
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hidden.

338
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:09,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole?

339
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a thought as far as like, I know

340
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Online tends to be, of course, all this stuff is going to exist online, but directing folks there, if there is a thought of like some physical signage, whether it's like stuff that can literally be like at city hall with a QR code or on like, you know, we could even do like.

341
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:32,324
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's budget for just like some lawn signs that could be on some public spaces with a QR code where people can then find out.

342
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:41,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if people aren't on Facebook or all the usual channels, we could have all this beautiful information and people, you know, a certain subset of people will still have no clue.

343
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:42,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

344
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:54,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Luke.

345
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like your idea.

346
00:34:56,495 --> 00:35:05,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, have you ever seen those before and after photo that it's almost like this like unique little subculture where people sort of

347
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:19,045
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, try to copy like a picture they took together like 30 years ago, but in the present, you know, so you'll have like a brother and a sister kind of sitting by side on a swing when they're four.

348
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:22,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they try to recreate that when they're 40, that sort of thing.

349
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:32,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so kind of along those lines, there's actually a video, um, and it's available through the, uh, the library and it was filmed in 1970.

350
00:35:34,037 --> 00:35:37,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is like a tour through the school.

351
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:56,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And like there's cuts, you know, between one building to the one room to the next, they talk about, you know, this great new, like woodshop area, they talk about the cafeteria, wouldn't it be cool if the if there is a media tech team, that they try to recreate that and show us what it looks like today.

352
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have the two videos.

353
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:02,133
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some cases, it'll be amusing.

354
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:13,701
[SPEAKER_09]: But in other cases, I bet it'll lead to almost shocking reflections of, I can't believe it still looks the same way.

355
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it doesn't even work anymore.

356
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:16,743
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

357
00:36:16,763 --> 00:36:19,965
[SPEAKER_09]: The comparisons could be stark in some cases.

358
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:23,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that sounds amazing.

359
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the thing that comes to mind is the theater.

360
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:31,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I imagine when it was built, it was like the bee's knees, right?

361
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:35,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's like an amazing theater with all this technology.

362
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:44,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And now if you talk to the Medford High drama students who just put on a show, they're like, why can you only hear one voice at a time?

363
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because the technology is dated and it's, that's,

364
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,540
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of all it's capable of, right.

365
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:56,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that could be such a like cool, fun, creative project.

366
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:10,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a media tech group of students who I'm sure could do some pretty amazing things with that concept, especially if there is this like this video from the 70s, that could be very cool.

367
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:20,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know who to send the link to, but I the videos out there and the library has posted it on their website.

368
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:21,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have it handy.

369
00:37:21,687 --> 00:37:25,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could post it in the chat.

370
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:31,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just post it in the chat and I will throw it in this document so that we don't lose it on the side and then I'll post it in the chat.

371
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:34,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, um,

372
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:46,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this would be useful, but I'm having all of our yearbooks digitized.

373
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:54,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I was going through all of the stuff that I have to get ready for that process, I came across the newspaper

374
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:01,471
[SPEAKER_08]: the Mustang newspaper that was dedicated to the fire of the old building.

375
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:07,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a lot of pictures in there of that older building, including all of the damages.

376
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:15,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if you are thinking about an historical perspective, that might be interesting to include some of those pictures as well.

377
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: But just wanted to, I have that, so.

378
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,635
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

379
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:21,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually a ton.

380
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:31,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So long ago, when I first got really interested and kind of terrified, I went to the library.

381
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:38,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is like, I think, after I read the first, there was an SOI before this current one.

382
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:47,364
[SPEAKER_09]: After I read that one, I thought, well, you know, I need to get a better idea of kind of all the sort of relevant aspects.

383
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I went to the library and I spent hours in there.

384
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is phenomenal.

385
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:56,218
[SPEAKER_09]: how many press clippings they have and flyers.

386
00:38:57,058 --> 00:39:07,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can actually piece together the sequence of meetings, the community-wide decisions, a whole number of things.

387
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:13,252
[SPEAKER_09]: From press articles, there was like a Mercury, Medford Mercury.

388
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:13,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

389
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:25,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And I bet if you went to one of the librarians and asked for the folder that she had, well actually I don't know if we still have it, they definitely have the material.

390
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:29,664
[SPEAKER_09]: She handed me a folder, like she actually had a dedicated thing because I

391
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:31,623
[SPEAKER_09]: her ahead of time.

392
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:34,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told her I wanted to research the high school.

393
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And so she put this whole thing together.

394
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:37,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if she still has it.

395
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:42,427
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like the head of the head librarian.

396
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:48,288
[SPEAKER_09]: This is back when they were like the library, and they had all their materials on Boston Ave.

397
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:49,989
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had to go to Boston Ave.

398
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's thick.

399
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, six to eight inches thick.

400
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like this folder opens up.

401
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like clipping after clipping after clipping.

402
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:00,452
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of material there.

403
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:09,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

404
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:14,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

405
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:15,087
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

406
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:15,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

407
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:17,724
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

408
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:28,753
[SPEAKER_04]: The other sort of related communication piece for the eligibility phase, I thought, was during the application process.

409
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:40,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some notes from some of our various boards and commissions and people who applied who said, I also am on this board or commission in Medford.

410
00:40:40,663 --> 00:40:42,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you need to be connected to them.

411
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:52,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the other thing I'm interested in talking about from an engagement perspective is, who are those boards and commissions that we should be thinking about reaching out to?

412
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:59,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we maybe do some outreach to them to say, here's roughly what the process looks like.

413
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:18,479
[SPEAKER_04]: tell us what the, you tell us what the right time is to be connected to you, or have a conversation with us so we can figure that out, because I don't think everybody is going to be interested in all of the phases, but, you know, and there may be some commissions that are not

414
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:35,751
[SPEAKER_04]: so directly connected at all, but there may be, there are probably many that are connected and might want to sort of be starting to think about their place in this process as an independent commission from the school building committee.

415
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:42,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if maybe like our short-term approach is just to, you know,

416
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:55,286
[SPEAKER_04]: survey them separately with a separate set of questions, or if you all have any other thoughts about how we might engage with our boards and commissions.

417
00:41:57,386 --> 00:42:04,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes sense because I think my thought was like doing like a roadshow, but to your point, not everything is going to be relevant to everybody.

418
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:12,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also don't want to exhaust the resources of the volunteers, but you know, in a very long process.

419
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:21,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think finding out where, what are different commissions or maybe dial in or be interested in an update and then using folks to, you know, have like a,

420
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Decided upon presentation or something and having different representatives be there.

421
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:26,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

422
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:32,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we could do that in a way where it's not like, always, you know, Jenny Graham going to 16 meetings.

423
00:42:32,194 --> 00:42:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can have different volunteers from the committee go to different commissions and committees.

424
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:49,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, we certainly can develop a roadshow presentation that, you know, we can just like sort of pick it up off the shelf and and send somebody to the meeting, but they have like that assistive support.

425
00:42:49,061 --> 00:42:52,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that makes a lot of sense as well.

426
00:42:56,637 --> 00:43:14,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the board that I am on that's a summer camp board, we had done like a whole master planning exercise and we had created a like a roadshow presentation that we put on in a couple of different, like, you know, we announced it in a couple of different places to say like, oh, this one's going to be focused on that.

427
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,443
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's going to be focused on that.

428
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:19,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people either called in or showed up to those specific, um,

429
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,248
[SPEAKER_06]: presentations depending on whether or not they were interested.

430
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:34,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of us going out to 16 different locations, is there a way to bring people together, like four or five?

431
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:49,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So Marissa, are you thinking like we hold like, you know, a summer meeting or something that invites all of our boards and commissions to come in here, like an info presentation to sort of warm up?

432
00:43:49,414 --> 00:43:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean,

433
00:43:51,064 --> 00:44:09,732
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe or maybe there's like after the survey there's a way to kind of bring to cluster them together in a way that it's not 16 different presentations it's four presentations to like a differing number of people or a different number of groups okay

434
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we were thinking about surveying boards and commissions.

435
00:44:25,823 --> 00:44:36,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Does your board or mission have a topical interest?

436
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the right word?

437
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: A topical interest in the school building committee?

438
00:44:57,098 --> 00:44:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: That the right appeals clunky but

439
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple choice there just so we don't get a million different answers.

440
00:45:46,317 --> 00:45:47,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it topical or professional?

441
00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:05,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Do our boards and commissions have like a scope or like a charter or something?

442
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:09,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are explicitly outlined in the charter and others are ad hoc.

443
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:10,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

444
00:46:12,718 --> 00:46:16,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it maybe just like an overlapping interest?

445
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Marissa, can you repeat that again?

446
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it maybe, yeah, overlapping interest.

447
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:31,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, overlapping.

448
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking aligning interest or alignment.

449
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:38,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Something along those lines.

450
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think topical is just like, I heard about it.

451
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:41,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

452
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:41,881
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

453
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I like overlapping.

454
00:46:48,246 --> 00:46:51,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either overlapping and or aligned, right?

455
00:46:51,807 --> 00:47:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's probably, like I'm imagining we're gonna wanna talk to like the Bicycle Commission and Walk Medford and the Disability Commission.

456
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:09,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There's lots of them and they all have sort of different things that they probably wanna weigh in on and be part of.

457
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

458
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:26,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what is the best way to reach you?

459
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:33,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any questions for?

460
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

461
00:47:52,798 --> 00:47:58,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, other thoughts on like near range community engagement.

462
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:02,822
[SPEAKER_04]: The other things that I, I sort of been thinking about.

463
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:06,464
[SPEAKER_04]: There are like I said, last was it just last week.

464
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:13,253
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some things that are sort of the purview of the school committee to decide.

465
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:22,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, will we be going after expanded vocational programming?

466
00:48:23,138 --> 00:48:24,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, which ones?

467
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:28,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And that presentation is scheduled to come to the school committee, I believe, on the 20th.

468
00:48:31,024 --> 00:48:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's some overlap will certainly want to make sure that school building committee members know that that's happening.

469
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:43,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But that will inform the chapter 74 document that we need to fill out.

470
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:54,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we say yes, we want to have a new program and it needs to have this kind of capacity, it needs to go you know honor by honor chapter 74 form in order to be part of the process at all so.

471
00:48:55,397 --> 00:49:06,002
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some, I think some things like that, and Curtis Tufts, the co-location of Curtis Tufts, where we have some subcommittee meetings scheduled.

472
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:17,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other big topic where that might happen is when we talk about all of our early childhood programming and, you know, any sort of changes there, which I think the

473
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:35,996
[SPEAKER_04]: administration still sort of working through, but there are some things like that as well that like the way to, you know, sort of know what's going on is maybe not just like just tuning into the school building committee, but also there's some like topical things that are going to happen outside of that.

474
00:49:36,096 --> 00:49:42,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering if Thomas, maybe we need to think about

475
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:56,898
[SPEAKER_04]: framing some sort of like periodic update about those kinds of things into the superintendent's weekly memo so that if there is something like that where it's like sort of crossover related that we can describe it.

476
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:00,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

477
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:04,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the nice thing about the superintendent's weekly memo is that it hits

478
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,617
[SPEAKER_01]: every family in the district.

479
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:11,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So it covers our school community really well.

480
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not necessarily get to the wider community.

481
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:20,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I was just about to say that my children aren't old enough to be in school yet.

482
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:28,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we do not get that information, but I obviously have two young children and this is important to me.

483
00:50:28,288 --> 00:50:36,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And like a lot of the families that have asked me about this so far do not have kids that are old enough to be in school yet.

484
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:39,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So getting the information out, yeah.

485
00:50:39,654 --> 00:50:45,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we need to be creative about how to kind of

486
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,585
[SPEAKER_01]: collect that audience with time.

487
00:50:49,305 --> 00:50:59,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we create a separate mail list, Tom, for people who are specifically interested in school in the process?

488
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the pieces of functionality that our website has is that you can sign up for automatic updates when a news post is added.

489
00:51:08,976 --> 00:51:12,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could have that set up for just the building committee section too.

490
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:20,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would cover anything that we share in terms of meetings, press releases, updates.

491
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, we do have individuals sometimes sign up for the superintendent's memos and the other district news.

492
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:33,435
[SPEAKER_01]: through that, even if they don't have children in the system yet.

493
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, we'll want a list of some form.

494
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a question of how we gather it.

495
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:39,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

496
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa, did you have another question?

497
00:51:43,894 --> 00:51:44,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, yes.

498
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the main question, this kind of off of what we were talking about, but the biggest thing that people have been asking me also is what is the timeline?

499
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:10,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I know that we don't know the timeline because there's all these different things, there's so many factors involved in it, but is there a way that we can convey some type of like graphic representation of the timeline, similar to that little diagram that you had pulled out?

500
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:13,594
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, here's where we are and here's where we go next.

501
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:28,346
[SPEAKER_06]: that could be like circulated through the community so that people have a bit of an understanding about like what the steps are and what the overarching, like, you know, this could take six months or this could take a year.

502
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:39,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know if we want to pin any actual timeline, period of concrete time to it, but is there a way to visually represent this process?

503
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:44,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

504
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:47,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke?

505
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:57,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I just wanted to kind of make the caution, and I agree with a lot of what's been said.

506
00:52:57,928 --> 00:53:01,472
[SPEAKER_09]: We, in this phase of the process, need to be careful about not

507
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,672
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of cultivating the perception that we're making any promises for things.

508
00:53:08,113 --> 00:53:11,275
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to listen to everybody, but we're really, really early on.

509
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:22,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And there might be some things that we can't do or some things that are just, we don't want to give anybody the wrong idea.

510
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:23,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to listen.

511
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:25,284
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to collect.

512
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:30,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think in eligibility, that's important.

513
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:51,853
[SPEAKER_09]: To Marissa's point about how long it takes, no one's got a crystal ball, can't predict how much or how long this particular project is going to last and like our performance through the gates, but we certainly have a trove of evidence from other schools that have

514
00:53:52,884 --> 00:53:54,045
[SPEAKER_09]: conducted this process.

515
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:55,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's measurable.

516
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:56,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a little bit of effort.

517
00:53:56,768 --> 00:53:59,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually done some of it on my own.

518
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like a press releases.

519
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody announces when they're accepted.

520
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:07,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone announces when they move to the next phase.

521
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:09,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's just simple math.

522
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:18,227
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you do it across enough communities, you can sort of get a rough picture of how fast you can go through it if it's a pitch-perfect game and how long it could potentially go if there's

523
00:54:19,248 --> 00:54:23,731
[SPEAKER_09]: deep-rooted acrimony, because there's examples of both.

524
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:39,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, I mean, I don't know necessarily if we want to have that kind of data science result posted on our website, but it's certainly something that almost anybody could do.

525
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:41,205
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just,

526
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:46,308
[SPEAKER_09]: But it gets to sort of the making promises.

527
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:53,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you post the graph and the bell curve is like, we should get through this in seven years, then it almost implies that we're promising that.

528
00:54:53,816 --> 00:54:55,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just don't know.

529
00:54:55,718 --> 00:54:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to.

530
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I volunteer.

531
00:54:59,241 --> 00:55:03,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to help as much as I can so that we get as close to that as possible.

532
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:13,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we could probably create a pretty like simple and not grainy graphic.

533
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:22,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just copied and pasted them off of the MSBA website, but they're not even like in the MSBA website in such a way that it really lends to that in a high quality way.

534
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:27,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we could just create something pretty simple that would show people what the steps are.

535
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:31,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could just be like,

536
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:34,796
[SPEAKER_04]: here's where we are right now.

537
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:40,019
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here and we'll let you know when we go to the next step and whatever it is.

538
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:45,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that would be pretty simple to do without, I think to your point, like making promises.

539
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:57,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts about

540
00:55:58,058 --> 00:55:59,159
[SPEAKER_04]: community engagement.

541
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have like a really nice list here so far.

542
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's the option of attending community events or just I'm thinking like the farmers market or something doesn't have to obviously be every week, but just let people know this is happening and how they can learn more and get involved.

543
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:25,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the the.

544
00:56:26,707 --> 00:56:29,768
[SPEAKER_06]: if they do that summer concert series as well.

545
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,689
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like the family concert series.

546
00:56:31,729 --> 00:56:33,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a great place to have a little table.

547
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

548
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:39,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

549
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:40,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

550
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:42,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Share again.

551
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We can move on maybe to the next question.

552
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:46,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just keeping a list here.

553
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:51,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see my screen again?

554
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:53,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

555
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:54,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

556
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, any of the, forgetting what the like, not circle the square, but that's another one.

557
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:25,524
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another big fest down in the summer in Medford Square that the chamber puts on.

558
00:57:25,544 --> 00:57:27,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to remember what it is.

559
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:29,369
[SPEAKER_03]: The clippership lawn.

560
00:57:29,689 --> 00:57:30,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think either.

561
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it clippership day?

562
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:33,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.

563
00:57:34,011 --> 00:57:34,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of it.

564
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:36,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I ended up in the dunk tank one year.

565
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:37,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I remember.

566
00:57:37,332 --> 00:57:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put clippership day, but we can find it.

567
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:43,594
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

568
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:45,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that makes sense.

569
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:57,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last item on our agenda for tonight, and just applaud us in advance for moving

570
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:03,096
[SPEAKER_04]: amazingly fast through this agenda, because I know everyone has places to go and things to do.

571
00:58:03,216 --> 00:58:11,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the questions that we'll have to answer in the educational profile is this question.

572
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:19,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, describe the community outreach that has occurred to this point and any future plans and goals related to engaging the community on the Medford High School project.

573
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:26,883
[SPEAKER_04]: If considering grade reconfiguration, consolidation of facilities and or a change to the current teaching methodology,

574
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:33,147
[SPEAKER_04]: describe the outreach and discussions that have occurred to this point and any future plans to engage the community on the proposed changes.

575
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, indicate whether the district has determined whether or not override or debt exclusion might be required for full project funding.

576
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:52,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if we get sort of broad agreement on all the things that we described up above, that is our community engagement plan.

577
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:55,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can write a narrative that describes all of that.

578
00:58:58,442 --> 00:59:06,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe that we are considering grade reconfiguration or massive changes to the teaching methodology.

579
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:09,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, with those like few exceptions.

580
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:20,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can, in this section, we can point to those community discussions happening at school committee and those approvals here in terms of like other touch points of community engagement.

581
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And then,

582
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:30,242
[SPEAKER_04]: The final piece is indicating whether we've determined if we will need an override or a debt exclusion for full project funding.

583
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:34,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will check with the mayor, but I believe the answer is yes.

584
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this kind of project gets done without that.

585
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:45,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to put this question out there just to get the juices flowing and have you all think about anything that you want to add.

586
00:59:46,054 --> 00:59:46,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

587
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:51,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're on mute.

588
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to introduce a process check here.

589
00:59:56,419 --> 01:00:05,925
[SPEAKER_09]: These are specific what the grade reconfiguration consolidation facilities changed current methodology.

590
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:08,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a specific question from the profile.

591
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:08,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, no, no.

592
01:00:08,907 --> 01:00:15,652
[SPEAKER_09]: There are specific terms that I think probably appear in the SOI, and so whatever answers we come up with, we should cross check.

593
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:19,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the process check with yes, make sure it's consistent.

594
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:22,056
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

595
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:45,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

596
01:00:47,088 --> 01:00:48,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other thoughts.

597
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I also just wanted to make sure that we do have a member of the community on, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you wanted to contribute to the conversation, you're very welcome to do so.

598
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:16,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a small group, so we'd love to hear from you as well.

599
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:24,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably me.

600
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:25,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

601
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:26,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

602
01:01:26,738 --> 01:01:28,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm merely here as an observer.

603
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you calling it out.

604
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:33,163
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to respect the committee doing their process.

605
01:01:35,104 --> 01:01:38,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just checking in to see kind of what's happening here.

606
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all.

607
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:45,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all excited and anxious and looking forward to the best outcome here.

608
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:49,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will kind of fade to the back again and let you guys carry on.

609
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:51,597
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you all for your work in this space.

610
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:53,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

611
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:54,339
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are your littles now?

612
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:54,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

613
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:58,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I've got one little guy.

614
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,309
[SPEAKER_00]: He is in third grade.

615
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

616
01:02:02,233 --> 01:02:05,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, when I knocked on your door, he was like ready to go to kindergarten.

617
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Luke was his coach.

618
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:09,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, it's Logan, right?

619
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:11,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

620
01:02:12,557 --> 01:02:19,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, small world, of course, in Bedford here, but there are many who have a vested interest here.

621
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:26,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one who happened to have a couple of minutes tonight to sit in and listen to you guys do your work.

622
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:27,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all you're doing.

623
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:30,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

624
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa, did you have your hand in the air or did I hear you come off mute?

625
01:02:34,938 --> 01:02:36,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna make sure we didn't lose you.

626
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:38,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did it by mistake.

627
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:41,000
[SPEAKER_06]: All of my kids are running around all over the place.

628
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a little chaotic in the background.

629
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

630
01:02:48,282 --> 01:02:55,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go, I just wanna go back to the top and find out if there's anybody who wants to like spearhead any of these

631
01:02:57,114 --> 01:02:57,634
[SPEAKER_04]: items.

632
01:02:57,894 --> 01:03:21,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay if that's not immediately obvious, like I think some of the communication stuff Tom can work on on our behalf, but I didn't know if there was anything else that anybody was like, I definitely want to be involved in that project or that initiative, because if you do, we want to make sure that you can do that.

633
01:03:23,171 --> 01:03:34,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm happy to be tagged in as like a support for anything that's like explicitly comms related since that's my wheelhouse among other wheelhouses, but that's what I do during the day.

634
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you could help me with the roadshow presentation?

635
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:38,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

636
01:03:42,888 --> 01:03:51,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I am happy to help with graphics and like putting slides and presentations together or generating new imagery or anything like that.

637
01:03:57,372 --> 01:03:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

638
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

639
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there somebody who is interested in taking on, like, identifying these events where we might have some tables and some information?

640
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I could look at that, Jenny.

641
01:04:25,835 --> 01:04:26,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I could look at that.

642
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:44,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also thinking, and it's pretty specific, about if we're doing polls, we should probably be polling the faculty to get their input and to see what they think we should, what their suggestions are.

643
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:52,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to- That's a great point, especially where we actually know that we can get in touch with all the faculty too.

644
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:56,230
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a list we already have, which is great.

645
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I, you know, before this all got started, the principal, Principal Cabral asked me to come and do a presentation in one of her staff meetings.

646
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of those like choose your own adventure staff meetings where there are like many things going on and people could sort of pick how they wanted to use their time.

647
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:25,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that you're saying that Maria I remember that somebody was like, are you recording this, so that other people who aren't here, was it you.

648
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I said something like maybe I should give this a test run before I do a recording but.

649
01:05:34,106 --> 01:05:36,948
[SPEAKER_04]: To that point, I may reach out to Ms.

650
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Cabral again and see if she wants to host another one that we might record so that as we head into the summer that the folks who work in the building every single day have some sort of extra touch point.

651
01:06:01,226 --> 01:06:02,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say for myself, I'm willing to

652
01:06:03,311 --> 01:06:04,211
[SPEAKER_09]: about time.

653
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:07,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel obligated to devote time to helping where I can.

654
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:12,594
[SPEAKER_09]: But just like three kids on five soccer teams.

655
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:16,315
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real problem.

656
01:06:16,995 --> 01:06:23,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what I do, it needs to be time flexible.

657
01:06:23,197 --> 01:06:24,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I work on weekends.

658
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:32,280
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's things that can be done sort of, you know, at odd hours,

659
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:34,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to do those.

660
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:43,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I may not be available to sit at a table or attend a meeting, but certainly, you know, I want to pitch in.

661
01:06:46,554 --> 01:06:57,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Folks identify areas that, you know, involve research or writing something up, like we do on a Saturday, that would be most helpful.

662
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you feel about

663
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:08,631
[SPEAKER_04]: taking on the work of collecting these responses and when we get the survey responses back and trying to make some sense of them.

664
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:09,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

665
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some ideas for how to process that.

666
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:13,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

667
01:07:23,242 --> 01:07:23,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

668
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:25,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I did already.

669
01:07:25,985 --> 01:07:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

670
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you all want to chat about?

671
01:07:38,717 --> 01:07:39,097
[SPEAKER_04]: today?

672
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:49,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I just want to go back to a previous part of the discussion when we were talking about the library information that they had.

673
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:57,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember I'm remembering the names and look, it was probably Vicki that you worked with there, who gave you all that information, but she's gone.

674
01:07:58,024 --> 01:08:03,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And the person who she retired, the person who's there now, just for point of information, Zoe.

675
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:08,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoe, Zoe, if you wanted to add that.

676
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:14,449
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the reference librarian.

677
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:16,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Marie, I think you're right.

678
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:17,931
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ringing a bell.

679
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:20,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I've probably got her name written down somewhere.

680
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:27,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I walked out of there with a bunch of scanned images and things.

681
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Really helpful.

682
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,681
[SPEAKER_09]: She was wonderful.

683
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:34,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

684
01:08:36,084 --> 01:08:36,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

685
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:42,609
