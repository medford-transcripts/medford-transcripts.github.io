1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:05,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It is 6.34 p.m.

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:14,579
[SPEAKER_09]: on Tuesday, February 11th, 2025, and I'm calling to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,261
[SPEAKER_09]: We are meeting hybrid.

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:22,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of us are here in room 201 of City Hall, and some of us are joining in remotely.

6
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And anything else I need to cover in the preamble?

7
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:31,819
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to have to read a whole thing, but we don't anymore.

8
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,279
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't.

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:42,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, we are currently awaiting, just to talk about meetings going forward, we're currently awaiting, it's called the Municipal Empowerment Act.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Governor Healey just submitted it last

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:52,576
[SPEAKER_06]: couple Fridays ago, in that we're expected that this will become permanent hybrid, being able to have remote participation.

12
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So once that act is passed, then it will be permanently sealed that we can continue to meet hybridly.

13
00:00:58,421 --> 00:00:59,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

14
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,064
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

15
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:09,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing that we are going to do is to talk about a small grant application for the cross street

16
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:14,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Cemetery Headstone Restoration, and we have a guest here with us today.

17
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:18,380
[SPEAKER_09]: You can come and join us at the table so we can see you better in the owl.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ryan, introduce yourself and tell us about this project.

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Ryan Hayward from the Medford Historical Commission.

20
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I serve as the vice chair.

21
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:35,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on the board for 17 years now.

22
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy moly.

23
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:47,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And most recent project I've worked with the cemetery trustees on is the headstone assessment for Cross Street Cemetery.

24
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:47,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Medford's

25
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,648
[SPEAKER_01]: second cemetery after Salem Street Burying Ground.

26
00:01:52,548 --> 00:02:03,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It originally existed right outside of City Hall on the site of 93, moved it in 1956, and that was the last time they restored headstones.

27
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:16,580
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through last year with a consultant to prepare a conservation report that details a work on the 100 or so stones, and between now and

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:27,671
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come after large-scale funding to sort of take on most of the restoration work, we want to do like a small pilot project.

29
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:30,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a proposed $10,000 project.

30
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:37,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Continued collaboration with the Cemetery Trustees, Freedoms Way National Heritage Area gave us $2,500 towards this project.

31
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:52,895
[SPEAKER_01]: the historical commission committed to funding another $2,500 for this project so we're asking CPC to fund both the match for freedoms way grant which is a two-to-one match and then the be at the remaining project.

32
00:02:54,096 --> 00:03:00,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked with the consultants they're interested in bidding on the project work so and they're pretty confident that they can get it done by

33
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:05,704
[SPEAKER_01]: in accordance with Freedom's Way grant, which has to be done by September 1.

34
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:14,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very quick 15 stone max in our project that specifically focuses on the veterans located in the stone, in the cemetery.

35
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:15,946
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 15 of them.

36
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one stone that would bring it up to 16 that is missing.

37
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:24,608
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, most of the stones are there.

38
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:25,889
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in various degrees.

39
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Some just need simple cleaning.

40
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Other ones need full restoration.

41
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,470
[SPEAKER_01]: The consultants were pretty

42
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,511
[SPEAKER_01]: that event that we can do all of that for that $10,000 budget.

43
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ryan, the deadline for the Freedom's Way is February 19th?

44
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've already submitted it and actually we already have it in hand.

45
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have that in hand.

46
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:55,676
[SPEAKER_01]: The Historical Commission voted to allocate a match of $2,500 last night, so back to back now I'm here for hopefully what is going to be three for three.

47
00:03:58,933 --> 00:03:59,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

48
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there questions from committee members?

49
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:06,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much is actually being requested?

50
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,479
[SPEAKER_01]: $5,000 from CPC or a $10,000 project.

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,722
[SPEAKER_09]: That follows the rules of our smart grant application.

52
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:22,445
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask for a one-to-one match, at least one-to-one for any small grant.

53
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,488
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some newer members on the board, so I just want to make sure everybody understands.

54
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:29,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

55
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a couple of questions.

56
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:40,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So these 15 stones that you'll be able to treat with this grant, what proportion of the whole Cross Street Cemetery section is that?

57
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:50,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are 300 extant stones out of the 425 that were at the original cemetery site.

58
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that, 100 or so need

59
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:01,897
[SPEAKER_01]: large degrees of preservation, be it resetting or major conservation work, it's probably another 25.

60
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:08,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a tiny fraction of that.

61
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:14,541
[SPEAKER_01]: But the total conservation estimate for all of that work, all the 100 stones, came in at around $70,000.

62
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,741
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, we're chipping away at

63
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:23,543
[SPEAKER_01]: like one-seventh of the whole project cost.

64
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a little low.

65
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:29,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I told the consultants I would probably add a 25 percent contingency on top of that immediately.

66
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:37,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't include the outside perimeter wall that I'm working to get estimates on, but that just needed minor cleaning.

67
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:44,530
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a small project that gets her feet wet with the actual conservation work.

68
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,552
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I've seen it done.

69
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:49,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see it done down at Salem Street.

70
00:05:49,773 --> 00:06:07,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very labor intensive, but these stones, there's only one that's missing the top that may need reconstruction entirely if it's not there, but the rest of them are all extended in some way.

71
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:11,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Doug, did you magically appear because you had a thought that you wanted to speak or?

72
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:14,442
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just...

73
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,711
[SPEAKER_09]: just intuiting how Zoom works.

74
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:35,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also curious whether some of the work that just requires cleaning, is that something that volunteers can be trained to do, or is that really better to be done by professionals?

75
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:39,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would like to do with this project is to get the consultants on site.

76
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:44,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have to be done in a specific, gentle manner.

77
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:49,037
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I would like to do is to have the consultants on site to show us

78
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:59,164
[SPEAKER_01]: with this stone and to ask them what the materials are so that we can, in advance of doing large-scale work, clean all of the stones ourselves.

79
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:10,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good project for volunteers, you know, especially if we have some, say, mobile active senior citizens who want to come down, anybody that's interested in local history.

80
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself would be interested in cleaning a few.

81
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:18,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets it done in advance of the big project, which probably will happen in 2026.

82
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:23,361
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some large scale funding to just complete the whole thing.

83
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:36,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a possibility that we might try to tie some of that funding request in with the sort of the other project that's happening over at the original site, but that's sort of up in the air.

84
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:40,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be nice if we could get funding to do that, but it's not guaranteed.

85
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:42,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

86
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I guess 1 other question that I haven't.

87
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really appreciate kind of getting the big picture of, like, what your plans are around the site.

88
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:03,142
[SPEAKER_09]: The other question that I have is not related to this site, but any update on the archaeology of the original cross street cemetery site.

89
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:06,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a question that we don't talk about?

90
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still in the discovery phase of what the next steps are.

91
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:11,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

92
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:12,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

93
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the easiest way to put it.

94
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:15,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

95
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:16,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Just curious.

96
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:40,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to, I wasn't sure if we'll be asking CPC if there's any way to tap into project funding because it's not really a sort of a mitigation for a potential project, but it's also, I guess, historic preservation in a way, but you know, and I don't know what's planned for the site, but like, you know.

97
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:54,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it would be a worthwhile question to raise with like, just to ask around, you know, have other communities used CPA funds for that purpose?

98
00:08:57,054 --> 00:09:03,500
[SPEAKER_09]: And are there best practices around doing that?

99
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it would be like, if you had a specific question to share, I'd be willing to,

100
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:20,347
[SPEAKER_09]: reach out to the coalition, to reach out to other communities and ask whether this is something that they do with CPA.

101
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:32,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I mean, it would be new to us, but I can see how it has historic preservation value, but it also maybe doesn't qualify.

102
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

103
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:48,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's worthwhile to ask that question, because it is sort of a potential mitigation, but it's not covered under what you would traditionally think is linkage fees for the development project that's going to go on there.

104
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:54,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be interested to see it, because it's not qualified for linkage, whether it would qualify for preservation funding.

105
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can explore that.

106
00:09:58,668 --> 00:09:59,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Doug?

107
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a quick comment.

108
00:10:03,575 --> 00:10:07,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, I know that we're kind of at the beginning of the process.

109
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:13,437
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know how big a problem we have there next to City Hall, across from the parking lot.

110
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would be loathe to spend a ton of money, of Medford's own money, for a problem that we did not create 60 years ago.

111
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:30,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the state and the federal government really are on the hook for anything that has to happen there because they

112
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:35,100
[SPEAKER_04]: that they absolutely screwed it up if that's what actually happened.

113
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And the degree of the screw-up is still TBD right now, I think.

114
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:48,386
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would be hard-pressed for Medford residents to bail out the state who did something and got away with something awful decades ago.

115
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:51,327
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really good point.

116
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:57,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next question that I would have is, how would Medford

117
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: likely pursue a solution to that?

118
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:13,424
[SPEAKER_06]: We're currently just, I can speak to that lightly, that we are, again, still, sorry, I turned Teams off.

119
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,946
[SPEAKER_06]: We are still, again, exploring what the next steps are.

120
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:21,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an idea of what the next steps are, but we're waiting for very specific guidance on what to do with that site.

121
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:28,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, we are approaching our state representation to see if they can earmark money

122
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:33,341
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to our state representatives and saying essentially what you just said there.

123
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:38,226
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you help us fix a problem that was not the majority our faults?

124
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:42,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's about a point though that you make that.

125
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully that answers it for now.

126
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:49,355
[SPEAKER_06]: As more information is available to be shared, we absolutely will.

127
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate all of that background.

128
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

129
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,701
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a small grant

130
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,177
[SPEAKER_09]: request for $5,000.

131
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:05,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone want to make a motion to recommend $5,000 for this project?

132
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion.

133
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:15,543
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted, Doug.

134
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you're saying great things, Doug, but you are muted.

135
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,084
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's muted, right?

136
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:31,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make the motion to spend $5,000 for this small grant.

137
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't make a motion.

138
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard Ada.

139
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you want to second the motion?

140
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:42,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

141
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:44,758
Great.

142
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:47,199
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

143
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will call the roll.

144
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find it easier if I do this.

145
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:54,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Maisha.

146
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:57,286
Sorry.

147
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:57,486
Doug.

148
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:57,946
Yes.

149
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Reg.

150
00:12:58,526 --> 00:12:58,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

151
00:12:58,826 --> 00:12:59,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada.

152
00:12:59,227 --> 00:12:59,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

153
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

154
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:14,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

155
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:15,845
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you're welcome.

156
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:32,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so it's clear and maybe for the benefit of some of the other newer members in the future, the process from here on out is you guys will create a referral that then goes up the chain to city council for approval and then they have to approve it and then it comes back and we sign all the paperwork.

157
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking we're about a month out.

158
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,724
[SPEAKER_06]: To have funding in hand, I think a month is

159
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:41,636
[SPEAKER_06]: four to five weeks.

160
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to make it more on the four or five before it's signed.

161
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:48,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll go before city council on the 25th.

162
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:52,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not need to be there, but we can circle back on that.

163
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll be good to be there.

164
00:13:54,306 --> 00:14:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be good to be there, but, you know, they've annotated in the past that small grants like this, like, as long as we can present it.

165
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:05,655
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're unavailable, but if you're available, we'll hang out.

166
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:06,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

167
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:07,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

168
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,180
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

169
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:10,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?

170
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,441
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's fine.

171
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:12,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one.

172
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

173
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,723
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back for Thomas Brooks Park.

174
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:16,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

175
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:21,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so next on our agenda is to review the FY26 application process and materials.

176
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the meeting packet, I had linked to our application material is available to be printed, but it's largely online.

177
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:58,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the meeting packet, I had linked to all of our application materials that we used last year, including our small grant application, our full application, the eligibility determination form, as well as the budget form.

178
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:05,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully everybody got a chance to maybe peek at those, but I'm absolutely happy to pull them up here.

179
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:11,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you pull them up one at a time and then we can flip through them.

180
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:21,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to share my screen here.

181
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgive me, folks who are at home.

182
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a challenge to figure out how to make it so everybody in the room can see Zoom and the screen.

183
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate your patience here.

184
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:45,483
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully everybody's seeing the application.

185
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:51,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what we used, again, for our application around last year.

186
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So these dates are now moot, but they've been applied for last year.

187
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So is this the full application?

188
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,291
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the full application.

189
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:01,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you prefer to start chronologically, like maybe with the EDF?

190
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:04,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why don't we start with the EDF, actually?

191
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

192
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:06,637
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all good.

193
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I should have asked her why she started sharing.

194
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,227
[SPEAKER_06]: One day, we'll get really good at technology, folks.

195
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not today.

196
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,408
[SPEAKER_06]: You're better than most.

197
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:29,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody should be seeing the eligibility determination form.

198
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:31,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make this a little smaller here.

199
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:47,409
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so my first question is, since you are the person who has to hold the hands of everybody who applies, Teresa, do you have observations about things that are working or not working in these forms?

200
00:16:49,299 --> 00:17:01,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only challenge I run into as city staff when it comes to the eligibility determination form, which I'll give a quick rundown because, again, we have newer members, this is the first step in our application process.

201
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:12,939
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a way for us to have a quick synopsis of what the project is without forcing those poor folks to have to go through a whole application only at the end to find out that you can't apply.

202
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:18,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is just a very light lift on what your project is about.

203
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:24,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just overall project name, address, how much money you're looking for, who you are.

204
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:34,831
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and this is where I'm tying this back into, is this project on a city property?

205
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a city department?

206
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are you a residence, a nonprofit organization?

207
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that background here,

208
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The only issue I really ever run into is every now and then somebody will apply, and it's a well-meaning resident who may or may not understand the process here.

209
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug has his hand raised.

210
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:57,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, Doug.

211
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not seeing the form.

212
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:03,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing the list of attachments from the packet.

213
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:04,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a different screen?

214
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,416
[SPEAKER_05]: guys sharing it this way.

215
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that better, Doug?

216
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:17,759
[SPEAKER_10]: That is it.

217
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:18,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

218
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

219
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:21,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

220
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:24,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll quickly scroll here.

221
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So every now and then we'll get an eligibility determinant.

222
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:37,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only happened a couple of times where somebody who wants to see an improvement at a park, so they'll submit it this way, and it's not ready, it's not cooked, it's just an idea.

223
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would look at that as also an opportunity to be like, oh, somebody wants something.

224
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So we collect that information.

225
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:53,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only issue I really run into is just whenever people use this to share feedback rather than, no, I actually have a well thought out project.

226
00:18:54,563 --> 00:19:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually in Somerville created a form for that purpose, which I just called a screening form.

227
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:07,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So it asked some of the same questions at the beginning.

228
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,302
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of project is it?

229
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:38,330
[SPEAKER_09]: like what describe what you're thinking and then tell us tell me your name um and your email so i can get in touch with you and that's the whole purpose of the form is for me to get back in touch so i i didn't i don't know if that would be useful for you but that was how i handled that i mean if the edf accomplishes the same thing then okay i like that the one that says um

230
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me scroll down just a little bit.

231
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

232
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,473
[SPEAKER_03]: CPA program area.

233
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:45,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

234
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we put that at the top?

235
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:48,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

236
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:54,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I say that, right, is because if it doesn't qualify under those three categories... That's a good idea.

237
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,199
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to go any further.

238
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,700
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good point.

239
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

240
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:00,961
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

241
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:01,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

242
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:04,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that just says everything.

243
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:08,359
[SPEAKER_03]: In a nutshell, you know, it's a good point.

244
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:16,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't qualify by, you know, by these three categories, then you're not eligible for CPA fund.

245
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:21,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they're kind of like the word recreation.

246
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we need new basketballs at the high school.

247
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:32,610
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like that's vague enough that it wouldn't necessarily like, it doesn't tell you everything, but it does like immediately.

248
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It focuses your idea.

249
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it has to be on one of these four things.

250
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:36,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

251
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:41,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to harken, I'll come right back to this.

252
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I am about to launch our survey.

253
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:48,048
[SPEAKER_06]: for residents to get feedback on CPA.

254
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:58,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I did do in the specific program area questions is I put examples of past, like, hey, we did, you know, Glastead Park basketball courts.

255
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,572
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an example of open space and recreation.

256
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:04,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put some visuals with it too.

257
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be a benefit in here too, is just to make it less text, more visual.

258
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So theoretically,

259
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:18,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Recreation should be under open space in parentheses.

260
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:24,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't really fund recreation.

261
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:30,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Not per se, not the way, not by the definition that most people.

262
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Of Medford, yes.

263
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You understand what I'm saying?

264
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.

265
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:41,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you put open space and then parentheses, recreation and whatever other category falls under open space.

266
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:43,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Just outdoor recreation.

267
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

268
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:46,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

269
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think that's the right edit that needs to happen.

270
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:50,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

271
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:51,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

272
00:21:53,402 --> 00:22:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason why they have been kept separately is because if we go back to the Department of Revenue matrix of allowed uses, there's a slight difference between open space and the recreation category.

273
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,735
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's for us to know.

274
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:15,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not necessarily something that we have to force them to be like public.

275
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:15,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

276
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:20,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like recreation as a category.

277
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:25,846
[SPEAKER_06]: you might think that that would include like artificial turf, so recreation facility amenity.

278
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: According to DOR, we cannot use CPA funds for artificial turf.

279
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:34,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why it's a little bit separated just because they have rules.

280
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:46,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had it be explained to me at some point, and I don't know if I would agree with this, but it was explained that you have to treat an urban farm different from a community garden.

281
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:59,187
[SPEAKER_09]: even though they're essentially the same thing, but farm falls in one place in that matrix and community garden falls in a different place in the matrix and different things are allowed.

282
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:06,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it gets like, we can't put all of those considerations in our form.

283
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,571
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it has to come to us and then we'll tell you whether we think it's eligible or not.

284
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just wanted to see.

285
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:19,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think for the sake of this, we can combine them and that would make it easier.

286
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:28,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And then adding in some sort of examples would also be helpful to maybe deter the, and again, I don't wanna deter the residents who are confused.

287
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I still would love that information, but yeah.

288
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So you being the gatekeeper, okay, what would be your suggestion?

289
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think to me, I want to have as much paired down

290
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,419
[SPEAKER_03]: as I possibly could.

291
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I actually really love Roberta's suggestion of what they do in Somerville is that screening tool.

292
00:23:52,523 --> 00:24:06,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems it's a little bit more pared down than this because that's just, you know, I think implementing that would be beneficial here because then it weeds it out and then we get to this point.

293
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:16,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have... I've actually made my EDF longer so that I'm asking more questions on the EDF, but the screening form is short and sweet.

294
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:21,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

295
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Project status.

296
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes.

297
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:34,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, this is just whatever, but project summary.

298
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really have any guidance there.

299
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:43,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be an opportunity to have some suggested information here.

300
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:56,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually on the EDFs, this section is never really too long, but project summary and product status could be maybe beefed up a little bit.

301
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:12,761
[SPEAKER_09]: So when it comes to the additional attachments and an issue that I've run into in Somerville that hasn't happened in Medford yet, but I. I wonder whether it could happen so.

302
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:23,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in Medford, we've never had a situation where a private property owner applied for a project on their property.

303
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:24,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Not yet.

304
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:24,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Not yet.

305
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:25,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I know one's coming though.

306
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,204
[SPEAKER_09]: One is coming, okay.

307
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:36,307
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that private, and actually we did have an EDF submitted once years ago, and they never got to the full application stage.

308
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:44,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that private property owner was a condominium association,

309
00:25:45,233 --> 00:26:03,541
[SPEAKER_09]: then it adds layers of complication which are like I'm kind of dealing with right now because we let them get all the way to the end of the process and now I don't know whether we can put conditions on their project and have those be approved by the condo association.

310
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:08,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm asking for attachments for

311
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:14,246
[SPEAKER_09]: letters of consent if you're partnering with another own property owner.

312
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,467
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a co-applicant.

313
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:20,050
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a co-applicant or if there's a condominium association you also need to have.

314
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,451
[SPEAKER_09]: You're specifically calling that one out?

315
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:24,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a condo association should have a letter of consent.

316
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:33,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we haven't dealt with it here, but theoretically it could happen.

317
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,520
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of addressed it in this

318
00:26:36,773 --> 00:27:04,446
[SPEAKER_09]: statement here the documentation of properties owner support but that could be reworded to include consent not support yeah that's different consent and call out condo association specifically because if they don't see their see their category in there they might not think it applies to them and they just don't pay attention to it scrolling up for a second to project summary which is vague and it sounds like you're not getting great answers so

319
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:14,896
[SPEAKER_07]: goal or project mission statement or something that just asks for like a one-sentence like hit us with your elevator pitch.

320
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:23,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe keep project summary but then put like oh we have extra down here like include goals and mission statement or something like that.

321
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

322
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

323
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:33,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see also somebody if it just said goals somebody be like to make Medford better you know which is great but not

324
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll add that.

325
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:40,190
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

326
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:47,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments about the EES?

327
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:51,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the... It really does not seem that long.

328
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like it would take five minutes to fill out.

329
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:55,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

330
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

331
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,605
[SPEAKER_06]: The application itself.

332
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll go ahead and pull up the full application.

333
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

334
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: which is this one.

335
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And drag it.

336
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:18,371
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are awesome.

337
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:23,456
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to do that for me, are you?

338
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,178
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

339
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should be seeing the full application.

340
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Light blue.

341
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:31,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

342
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Doug.

343
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:34,046
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

344
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:50,761
[SPEAKER_08]: name, location, funding request, CPA program area, project summary, which is the same question, and the applicant's information.

345
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:59,380
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only, you've already taken care of the fact that the amount of funding requests should be right up at the top.

346
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

347
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:01,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it last year.

348
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you said, hey, I want it at the top last year.

349
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you would print them, it garbles it up.

350
00:29:07,524 --> 00:29:14,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe there's a setting in there that it creates a report and it thinks that it belongs further down in the report.

351
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

352
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:19,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I also am not a huge fan of Smartsheet, but that's what the city uses.

353
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to explore using

354
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:24,954
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps JotForm, which is a unit, I think you use it in Somerville.

355
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:28,195
[SPEAKER_06]: CDBG uses it for their application.

356
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:32,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just more user-friendly on the front end, back end.

357
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:40,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, yes, somehow it will be one of the first things on this report there, because it's, who are you?

358
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:41,622
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money do you want?

359
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now let's stop.

360
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:54,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when we're reviewing the applications like that's the first thing that we want to know Exactly what you said, who are you and how much money do you want?

361
00:29:54,991 --> 00:30:07,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So describe the project so this is This first question is very similar to the project summary I was just thinking that yeah, that's up here.

362
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:10,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah so we could

363
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:19,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at this point, if you're filling out this application, you've already filled out an EDF, the eligibility form, and I've approved it.

364
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:20,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been approved.

365
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:22,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe just strike it.

366
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

367
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:30,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

368
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:35,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And they want to cut and paste the project summary into the first question here under project narrative.

369
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:37,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't complain.

370
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this project needed?

371
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:47,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question, I think.

372
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:56,800
[SPEAKER_09]: How does the project meet general and category-specific priorities?

373
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:05,107
[SPEAKER_09]: A question I have is, are we getting useful answers from applicants on this question?

374
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:14,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the city departments will go and copy-paste information from the CPP, the preservation plan.

375
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:32,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Our at-large or non-city applicants usually do a fair job at it, but some of them, we've definitely had applicants, this is the first time they've ever written a grant, so there's a little bit of greenness to it.

376
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the time, we get pretty

377
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:37,572
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty fair answers on this.

378
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

379
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:39,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a huge issue.

380
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:40,413
Okay.

381
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Scope and budget.

382
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:44,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

383
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:47,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, I think, as I was looking at this, it might be helpful to link.

384
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:48,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

385
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:49,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

386
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:49,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

387
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So, link to CPP.

388
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll add that for the next iteration.

389
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:56,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Great idea.

390
00:31:57,842 --> 00:31:58,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Scope and budget.

391
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:04,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sent you, like, so, I noticed that

392
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:14,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere I saw an example of something that you had set up that really had the summary and detail on one page.

393
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:18,886
[SPEAKER_09]: It was probably the handout I had for city council, maybe?

394
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Might have been.

395
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:27,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just formatted a version that has summary and detail on one page.

396
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:28,308
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

397
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,099
[SPEAKER_09]: and send that to you so you could use that.

398
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:49,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think like where we have the steps one and two, we can consolidate that to one so that we make it easier for them, that we get all the detail that we need, but they only have to fill out one form.

399
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:51,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so not necessarily.

400
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, then the total project cost?

401
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

402
00:32:56,178 --> 00:33:00,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people understand what to fill in those two lines?

403
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:08,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I have gotten a couple of confusing answers on this, and I've had to reach back out and say like, hey, just wanted to clarify.

404
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:12,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, both times were city department folks.

405
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say the non-city folks applying tend to get this one pretty well.

406
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been one person.

407
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:21,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I wonder,

408
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:32,674
[SPEAKER_09]: If the attachment gives us the correct information, should we just eliminate that error by eliminating the question?

409
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:36,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm going to pull up the budget sheet and hopefully it will.

410
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody can see this.

411
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:43,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I shared the application.

412
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is the summary version.

413
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

414
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:56,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would give you the answer to that question, if they fill this out correctly.

415
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:57,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

416
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:09,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is how I've been able to see like, you ask for $100,000 and then the total project costs, including all non-CPA funds is $100,000.

417
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:13,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But then on your budget sheet, you say you've got a $300,000 grant.

418
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:16,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where I've been able to sleuth out.

419
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:17,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

420
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:17,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

421
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:31,037
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, if this is confusing to people, we might cut those questions, as long as the information comes to us in the attached form.

422
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:31,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

423
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:33,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

424
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:34,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

425
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:36,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's easier.

426
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all for streamlining.

427
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see a need for redundancy.

428
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:40,622
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

429
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:41,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

430
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:46,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at the end of the day, you don't need them to write the same thing two separate places.

431
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:49,067
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need the one budget they produce to be good.

432
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:49,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

433
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:50,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

434
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:53,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, at this point, we're asking for it in three different places.

435
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:56,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at the top, we're asking, how much is your CPA funding?

436
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking here, and we're asking for a budget sheet.

437
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:02,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we're suggesting just to strike this whole area.

438
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:06,015
[SPEAKER_06]: But keep like the, hey, you must do this.

439
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:06,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

440
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,037
[SPEAKER_06]: But just strike the... Strike those two questions.

441
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:14,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's keep the detailed outline of tasks.

442
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,082
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like one of the most critical questions that they never answer.

443
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:24,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening, but can you repeat yourself?

444
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:32,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I said strike the two questions total project cost and CPA funding request, but keeps the detailed outline of tasks.

445
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:35,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the most critical question that they never answer correctly.

446
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:36,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

447
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,989
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a fact.

448
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

449
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:45,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I also do like this question.

450
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps us to prepare for if there's future requests.

451
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:49,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

452
00:35:51,925 --> 00:36:04,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know like it's a quite sometimes we just have to ask it verbally because I was like what Ryan just told us that in the big picture they're looking at $100,000 project that helpful.

453
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:05,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

454
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is just the first phase of that like that's what I want people to tell us in that.

455
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:18,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ryan's particularly, well the whole entire historical commission, but Ryan's really the grant writer.

456
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,133
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always good at trying to find a small change here and there.

457
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: He's constantly shaking the couch cushions up, so I can appreciate his approach to it.

458
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:34,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So describe, so then the next question, describe successful and unsuccessful attempts to secure funding.

459
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:40,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so it was really helpful that verbally Ryan just told us that, um, we're.

460
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:49,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the state delegation to try to get an earmark to take care of that, but we don't know if we're going to get that yet.

461
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:49,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

462
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the kind of information that I would love for them to give us in that.

463
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:59,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say we haven't looked at the small grant application yet, but.

464
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:10,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Since just to explain those, he probably would have answered and given that information, but our small grant application is a much more string dense and streamlined version.

465
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, I don't believe those questions are on there.

466
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:13,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, probably.

467
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:21,422
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, that's an example of how, like, why those questions are in there and what we want them to tell us.

468
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:27,101
[SPEAKER_09]: If the funding is not available, can this project be phased or reduced in scale?

469
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:36,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's also exactly what we just learned about this project, how they're going to be phasing it.

470
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:43,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so describe the applicant.

471
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:50,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we should set up some logic to eliminate that question if the city is the applicant.

472
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:55,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

473
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:05,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that city departments just usually say, like, city department, they keep it very, it's not a huge lift for them.

474
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:10,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can add some logic.

475
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:20,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Just identify, so, I mean, I don't know, it depends on how much time you want to spend with logic, because then the next question, identify and describe the roles of known participants.

476
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:22,765
[SPEAKER_09]: What I do want to know from the city is,

477
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Which departments are going to be involved in this project?

478
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:33,394
[SPEAKER_09]: And what is the contact person who is responsible in each department?

479
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:39,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be a separate set of questions for the city than for non-city applicants.

480
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sorry to bounce around for folks at home.

481
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying, I thought that there was a bit about that specifically.

482
00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:58,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking on the city authorization form.

483
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,319
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not a city department, who's your contact?

484
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

485
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so add something in here.

486
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:10,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe do you want to call out specifically city departments?

487
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:17,203
[SPEAKER_09]: If the applicant is a city department, then you have a set of questions for city departments.

488
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:22,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the applicant is not a city department, then you ask, how do you know?

489
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:25,954
[SPEAKER_08]: what you're doing.

490
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So that might lead to editing.

491
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:42,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this question.

492
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:49,189
[SPEAKER_09]: That third question might, you know, be for organizations and not the city.

493
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:53,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

494
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:58,758
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, and.

495
00:40:00,379 --> 00:40:00,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And so.

496
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:01,060
[SPEAKER_11]: The.

497
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Feasibility so.

498
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:25,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Then are both of those two feasibility questions, how well do you think applicants understand their questions?

499
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they giving us quality answers?

500
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually get pretty quality answers here, especially on the first one.

501
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: ADA and MAAB regulations are kind of

502
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:45,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say standard, but if you're in the game, those are recognized.

503
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:50,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually the secondary question where people like... What is that?

504
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:51,427
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

505
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, maybe that's an opportunity to link.

506
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:04,214
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one, the secondary, the historic preservation projects, secondary and interior standards question, that can trip people up a little bit.

507
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:04,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

508
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:15,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it's a well-written question.

509
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:20,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's a subject matter that if people aren't familiar with it, they raise an eyebrow.

510
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think maybe just linking to it might be.

511
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I think linking to it is the right thing.

512
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Go straight to the website and people can figure it out.

513
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:30,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually not that complicated once you actually know where it is.

514
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:31,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

515
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:32,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

516
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:44,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is an area where your process is going to be very different from some of those process for how to ensure compliance.

517
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:44,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

518
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:55,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And like when I keep it's just valuable that we even have the question because they might not know that there are standards that they have to meet.

519
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:55,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

520
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:58,976
[SPEAKER_09]: You might not know that there are standards we have to meet.

521
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,396
[SPEAKER_09]: They might.

522
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:13,829
[SPEAKER_09]: give you know just want to you know have somebody carry out the project who doesn't know anything about historic preservation.

523
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:15,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Chuck in a truck it's a lot of work man.

524
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:29,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it also might be good here to say call out something specific about like if you are seeking historic preservation funding you will also be required to put a preservation restriction.

525
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:30,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be another

526
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in our contract, we always mention it verbally, but it might be another reinforcement thing here to iterate that and a preservation restriction again for the folks who are new.

527
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:50,907
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's a legally binding document that we recorded the registry of deeds that carries with the property that prevents it from.

528
00:42:52,883 --> 00:43:10,565
[SPEAKER_09]: here's a suggestion um do so i assume that medford has some kind of um general conditions attached to our contracts so if we make a gen like the general conditions into a pdf and then we also have um

529
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:31,452
[SPEAKER_09]: like we can have a checklist saying I understand that my project will have to abide by these general conditions and I understand and that's one check and then another check is I understand that my project may be required to a

530
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:36,656
[SPEAKER_09]: have a historic preservation restriction or a local historic district.

531
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

532
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:43,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I mean, again, it's in our contract, but it might be nice to have somebody like physically need to checkbox it.

533
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:43,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

534
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:43,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

535
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

536
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:57,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Teresa, what are you finding based on your and Daniel's experience that what the track record is in the timeframe for people getting preservation restrictions who don't have them at the beginning of the process?

537
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:59,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any kind of metric there?

538
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:03,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you, Doug, years.

539
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:18,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So first we have a process, like first we have to go through the process of drafting it and going through our legal channels to have a draft instrument.

540
00:44:19,212 --> 00:44:24,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we send that draft instrument to the state for their pre-approval.

541
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And that can take

542
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:30,614
[SPEAKER_09]: getting the preapproval can take a few years.

543
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:39,120
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once you have the preapproval back from the state, then you start having all of the different parties execute it.

544
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And how long does it take you to put that on the city council agenda and the historical commission agenda and get

545
00:44:49,851 --> 00:45:10,568
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the city councilors, historic commission chair and mayor to have their notarized signatures on it and the grantee have their notarized signature on it and then you send it back to the state and they stamp it and send it back to you and then you can take it to the registry of deeds.

546
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:15,283
[SPEAKER_04]: In which case your project has been complete for three years, right?

547
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:22,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we ought to actually say something like that because it's effectively, it's an intent, not an actual requirement.

548
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:28,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally, if they completely renege on it, say,

549
00:45:36,724 --> 00:45:53,016
[SPEAKER_09]: say we've given a grant to a property owner to restore their windows, and they have not recorded a preservation restriction yet, and they turn around and put in a request to demolish their building.

550
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:59,740
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have this in the contract, even though we can at least

551
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:05,058
[SPEAKER_09]: like take them to court and make them pay us back the CPA funds.

552
00:46:06,078 --> 00:46:10,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'm just trying to think of what could be the worst case scenario that happens in the future.

553
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:14,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not suggesting we take it out of the contract.

554
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:21,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to kind of give people who may not understand what it is a sense of the time scale involved in this.

555
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real commitment, but obviously we're pretty loose on enforcing it because

556
00:46:28,212 --> 00:46:42,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either two to four years, depending on your dexterity with bureaucracy at state and local levels and ability to move that forward.

557
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:55,852
[SPEAKER_09]: What we, I'm just speaking from Summerville's experience, because we're a couple steps ahead of Medford in implementing this.

558
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:13,178
[SPEAKER_09]: We have had, so we have been just giving out the grants on the trust that they're going to file the preservation restrictions at the registry.

559
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:16,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have had some grantees who are non-compliant

560
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:19,699
[SPEAKER_09]: But they aren't trying to tear their buildings down.

561
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:21,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not a big problem.

562
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:28,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But so we have had to just go ahead and give the funds without first getting the condition met.

563
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:35,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And that makes our law department a little bit nervous because they don't like the fact that we have grantees noncompliant.

564
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:41,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've actually given me an alternative set of conditions to have in Somerville.

565
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:50,046
[SPEAKER_09]: which is that we put a term limited preservation restriction on those properties.

566
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:55,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that doesn't have to get approved by the state.

567
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can do that on our own timeline.

568
00:47:57,231 --> 00:48:01,855
[SPEAKER_09]: We can just have a template ready to go and get it executed right away.

569
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:10,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And then be able to give them the, have that be recorded at the registry before giving them any money.

570
00:48:11,032 --> 00:48:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have a covenant that says that the permanent deed restriction has to be filed within 10 years.

571
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:23,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the permanent deed restriction isn't filed after 10 years, you have to give us back the money.

572
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:27,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Why give them such a long time period to do it?

573
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:33,389
[SPEAKER_09]: To give plenty of time to cover up for.

574
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,352
[SPEAKER_09]: So the temporary one is already in place.

575
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:46,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But the 10 years gives them all the possible time to cover up for any delays in the process that are out of their control.

576
00:48:47,665 --> 00:48:51,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So say the state on average takes two years, but maybe they take five.

577
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:55,888
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is, I thought the 10 years was for them even just like applying.

578
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:58,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

579
00:48:59,184 --> 00:49:02,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, that was just how Somerville is solving the problem.

580
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:06,795
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is that if we waited until they had it recorded before we gave them any funds.

581
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:25,840
[SPEAKER_09]: then we might as well not have historic preservation grants because the building is already falling down before we can actually.

582
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:26,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to do that.

583
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:32,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like your idea of the term limit thing just because it does move the process faster and it's reasonable.

584
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about it though, we're in year 6 or 7 now and after 10 years, the entire board could have turned over.

585
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:46,844
[SPEAKER_04]: the coordinator could have turned over a few times as it has.

586
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:54,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The history might be lost unless it's pretty front and center, making sure we don't lose that.

587
00:49:54,847 --> 00:49:59,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a covenant that gets lost in time.

588
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:06,972
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd have to have a way of keeping track of properties that we hold deed restrictions for.

589
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:12,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It's recorded in the registry, but what is the trigger to know that something has

590
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:18,648
[SPEAKER_09]: come up for development that has a deed restriction.

591
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:25,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's a possibility.

592
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:29,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something like, this is a question that gets really boring to talk about.

593
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:33,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really deep in the weeds until the day comes that you need to make a decision.

594
00:50:33,574 --> 00:50:42,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all of a sudden, it's that thing that makes your three-hour meeting go to five hours, trying to figure out is this

595
00:50:43,844 --> 00:50:49,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what kind of conditions do we put on properties, so I've been working over.

596
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:57,837
[SPEAKER_09]: at my job trying to create some guidelines and have people agree to guidelines.

597
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:10,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just takes several bites at the apple, several different steps in the process to talk about what kind of restrictions, what kind of conditions are we going to put on historic preservation.

598
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:13,932
[SPEAKER_09]: But then like that comes down to the application of

599
00:51:16,603 --> 00:51:30,647
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that the applicants know up front what's gonna be asked of them so that they agree to that and then don't turn around and say, oh, thank you for the money, but no, we don't, we're not interested in a preservation restriction.

600
00:51:33,768 --> 00:51:34,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

601
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:40,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we had any instances where this has happened in Medford?

602
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Yes, no, maybe, don't know.

603
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,822
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of actually securing a preservation restriction.

604
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:52,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have in the past.

605
00:51:53,304 --> 00:52:01,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Recipients that have received historic preservation funding, we have made it a condition that they must have a preservation restriction reported.

606
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:05,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them have already had that in place through other means.

607
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're already.

608
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:13,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Protected under that restriction, like Grace Church and Unitarian Universalist, they already had some sort of a restriction.

609
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:19,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Brooks Estate has a preservation restriction and the Royal House has a preservation restriction.

610
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:27,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the past grantees have already, that's already in place, but a couple of them where it's a work in progress currently.

611
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering, I mean,

612
00:52:30,468 --> 00:52:40,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Historic preservation is, you know, we do usually the third and third and third, you know, for our payouts and so on and so forth.

613
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:43,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

614
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:56,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering how many would actually fall into this category who would not have known that there is a requirement, because if you are a historical entity, if you will,

615
00:52:57,623 --> 00:53:04,128
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably already know that the process to get anything done takes quite some time.

616
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:13,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, some are still newer to owning a historic building and still learning all the various minutiae, yeah.

617
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the most part, they're informed at least.

618
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:25,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering, you know, we're spending a lot of time on this.

619
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:28,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good topic.

620
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:38,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it doesn't come up that often, and if the applicants who do utilize that particular session

621
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:45,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually know by the time they get to us, right?

622
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:56,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the ones who already have preservation restrictions are usually the owners or the organizations that have

623
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,651
[SPEAKER_09]: buildings, historic buildings, and they're very familiar.

624
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:07,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're the high capacity people, the ones who already have a preservation restriction.

625
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:15,083
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones who are very new at this and don't know what they're doing are the ones whose buildings are most unprotected.

626
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:25,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're trying to protect them by requiring that our money comes with some form of protection.

627
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think.

628
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, are we creating a problem that should be somebody else's problem?

629
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:49,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just asking because I'm struggling with this.

630
00:54:49,805 --> 00:55:00,390
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have dedicated staff in this building whose majority of their job is historic planning, preservation efforts in general.

631
00:55:00,411 --> 00:55:05,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So we end up being, in particular, we end up being the de facto

632
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,815
[SPEAKER_06]: advocate for historic preservation.

633
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:20,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hear what you're saying, that are we creating a problem, but we're also essentially at this point unofficially the watchdog for these type of- We're trying to get ahead of a potential problem.

634
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus we want to protect our investment.

635
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to protect the residents' investments too.

636
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to protect the building, but also our investment at the same time.

637
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And this vehicle is the best way to do that.

638
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:35,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wonder which question would be the most

639
00:55:36,278 --> 00:55:53,938
[SPEAKER_06]: appropriate that's that's all i'm saying you know um i just think we should do a better job uh making it very clear from the beginning that if you want this money if you want this investment this is a requirement so i think we just flag it in in this section right i think that will suffice

640
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And then maybe you'll ask, well, what's a preservation restriction?

641
00:55:57,882 --> 00:55:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And it opens up a door for a conversation.

642
00:55:59,763 --> 00:56:04,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the question that the cursor is on right now is a good question, just as it is.

643
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:14,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe we need to add an acknowledgment section later on that acknowledges that they know what we're going to ask of them if they take our money.

644
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:20,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds a little bit more

645
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:49,148
[SPEAKER_03]: user-friendly, if you will, because I'm trying to be the applicant, you know, I'm trying to look at this as an applicant and whether it be, you know, any one of the categories that we fund, you know, so if I'm a historic guy or entity, if you will, I would want to, you know, have as much information right there so that I don't come to you looking like

646
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:51,279
[SPEAKER_03]: making the dance.

647
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

648
00:56:54,362 --> 00:56:55,483
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

649
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:56,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And party discussion.

650
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:57,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

651
00:56:57,886 --> 00:56:58,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

652
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:03,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to put in an addendum at the bottom to acknowledge, you know, if you do.

653
00:57:08,332 --> 00:57:12,077
[SPEAKER_03]: apply for historical preservation funds.

654
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:19,246
[SPEAKER_03]: There are logical steps that you have to take, A, B, C, D, or whatever, however many you want to put in there.

655
00:57:19,266 --> 00:57:26,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So that eliminates an awful lot of stuff for you, and it eliminates a lot of stuff for us as a committee, too.

656
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:36,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to blow up that discussion, but as you were talking, I was thinking, well, technically, we also can require conservation restrictions for open space acquisition.

657
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:42,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can also require affordable housing covenants for housing development.

658
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:52,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I can wordsmith something that says to the tune of, you may be required to put a property restriction recorded at the deed for any project.

659
00:57:53,415 --> 00:58:02,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you come to us and say, hey, Teresa, I really want to update the playground at Logan Park or whatever, we wouldn't force a conservation restriction there.

660
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:17,484
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you came to me saying, hey, I want to buy this open space land, somebody is selling off five acres, which never happens in Medford, but that would we would require a conservation restriction for it to maintain open space and perpetuity.

661
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:17,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

662
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So so we've got a restriction for every

663
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:22,692
[SPEAKER_06]: every one of our three categories.

664
00:58:22,752 --> 00:58:34,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll just make it... So you can make a general statement saying that, you know, for each one of these categories there... You may be subject to a restriction that's recorded on your part.

665
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:46,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just add that I actually put those acknowledgments on the EDF rather than the full application so that if they aren't going to agree to it, they don't go through this effort of doing all this.

666
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's probably the place to put it.

667
00:58:51,713 --> 00:58:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So that the gatekeeper over there can keep the gate.

668
00:58:58,196 --> 00:58:59,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on the EDF, that's a great idea.

669
00:59:00,197 --> 00:59:00,458
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

670
00:59:00,618 --> 00:59:07,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And so then the next question, the feasibility checklist, how well is this working in your experience?

671
00:59:07,161 --> 00:59:17,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I like having this here, but it's not really applicable to city departments.

672
00:59:17,566 --> 00:59:18,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, logic can help that.

673
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:20,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Logic can help that.

674
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:29,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I can add that in there, so it would be more applicable for your non-city entities.

675
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:38,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just a way for us to understand the full scope of the project, as well as help them understand the full scope of the project.

676
00:59:38,723 --> 00:59:44,566
[SPEAKER_06]: That you might be coming to us wanting to do this, but are you aware that you're going to need engineering to look at that?

677
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:48,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might mean a plot plan, and that might mean extra budget for you.

678
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is helpful for the non-city entities, but to Roberta's point, I can add logic here so that this gets skipped for city departments.

679
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:07,384
[SPEAKER_06]: The environmental assessment one, I like having that one in there, actually even for city departments.

680
01:00:07,844 --> 01:00:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they're like, oh, I want to do this over and it's like 50 feet from the river.

681
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can't, or you need permissions.

682
01:00:16,315 --> 01:00:26,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So overall, it's not helpful for 75% of our applications, but for those 25%, it's very helpful.

683
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: So logic will help that.

684
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:29,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, think about that.

685
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:30,542
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

686
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:41,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would encourage you to review the list of attachments and think about which ones do you actually want

687
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,661
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe all of them.

688
01:00:46,142 --> 01:01:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But in your experience of putting together the applications to share with us what is actually useful and not.

689
01:01:02,614 --> 01:01:06,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we need to go through them all now, but you can think about that.

690
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:09,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

691
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:11,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's it.

692
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:11,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

693
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,770
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

694
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have the small grant application.

695
01:01:15,152 --> 01:01:20,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully we can go through that one quickly.

696
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:25,238
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

697
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:29,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're the applicant.

698
01:01:31,983 --> 01:01:33,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see you're the applicant.

699
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:34,925
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a yes, no question.

700
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I've come up with a very complicated who owns this

701
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,183
[SPEAKER_09]: property questions so that I have lots of logic attached to that.

702
01:01:45,144 --> 01:01:48,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like all these different circumstances.

703
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:54,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So this might be sufficient for us, but all these different circumstances might lead to different.

704
01:01:56,954 --> 01:01:59,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have some logic where if you hit no, this question pops up.

705
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:00,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

706
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:01,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, good.

707
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:08,283
[SPEAKER_08]: More or less what I have is the Applicant to City Department linked to

708
01:02:10,118 --> 01:02:11,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this I can clean up.

709
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:11,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

710
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I got it.

711
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

712
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

713
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:29,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, for the new folks, anytime a project happens on city property, the mayor needs to approve it as she authorizes this project to go forward seeking funding.

714
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:31,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to explain what city authorization she is.

715
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:43,395
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a fun first application cycle before we had that sheet where we had projects that came to us that were really out of the blue.

716
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

717
01:02:45,757 --> 01:02:46,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor should know.

718
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:48,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

719
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,181
[SPEAKER_09]: That's certainly the mayor at the time, but so.

720
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:57,704
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think this is unnecessary.

721
01:02:59,025 --> 01:02:59,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

722
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I'm not going to lie to you.

723
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really touch this from previous ones, but.

724
01:03:08,237 --> 01:03:10,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I encourage you to look at it with fresh eyes.

725
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:15,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think about what what questions do we actually want answers to versus the ones that we can.

726
01:03:16,098 --> 01:03:21,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and the really, oh, substantive question that I wanted to ask all the committee members.

727
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,700
[SPEAKER_09]: $5000 was what we came up with back in 2017 when we first started

728
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:40,592
[SPEAKER_09]: the CPA program, do we want to increase the thresholds for a small grant application at this point?

729
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:43,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we do.

730
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:49,258
[SPEAKER_04]: 5,000 is probably worth closer to 3,500 at this point with inflation in seven years.

731
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll agree with Doug there.

732
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:56,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a lot of requests every now and then.

733
01:03:56,364 --> 01:03:57,725
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be seasonal.

734
01:03:59,026 --> 01:04:06,132
[SPEAKER_06]: for small grants and the $5,000 maximum CPA award for projects up to $10,000.

735
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:09,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, small grants are matching grants.

736
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:13,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I get a lot of projects that are like $12,000, $15,000.

737
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:24,587
[SPEAKER_09]: We do need to keep it low enough that it's easy for us to just keep that pocket change available at any time.

738
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,429
[SPEAKER_09]: The first few funding rounds we tried to be very

739
01:04:28,033 --> 01:04:30,134
[SPEAKER_09]: organized and actually set aside 50,000.

740
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:31,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

741
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:37,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So that we would always be able to fund whatever small grants came through the door.

742
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:43,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we go back to doing that each funding round or maybe, I don't know if we want it.

743
01:04:43,698 --> 01:04:47,139
[SPEAKER_03]: How much would you love to know about?

744
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:53,001
[SPEAKER_06]: About is, um, after we've just done this last award, we have about 220, I think it's like 221, 221,000.

745
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:53,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

746
01:04:56,825 --> 01:05:18,353
[SPEAKER_06]: so we have it but we don't we don't like your market or you know plus we don't know how much we're going to claw back right are we do we have any eligible clawbacks there might be one floating out there pray for cape and park splash pad so what are you thinking about as a number i haven't been able to get much

747
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm thinking 10,000.

748
01:05:24,043 --> 01:05:30,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I don't think we get more than, I mean, how many, Teresa, the most we've ever had is what, three or four in one year?

749
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Three or four, yeah.

750
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:34,651
[SPEAKER_06]: We get a fair amount of requests.

751
01:05:34,671 --> 01:05:36,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just people don't follow through with applications.

752
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

753
01:05:37,673 --> 01:05:40,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we're trying to have them bring some money to the table.

754
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a 12,000 grant, we give them 10, they can come up with a two.

755
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's ways around that.

756
01:05:47,353 --> 01:05:51,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that the one-to-one match might be a challenge sometimes.

757
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:54,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So it should be no more than one-to-one.

758
01:05:56,457 --> 01:06:00,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could be a $5,000 total project.

759
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,460
[SPEAKER_09]: The match isn't required.

760
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

761
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that they can match it up to 100%.

762
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:18,452
[SPEAKER_09]: so that a $5,000 request can fund a $10,000 project.

763
01:06:19,232 --> 01:06:25,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what we don't want is for them to call it a small grant when they're really doing a $50,000 project.

764
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:25,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

765
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:26,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

766
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:28,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So... Okay.

767
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying some of these small projects.

768
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:33,003
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is a small project today?

769
01:06:34,944 --> 01:06:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten.

770
01:06:36,245 --> 01:06:37,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Headstone Restoration?

771
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:39,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at least ten because, you know,

772
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at the price of eggs.

773
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

774
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:48,708
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to think about CPA grants for eggs.

775
01:06:48,868 --> 01:06:49,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

776
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:52,030
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to really get that price of egg.

777
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the way they did this through the roof.

778
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:56,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the initial, I got to go to get a proposal, cost money.

779
01:07:11,298 --> 01:07:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and so you know how much is the proposal cost well now they're saying okay well you know the proposal is $2,500 or you know $3,000 depending on you know so your time so that gives me something else that i want to come back and ask about but anyway yeah i don't want to give you any more ideas sorry

780
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,056
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I think $10,000 would be reasonable.

781
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:37,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So $10,000 request for a total $20,000 project to just double it.

782
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:37,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

783
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:54,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's my I think that's fair, because somebody could still come through with a 15,000 on a project and it's just half of that so up to 20.

784
01:07:54,437 --> 01:08:03,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question I have is why, why is the match so important because I feel like historically a lot of grants we've gotten.

785
01:08:04,738 --> 01:08:06,460
[SPEAKER_04]: have not brought a lot of money to the table.

786
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't factor in our decision making.

787
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:12,585
[SPEAKER_04]: How much money they bring almost never factors in.

788
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:17,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the value of the project that we... And we don't get many requests.

789
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:26,016
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like we really need that 50,000 squirreled away because to your point, we're getting two to three requests a year.

790
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's...

791
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:35,041
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I agree that we don't, that the match is not a requirement for the small grant.

792
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:36,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you sure?

793
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:37,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

794
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:40,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not my understanding or how we're advertising.

795
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:44,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Well then, I mean, yeah.

796
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:50,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you saying that right now, what we're saying it's up to $10,000 project will match that $5,000?

797
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:53,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying that if the project's $5,000, we'll give somebody $5,000?

798
01:08:53,913 --> 01:08:54,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's,

799
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:08,238
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way it is written right now, my understanding, but the committee members all invented that.

800
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We can invent something new if we want.

801
01:09:15,502 --> 01:09:17,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just don't see the value in it.

802
01:09:17,443 --> 01:09:18,964
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is looking for $10,000, they probably don't have 10,000.

803
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:20,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they're looking for it.

804
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:26,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's meaningful.

805
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:30,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather have more products done at smaller scale.

806
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:32,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's the reason we're not getting more than three or four.

807
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:39,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Ryan just walked in the door and brought $5,000 to the table to get 5,000, right?

808
01:09:39,912 --> 01:09:41,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was a match, right?

809
01:09:41,293 --> 01:09:43,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what the perception out there is.

810
01:09:43,074 --> 01:09:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

811
01:09:45,775 --> 01:09:46,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

812
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a barrier.

813
01:09:49,296 --> 01:09:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It's prohibitive for the smaller projects that are out there.

814
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:53,898
[SPEAKER_06]: The match.

815
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:54,578
[SPEAKER_06]: The match.

816
01:09:56,261 --> 01:10:01,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've had differing opinions though, right?

817
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,172
[SPEAKER_03]: You think there is no match?

818
01:10:03,853 --> 01:10:06,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And the public think there is a match?

819
01:10:08,995 --> 01:10:12,976
[SPEAKER_09]: My I don't remember what we had in our instructions.

820
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:20,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Teresa is the most familiar with our instructions and Teresa has been under the impression that there is a match.

821
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:27,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever the instructions say, this is our chance to define something new going forward.

822
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we want to match or not want to match?

823
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hear I'm hearing that match.

824
01:10:35,302 --> 01:10:38,103
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really want to require a match.

825
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:43,826
[SPEAKER_09]: for small grants, that if they come in, so we're saying two things.

826
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:48,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, we want to increase the maximum to 10,000.

827
01:10:49,768 --> 01:11:01,232
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, that they can get a grant without having to bring a match.

828
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:08,075
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I would add that if they bring a match, it should not be more than one-to-one.

829
01:11:09,624 --> 01:11:15,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So they shouldn't have a $30,000 project that they're getting a small grant for.

830
01:11:16,451 --> 01:11:18,914
[SPEAKER_09]: It can only be a $20,000 project.

831
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:20,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fair.

832
01:11:20,635 --> 01:11:23,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, let's see if it brings us more projects.

833
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:26,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, more products is a success metric.

834
01:11:29,024 --> 01:11:29,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

835
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:40,611
[SPEAKER_09]: One situation that we did encounter in the past was that one year we had one applicant who wanted to apply for four small grants all at the same time.

836
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:48,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we put a limit on that and said not more than one or two per six month period.

837
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:53,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if we want to.

838
01:11:53,538 --> 01:11:54,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Small grants.

839
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

840
01:11:55,661 --> 01:11:58,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So what types do you remember?

841
01:11:58,505 --> 01:12:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That one was for restoring veterans monuments around the city.

842
01:12:04,713 --> 01:12:06,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking about Thummerville or Medford?

843
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:06,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford.

844
01:12:06,536 --> 01:12:07,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

845
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:16,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So because we received all of those at the same time, and at the time, we had set aside a certain amount of money for small grants.

846
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:25,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that would eat up a large share of the small grant money for the whole year, just for one applicant all at the same time.

847
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:32,198
[SPEAKER_03]: So the entity that you're talking about, they put in four separate for the same project.

848
01:12:32,758 --> 01:12:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in essence, it wasn't four separate projects, it was one project.

849
01:12:36,321 --> 01:12:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's trying to get around the small grant limitations by... Trying to get it in earlier before the funding cycle, maybe?

850
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:48,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it is... I mean, I'm also just thinking about how, like, the small grants are 5K.

851
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Our typical big grants are, like, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

852
01:12:54,595 --> 01:12:57,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, there's, like, no middle ground at all.

853
01:12:57,757 --> 01:12:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I almost, like, if this person had a $20,000 project, like,

854
01:13:02,298 --> 01:13:06,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, like, where do they fit in to the CPA framework, you know?

855
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can still request $20,000 or $30,000.

856
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,941
[SPEAKER_03]: You just come in once a year.

857
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But you only can get one bite at the apple.

858
01:13:14,822 --> 01:13:15,643
[SPEAKER_07]: People don't do that, though.

859
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But the small grants should only get one bite at the apple as well.

860
01:13:19,324 --> 01:13:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

861
01:13:20,024 --> 01:13:20,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

862
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:23,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kind of noticing there isn't really that middle.

863
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:27,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, let's say Ryan comes back

864
01:13:30,195 --> 01:13:46,159
[SPEAKER_09]: in like next month and wants another small grant for Thomas Brooks Park, as he said, even though I don't know if that's his timeline, but would we want to set a limit such that he would have to wait six months to be able to come back for Thomas Brooks Park?

865
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:53,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, this was the trustees.

866
01:13:54,011 --> 01:14:02,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I also feel like we shouldn't punish him for being a really involved Medford resident.

867
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:06,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, like being the same contact person.

868
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:22,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to figure out how to set limits that are equitable, that don't let someone circumvent the process to be able to get funds out of turn when they should be applying through the regular cycle.

869
01:14:22,164 --> 01:14:30,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what if we just had a sentence at the top of the small grant thing that was like, if you are applying for multiple small grants that all are

870
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:36,696
[SPEAKER_07]: related to each other, please consider applying for a single grant.

871
01:14:36,936 --> 01:14:38,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

872
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had a hearty discussion with the applicant yet, but there's a potential project out there right now to expand community gardens.

873
01:14:47,662 --> 01:14:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of a perfect example.

874
01:14:49,382 --> 01:14:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Would they apply for garden here, garden one, two, three, four, or wait till the funding round cycle and then apply for like one big project to

875
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:00,892
[SPEAKER_06]: include all four locations or something like that.

876
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:06,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't want to discuss it right now, but that's an example.

877
01:15:06,434 --> 01:15:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great example of this issue.

878
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so let's keep the rules as they are, but maybe add some more clear explanation, the rules pertaining to how often you can apply versus how often you can correct.

879
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,001
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll make it

880
01:15:29,552 --> 01:15:36,014
[SPEAKER_09]: total budget not to exceed $20,000, CPA funding request not to exceed $10,000.

881
01:15:36,794 --> 01:15:38,414
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're still matching?

882
01:15:40,054 --> 01:15:44,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can match, but you don't have to bring a match.

883
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:50,717
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next question, CPA request as a percent of the total budget, it can be 100% or it can be 50%.

884
01:15:50,777 --> 01:15:52,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be anywhere between 50% and 100%.

885
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:00,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it can't be 10%.

886
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,132
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to clarify.

887
01:16:04,492 --> 01:16:06,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm the mouthpiece for this.

888
01:16:06,373 --> 01:16:07,994
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure you got this right.

889
01:16:08,274 --> 01:16:10,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying that if I have a $20,000 project?

890
01:16:11,056 --> 01:16:12,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can ask for 20,000?

891
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:13,778
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can ask for 10.

892
01:16:13,878 --> 01:16:14,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

893
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:18,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I have a project that's 10,000, I can ask for 10.

894
01:16:18,561 --> 01:16:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

895
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:19,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, got it.

896
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:21,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Just got it.

897
01:16:21,462 --> 01:16:22,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was Yeah.

898
01:16:23,323 --> 01:16:23,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

899
01:16:23,804 --> 01:16:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Match of zero to 100% with a 10k upset.

900
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:36,775
[SPEAKER_09]: No, CPA as a percent of the total budget, CPA can be 50% of the total budget or it can be 100% of the total budget or anywhere in between.

901
01:16:36,795 --> 01:16:38,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

902
01:16:38,896 --> 01:16:39,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotcha.

903
01:16:39,256 --> 01:16:39,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

904
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:40,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

905
01:16:42,117 --> 01:16:43,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that.

906
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:45,018
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

907
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:47,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So how these, okay.

908
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:56,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So how the CPA funding request was determined, um, as Reg just pointed out, um, a lot of contractors are asking for,

909
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:02,154
[SPEAKER_09]: a significant amount of money now just to give an estimate.

910
01:17:02,975 --> 01:17:16,227
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm quite willing, because before people even have any funding, I'm quite willing for them to be creative about how they come up with

911
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:33,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Because right now the reason why we need a budget from them is so that we can give them the proper, we can promise them the proper amount of money, but they're not going to get that money until they invoice it and demonstrate that they're paying for a project that's being done.

912
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have to go through whatever procurement applies to them and so forth.

913
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:45,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So like we need a budget that's supportable

914
01:17:47,926 --> 01:17:59,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we don't have estimates, like three estimates is really, I don't even know if I've ever seen a project that submitted three estimates for a budget.

915
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:08,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there have been, but they usually just present the lowest or best estimate with the applications.

916
01:18:10,914 --> 01:18:15,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it goes more into that in the full application.

917
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:24,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So this just says, describe how you got this budget, but the full application wants more detail.

918
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:32,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we should be flexible about how they derive their budget, as long as it's attached to a real scope.

919
01:18:32,297 --> 01:18:42,260
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the problem that we had with the- For a maximum of $10,000, they should have some idea of how they came about getting to $10,000.

920
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:42,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

921
01:18:44,105 --> 01:18:45,646
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be able to explain it to us.

922
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:51,832
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't like something better than a dart and a dart board.

923
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:51,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

924
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:02,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And the project details, description.

925
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:05,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

926
01:19:06,404 --> 01:19:08,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh, what did you do?

927
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this computer.

928
01:19:12,959 --> 01:19:14,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the same questions.

929
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those are the same questions that we have in need.

930
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:25,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to explain, we ask these questions because DOR dictates how this money is spent.

931
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:29,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are kind of coming specifically from DOR guidance.

932
01:19:29,405 --> 01:19:37,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like this question.

933
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:43,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's applying with a government entity as a co-applicant.

934
01:19:43,552 --> 01:19:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Describe how they will work together, how finances will be managed, and how the work will be continued after the conclusion of CPA funding.

935
01:19:49,894 --> 01:20:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot to unpack there, I think it's... I mean, who did this apply to was that the high school students and the bench.

936
01:20:01,538 --> 01:20:03,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, at Dunkirk Cardicam.

937
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:03,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

938
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:08,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, it does sometimes happen, but

939
01:20:11,062 --> 01:20:17,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be too much to ask, like maybe that's an interview question and not an application question.

940
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe just strike it.

941
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:18,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

942
01:20:22,347 --> 01:20:30,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can also make sure that, you know, there's some, because there is a question above about like, who's the applicant and everything.

943
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:30,490
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

944
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Is ongoing maintenance and upkeep required?

945
01:20:40,932 --> 01:20:42,973
[SPEAKER_06]: If yes, please explain how this will be accomplished.

946
01:20:43,354 --> 01:20:44,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this to stay.

947
01:20:44,575 --> 01:20:44,935
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

948
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:51,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford is famous for its deferred maintenance, and I don't want that anymore.

949
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Non-maintenance, but it's a school building.

950
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:03,789
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's a little wordy.

951
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:04,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can.

952
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:08,391
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can find a way to make it make sense.

953
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:08,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

954
01:21:08,991 --> 01:21:18,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially because for small projects, they usually are not, that might just be struck from the small projects.

955
01:21:18,594 --> 01:21:19,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

956
01:21:19,394 --> 01:21:20,034
[SPEAKER_09]: One because.

957
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:24,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can put in, you can put in if applicable at the beginning.

958
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:27,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That could help it.

959
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:28,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

960
01:21:28,437 --> 01:21:33,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just, and then, you know, and if they put in N A then you'll know it's not.

961
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:33,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

962
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

963
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:44,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, that list of things to include, to upload.

964
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:44,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

965
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about it.

966
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:51,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And that concludes our review application material.

967
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:51,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

968
01:21:51,753 --> 01:21:52,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

969
01:21:52,393 --> 01:21:59,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I think last year it was a little bit more cursory, so I appreciate everybody's in-depth conversation about it this year.

970
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think last year it was pretty light, but this year we drilled down, so.

971
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:04,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

972
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:05,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

973
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:10,484
[SPEAKER_09]: answer these questions for ourselves when we have some time to think about them.

974
01:22:10,504 --> 01:22:17,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's boring, but it's necessary.

975
01:22:17,568 --> 01:22:18,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, later.

976
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:20,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the work easier.

977
01:22:20,409 --> 01:22:29,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it gets us the answers that we need before we sit around the table and we're asking the same doggone questions that we really need.

978
01:22:29,774 --> 01:22:30,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

979
01:22:30,214 --> 01:22:31,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

980
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, exactly.

981
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:35,982
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

982
01:22:36,002 --> 01:22:41,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So next on the agenda is community event on April 26th discussion.

983
01:22:41,846 --> 01:22:51,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So there has been an idea banded around to hold a community event celebrating CPA on Saturday, April 26th.

984
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:58,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of, it's, we're not ready to advertise yet.

985
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,963
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to have a discussion with the committee here real quick, but we're eyeing Riverbend Park.

986
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:06,635
[SPEAKER_06]: which is over by Midland and Andrews Schools.

987
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:11,379
[SPEAKER_06]: We're behind that one because CPA has invested in a lot of projects in the park.

988
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:21,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Midland School Playground, the Hormel Hockey Rink, the Labyrinth, the upcoming COVID Memorial Grove has been cited for Riverbend Park.

989
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:29,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And the gardens have received funds from us too there, I believe.

990
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:42,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is just a two-hour event where we might have folks stationed at each project, then be able to spotlight the McGlynn Playground and talk about the process there.

991
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So have it be like a walking tour throughout the entire park for folks just to have an engagement.

992
01:23:49,202 --> 01:23:52,463
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that time of the year, April 26, where people are itching to get back out.

993
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:57,185
[SPEAKER_06]: April 26 also happens to be National Trails

994
01:23:57,903 --> 01:24:00,605
[SPEAKER_06]: National Celebrate Trails Day.

995
01:24:01,706 --> 01:24:04,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I mean, technically Riverbend has a nice little trail there.

996
01:24:05,149 --> 01:24:12,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also, I've spoken with our friends over at DCR about sharing an update as it pertains to the Clippership Connector.

997
01:24:12,876 --> 01:24:22,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They are happily able to, they might not be able to physically participate that day because Saturday's and it's trails day, so I'm sure DCR is going to be very busy that day.

998
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:33,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing that we have looked into, and I've actually already drafted, and I could happily kick it around with folks, a self-guided audio tour.

999
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:50,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we've all encountered those in the past, but have it be, like, geolocated QR codes for folks to scan at the locations where, you know, for the folks who might not want to be as hands-on, one-on-one chatting with folks but still want to be involved,

1000
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,811
[SPEAKER_06]: that applies to a lot of my friends.

1001
01:24:52,851 --> 01:25:00,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very friendly, but don't want to talk.

1002
01:25:00,354 --> 01:25:02,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like a really sweet event.

1003
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like it kind of serves a different function, though, than like networking.

1004
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:11,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So just curious, because I know we were talking about the idea.

1005
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:13,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, we can also incorporate that.

1006
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,060
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just like the

1007
01:25:15,126 --> 01:25:18,007
[SPEAKER_06]: in the week and a half, this idea has been kicking around.

1008
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the absolutely want to flush it out and make it have it be more impactful, meaningful.

1009
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:29,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And then perhaps we can connect with other organizations to just to really try to drive attendance here.

1010
01:25:29,372 --> 01:25:35,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we'll just have a discussion about it, because I would love some other ideas, too.

1011
01:25:35,615 --> 01:25:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't want to do like the Harvest Your Energy Festival copy paste, you know, like the Medford Family Network there or anything like that.

1012
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But it might be nice to have them there.

1013
01:25:44,732 --> 01:25:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to copy that event, but maybe steal some ideas from it.

1014
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:50,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's in the same space.

1015
01:25:50,673 --> 01:25:56,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we want to obligate ourselves to do something really big on that scale either.

1016
01:25:56,354 --> 01:26:02,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So like, yeah, I love the idea of something that's essentially a party.

1017
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:08,777
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can come up with like some activities that give enough of an excuse for people to be there.

1018
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:10,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I, yeah, I,

1019
01:26:11,674 --> 01:26:15,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of feel like why not do two different things?

1020
01:26:15,977 --> 01:26:19,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this event that you're talking about seems cool.

1021
01:26:20,701 --> 01:26:38,575
[SPEAKER_07]: But then separately, like meet up at the Beer Hall with like neighbor, or not neighbor, associate organizations or people, involved people in Medford and just like highlight some future projects and like network and talk about ideas people have.

1022
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:40,877
[SPEAKER_06]: What if we had like a timed walk

1023
01:26:42,437 --> 01:26:55,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And then specifically say like meet us at the park will have a group walk at 12 o'clock and we'll hit all the spots and then meet us at great American beer hall at 134 continue networking is that what you're kind of thinking or.

1024
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:14,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably wouldn't do this event if I wasn't on the committee, the one you're talking about just because of having little kids and just being in the middle of the day and like okay do you know what I mean like so i'm just thinking about like in terms of who we want to bring like are we offering a social piece like are we do you mean like is it going to be in a time that people can.

1025
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:16,148
[SPEAKER_07]: go to it.

1026
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:17,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what I mean?

1027
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That Saturday is also the Saturday of school vacation.

1028
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:22,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just looking at that.

1029
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:23,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's the Saturday after.

1030
01:27:24,234 --> 01:27:25,114
[SPEAKER_06]: People might be back.

1031
01:27:25,555 --> 01:27:30,298
[SPEAKER_06]: They might be looking for things to do.

1032
01:27:30,318 --> 01:27:33,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not super tied to that date either.

1033
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Or have a component that is less

1034
01:27:39,918 --> 01:27:48,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you're talking about is kind of like a distributed, like not a gathering, but more like we're walking around, we're featuring different things.

1035
01:27:48,725 --> 01:27:52,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is not a social thing is how it's landing with me.

1036
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:58,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe there's a component at the end of that where it's like community picnic.

1037
01:27:58,532 --> 01:27:59,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1038
01:27:59,593 --> 01:28:00,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1039
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:08,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Beer tent, like, I don't know, like something that was just like more like fun community families, like people.

1040
01:28:09,323 --> 01:28:09,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1041
01:28:10,364 --> 01:28:11,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I like that idea.

1042
01:28:11,906 --> 01:28:24,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it has to be like inside somewhere, but like something that is like a, you're going to go see your friends posting, as opposed to like, I'll be at this side of that parking, you'll be like all the way to the other side.

1043
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:29,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like, well, I was thinking like, we could have a community picnic would be great.

1044
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:33,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could also include something like,

1045
01:28:35,177 --> 01:28:44,099
[SPEAKER_09]: a self-guided tour or a scavenger hunt or something as an activity that gets people to explore all of the things that we've done in that area.

1046
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:49,280
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't have to like be trying to do both things at the same time.

1047
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:59,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So the self-guided tour, the scavenger hunt lets you come two days later if you're not back from vacation yet and still get to find out like find the information.

1048
01:29:00,142 --> 01:29:03,903
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you can be there for the picnic

1049
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:32,598
[SPEAKER_07]: um then then we could have more conversations with some sort of draw like we've got the um we've got colleen serving ice cream or we've got the little tent with like the brewery or something that makes it like a little like extra you know what i mean yeah i will say beer tents with proximity to school it's a little challenging we did it last year for artist bus and

1050
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:36,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's just something to consider.

1051
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like ice cream could be a good alternative.

1052
01:29:38,512 --> 01:29:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like maybe we could- Something that's just like- We've got a little admin money that we could sponsor, like, I have no idea how much ice cream costs.

1053
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: At the MFN concerts, people pay for their own ice cream, but the ice cream, the Colleen's comes, because they always make business, or they would, like, make money there.

1054
01:29:56,442 --> 01:29:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a good idea.

1055
01:29:57,383 --> 01:30:02,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't have to necessarily pay for the ice cream, if we, like, thought we could get enough people.

1056
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:03,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1057
01:30:04,808 --> 01:30:07,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused.

1058
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:11,509
[SPEAKER_03]: What were we trying to approach?

1059
01:30:11,889 --> 01:30:15,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is our audience?

1060
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:16,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1061
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:33,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you said you have two kids, young children, who might not be interested in doing what teenagers want to do, who might not be interested in college kids, who might not be interested in regular citizens, who might not be interested in

1062
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:36,238
[SPEAKER_03]: elderly citizens.

1063
01:30:38,919 --> 01:30:45,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's our audience and who are we trying to get to?

1064
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:56,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that seems to be the... Well, let's just say that our goal would be to get to as many of those different groups that you named as possible.

1065
01:30:56,905 --> 01:31:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some things that we could do that would be appealing to different audiences?

1066
01:31:13,095 --> 01:31:15,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're just bringing this on folks.

1067
01:31:15,076 --> 01:31:17,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have some thoughts, you can always.

1068
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:23,222
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was looking, so we have 10, 10, 10, 10 weeks in a couple of days.

1069
01:31:24,203 --> 01:31:26,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's enough time to plan it.

1070
01:31:27,265 --> 01:31:29,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I suppose.

1071
01:31:31,549 --> 01:31:36,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just wondering how we talk to how we're going to tie this into CPC.

1072
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:39,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is going to be a way of

1073
01:31:40,591 --> 01:31:43,893
[SPEAKER_09]: showcasing projects that we funded in the past.

1074
01:31:45,014 --> 01:32:02,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So shows this is what like celebrating literally what CPA funded before and inviting people to share ideas about what they'd like to see in the future.

1075
01:32:04,368 --> 01:32:09,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to sound like I'm a drunk or something, and this needs to be in a brewery because I do not drink that much, but like

1076
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: to draw.

1077
01:32:11,627 --> 01:32:26,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We could go to the beer hall, have like some just posters or like poster X project, poster Y project, poster B project, and then be mingling and networking, have some apps out.

1078
01:32:27,419 --> 01:32:32,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be like a much more like, like people wouldn't be like all over the place.

1079
01:32:32,963 --> 01:32:36,786
[SPEAKER_07]: People would be like together networking and we'd have like visuals.

1080
01:32:37,953 --> 01:32:43,838
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to, like, if we're doing a scavenger hunt or something, people are kind of, like, off, like, doing, looking at the different things.

1081
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:50,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, if the goal is more, like, networking and featuring projects, that could accomplish that.

1082
01:32:50,964 --> 01:33:03,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like the time for the networking and featuring projects that you described would be a good activity for our

1083
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:09,632
[SPEAKER_09]: are what do you call that thing annual public hearing, which is next month.

1084
01:33:09,972 --> 01:33:12,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1085
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:17,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we had talked about in the last, I guess that's why I was here.

1086
01:33:17,655 --> 01:33:20,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So the annual public hearing is the time when we want to

1087
01:33:22,684 --> 01:33:34,317
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe show a little bit of presentation about what we've done before and ask for some feedback input about what do we think the needs are and priorities.

1088
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:39,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like that's the real targeted like we want to hear your input.

1089
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:40,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1090
01:33:41,585 --> 01:33:44,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is more of like a celebration like here we are and

1091
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:53,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was still in that mindset of our conversation last time.

1092
01:33:53,505 --> 01:34:03,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that I have approached the farmer's market has been holding winter sessions at the beer hall.

1093
01:34:03,891 --> 01:34:12,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have an inquiry out there to see if I could piggyback off of that, walk around and do some, hey, let's talk about ZPA.

1094
01:34:13,637 --> 01:34:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That is still on the table, just not at the scale that we were talking

1095
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:18,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1096
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:29,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we had our fifth year party at the Unitarian Universalist, we had a lot of information about projects that we had already funded.

1097
01:34:30,393 --> 01:34:32,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember we had a map.

1098
01:34:34,495 --> 01:34:42,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some of those things were just, you know, eye opening to me because I hadn't been on the committee that long.

1099
01:34:43,397 --> 01:34:45,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine something like that would be

1100
01:34:49,595 --> 01:35:01,302
[SPEAKER_03]: probably more interesting to the general public or people who might be interested in using CPA funding in the future.

1101
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:09,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, you know, come on in and let me give you ice cream cone.

1102
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:14,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, so we have those materials we could

1103
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no sense in us trying to reinvent the wheel.

1104
01:35:17,998 --> 01:35:18,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1105
01:35:19,098 --> 01:35:26,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have materials that would be advantageous to us to show.

1106
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:28,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1107
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,801
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they're interesting, too.

1108
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:35,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not boring, you know.

1109
01:35:35,421 --> 01:35:40,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you know, we don't like you said, 10 weeks, you know.

1110
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:41,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1111
01:35:44,433 --> 01:35:46,094
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it's not what we cut and paste.

1112
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, that's a good point.

1113
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:50,938
[SPEAKER_09]: We can reuse what we already have.

1114
01:35:52,299 --> 01:36:02,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, Teresa and I can think some more about preparing for the annual public hearing.

1115
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:08,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And for this celebration event, we'll

1116
01:36:11,645 --> 01:36:23,592
[SPEAKER_09]: think of these self-guided things, but also think of like, what can we do to bring people to join together for a picnic so that we can encourage everyone to gather in the same place?

1117
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:26,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And what kind of activities?

1118
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:28,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can hire ice cream.

1119
01:36:28,234 --> 01:36:38,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can get some of our partners, recreation users who use any of the facilities that we've funded around there to

1120
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:43,825
[SPEAKER_09]: invite them to participate in this this event.

1121
01:36:45,447 --> 01:36:53,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it doesn't just have to be those like any recreation users of places that we funded should be invited to.

1122
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:59,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's there's not like a roller hockey team that plays in the rink.

1123
01:36:59,102 --> 01:36:59,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It's open.

1124
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:04,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we actually set up a temporary pickleball court in the rink?

1125
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:06,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, during our event.

1126
01:37:06,641 --> 01:37:09,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to have a hockey game going on.

1127
01:37:09,643 --> 01:37:12,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my boyfriend plays hockey, so actually I was at that.

1128
01:37:12,384 --> 01:37:16,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, can you just get a couple of your friends for like a little pickup game or something as a demonstration?

1129
01:37:17,046 --> 01:37:17,507
[SPEAKER_07]: But MFN,

1130
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:22,962
[SPEAKER_07]: obviously has their little like stuff they bring around to the farmer's market.

1131
01:37:23,363 --> 01:37:27,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That is definitely Marie doing it herself, but I didn't really want to ask her to do that.

1132
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:34,491
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also sometimes pay $500 for that company to make that we're getting.

1133
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:36,753
[SPEAKER_07]: That brings all the gross motor stuff.

1134
01:37:37,073 --> 01:37:43,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we had money in the budget, that could be like a draw to families and stuff to make it more of like a,

1135
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:48,386
[SPEAKER_07]: we are putting this event on to help entertain your children.

1136
01:37:48,406 --> 01:37:50,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have activities.

1137
01:37:50,668 --> 01:37:53,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1138
01:37:54,471 --> 01:37:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good idea.

1139
01:37:55,392 --> 01:37:56,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1140
01:37:56,472 --> 01:37:59,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, there's so many more things that we can do.

1141
01:37:59,715 --> 01:38:09,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And the constraint is really going to be Teresa's capacity and anyone else who volunteers.

1142
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:39,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I would really love to volunteer reg to corral any of our recreation users of parks that we funded to just at least spread the word among them to let them know about it and invite them to participate in giving us some input about like what they've done at the sites that they like

1143
01:38:41,389 --> 01:38:43,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll connect with you about that.

1144
01:38:44,771 --> 01:38:46,672
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the time frame on Saturday?

1145
01:38:46,872 --> 01:38:47,853
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the hours you're thinking?

1146
01:38:48,793 --> 01:38:53,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking 12 to 2 or 10 to 12.

1147
01:38:53,616 --> 01:39:02,821
[SPEAKER_06]: The reasoning for that, sorry I'm losing my voice, reasoning for that is the park, we anticipate it will be heavily used.

1148
01:39:02,861 --> 01:39:10,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We know Boston Glory, the ultimate frisbee team will be at Hormel and the fields probably for youth

1149
01:39:10,759 --> 01:39:11,139
[SPEAKER_06]: soccer.

1150
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:15,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we did, I think it's 12 to 2 is the sweet spot.

1151
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:17,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1152
01:39:18,302 --> 01:39:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: To dodge most of the traffic.

1153
01:39:21,363 --> 01:39:30,187
[SPEAKER_09]: And so like that, those two hours would be the actual gathering time, but the self-guided tour and maybe a scavenger hunt could be on your own time.

1154
01:39:30,347 --> 01:39:30,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1155
01:39:30,907 --> 01:39:32,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Up to a couple of weeks after.

1156
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:34,529
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1157
01:39:34,609 --> 01:39:35,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to belabor it.

1158
01:39:35,849 --> 01:39:40,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the hour is getting late, and we're all wearing out.

1159
01:39:41,107 --> 01:39:45,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have one more thing on our agenda, which is to approve the meeting minutes from January 2025.

1160
01:39:45,288 --> 01:39:46,208
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in the packet.

1161
01:39:46,228 --> 01:39:48,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I can bring them up if you'd like.

1162
01:39:48,929 --> 01:39:52,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to mention to approve.

1163
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:53,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1164
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:58,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to bring them up?

1165
01:39:59,051 --> 01:40:02,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I already have a motion to approve in a second, so I will call the roll.

1166
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Doug?

1167
01:40:05,393 --> 01:40:05,653

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: And myself, yes.

1175
01:40:15,288 --> 01:40:18,068
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1176
01:40:18,088 --> 01:40:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is everything that's on our agenda.

1177
01:40:23,049 --> 01:40:25,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn?

1178
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:33,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1179
01:40:34,431 --> 01:40:34,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1180
01:40:34,991 --> 01:40:36,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I the motion person tonight?

1181
01:40:37,012 --> 01:40:38,172
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1182
01:40:38,212 --> 01:40:38,832

1183
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:39,632

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:40:44,949 --> 01:40:45,470

[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, everybody.
