00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,621
Hi, my name is Melanie Tringali, and I'm a candidate for Medford City Council.

2
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:21,328
A homeowner and taxpayer, my husband James Murdoch and I live on 4th Street with our four children, Michaela, Emily, Jackie, and my son Jacob, who is a junior at Medford High.

3
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,431
Both of my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High School.

4
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:32,656
My father, Salvatore J. Tringali, grew up in South Medford, and my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside.

5
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:42,544
I am a UMass Amherst graduate and have over 20 years of business experience in operations and marketing, working for both for-profit and non-profit organizations.

6
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:47,246
For more than 20 years, I've volunteered with organizations throughout Medford.

7
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:58,528
I served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, served on the Historic District Commission, and organized annual park cleanups.

8
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:12,550
Today, I'm a board member of the Rotary Club, an organization that provides community service to our cities and schools, providing college scholarships, neighborhood improvements, and other initiatives such as Thanksgiving and Christmas baskets.

9
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:14,602
Why am I running?

10
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:22,407
For too long, I've seen our elected officials focus more on ideology and national issues rather than the local challenges right in front of us.

11
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:30,852
My goal is to bring the focus back to Medford to strengthen our communities, support our residents, and address the issues that affect our daily lives.

12
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:40,919
We need to bring common sense back to the city council, the kind that strengthens our neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the character and history of our community.

13
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,470
As a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but let me highlight my top priorities.

14
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:51,458
One, I will always stand up to protect our neighborhoods in historic squares.

15
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,506
Blanket rezoning that favors high density would forever change the look and feel of our community.

16
00:01:57,693 --> 00:02:12,682
Instead, we need thoughtful, balanced planning that focuses on revitalizing our commercial areas and main corridors, bringing new life to our business districts, expanding our tax base, and supporting responsible growth that benefits residents.

17
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:19,567
With more than 1,100 new apartment units already in the pipeline, there is no need to expand residential zoning.

18
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:24,650
Mevitt can grow and thrive without sacrificing the character and charm of our neighborhoods.

19
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:28,443
Two, our streets and sidewalks remain in poor condition.

20
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:37,525
Potholes, uneven walkways, and crumbling pavement make daily life difficult for too many residents, specifically our seniors and physically challenged.

21
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:41,787
Despite budget overrides and staffing changes, little progress has been made.

22
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:47,588
Safe sidewalks, well-maintained streets, and reliable city facilities aren't optional.

23
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,149
They're basic city services.

24
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:53,930
We must repair what's broken now while also investing in long-term maintenance plans.

25
00:02:55,625 --> 00:03:02,008
Three, our police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel put their lives on the line every day.

26
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:07,710
They deserve full staffing, safe facilities, and modern equipment to do their jobs effectively.

27
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,952
Public safety must come first in our city budget.

28
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:17,615
We need to prioritize the health and safety of those who protect us and ensure our neighborhoods remain safe for everyone.

29
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:27,080
Four, for the fourth year in a row, Medford has carried unusually high levels of free cash reserves, a sign that we need better financial planning and accountability.

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,362
I will push for line-item budgets, transparent reporting, and a financial process that shows where every tax dollar goes.

31
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:46,165
We also need to diversify our revenue by encouraging commercial growth, reducing over-reliance on residential taxpayers, and ensuring we're investing in projects that deliver real value for our community.

32
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:47,205
And five,

33
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:51,407
We need traffic patterns that ease congestion, not create it.

34
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:59,733
Lane reductions, narrowed streets, and scattered pylons strewn across the city have only made driving more frustrating and stressful.

35
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:02,535
It's time to bring common sense to our traffic planning.

36
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:11,702
Any changes, whether it's a lane adjustment, signal timing, or street redesigns, should be well-planned and backed by real studies and data, not rushed experiments.

37
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:22,786
At the same time, we must ensure clear, well-marked crosswalks and safe intersections so that walkers, cyclists and drivers can all move safely and confidently through our city.

38
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,028
Medford residents deserve a transportation plan that works for everyone.

39
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:33,673
Together, these priorities strengthen the foundation of our community and help make Medford the special place that it is.

40
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:41,681
I'll bring to City Hall an independent, fair-minded voice focused on what works for Medford, not on partisanship or politics.

41
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,465
My decisions will always be guided by what's best for the residents and neighborhoods.

42
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:49,048
In closing, Medford deserves a City Council that puts Medford first.

43
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,863
I look forward to earning your support, your trust, and the opportunity to serve you and our city on November 4th.

44
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:59,050
I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for City Council.

45
00:04:59,411 --> 00:04:59,712
Thank you.
