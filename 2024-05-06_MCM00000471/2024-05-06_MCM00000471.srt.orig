00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:04,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Health and Community Safety meeting, April 9th 2024.

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Clerk, can you please call the roll?

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:06,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kelly?

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

5
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins?

6
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:10,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

7
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lemit?

8
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:20,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Stang?

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

10
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:28,030
[SPEAKER_12]: That is one, two, three, four, four present, one absent.

11
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,912
[SPEAKER_12]: This committee is called to order.

12
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:38,215
[SPEAKER_12]: We have one item on the agenda today, 24-074, Annual Surveillance Report Presentation.

13
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:40,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to mute my, sorry about that.

14
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:51,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Councilor Collins has brought this to our attention, and I would love for Councilor Collins to speak on this item.

15
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chair Lazaro.

16
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:57,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.

17
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:01,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to everybody who's joining us today.

18
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:12,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank the Medford Police Chief, Chief Buckley, for submitting our very first annual surveillance report under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

19
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: It is exciting to bring this to the committee for the first time.

20
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:25,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to quickly recap the topic of tonight's meeting.

21
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:37,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Because as many folks in this space already know, this is the first time that we are having a committee meeting that is brought forth because of the new process of the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

22
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,292
[SPEAKER_11]: That is an ordinance that we passed last year around this time.

23
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,274
[SPEAKER_11]: in 2023.

24
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:54,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It was brought forward by community members in Medford by accountability, transparency, civil liberties advocates.

25
00:01:55,742 --> 00:02:05,550
[SPEAKER_11]: We workshopped it together with the administration and the collaboration of the Medford Police Department over about a year and a half last term before it was passed.

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:20,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what is a really special opportunity about this ordinance is that this creates a mechanism for accountability around the use of surveillance technologies by any city department.

27
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,940
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, in most cases, it's going to be the Medford Police Department.

28
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,922
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a mechanism for bringing greater transparency

29
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:38,272
[SPEAKER_11]: between the community and those agents and offices that are charged with keeping us safe and more transparency around how they do that and with what tools they do that.

30
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:51,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a mechanism for talking about safety, the tools that we use to keep Medford residents safe and also our safety in the face of surveillance tools that we do know to be complicated.

31
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:57,962
[SPEAKER_11]: and problematic that have been demonstrated to be, you know, not without their risks and not without their complexities.

32
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:06,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So given all that, it is, I think, really positive to be in a place where we've passed this ordinance.

33
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,853
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at the beginning of the process where we are going through the process of

34
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:33,304
[SPEAKER_11]: bringing these technologies, the policies that we have for them, reporting around them to light in these public forums so that we can converse in the public sphere about them so we can have those conversations about risks and benefits and why we're using what we're doing and how we're using these tools to really maximize benefit for the community so that they're net positives.

35
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that this can be a trust building exercise.

36
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:41,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the administration and especially Chief Buckley for partnering

37
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:42,548
[SPEAKER_11]: on this.

38
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:49,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I pass the mic, I just want to orient us in what specifically this meeting is about.

39
00:03:51,736 --> 00:04:01,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I will note that for folks who weren't there at the passage or who are new to this process, the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance covers a lot.

40
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:19,360
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the many nuances in the ordinance is that we made several exceptions for the body-worn camera program because those were purchased and the rollout for those was already planned before this ordinance got underway.

41
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:28,509
[SPEAKER_11]: For your average surveillance technology, there are more things in the CCOPS ordinance that those technologies would be subject to.

42
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:32,532
[SPEAKER_11]: In the case of the body-worn cameras, the process is truncated.

43
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:41,461
[SPEAKER_11]: The annual surveillance report is the only report that the Medford Police Department has to submit to the city council about that technology.

44
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:45,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So where we are in terms of what the ordinance requires us to do,

45
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:55,275
[SPEAKER_11]: The meeting that we're having tonight is about the annual surveillance report for folks following along that section 5077 of the ordinance.

46
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:06,666
[SPEAKER_11]: And that says, I'll just I'll just be super brief here, a municipal entity that obtains approval for the use of surveillance technology must submit to the city council and make available on its website and in hard copy form.

47
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:14,615
[SPEAKER_11]: and annual surveillance report for each specific surveillance technology used by the municipality within 12 months of City Council approval.

48
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:21,523
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, body-worn cameras were exempt from City Council approval, and annually thereafter on or before March 15.

49
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,145
[SPEAKER_11]: So I suspect that

50
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:31,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Buckley is going to run through specifically all of the parts that the annual surveillance report on body-worn cameras is speaking to.

51
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:39,853
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is our chance to take kind of a bird's eye view at the past year of usage for surveillance technology and say,

52
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:41,854
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, let's ask the questions.

53
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:42,795
[SPEAKER_11]: How was it used?

54
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Has it been effective at its identified purpose?

55
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:58,106
[SPEAKER_11]: And some other, you know, just several other questions about the usage and about the community reaction to that technology in the preceding 12 month period.

56
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:08,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure Chief Buckley will speak more to this, but we're starting things off with a short report because the pilot program for body-worn cameras went into effect in December of 2023.

57
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:11,856
[SPEAKER_11]: and this annual surveillance report covers 2023.

58
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:22,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So I look forward to reviewing with my fellow councillors this annual surveillance report that covers three weeks of usage of body-worn cameras in Medford.

59
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I will pause there.

60
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

61
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:30,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councillor Collins.

62
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:34,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any comments from other councillors?

63
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:38,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

64
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Chief Buckley, would you like to speak?

65
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:43,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for being here.

66
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand you had a traffic commission meeting.

67
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:47,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no worries.

68
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Much calmer than the traffic commission.

69
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for having me here.

70
00:06:55,965 --> 00:07:01,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to have submitted the report, albeit probably like a week or two late, and that's my fault.

71
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I misread one of the communications.

72
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:04,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But

73
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:14,699
[SPEAKER_05]: to repeat what Councilor Collins has already said, that we started our body-worn camera program officially in December of 2023.

74
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So we roughly have one month of using it.

75
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:20,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then it was a trial period.

76
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about 40 officers who were wearing the body-worn cameras and

77
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:28,231
[SPEAKER_05]: going through a process of trying to get used to it and trying to fix the flaws so we could train the officers.

78
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:39,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to that December period, though, we spent more than that year, but training the officers in depth on the use of body-worn cameras and the policy that relates to the body-worn cameras.

79
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And even prior to that, we spent many, many

80
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,727
[SPEAKER_05]: months writing a policy.

81
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:50,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll note, I do have a copy of the policy here, but I believe I've sent it to everyone here and it is on our website.

82
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:55,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone in the public wants to see the policy on body-worn cameras, it is available publicly on the website.

83
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the

84
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:14,346
[SPEAKER_05]: in the little, the small timeframe that we've had in December, I have to say that it's gone like much better than I expected as far as, you know, this is a big change for us as police officers and it has been hugely, I think, successful in where we go with it.

85
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:19,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a process that, I mean, I have two full-time officers.

86
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Lieutenant Pat Duffy and Officer Frank Casarino.

87
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:28,671
[SPEAKER_05]: They're with me tonight in case there's questions that I probably can't answer that may go to, they are full-time assigned to the body-worn camera unit.

88
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: They handle almost every request that is covered by this surveillance report.

89
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:47,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And so on a daily basis, they're reviewing this process so that the technology reports, excuse me, the surveillance report can be kind of compiled at an easier pace year after year after year.

90
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:57,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So having said that, we have in December started the process and the 40 or so offices that

91
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: use the body one cameras, put them into play and we received no complaints.

92
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we've received a complaint yet.

93
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:11,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm stretching out at the 2024 but we have had no complaints yet from the public and the use of our body one cameras up to today.

94
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so there's nine questions that are being asked.

95
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:20,068
[SPEAKER_05]: to compile this report, and I believe everyone has it.

96
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:24,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's been posted as part of the public record here for tonight.

97
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,131
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see the camera is on me right now.

98
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,991
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a small piece of technology.

99
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:33,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Every police officer will wear it, including myself, when I'm out in public.

100
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:39,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, it's a piece of equipment that captures audio and video footage.

101
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:45,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use it to sort of document police interactions with the public.

102
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:52,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And almost all of our officer relationships with the public will be documented on a body-worn camera.

103
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's done through policy and, you know, but the normal, hello, how are you?

104
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, can you tell me where the nearest

105
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:05,045
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, public parks or something probably will never get documented, right?

106
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some discretion that comes to there.

107
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:14,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think in 2024, everyone has a general idea of how well the technology works.

108
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,910
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough video out there that people have seen that.

109
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,512
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the question of whether or not the technology has been effective in achieving its identified purpose.

110
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,253
[SPEAKER_05]: In one month, we were very satisfied, right?

111
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was, but it was all new.

112
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:27,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's,

113
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:37,678
[SPEAKER_05]: this still learned, you know, a lot more to learn on this program, but thus far, again, extending my comments into 2024, it is very effective.

114
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, you know, it's not numbered as of now, but we've seen a reduction in complaints, but we see quicker resolution for any complaint, not complaints related to body-worn cameras per se, but maybe complaints related to officer behavior or conduct or something along those lines.

115
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very helpful when it comes to those.

116
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,365
[SPEAKER_05]: and of those sort of incidents.

117
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:01,347
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is asked about collected surveillance data.

118
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we sharing with external persons or entities?

119
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of the people or the persons that we will share this body one camera with has been the district attorney's office.

120
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:14,057
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2023, there was only two instances with body one camera.

121
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:21,542
[SPEAKER_05]: The Middlesex District Attorney's Office has taken the tact that they're going to take all body-worn cameras for every sort of police criminal charge.

122
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a lot of work.

123
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:27,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And these two gentlemen behind me do that work on a daily basis.

124
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll submit it to the District Attorney's Office unredacted.

125
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:36,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we will continue throughout 2024 and future years be providing that to the District Attorney's Office.

126
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,334
[SPEAKER_05]: It could go to the U.S.

127
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney's Office, depending where criminal matter will be.

128
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:41,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But in accordance with

129
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:49,344
[SPEAKER_05]: The trial courts, both federal and state, were obligated and is mandated to provide this as discoverable materials.

130
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:52,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is why we'll have to push those forwards.

131
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,129
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have one public records request in 2023.

132
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:09,781
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an individual who wanted the body-worn cameras related to a specific call, but that call was related to domestic violence, and by law, we are precluded from sharing that with anyone.

133
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:15,286
[SPEAKER_05]: so we do not disseminate that, and we have advised that individual thus far.

134
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:24,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've seen an increase coming into 2024 as a preview, as we use these more and more, we'll get more and more requests for it, and we have released them.

135
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:31,960
[SPEAKER_05]: There's very few issues that would prevent us from releasing a body-worn camera.

136
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Ongoing criminal investigations would be one of them, but I will tell you this, the biggest

137
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:50,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, foreshadowing what is going to be said at the end of 2024 is that one of the bigger problems we have is we have to edit and redact every piece of body-worn camera.

138
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you, an average police call may take 20 minutes.

139
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I have three police officers there, that's 60 minutes of video that has to be watched, redacted before it's released to public record.

140
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:06,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's any delay in releasing things publicly will probably mostly be tied to that.

141
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a major incident, you're going to have many hours of voting on camera video.

142
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I've stated already the answer to number five, complaints and concerns that were received about the surveillance technology.

143
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:17,812
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been none.

144
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: The results of any internal audits, we have, again, this is where I go into explaining the trial period.

145
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 40-something officers.

146
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:33,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Interestingly enough, I had more officers wanting to get involved in the trial period because the technology was out there.

147
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,742
[SPEAKER_05]: When the program was new, we were auditing almost on a daily basis, right?

148
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:46,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have a general order related to auditing compliance and offices.

149
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:49,131
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the body one camera unit will have a lieutenant charged with that.

150
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: He will do the auditing of these cameras as we move forward in the years.

151
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:59,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, anything that goes out public records wise or released to the district attorney's office is another time we will be reviewing at odds.

152
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, like no police officer should be watching anyone else's video unless there's a reason and purpose for it.

153
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that sometimes is asked that question.

154
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:18,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get it to seven, whether the civil rights or liberties of any communities or groups, including communities of color or other marginalized communities in the cities are disproportionately impacted by the deployment.

155
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:21,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at this time, we do not believe it.

156
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:28,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've said it earlier when we had the surveillance ordinance reviews, I think that this will help us.

157
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of now, we have no compliance.

158
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:38,314
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen no change in behaviors or attitudes related to body-worn cameras.

159
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you it's sort of business as usual.

160
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we don't feel that the body-worn cameras are doing anything but helping the city and helping the police.

161
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Total costs related to the surveillance technologies.

162
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:50,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're sitting right there.

163
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to pay the salaries of two police officers, two full-time police officers.

164
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the majority of our costs right now.

165
00:14:56,586 --> 00:15:00,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's outside of we've already paid for the body-worn camera technology in and of itself.

166
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:09,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a significant cost of, say, $28,000 in 2023, but that was related to training every single police officer on the use of body-worn cameras.

167
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:21,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Going forward, there'll be some training for newer offices, there'll be sort of remedial trainings maybe that will come up and then some sort of updated trainings, but probably we'll never come to the total of that cost again going forward.

168
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:35,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, a decloser, any new agreements made in the past 12 months with non-city entities that may include acquiring, sharing, or otherwise using surveillance technology or the data, surveillance data it provides, I assume that is

169
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:45,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I should assume that it's generally related to the bodywork cameras or the technology, but either way, we have not done anything with any organization on any surveillance data, including this.

170
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,238
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't share it with anyone outside of what I've disclosed in it.

171
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So that covers the report.

172
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:57,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'm open to answer any questions as it relates to that.

173
00:15:57,385 --> 00:16:01,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I turn it back to the chair.

174
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,471
[SPEAKER_12]: If I, as a new councilor,

175
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:11,359
[SPEAKER_12]: coming into this, not having the history of when this was established.

176
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:18,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I have just a couple of follow-up questions that may have been covered in prior meetings discussing this, but forgive me.

177
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:19,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

178
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:22,988
[SPEAKER_12]: When are the cameras turned on and when are they turned off?

179
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so on and off, and not to get too technical, my camera's on right now.

180
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:31,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

181
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:32,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not recording anything.

182
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:39,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So on and off is when the police officer leaves the police station and goes out on patrol or is out into the public.

183
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:45,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's turned off when he enters the building or he exits his shift.

184
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:50,019
[SPEAKER_05]: That's technically like sort of like powering it on in a better way, but it's activated.

185
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,880
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a large button right here.

186
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be activated at the time an officer is either dispatched to the call

187
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:05,765
[SPEAKER_05]: or something of immediacy happens, and then we'll activate that computer, or an exigency, it happens as soon as they can feasibly activate their camera.

188
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:09,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So almost all interactions are being recorded now.

189
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:20,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So the reason I'm asking is because I am familiar with a lot of folks that will make calls to the police because of suspicious activity.

190
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:24,669
[SPEAKER_12]: If somebody is called because of suspicious activity,

191
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:34,961
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, so they're dispatched to a place and they're called upon to deal with somebody who may be outside somebody's house.

192
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,571
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe doing nothing wrong or maybe just existing.

193
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:41,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Would the camera be turned on?

194
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:43,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Would that person be recorded?

195
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:46,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Would that data be kept?

196
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you kind of walk me through what that would look like?

197
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:50,378
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simple.

198
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's recorded.

199
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:53,219
[SPEAKER_05]: What the data is, that would be.

200
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really would depend on how the outcome of the call came, but it would be collected for, what's that?

201
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,183
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably one year, right?

202
00:17:59,223 --> 00:17:59,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Retention on that.

203
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:19,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends on the outcome of the call, you know, if an arrest that gets extended father but if it's just an interaction with the public that would be kind of retained for a period of time and the retention schedule for all our instances in the back of that policy, but innocent like that will be recorded, and we've had that happen a lot.

204
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:40,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably want to keep it so when you talk about just say hey suspicious person is someone in my neighborhood, you know, we have, we've advanced our policing over the years to kind of be aware of what is what is happening and how people think and behave and how they want to use policing, but we definitely would record those incidents.

205
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

206
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:45,885
[SPEAKER_12]: So you do have, you have a schedule for the amount of time that you will keep.

207
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:54,901
[SPEAKER_12]: recordings of that nature if it doesn't result in an arrest or say it results in an arrest but not a charge.

208
00:18:56,654 --> 00:19:01,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, arrest would, well, I mean, I guess it's possible, an arrest would be a charge, but it's automatic with an arrest.

209
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:10,085
[SPEAKER_05]: If it involves just a minor thing, but it may involve, maybe it evolves into a complaint against the officer, we would then extend the- I see, okay.

210
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we would keep that for anything.

211
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:22,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that sort of arises after the call for, say, a basic call for service that we would wanna pay attention to, there's a means for retaining it, and that's why these officers are reviewing that.

212
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:31,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I get a public records request or a complaint regarding, let's say, officer behavior, or even sometimes accommodation on the officer's behavior, we might want to retain that.

213
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:39,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it results in a crime, like we cannot, you don't just have to arrest somebody, you could file criminal charge later, we would then retain that for a longer period of time.

214
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

215
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:51,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the reason I'm asking is because I'm curious if the goal of the program is to assist with evidence gathering or to

216
00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:59,781
[SPEAKER_12]: assist with officer compliance more, which would you, or is it both?

217
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:07,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably, I mean, I say it's both, but there's, you know, there's a lot of things, right?

218
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,506
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, evidence is related to not just

219
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It's statements, it's physical evidence that you might see.

220
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,462
[SPEAKER_05]: We had one instance where a police officer interacted and the individual had a gun and he didn't even know it.

221
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,463
[SPEAKER_05]: The police officer was a newer officer.

222
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:26,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like that we can find and use as evidentiary purposes later on in the court.

223
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:31,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's statements that are made and then recorded while we're talking to individuals.

224
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also allows us to some extent to be doing some review of training and officers' behavior and

225
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,980
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even if it could be a simple search thing.

226
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:47,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's multiple reasons why the retention of these cameras or the recordings is important.

227
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:55,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we don't hear anything for, you know, six months, three months, six months, a year, we're in a minor incident, we're getting rid of them, we need space.

228
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

229
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

230
00:20:57,108 --> 00:21:00,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

231
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

232
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.

233
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:10,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to, you know, be informed of this totally new process and new technology and everything.

234
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a couple of questions.

235
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:23,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did talk about, you used the word audit, and I wondered, after the, you know, opening sort of process where you're training people and you're

236
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:28,898
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, learning how the Medford Police Department will be using these body-worn cameras.

237
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:35,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any sort of continuation of any sort of audit of the footage?

238
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that you would ever, like, what is in terms of the policy that, going forward, is there any review of footage that would happen without a sort of complaint or an arrest or a need for that footage by a specific cause?

239
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:54,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have a compliance audit.

240
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Each officer is going to have three incidences audited, and it's somewhat random.

241
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:07,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I should probably ask the lieutenant to come up here and kind of talk to this, but we have a general incident, an arrest, and a motor vehicle stop would be the three instances.

242
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll pick them randomly from the police officers, and we'll go through them randomly.

243
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,118
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure they're complying with the policy.

244
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:16,199
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure they're not shutting the camera off at the wrong and appropriate times.

245
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:20,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to make sure that the policy is being adhered to.

246
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,961
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 100 something offices and that takes a long time.

247
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:33,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what helps us get through that is if the district attorney says, hey, I want to see Chief Buckley's 41 camera on this incident, well, they're going to audit it then.

248
00:22:33,923 --> 00:22:35,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to count as an audit.

249
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:40,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And that gets us through the year because they're taking almost every video that we have if it comes to a criminal challenge type stuff.

250
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:50,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So that gets us to the thing, but it is an annual audit of three different incidences of police officers' use of the body-worn camera throughout the year.

251
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:53,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will continue for as long as we have cameras.

252
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:58,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And my second question is, you mentioned redacting.

253
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:03,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious if the footage needs to be provided for some reason.

254
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:08,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just give us a sense of what the redacting process is like?

255
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have no idea.

256
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,874
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Patrick Duffy?

257
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: We just started the redaction, but it's pretty time consuming, but it is pretty easy to understand and figure out what we need to redact and what we don't have to.

258
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always going to err on the side of caution and lean on someone's privacy.

259
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:42,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we get a request for, say, someone had an interaction with us, and I'm giving an example that we actually had out in front of 121 Riverside,

260
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,374
[SPEAKER_03]: that person wanted the video of their interaction.

261
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:52,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We blurred out everybody's face and everybody that walked by in the background.

262
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:57,656
[SPEAKER_03]: If there were any juveniles that we saw, their faces were blurred out.

263
00:23:57,796 --> 00:24:05,437
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone was speaking in the background that could be identified, such as using a name, hey, Sally, Matt, we muted that.

264
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:12,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We then went into that president's apartment and we went into an elevator and there were three or four people in there.

265
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,780
[SPEAKER_03]: We told everybody that they were being recorded.

266
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:19,202
[SPEAKER_03]: When we did the redaction, we blurred everybody's face out.

267
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no privacy issues.

268
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:26,925
[SPEAKER_03]: The person that requested the video, obviously he can be shown on the video because he's getting the video.

269
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:33,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're always going to take into consideration everybody's privacy that's not involved in the call.

270
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:38,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll take as long as it takes to redact the video to make sure that happens.

271
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

272
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the totality of the reductions.

273
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:51,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you mute, you blur, license plates, anything identifying, someone's house number, street number, a car in the driveway.

274
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at everything.

275
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:56,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen videos from other departments and seen what they do.

276
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And Officer Kasserian and I make sure that we double check it before we send it out.

277
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:16,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, we've just got requests from mostly people involved, and there hasn't been a ton of redaction, but the few that we have had, I'd say they've been pretty spot on keeping everybody's identities private and out of that video.

278
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,048
Great.

279
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:17,608
Thank you.

280
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:18,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

281
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:23,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I can just add one other aspect to that is

282
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:33,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned to say never, not say never, but it would be highly unlikely that anything a police officer said or a police officer's identity would be redacted.

283
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:36,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be on that, to the extent that another officer's in the camp would.

284
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So that stuff would not be redacted.

285
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:45,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

286
00:25:46,138 --> 00:25:47,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report.

287
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:47,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your time.

288
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to our fellow officers for their time too.

289
00:25:51,359 --> 00:26:06,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your summary of the report was really, I think, very succinct and helpful, and it's really helpful to review what the policy is and has been, especially as you guys have just developed the policy.

290
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:11,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had two very specific questions about things in the report, and then I'll hand it back to the chair.

291
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:22,884
[SPEAKER_10]: In the sixth kind of blurb of this report, you mentioned that they're minor violations, not criminal in nature.

292
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:29,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I trust that characterization and I trust what's being said.

293
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:39,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we maybe don't want to go too much into detail, but I was wondering what kinds of things are we referring to there?

294
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the most common one is, I forgot the term, but body-worn camera.

295
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

296
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:46,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, there's also times where officers will go in and deal a report.

297
00:26:46,964 --> 00:27:09,695
[SPEAKER_05]: put their camera onto the to download anything that's on there and then they get a call and immediately rush out and they're like oh I forgot it's all new to them right and so it's like a lot of habit is being put that is the majority of what we're seeing and you know in this city it's very rare that a police officer is going to be alone or one call so if somebody did forget to turn it on they eventually do but the other officers captured the video

298
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just trying to get the officers to a point, and it's actually coming along really quickly, which is for some matter, right?

299
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:18,023
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a lot of things with our radio.

300
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:22,266
[SPEAKER_05]: After 25 years, I'm always doing certain things, and that's gonna be one that we pick up on.

301
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the issues that are minor in detail that we're just trying to get people to comply with.

302
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:38,775
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, I mean, I do have a general order out there that says, listen, I get it that you forgot to turn your camera on, but you forgot to turn it on the next day, and the next day.

303
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:45,165
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, we're getting beyond my right, you've got to start learning something.

304
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, but that's the lieutenant's job.

305
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we in these deal with it, and we're becoming effective.

306
00:27:51,071 --> 00:28:04,402
[SPEAKER_05]: When there are discrepancies on the video, like if I was approaching and said, say, hey, I would like you to not record me, you know, and they're in a private place, the officer would just say, based on the request, I'm going to shut off the body-worn camera.

307
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:10,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they have to do a report, a little quick compliance report that happened so that the lieutenants know.

308
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:14,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they forget to do those things because it gets busy at the end of the shift.

309
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a lot of training, a lot of habit to get built into it.

310
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:21,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the extent of what we're looking at as minor infractions.

311
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:21,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

312
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:22,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

313
00:28:22,175 --> 00:28:22,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

314
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:26,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that satisfies a lot more and that's very helpful to know.

315
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:32,079
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the second question, again another quick question, is about question seven.

316
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:39,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Just that I also trust that nothing has come to light about this.

317
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:44,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I was curious what types of things you would be looking for in terms of answering this question.

318
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:48,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So what would be the types of infringements?

319
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:53,165
[SPEAKER_10]: the disproportional impacts that you would be looking for in answering this question?

320
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:57,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's an interesting, I've asked myself that I try to answer that question, right?

321
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's how do you know and how do you study this, right?

322
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:04,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess part of it is that we're not going to see every body-worn camera video that we have.

323
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The first and most obvious is we're getting complaints about the use of our body-worn cameras.

324
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:15,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't, right, to this point, and that's a good thing.

325
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we do have them, we'll be kind of keying in on, like, what is being used and how are we going to use it.

326
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:28,835
[SPEAKER_05]: But if everyone is recording every incident and they're doing it properly, they're only going to record what calls of service we're going to.

327
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:35,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there is proactive police operations, right, so where I sort of self-deploy, I want to do parking enforcement.

328
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:39,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking enforcement on an empty car isn't going to necessitate up to a particle camera.

329
00:29:39,814 --> 00:29:42,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I do traffic stops, that will attest.

330
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:45,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can be able to tell and say, listen, OK, no.

331
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts is really unique when it comes to traffic enforcement.

332
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not allowed to ask anyone their race.

333
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:55,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to make guesses.

334
00:29:55,924 --> 00:30:01,628
[SPEAKER_05]: That fascinates me to this day, that we're just supposed to guess as to what someone's race is.

335
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why when we give statistics, you're always looking and you say,

336
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, it comes down.

337
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:12,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But this would be able to kind of record those instances, what the police officer may have seen, what time of day, and put those things in.

338
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be helpful when it comes down to those sorts of incidences.

339
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:16,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is an open question.

340
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:27,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I didn't, the metric of asking whether or not the civil rights and liberties of communities or groups are marginalized, are being impacted by the deployment of technology, I didn't write that question.

341
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably would have phrased it a different way.

342
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean,

343
00:30:32,014 --> 00:30:37,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand what they're asking, and it's actually a great reminder for us to always be aware of what we're doing.

344
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:44,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think it's a measurable item, you know, thing, so we'll do the best we can as it comes to that.

345
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:49,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just, it's, even answering that, I'm like, how do we, how do we absolute measure?

346
00:30:50,286 --> 00:31:11,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I was reading that question and I was also that was in my mind that, how do you measure this I mean, I think we all know what it's pointing out but you know it's a big, it's a broad question, and maybe the broad, the breadth is good, but, um, yeah I mean it serves as constant reminder for us right to keep this this those things in.

347
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,152
[SPEAKER_05]: in our conscious thoughts as we move forward as a police department, but it is anyway.

348
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that we constantly think about those sort of things.

349
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But I answered it to the best that I could, but I don't know that it's technically answerable.

350
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:30,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I don't have a scientific calculation to kind of figure out that question.

351
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:35,308
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll hear that answer from me every year going forward, because it is just tough to kind of gauge.

352
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would be able to see it through complaints.

353
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:49,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate your answers and appreciate your time and the fact that they haven't been complete yet.

354
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, so good.

355
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, so good.

356
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:52,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Really happy.

357
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:55,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gotten a lot of positive feedback in the community about them on that.

358
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying I'm surprised at that.

359
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Most jurisdictions that do this, but people are very

360
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:05,014
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, Hey, we let them know what's on recording on my 41 camera.

361
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:06,116
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, okay, great.

362
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:15,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I think they're kind of happy that, you know, just moving forward has been no real negative at all when it comes to that.

363
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So can't, can't be happy with that.

364
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

365
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:20,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And.

366
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:26,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I know that I don't know if there are any questions here, but I assume you can probably open up the public comment.

367
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:29,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But before I do, I really, really want to take the opportunity to say to do it.

368
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:33,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to thank Lieutenant and Officer Casarino here for the work that they put into this.

369
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

370
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:38,713
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not easy stuff and they do this on a daily basis and this is it.

371
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:51,138
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a full-time assignment from putting together the audits and review and they keep me posted on equipment and what's happening and who's in compliance and where they're not and what things we have to look out for.

372
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:55,580
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a bang-up job but I go all the way back to even writing this policy.

373
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,181
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not an easy policy to write.

374
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:02,786
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of input throughout the 2021-22-23 about body-worn camera policies.

375
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:10,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you now that they did a lot of work on this, but mostly I have Cambridge, Arlington, Belmont,

376
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,978
[SPEAKER_05]: They all are interested in this policy.

377
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:19,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, every community will modify slightly, but this is a policy that also our labor unions signed off on, right?

378
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So police labor has signed off on this policy.

379
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:26,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The district attorney's office has reviewed and signed off on the policy.

380
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:27,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extensive, right?

381
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:34,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to write a policy that's so extensive, but people are happy with that policy thus far as we see it.

382
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:38,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to take the time publicly to give them the credit for a lot of the work that they did

383
00:33:38,555 --> 00:33:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: us in the work that they do on a daily basis in this unit, because it's not easy.

384
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, I don't have to do it all day long.

385
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

386
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:51,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

387
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:59,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Collins has her hand raised on Zoom, so let's go to our, excuse me, Vice President Collins.

388
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chair Lazaro.

389
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:03,655
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

390
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I answered both.

391
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:09,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Want to again, thank you, Chief Buckley and officers for being here.

392
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:15,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this is, I know a lot of care and hard work has gone into this, and that's really evident.

393
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you again for that.

394
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:22,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's very relevant, you know, the reminder that

395
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,624
[SPEAKER_11]: how much work has gone into adopting these and bringing these onto the force.

396
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:34,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And to me, that brings us back to kind of the theme of this public process to begin with.

397
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:38,470
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that there's a lot of escalating pressures to use body-worn cameras.

398
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Specifically, you noted that so far the only occasions that you've had to share

399
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:49,195
[SPEAKER_11]: footage apart from that one public records request that, of course, had to be denied per law has been to the district attorney's office.

400
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:56,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that state level district attorneys are expecting, requesting this type of evidence more and more.

401
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's an external pressure upon our police department, as with many others.

402
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:03,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

403
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:23,836
[SPEAKER_11]: a positive outcome of this process, which I'm really glad that we're going through together, is that knowing that pressure to adopt new technologies, including things like body-worn cameras, that pressure on police departments and other city departments, both from within industry, from within modern policing,

404
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:48,867
[SPEAKER_11]: and from kind of the more technology developmental sphere, we need to do our best to keep pace with that pressure to adopt and scale up and use new technologies and bring them up to speed and up to the force quickly with creating processes to let the community know what are these, why are they being used, how are they affecting your work, how are they affecting the community.

405
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:55,468
[SPEAKER_11]: and try to keep pace with the rapid pace of adopting them into your work.

406
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,229
[SPEAKER_11]: So just another way of phrasing that.

407
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:09,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really positive to be beginning this process in a way it feels appropriate to me that the first annual surveillance report is on this super short window of time, kind of bite size.

408
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good chance for us to get a sense of what this process will look like.

409
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:30,773
[SPEAKER_11]: going forward and have an initial small benchmark for this reporting and the type of questions that we know the community really does want answers to because of the appetite in the community for this type of process.

410
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:33,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't take too long.

411
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:44,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there's folks who are eager to speak and ask questions, but I really appreciate my fellow counselors' questions about the annual surveillance report and the body-worn camera policy.

412
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:54,630
[SPEAKER_11]: So far, you know, it strikes me that, you know, this specific committee meeting, as outlined in the ordinance, is for going over the annual surveillance report, which touches on

413
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:01,296
[SPEAKER_11]: the actual technology policy, but it also gives us the opportunity to ask questions about the execution.

414
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, the policy and execution are intimately related, but kind of separate.

415
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:18,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the big transparency benefits that we have is getting this chance to ask in public, just these kind of specific, sometimes abstract questions about the policy and why it is the way it is.

416
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:28,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And also as counselors, it is our role to kind of ask those questions about the policy itself, like the regulation, the policy level.

417
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:42,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the opportunity to do both, just to ask the questions about why is the policy the way that it is and, you know, get clarification on how it's being carried out so far.

418
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:50,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So on that point, I just wanted to follow up on Councillor Callaghan's line of questions on the redaction policy.

419
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:56,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, you know, honestly, this is gratifying for me to hear as a Councillor.

420
00:37:56,332 --> 00:38:01,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like, you know, by all accounts, Officer Duffy is setting a really good precedent here.

421
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,627
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't mind reminding me, is this redaction policy, is this a policy that's laid out in the body-worn-camera use policy?

422
00:38:11,928 --> 00:38:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is this kind of more of a norm that's being established in real time?

423
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:22,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Like put a different way, like in the hypothetical that Officer Duffy gets promoted into a different role, there's somebody else doing the redactions.

424
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:36,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a leeway for this kind of norm to change into a policy that's less rigorous, or is this written into, like, this is always how camera footage is going to be redacted this rigorously?

425
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:37,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

426
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it makes sense.

427
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:39,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good question.

428
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a redaction policy per se, we do have a redaction practice.

429
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:49,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I can say in general that we haven't really fully developed a redaction process is we haven't done.

430
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:59,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were learning, we're getting body-worn cameras, we're looking to see in our heads, we know what we expect, but now it's real life and we're learning what we want to redact and how well we're going to redact.

431
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:16,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you that ultimately it will be put into probably policy, but it might be just put it through general orders about how things will be redacted and what will be like, but we're learning right now what we have to redact, where to redact, and they're still undergoing training.

432
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:18,462
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done a great extent of the training.

433
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:23,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not done yet, but it will be, but we just didn't know what to expect.

434
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:26,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll get there.

435
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully soon, but I think they're doing the right thing.

436
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:39,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We are redacting everything that is except for what is being requested to the extent that we can.

437
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chief.

438
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:43,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does.

439
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:44,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

440
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:45,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.

441
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:46,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a great answer to the question.

442
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:58,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to hear that there's plans to turn this into policy once there's more data gathered around what's working and what that policy should be after you've gone through a little bit more time of doing the redactions.

443
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,761
[SPEAKER_11]: And before I pass it off again, just one more question.

444
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:13,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Councilor Lazaro touched on one of the questions in the surveillance report, the expense of using this technology.

445
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:17,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Heard you loud and clear that the expense is essentially salaries and training.

446
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:19,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I was curious.

447
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:27,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a less than annual licensing cost to continuing to have these cameras on the force?

448
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the cameras themselves might be more capital expense than an operating one.

449
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:40,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there renewal costs to keeping these on, even if that cost doesn't occur with every budget cycle?

450
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:46,131
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be ultimately, you know, part of the package that we purchased originally.

451
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:56,296
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that calls for is an upgrade in the equipment right so for for period of these these cameras are supposed to go, you know, be in.

452
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:05,285
[SPEAKER_05]: use for, say, three years, and then after that third year, you're going to get a camera replaced, just a modern technology, the newest versions.

453
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:12,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually, believe it or not, starting that process sooner because it took so long since we originally purchased the cameras.

454
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:14,712
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's at no cost.

455
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:16,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the original package that we got.

456
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just included that after a certain period of time, you get an upgrade.

457
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:31,724
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be things that we have to purchase, like these things come in all sorts of like clips to hold them to uniforms, very minimal cost, but we occasionally find that we need to have more of these.

458
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:38,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've purchased some of them, but during the whole process over the last sort of estimates of the other,

459
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: that at least right now we feel we have enough.

460
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:56,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I do think that you know depending on breakage or number of offices we have we're probably going to want to purchase some more in the future to kind of keep just but these are going to be small numbers of the same technology it won't be newer during the course.

461
00:41:56,744 --> 00:42:00,607
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of five years the the lifespan of this camera

462
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:10,397
[SPEAKER_05]: the city is gonna have to negotiate with a vendor to bring body-worn cameras, either change vendors or get a new deal for new technology.

463
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:17,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But all the storage is already included in this, and it's up in the cloud, and it's based on our server.

464
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:22,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of that is currently included with the exception of some of those small incidentals.

465
00:42:22,221 --> 00:42:30,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the, I forget when we actually signed this contract, but by 2025, by 2026, I think, we'll be going through this whole process with a new vendor.

466
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:34,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you appreciate that.

467
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:36,172
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

468
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the next expected cost for that.

469
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:46,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's probably when at least we have a five-year exemption on body-worn cameras.

470
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it closely coincides with that.

471
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:54,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is a five-year exemption for the other parts of the ordinance.

472
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:54,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

473
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:56,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the clarity on that.

474
00:42:57,397 --> 00:42:57,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

475
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:01,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

476
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:06,892
[SPEAKER_12]: If counselors don't have anything else to add, I can open it up to public participation.

477
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:16,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we open it up to the floor and to Zoom, I have a couple of letters that were emailed that were requested that I read into the record.

478
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:19,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Chief, you can feel free to sit.

479
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:22,244
[SPEAKER_12]: You can stay standing if you want, that's fine too.

480
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:23,284
Okay.

481
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:27,808
[SPEAKER_12]: First is from Gene Zotter, 36 Saunders Street, Medford.

482
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:39,342
[SPEAKER_12]: I am writing to comment on the annual surveillance report submit by the City of Medford's Medford Police Department to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee as part of the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

483
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:47,085
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I want to express how significant it is to me as a member of Medford People Power, which advocated for this ordinance that this hearing is happening.

484
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:52,546
[SPEAKER_12]: We worked collaboratively with City Council, the City of Medford, and the Medford Police Department to pass this ordinance.

485
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:57,628
[SPEAKER_12]: It took many years to get here, and it is heartening in this age of pervasive and invasive technology.

486
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:01,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the city will take this requirement seriously as we move forward.

487
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:04,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wait, hold on.

488
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Pass this ordinance.

489
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:06,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Heartening to see it in action.

490
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:13,812
[SPEAKER_12]: CCOPS is an important part of ensuring transparency and accountability in this age of pervasive and invasive technology.

491
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:17,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope the city will take this requirement seriously as we move forward.

492
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:25,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Second, while there are many parts of the body-worn camera policy that follows state guidance, there is one area that deviates from state task force recommendations that I hope will change.

493
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:32,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that as part of the agreement with the city, city council exempted body-worn cameras from the approval process for the first five years.

494
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:42,615
[SPEAKER_12]: However, it is an important time for the public to be aware of the body-worn camera policy and weigh in on their use in preparation for when the technology will fall under this ordinance.

495
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:53,681
[SPEAKER_12]: The main concern I have is the provision that allows pre-statement viewing video footage by involved officers, even allowing previewing with an officer's lawyer present in situations of possible police misconduct.

496
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:58,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that cases of the use of deadly force are exempted from previewing.

497
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:08,025
[SPEAKER_12]: State guidance, however, recommends that officers shall not access or view any recording of an incident involving the officer before the officer is required to make a statement about the incident.

498
00:45:08,845 --> 00:45:11,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see Medford align with the state recommendation.

499
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:21,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Third, I hope the committee will consider working with Medford People Power in the future to address a loophole in the ordinance that allows the Medford Police Department to purchase bulk surveillance data.

500
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:28,645
[SPEAKER_12]: the ordinance disallowed this purchase, but it was changed at the last minute by City Council at the request of city officials.

501
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:35,409
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope you will let us work with you to fix this as it allows police to subvert current warrant requirements and lessens civil liberties.

502
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:46,534
[SPEAKER_12]: The second letter that I have to read is, this is from Jen Sullivan, I think, but it's printed out and I don't have her name attached to it.

503
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:49,136
[SPEAKER_12]: As a

504
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:51,679
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Jen Sullivan, right?

505
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,499
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in our email.

506
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,320
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll put that into the record with her address.

507
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:06,427
[SPEAKER_12]: As a longtime resident and a member of Medford People Power, I'm proud that we were able to work together with the Medford Police Department, City Council, and the City of Medford to finally make C-COPS a reality.

508
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:13,971
[SPEAKER_12]: C-COPS demonstrates to the Medford community that we mean it when we say we want accountability and transparency, but we must do even better.

509
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:18,093
[SPEAKER_12]: The 2023 annual surveillance report submitted by the Medford Police mentions

510
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,050
[SPEAKER_12]: There have been no issues or complaints related to the department's BWC program.

511
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,932
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the process for submitting a complaint or issue?

512
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:26,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Who can access them and when?

513
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:34,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Allowing officers, possibly with a lawyer present, to view BWC footage before making a statement is not transparency.

514
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,242
[SPEAKER_12]: This access is not granted to suspects or witnesses.

515
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:43,947
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a privilege being permitted to only the police, giving them ample opportunity to craft their response based on viewing the BWC footage.

516
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:51,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I encourage the MPD, City Council, and City of Medford to commit to continued work on improving CCOPS.

517
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:56,621
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a loophole in the current ordinance that allows the MPD to purchase bulk surveillance data.

518
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:00,564
[SPEAKER_12]: The original ordinance banned these purchases, and that ban needs to be reinstated.

519
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

520
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:11,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so I would like to open it up to public participation now in the room or on Zoom.

521
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:14,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I have nobody on Zoom, so we can open it up in the room right now.

522
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:17,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Please state your name and your address for the record.

523
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Marie Izzo, Pilgrim Road, Bedford.

524
00:47:23,617 --> 00:47:25,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to thank the chief for being here and

525
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:46,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, I've spoken to the chief often about his vision of community policing and I think that this policy and the amount of work that has gone into it very much reflects I would hope, you know, your role in that and our goal and really keeping you to task chief, but I'm just going to read because I'll get up.

526
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:50,999
[SPEAKER_06]: topics, I'll just read, but thank you again.

527
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:04,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So we at People Power are happy that after years of working, collaborating with the Medford Police Department, City Council, we have finally gotten here in our first public meeting with the annual report and surveillance equipment used by the Medford Police Department.

528
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:15,793
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, the purpose of this tool is to build, is for trust building between all the people of Medford and the police department through transparency and accountability.

529
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:22,238
[SPEAKER_06]: My hope is that it will be taken seriously by prioritizing timelines as well.

530
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:34,389
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand that this is new and that the chief is very busy with staffing shortages, technological limitations, budgeting, and possible union conflicts.

531
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:39,093
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there has been very little to report in a full year to put the reporting in place.

532
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:43,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Many Medford residents and groups are in support of this ordinance and

533
00:48:44,397 --> 00:48:48,540
[SPEAKER_06]: that Medford should follow state guidelines regarding body-worn cameras.

534
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:59,866
[SPEAKER_06]: These concerns are stated by Safe Medford, NAACP of Medford, the City Committee, Wards 2 and 8, Unitarian Universalist, and Sanctuary Churches.

535
00:49:01,247 --> 00:49:07,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, we hope that this process continues to be prioritized and that it's not just checking a box.

536
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:08,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

537
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:09,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

538
00:49:19,234 --> 00:49:19,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

539
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:23,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street, Medford.

540
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:28,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a member of Medford People Power and a longtime resident.

541
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:39,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to thank Chief Buckley for his report and thank this committee for holding this hearing and for the opportunity to speak.

542
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:46,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to address two concerns regarding body-worn cameras and their policies for use.

543
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: First, in his report, Chief Buckley describes the identified purpose of the body-worn cameras as follows.

544
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:58,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I won't read it because he read it.

545
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: When Chief Buckley was first proposing the body-worn cameras to the city, he was describing it as a tool for police accountability, for

546
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,740
[SPEAKER_09]: preventing police misconduct.

547
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:25,362
[SPEAKER_09]: There is nothing here in the way he describes the purpose of the body-worn cameras that even mentions the word accountability.

548
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:40,246
[SPEAKER_09]: This language heightens our concern that body-worn cameras have been adopted for the primary or sole purpose of gathering prosecutorial evidence and not towards our shared goal of police accountability.

549
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:46,409
[SPEAKER_09]: which was what was claimed was going to be their purpose prior to acquisition.

550
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:55,297
[SPEAKER_09]: My second concern is with the Medford Police Department's body worn camera use policy.

551
00:50:56,498 --> 00:51:07,448
[SPEAKER_09]: The core policies in the use policy are mostly positive and quite aligned with the ACLU and with the state guidance with a few exceptions.

552
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:33,520
[SPEAKER_09]: The most glaring exception, which puts it out of compliance with the state task force's recommendations, the judgment of civil libertarians, and the expressed view of the Massachusetts state legislature, is the provision allowing pre-statement viewing of video footage by involved officers, and even with a lawyer in situations of possible police misconduct.

553
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:46,073
[SPEAKER_09]: This creates an uneven legal playing field, allowing officers to conform their testimony to what they view on the camera rather than what they actually witnessed.

554
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:56,441
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a privilege accorded to criminal suspects or to witnesses, and it is outrageous that officers have this privilege in Medford.

555
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:16,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to emphasize that when we say that the Medford Police Department's body-worn camera policy is out of compliance with the recommendations of the state task force, this task force is, I'm not talking about the notions of a bunch of academics and starry-eyed idealists like me.

556
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:33,997
[SPEAKER_09]: The task force's 25 members included nine from law enforcement, two prosecutors, and six high-level, state-level public safety officials from the Baker administration, as well as several elected officials.

557
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:44,201
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very strong concern of ours that we'd like to put on the record, that we'd like to put on the record, and we'd like the Menford Police Department to reconsider.

558
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:45,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

559
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:55,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Elizabeth Burke, 12 Stephen Street in Medford.

560
00:52:55,678 --> 00:53:05,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also a member of Medford People Power, and I'm very appreciative of the engagement by the City Council, the Medford Police Department, and this committee on the issue of surveillance technology.

561
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:16,958
[SPEAKER_13]: The annual surveillance report prepared by Chief Buckley and the Medford Police Department is a significant step to help our community understand the technologies that Medford chooses to purchase.

562
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:38,869
[SPEAKER_13]: While we think much of the content of the body-worn camera policy is robust, we do have significant concerns regarding the latitude given to officers and supervisors to use their personal discretion to create exceptions about the use of the cameras, even in matters regarding First and Fourth Amendment rights of residents, such as surreptitious use and filming of protests.

563
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,672
[SPEAKER_13]: State guidance does not allow for these types of exceptions.

564
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:49,268
[SPEAKER_13]: if in the opinion of the officer is a low bar for justifying violations of the constitutional rights of residents.

565
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:58,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, this policy does not describe the progressive disciplinary procedures that would be used in the event of policy violations.

566
00:53:58,597 --> 00:54:09,307
[SPEAKER_13]: While the policy excels in firmly stating the need to protect civil liberties and privacy, there are no sanctions stipulated even for gross violations of individual officers or the department as a whole.

567
00:54:10,193 --> 00:54:21,542
[SPEAKER_13]: The annual surveillance report states that during the BWC pilot program, minor violations would be, quote, managed with additional training and counseling, as opposed to formal discipline, end quote.

568
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:32,070
[SPEAKER_13]: This indicates that when the pilot program ends, there would be disciplinary actions taken when warranted, and we'd encourage that future versions of the BWC policy describe that in more detail.

569
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:37,094
[SPEAKER_13]: The very purpose of law enforcement is to ensure accountability in our communities.

570
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:43,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine if the only thing an officer could do when a motorist was speeding was to pull them over and tell them they were speeding.

571
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:59,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Sharing how the Medford Police Department enforces accountability to this policy would only increase the public's confidence that the Medford Police Department and our city more broadly can use surveillance technology in a way that provides benefits while respecting our civil rights and liberties.

572
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

573
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,702
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle.

574
00:55:20,422 --> 00:55:29,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank the city councilors and the chief and his lieutenants for being willing to come here and discuss this important issue.

575
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:56,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I am here as a representative of both Safe Medford and the Mystic Valley NAACP to support the testimony given by people power and to request that the Medford Police Department's policies regarding body-worn cameras be amended to conform to the recommendations of the Law Enforcement Body Camera Task Force.

576
00:55:58,638 --> 00:56:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: In preparation for speaking here, I looked up the definition of surveillance and found this.

577
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:11,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Surveillance is the close observation, especially of a spy or a criminal.

578
00:56:13,868 --> 00:56:19,452
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is surveillance does not happen separate from racism.

579
00:56:20,193 --> 00:56:22,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Racism is encoded in surveillance.

580
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:33,223
[SPEAKER_07]: While white people feel protected by surveillance because of racism, people of color feel targeted and endangered.

581
00:56:34,884 --> 00:56:37,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Urban surveillance is policing.

582
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:43,587
[SPEAKER_07]: This form of policing is a new and crucial part of the civil rights battle.

583
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:50,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And surveillance negatively affects the lives and psyches of people of color.

584
00:56:51,082 --> 00:57:01,968
[SPEAKER_07]: How are people of color to feel they belong to America when they are viewed as potential criminals and their civil rights are ignored and even trampled on?

585
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:05,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Surveillance causes alienation.

586
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Students at high surveillance schools

587
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:21,924
[SPEAKER_07]: had lower math scores, higher suspension rates, and were significantly less likely to enroll in or graduate from college.

588
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:44,177
[SPEAKER_07]: For these reasons, Safe Medford and the Mystic Valley NAACP joins people power in requesting that the Medford Police Department's policies regarding body-worn cameras be amended to conform to the recommendations of the Massachusetts Task Force.

589
00:57:45,397 --> 00:57:50,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Surveillance threatens the rights of all of us to privacy and civil liberties.

590
00:57:51,560 --> 00:58:06,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Surveillance must be strictly regulated and controlled to help prevent a dystopian future in which everyone is considered a potential criminal spy or terrorist.

591
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:08,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

592
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:09,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

593
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

594
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:23,862
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is David Harris.

595
00:58:24,022 --> 00:58:27,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived at 151 Sharon Street, West Medford for 29 years.

596
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:33,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I chaired the Medford Human Rights Commission for over a decade, although I can't remember exactly how long.

597
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:36,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently chair of the Massachusetts Advisory Committee to the U.S.

598
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission on Civil Rights.

599
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a board member of the New England Innocence Project and former managing director of the Charles Hamilton Institute for Race and Justice.

600
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:53,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I was appreciative of the opportunity to testify last year as the city wrestled with questions arising from its use of technology.

601
00:58:54,141 --> 00:59:00,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I was disappointed in some aspects of the outcome, specifically related to body-worn cameras, but held out hope as we moved forward.

602
00:59:01,626 --> 00:59:09,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I concluded my remarks last year by saying there may be some wrinkles to iron out, but the ordinance in all its detail provides a reasonable and workable way forward.

603
00:59:11,003 --> 00:59:22,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here today to follow through on that hope with a focus on two specific wrinkles that privilege officers in ways that further undermine the legitimacy of policing as performed here in Medford.

604
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna begin with a personal anecdote.

605
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:35,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago in 2016, my wife and I awakened to find a note from our 16-year-old son that said simply, it happened again.

606
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubel Philando Castile.

607
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:42,019
[SPEAKER_01]: We did so and learned about the shooting.

608
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:50,362
[SPEAKER_01]: While the shooting itself shook us terribly, we were more disturbed by the fact that our son had to experience this news late at night by himself.

609
00:59:51,162 --> 00:59:56,844
[SPEAKER_01]: We realized there was no way we could protect him from such events, and he was reduced to saying, it happened again.

610
00:59:57,765 --> 00:59:59,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We could not protect him from this violence.

611
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:06,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I went on WBOR a few days later and was asked by Bob Oakes about the talk.

612
01:00:08,781 --> 01:00:13,964
[SPEAKER_01]: This, of course, has become a matter of American folklore, and people rant about it all the time.

613
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:23,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows about the talk black parents must have with their kids, especially their sons, about how to manage encounters with the police.

614
01:00:24,342 --> 01:00:32,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we ever had that talk with our son, but we had a different, more important, and more painful talk long before this happened.

615
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:40,612
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a talk about the nature of policing itself in the United States, its history and continuing disparate impact on black people.

616
01:00:41,312 --> 01:00:44,614
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not feel he needed to be told how to act around police.

617
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:49,658
[SPEAKER_01]: He needed to know policing was a failed practice and it had little, if any, legitimacy.

618
01:00:50,538 --> 01:00:53,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And we taught him to carry the name of an attorney in his wallet.

619
01:00:54,656 --> 01:01:05,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ask you tonight to reconsider two departures from past best practices and plain common sense that are part of the Medford Police Department's policies.

620
01:01:05,722 --> 01:01:10,825
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is the policy allowing officers to use their own discretion at times in the use of their cameras.

621
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:20,490
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be First Amendment or other questions raised, but the fundamental question has to do with why the public should trust the police with such discretion.

622
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:22,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me

623
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:28,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize if I've misunderstood something, because from what Chief Buckley said, this might not be the case.

624
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:38,670
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to me that with this new technology, it is better to proceed creating published rules and practices that eliminate or greatly constrain discretion around camera use.

625
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:47,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It may well be that at some point in the future, based on experience we have accumulated, we can identify certain circumstances or situations that would allow for such discretion.

626
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:54,515
[SPEAKER_01]: but we do not have enough experience to issue a blanket in the opinion of an officer privilege.

627
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:58,818
[SPEAKER_01]: The second concern is even more serious than we've heard about it today.

628
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:05,164
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with allowing officers to preview video footage before creating or submitting their statements on an incident.

629
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:10,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And worse still, to have an attorney present in an instance of possible police misconduct.

630
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:17,614
[SPEAKER_01]: This provision is wrong on so many levels, not least of which is the simple injustice of such access.

631
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:27,944
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past years, we've seen many instances in which police statements vary from video records, and that variation has exposed truths that are painful truths.

632
01:02:28,865 --> 01:02:38,797
[SPEAKER_01]: On one hand, we might think previewing would only help an officer recall events accurately, but it could also allow an officer or officers to create an alternative narrative.

633
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:53,843
[SPEAKER_01]: More disturbing still is the obvious advantage the practice creates over others and other involved parties, whether suspects or witnesses, who are left with only their own memories.

634
01:02:54,744 --> 01:03:00,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to think of many things more harmful, not only to the legitimacy, but to the simple notion of justice.

635
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:03,891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to imagine allowing this provision to stand.

636
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:07,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of the newly revised story we'll have to tell our children.

637
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:22,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, son, the police were granted legitimate use of force and the right to carry firearms are also advantaged over everyone else by getting to preview the body camera for footage that is intended to provide unbiased accounts of incidents.

638
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:26,659
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else will enjoy this privilege or this memory aid.

639
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:35,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know we have taught you that you must be fair and must play by the same rules, but policing in Medford is different.

640
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:41,111
[SPEAKER_01]: While many things are or can be complicated, these two are not.

641
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:44,693
[SPEAKER_01]: These wrinkles can be removed by simple elimination.

642
01:03:47,314 --> 01:03:47,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

643
01:03:55,819 --> 01:03:57,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there any further public participation?

644
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:11,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a raised hand on zoom so I'm just going to go to Emiliano.

645
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:11,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

646
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:36,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, dear committee, I am here today to talk about two issues that were mentioned today here.

647
01:04:37,472 --> 01:04:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is the body-worn cameras.

648
01:04:40,674 --> 01:04:44,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second one is, can you hear me?

649
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, can you just state your name and address for the record, please?

650
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:49,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

651
01:04:49,536 --> 01:04:50,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Emiliano Falcomarano.

652
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:53,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the policy counselor for the ACLU of Massachusetts.

653
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:56,769
[SPEAKER_08]: My address is 225 Center Street.

654
01:04:58,832 --> 01:04:59,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

655
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:07,411
[SPEAKER_08]: So, as I was mentioning before, I want to speak on two issues today.

656
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:14,658
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one being boy-worn cameras, and the second one being some issues related to purchasing data.

657
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:26,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the first one, I want to remind this committee that I was part of the law enforcement boy-worn camera task force that analyzed

658
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:31,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year and the year prior are the usable.

659
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:36,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I mandate from the legislator and we should have reported that.

660
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:46,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume everyone here here has seen and I want to stress that in section of 5.2 of this comedy in the.

661
01:05:49,573 --> 01:06:04,700
[SPEAKER_08]: section pertaining to Operation Sanders, it was recommended that users should not access or view any recording of an incident involving the user before the user is required to make a statement about the incident.

662
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:15,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason for this is that there was a lot of discussion in the committee, and almost every member of the committee voted in favor of including this recommendation.

663
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason that this was included

664
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:26,094
[SPEAKER_08]: was because the legislator mandated us to include this committee in the enabling statute.

665
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:35,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The legislator in the Police Reform Act of 2020 mandated the task force to basically impose this requirement.

666
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:41,288
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that police officers that were involved in an incident shouldn't be able to review

667
01:06:42,228 --> 01:06:54,079
[SPEAKER_08]: um the footage of the war on camera before giving their first statement um they can the recommendation of the of the task force implies that they can they should give the statement then they can see the um

668
01:06:55,629 --> 01:07:01,752
[SPEAKER_08]: their footage, and then they can give a second statement if they think that they have forgotten something.

669
01:07:02,032 --> 01:07:16,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason for this is that if there is a use of force by police officers and their body-worn cameras are supposed to be an accountability tool, they're not a surveillance tool, or they shouldn't be a surveillance tool.

670
01:07:17,139 --> 01:07:18,279
[SPEAKER_08]: They're an accountability tool.

671
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't make sense to

672
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:28,965
[SPEAKER_08]: allow police officers that are involved in incidents to review their footage before they give their incident.

673
01:07:29,286 --> 01:07:38,311
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't give this opportunity to any sort of defendant in the criminal justice system.

674
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:45,256
[SPEAKER_08]: When someone is called to a station to give a testimony or something of the sort, people are not shown all the evidence.

675
01:07:46,357 --> 01:07:56,611
[SPEAKER_08]: that's in the case, so this should not be different from police officers that are involved in this type of events.

676
01:07:57,398 --> 01:08:12,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, I want to talk a little bit about the use of body-worn cameras in protests, which, as we know, body-worn cameras should be activated in any sort of instance when there is interaction between police officers and people.

677
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:15,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there is a protest,

678
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:26,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the policy for policy leaves to the discretion of the police officer where to activate the camera if the officer believes that there might be some incident.

679
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:32,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to say that if there is an incident, then the camera should be used.

680
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:50,010
[SPEAKER_08]: to analyze how that incident went, but if there is no incident, that footage should not be reviewed and should be deleted immediately, because there are a lot of First Amendment concerns with having footage of peaceful people protesting, of course.

681
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:54,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And second, I want to mention that

682
01:08:55,235 --> 01:09:02,097
[SPEAKER_08]: the risks of bulk buying and purchasing data, particularly sensitive data like location data.

683
01:09:02,658 --> 01:09:17,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there was a discussion in the council before the CCOPS ordinance passed where there was a language that was removed, and the language prohibited the police department from acquiring data.

684
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:24,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say that the market of sensitive data is a very big market, and it's a very harmful market.

685
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:29,707
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, a 2020 investigation by Vice disclosed that the U.S.

686
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:39,971
[SPEAKER_08]: military has been purchasing user location data that was mined from a Muslim prayer app or dating apps that Muslim people use called Muslim Pro.

687
01:09:40,271 --> 01:09:44,513
[SPEAKER_08]: There are countless and countless of instances where the government is accessing and is

688
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:50,597
[SPEAKER_08]: circumventing the constitutional rights and buying and purchasing data.

689
01:09:51,878 --> 01:10:02,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think that this should be banned, that the police department shouldn't be able to buy location data or any other type of sensitive data.

690
01:10:02,525 --> 01:10:03,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

691
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:06,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

692
01:10:12,152 --> 01:10:13,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any further public participation?

693
01:10:21,265 --> 01:10:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Barry Ingler, 9 Draper Street.

694
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:32,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to follow up on what Emiliano was just talking about in regard to the purchasing of bulk data.

695
01:10:34,928 --> 01:10:55,363
[SPEAKER_09]: While the passage of the CCOPS ordinance last year was a great victory for Medford residents who care about privacy and justice, there is a loophole that remains regarding the city's potential purchase of commercially available surveillance data for law enforcement purposes.

696
01:10:57,525 --> 01:11:17,182
[SPEAKER_09]: At the last minute, just before the final hearing on the CCOPS ordinance, the city requested that city council delete a section of the ordinance, section 5080, that prohibited certain public-private contracts for the purchasing of privately generated and owned bulk surveillance data.

697
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:29,264
[SPEAKER_09]: The last minute request exempted the Medford Police Department from the section and allows the Medford Police Department to purchase both surveillance data, and we want this changed.

698
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:30,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

699
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:32,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

700
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:44,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor, Vice President Collins.

701
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:50,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chair Lazaro.

702
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:59,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Joining virtually, it's hard for me to see if there's others in the chambers that are going to speak, if that's the case, I'd happily defer.

703
01:12:02,504 --> 01:12:17,371
[SPEAKER_11]: But just wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who spoke and was present for sharing their reflections on the annual surveillance report and the body-worn camera policy, sharing questions, concerns, reflections.

704
01:12:18,432 --> 01:12:25,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I really want to thank Chief Buckley and his officers and lieutenants for being here to present, to receive, and to respond.

705
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:29,504
[SPEAKER_11]: These are hard conversations to have.

706
01:12:29,664 --> 01:12:32,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that this is the rubber hitting the road.

707
01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:35,271
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the process that we were

708
01:12:36,521 --> 01:12:42,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all of us worked very hard towards for several years before the passage of this ordinance.

709
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:49,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we are at the point where we look at the reports on the technologies that are being used.

710
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:52,624
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, it's just body-worn cameras.

711
01:12:52,644 --> 01:12:59,926
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only one that the city has that we'll be getting a report on until others are proposed and put forward and approved.

712
01:13:02,347 --> 01:13:03,107
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that

713
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:20,043
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the crucial precondition for being able to grow trust and transparency and to be able to improve outcomes and improve justice is being able to have these conversations in public, making the policies and the reporting public.

714
01:13:21,784 --> 01:13:35,659
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing the public to have access to at least an annual opportunity to go on the record, asking questions and responding and reflecting on these tools that are being added to policing and other city functions in our community.

715
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:40,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that is not the end goal.

716
01:13:40,985 --> 01:13:57,751
[SPEAKER_11]: The end goal is participating in this shared project of making sure that these policies are always a net positive for the community and making sure that those public safety improvements and those other benefits are distributed equitably around the community.

717
01:13:58,671 --> 01:13:59,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we're here to do.

718
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:00,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

719
01:14:01,315 --> 01:14:10,223
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everybody who is involved in debating, deliberating, negotiating, what would this ordinance, what would the structure that is created by this ordinance look like?

720
01:14:11,063 --> 01:14:12,645
[SPEAKER_11]: That was not itself an easy process.

721
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:17,068
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, again, want to thank everybody who was involved in that, the administration, the chief, my fellow colleagues.

722
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:23,374
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, this second chapter of implementing it is also difficult.

723
01:14:23,654 --> 01:14:27,037
[SPEAKER_11]: But I believe it's, you know, certainly as a city councilor, I think it's,

724
01:14:28,718 --> 01:14:38,546
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, our responsibility to when we hear from the community saying, you know, this this really nascent class of technologies are not simple.

725
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:40,648
[SPEAKER_11]: They are complex.

726
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,629
[SPEAKER_11]: They are problematic.

727
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:43,871
[SPEAKER_11]: They're demonstrated problematic in other communities.

728
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:46,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And Medford isn't a unicorn.

729
01:14:46,513 --> 01:14:48,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to make sure that we have the structures for

730
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:53,257
[SPEAKER_11]: bringing as much clarity and accountability to that process as we can.

731
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:57,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a responsibility to respond to that.

732
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is just the beginning of what that can look like.

733
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:07,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to appreciate everybody for starting this structure together.

734
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:11,124
[SPEAKER_11]: All of these surveillance technologies, in this case we're talking about body-worn cameras,

735
01:15:13,617 --> 01:15:19,861
[SPEAKER_11]: These technologies are being added to the field of policing because public safety is problematic.

736
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:22,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Policing is problematic because the world is changing around us.

737
01:15:23,362 --> 01:15:42,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is our responsibility to maximize public safety by using tools that are appropriate for the community in a way where we are continually, as a city, not singling out departments or individuals, but as a city, asking ourselves those questions that are ultimately impossible to really quantify.

738
01:15:43,493 --> 01:15:44,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is this helping?

739
01:15:44,893 --> 01:15:46,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is this making more vulnerable?

740
01:15:46,294 --> 01:15:47,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is this disproportionately affecting?

741
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:54,980
[SPEAKER_11]: We are, I think we have a requirement to ask ourselves those questions, even though it is hard to answer them.

742
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,684
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am really grateful to everybody who's a part of this process so that we can start out

743
01:16:03,765 --> 01:16:08,387
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, start with our best foot forward and saying these questions are going to be a part of this process.

744
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:14,669
[SPEAKER_11]: And for this committee meeting, these questions are being raised, these concerns are being raised.

745
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:22,512
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't end, you know, the outcome here in terms of the City Council's jurisdiction right now is not to make any changes to the policy.

746
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:23,312
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't do that.

747
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:45,340
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's very important that we're putting these concerns on record, and I'm really proud that we are collaborating with the administration, with the Medford Police Department, on a structure that really requires us to ask ourselves every year, and I know for the people using these technologies, it's a part of the day-to-day workflow.

748
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:52,263
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the goal, is to have it be a constant question of, what are the impacts of these on whom in the community?

749
01:16:52,783 --> 01:17:00,746
[SPEAKER_11]: making sure that this is a net positive for the community and really investigating how is that playing out.

750
01:17:05,028 --> 01:17:17,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to, before I make a motion to receive and place on file, unless there are other comments or questions from my fellow counselors and members of the public, I just wanted to preview for

751
01:17:19,788 --> 01:17:28,876
[SPEAKER_11]: everybody in the space what the process in terms of the annual timeline of the Community Control of Republic Surveillance timeline looks like from here on out.

752
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:41,987
[SPEAKER_11]: As I mentioned, the risks report that the police department submitted was the annual surveillance report because of the exemptions granted to body-worn cameras.

753
01:17:42,027 --> 01:17:46,611
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only report that is due for that technology.

754
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:59,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that the City Council has this in hand, per the ordinance, it is our responsibility to post by April 15 an annual public reporting that comes from the City Council side.

755
01:18:00,883 --> 01:18:02,623
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be on the city website.

756
01:18:02,663 --> 01:18:06,865
[SPEAKER_11]: This will also be available in print, just like the annual surveillance report is.

757
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:13,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It will cover the number of requests for approval for new surveillance technologies that are submitted to the City Council.

758
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:14,809
[SPEAKER_11]: This number will be zero.

759
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:19,833
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of times the City Council approved requests for new surveillance technologies.

760
01:18:20,453 --> 01:18:21,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this will be zero.

761
01:18:22,315 --> 01:18:25,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of times the City Council rejected requests for new surveillance technologies.

762
01:18:26,778 --> 01:18:31,202
[SPEAKER_11]: There were also no new requests for surveillance technology that were requested.

763
01:18:33,704 --> 01:18:43,210
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2023, the number of times the City Council requested modifications to surveillance impact reports or surveillance use policies for new surveillance technologies.

764
01:18:44,431 --> 01:18:50,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, because there were no surveillance technologies approved or rejected by the City Council in 2023,

765
01:18:53,477 --> 01:19:03,700
[SPEAKER_11]: All of those sections will be irrelevant for this reporting cycle, but that annual public reporting for which the city council is responsible will include this annual surveillance report.

766
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:15,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And in future years, if the city is ever using more than one surveillance technology that is eligible under this ordinance, it will include all surveillance reports that are submitted to the city council.

767
01:19:15,965 --> 01:19:22,707
[SPEAKER_11]: So over time, this will be the community's repository for aggregating

768
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: data and feedback and reporting documentation on how surveillance technology, what surveillance technology is being proposed to the community.

769
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:39,576
[SPEAKER_11]: the community's reaction to it, and then documentation of those approvals and how it's being used.

770
01:19:39,656 --> 01:19:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to mention that in terms of, we've had this meeting, we've had a discussion, we've discussed the body-worn camera policy, concerns have been raised, accolades have been raised, the report has been submitted, what happens next?

771
01:19:52,326 --> 01:20:01,413
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just another piece of documentation that comes from the city council side to create another benchmark for documentation around this surveillance technology.

772
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:16,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, I just want to again say thank you to Chief Buckley for being here, for the presentation, for answering all of our questions, for the reflection, for always being available when we do have questions about this.

773
01:20:16,924 --> 01:20:27,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I also really want to thank all the community members who attended this meeting to reflect on this policy and to say that your concerns are heard.

774
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:33,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I would make a motion to receive the report and place it on file.

775
01:20:35,763 --> 01:20:37,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

776
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:44,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan did have one comment to make before we vote on that motion.

777
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan?

778
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:45,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

779
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: As one of the councilors who was not involved in passing the CCOPS ordinance, I would appreciate Chief Buckley responding to the two

780
01:20:57,008 --> 01:21:03,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, variance is places where we differ from the state recommendation, um, that have been mentioned multiple times.

781
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:18,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So allowing police involved in a miss in a misconduct report, um, to preview the footage and secondly, purchasing bulk data and why, um, what the reasons are that those exceptions were, uh, asked for.

782
01:21:24,857 --> 01:21:39,705
[SPEAKER_05]: the Middlesex District Attorney's office as well as other district attorneys across the commonwealth have basically suggested both plainly stated and uh, letters to the chiefs of police that they want their police officers watching more camera videos.

783
01:21:40,465 --> 01:21:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not a police department in the commonwealth of Massachusetts that I am aware of that has that in place right now.

784
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:52,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand there was a commission put together and there were recommendations, but

785
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Time has moved on and this is where the standard is.

786
01:21:55,561 --> 01:21:59,464
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually written in the quote from the Middlesex District Attorney is in this policy.

787
01:22:02,346 --> 01:22:06,148
[SPEAKER_05]: The second part is, I don't even know how to answer this about bulk data.

788
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:07,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you're talking about.

789
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:14,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why someone from the ACLU comes on and accuses me of purchasing bulk data and working with the military.

790
01:22:14,053 --> 01:22:18,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we came in here with a pretty, like the police department.

791
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:25,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We work well, I had objections that were reasonable to the C-Cops ordinance.

792
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I came here tonight saying, this is good, this is a good process.

793
01:22:29,548 --> 01:22:33,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I can listen to constituents, I can hear what they wanna say about the voting on cameras and I can adapt.

794
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:37,713
[SPEAKER_05]: But we ended with accusing me of like being what, a military spy?

795
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:39,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Surveillance spy?

796
01:22:41,315 --> 01:22:42,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what we think of our police department?

797
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:44,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where tonight we're not at?

798
01:22:45,137 --> 01:22:50,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is someone who's not a Medford resident being allowed to accuse their chief of police of working with the US military?

799
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair, do we have an answer?

800
01:22:57,212 --> 01:22:57,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, no.

801
01:22:58,492 --> 01:23:04,336
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that the lawyer from the ACLU worked with Medford People Power and was part of the conversation.

802
01:23:04,456 --> 01:23:06,417
[SPEAKER_05]: They can work with Medford People Power all they want.

803
01:23:06,597 --> 01:23:07,817
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in a public hearing right now.

804
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just accused your chief of police of inappropriate behavior.

805
01:23:14,761 --> 01:23:22,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just going to tell you, this should be a process where we are working together, right?

806
01:23:23,508 --> 01:23:26,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I can answer questions, I came here, I brought my team to answer questions.

807
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:31,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the questions that were asked are very clearly defined in here.

808
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,551
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not, it's prohibited to record during demonstrations.

809
01:23:36,351 --> 01:23:45,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The discretion is to allow, if a police officer does see criminal behavior or something that is going to lead to something, to record, because that is what the recommendation is.

810
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The discretion is to turn the camera off.

811
01:23:47,834 --> 01:23:52,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a discretion to record those who are protesting.

812
01:23:55,102 --> 01:24:05,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I will just say that public participation is, we are very open with the way that the public is allowed to interact with the city council in Medford.

813
01:24:06,454 --> 01:24:12,300
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't police the way that people speak to the council in any way.

814
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,902
[SPEAKER_12]: They can say anything they want.

815
01:24:14,585 --> 01:24:27,743
[SPEAKER_12]: So sometimes people will say things, and this was a decision by the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts last year.

816
01:24:30,178 --> 01:24:30,578
[SPEAKER_12]: believe me.

817
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:45,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I apologize for how that may have come across, that's, we can only speak for the Medford City Council but public participation is still a big part of the way that City Council meetings operate.

818
01:24:47,937 --> 01:24:49,718
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I can only speak for myself.

819
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:58,984
[SPEAKER_12]: We as the Medford City Council are here to hear from the public and hear from our departments and hopefully we're all willing to work together.

820
01:24:59,524 --> 01:25:06,168
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the goal here is to just see the report and talk about the report.

821
01:25:06,608 --> 01:25:07,909
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do apologize.

822
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:14,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry that that came across the way that it did, but that's our reality.

823
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:20,322
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do come across, maybe someone should stand up and say that that is not what is going on in our city.

824
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:26,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what the life expectancy of a career of a chief of police in Massachusetts is right now?

825
01:25:26,726 --> 01:25:28,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably less than two years.

826
01:25:28,127 --> 01:25:29,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going on six.

827
01:25:29,228 --> 01:25:32,470
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why you don't have chiefs of police staying around.

828
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:37,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You get accused of stuff, and all you're trying to do is make the community better.

829
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:38,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I came here tonight.

830
01:25:38,473 --> 01:25:39,674
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a good event.

831
01:25:39,914 --> 01:25:41,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm leaving here ticked off.

832
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:42,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to.

833
01:25:42,825 --> 01:25:44,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's nothing to do with them.

834
01:25:45,287 --> 01:25:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I could answer all of their questions of back and forth.

835
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:59,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to talk with you about this afterwards, but I'm empathizing with you very deeply.

836
01:26:00,377 --> 01:26:06,741
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that being said, we do have a motion on the floor to receive and place on file, but does Councilor Callahan have more that you'd like to say?

837
01:26:06,781 --> 01:26:07,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Councilor Callahan.

838
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I certainly hope you didn't feel like I accused you.

839
01:26:11,468 --> 01:26:15,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard many people here who simply asked about the purchasing of bulk data.

840
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my only question.

841
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the two questions, the first one that you answered, I do appreciate that.

842
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:28,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like you don't actually know anything about the purchasing of bulk data or why that all I recall, sorry.

843
01:26:29,638 --> 01:26:38,840
[SPEAKER_05]: All I recall about that purchase is I believe, and I have to go back, this is a little while now, that the city attorney believed that that was illegal to put in the process.

844
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't recall anything about data.

845
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:44,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recall working with the US military and acquiring data.

846
01:26:44,061 --> 01:26:46,782
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, we're not doing any of that sort of stuff.

847
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And to think that we would do it is just, I don't know what to say.

848
01:26:53,824 --> 01:26:57,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We work pretty hard to be accountable to this community.

849
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:58,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Accountable is the first sentence.

850
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:07,603
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I didn't put it in a three sentence response to nine questions that I didn't write or you didn't write, right?

851
01:27:08,903 --> 01:27:10,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very accountable to this community.

852
01:27:11,405 --> 01:27:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I will come here at any sort of time, but I'm not gonna come here and be accused of just total nonsense.

853
01:27:17,389 --> 01:27:17,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

854
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:18,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

855
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I think that the chair stated it very well.

856
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:26,275
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no ability to,

857
01:27:28,044 --> 01:27:42,691
[SPEAKER_02]: change or demand make demands on what people can say public comment is quite common that people come say public comment things that are accusatory toward a city councilors or are completely inaccurate and not in any way true.

858
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:47,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is simply nothing that we can do because that is the way that public comment works in the state of Massachusetts.

859
01:27:48,994 --> 01:27:56,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that in the future, you will just allow those things that there's nothing else to do about them, unfortunately.

860
01:27:57,803 --> 01:28:06,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that if you have any issues with the way the city counselors are interacting with you, then we would love to address those ways.

861
01:28:07,613 --> 01:28:09,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly did not have any intention

862
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:12,277
[SPEAKER_02]: of having any accusation.

863
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:19,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply wanted to address the two issues that had come up from many of the people here who spoke from that particular hour.

864
01:28:19,982 --> 01:28:25,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may have seen that I was walking up to the podium and then you went back and then it went on.

865
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was going to voluntarily answer those questions.

866
01:28:28,731 --> 01:28:29,651
[SPEAKER_05]: They are pretty straightforward.

867
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:40,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the district attorney, I believe that they have met with a core group of judges, and it's written in here exactly why and what they believe is why we should be reviewing and watching our body-worn cameras.

868
01:28:42,003 --> 01:28:44,065
[SPEAKER_05]: to some extent that makes sense, right?

869
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:50,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're gonna abide by what the district attorney tells us we have to do when it comes to that process.

870
01:28:50,953 --> 01:28:53,095
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue in demonstrations I think is being misread.

871
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:54,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a prohibited action.

872
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:57,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's listed in here under prohibited actions.

873
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,083
[SPEAKER_05]: All purchases, follow what you're talking about.

874
01:29:03,966 --> 01:29:04,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, so.

875
01:29:06,112 --> 01:29:07,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the clarification on that.

876
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:13,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we would have invited you either way to come back up and clarify those questions.

877
01:29:13,356 --> 01:29:14,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I appreciate it.

878
01:29:15,036 --> 01:29:16,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't want to it.

879
01:29:16,677 --> 01:29:17,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.

880
01:29:17,097 --> 01:29:19,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

881
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:35,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Councilor saying on the motion to receive and place on file by Vice President Collins and seconded by Councilor saying and to adjourn Vice President Collins.

882
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:38,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

883
01:29:39,444 --> 01:29:45,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on the motion to receive in place on file and adjourn by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

884
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call, please.

885
01:29:51,614 --> 01:29:51,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

886
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

887
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:52,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

888
01:29:53,436 --> 01:29:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this meeting is adjourned.
