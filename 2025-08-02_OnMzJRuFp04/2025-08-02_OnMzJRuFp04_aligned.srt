1
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:08,336
But let's begin tonight with a young man by the name of Donald Aloysius Trump.

2
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:27,924
As you know, this young man has been embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal and did what anybody who is innocent when facing an accusation of this type, did what anybody who is innocent would do.

3
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,005
He fled the country.

4
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,825
He fled the country, taking a jaunt to bonnie old Scotland.

5
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,445
That's probably not the right accent.

6
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:50,808
To leave his troubles in the United States behind and finally gain an ocean's distance between himself and the Epstein scandal.

7
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,228
And focus on his new trade deal with the EU.

8
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,069
I'm sorry, yes, you there, from the Inverness Castle Times.

9
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:03,667
Mr. President, was part of the rush to get this deal done to not let Jeffrey Epstein's story out?

10
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:04,867
Oh, you gotta be kidding with that.

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,933
Donald Trump, he's all like, how did you even hear about it?

12
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,595
I thought, I thought you guys just got Baywatch like three months ago.

13
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:34,098
Doesn't anybody here have a question about this trade deal sinking both of our economies with tariffs?

14
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:40,185
How high do I have to make the tariffs before you guys shut the f*** up about Epstein?

15
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:48,254
But of course, how do you expect the media to move on when even Trump has trouble doing so?

16
00:01:49,417 --> 00:02:05,945
So it was, on the day of striking a trade deal with the EU, Donald Trump presented, once more, this time for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, his classic Epstein defense, 13 reasons why I'm not involved with the pedophile.

17
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,728
Those files were run by the worst scum on earth.

18
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,909
If they had something, they would have released.

19
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,751
Now, they can easily put something in the files that's a phony.

20
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,947
Which is why I can't release it.

21
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,028
It's simple.

22
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:25,750
If I, Donald Trump, was in the files, they would have released it.

23
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,611
So clearly, I'm not in the files.

24
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,413
But of course, I'm clearly in the files.

25
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:35,476
Which makes them phony.

26
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:39,158
I mean, what do they even have on Trump?

27
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,039
A creepy drawing Trump gave to Epstein?

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,100
Please.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,881
I don't do drawings.

30
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,562
I'm not a drawing person.

31
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:59,275
Your Honor, I submit to the court, if there is one thing I would never do, it is draw.

32
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:05,258
As you know, I suffer from tiny hands.

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,741
I cannot physically even perform the task of drawing.

34
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,084
I do not possess the motor skills and muscle strength required.

35
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,386
I cannot draw, not now.

36
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:22,620
Not ever!

37
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:31,585
Although... Sometimes people say, would you draw a building and I'll draw four lines and a little roof, you know, for a charity.

38
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,587
But I'm not a drawing person.

39
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,188
I don't do drawings of women.

40
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:37,609
That I can tell you.

41
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,771
I mean, sometimes people would say, would you draw a woman?

42
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:46,755
I'd draw a parentheses for breasts and a triangle for Bush for charity.

43
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,717
For charity.

44
00:03:52,016 --> 00:04:00,481
I wouldn't call them drawings, more of a cubist pastiche of punctuation and geometric shapes to trick the eye.

45
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,564
Some would see a naked woman, of course.

46
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:14,571
Others would see an old woman holding a falcon, riding a hoverboard with a triangle for a vagina.

47
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:15,472
Look, the point is this.

48
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,334
I don't draw.

49
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:25,161
In Trump's defense, he did end his relationship with Epstein in the aughts.

50
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,242
Perhaps a look into why he ended it will exonerate Trump.

51
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:36,744
That's such old history, very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it.

52
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,625
He did something that was inappropriate.

53
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:45,347
What he said was Epstein had done something inappropriate, and that's why they're no longer friends.

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,882
You see, Donald Trump recognized that Epstein had finally crossed the line.

55
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:56,425
Now, if it were me, obviously, giving this explanation in front of reporters, I probably would have stopped there.

56
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:04,329
But since I am not,

57
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:11,804
And Trump went on to describe Epstein's inappropriate behavior.

58
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:16,305
And wait till you hear what was the Rubicon that Epstein crossed.

59
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:17,805
He hired help.

60
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,366
And I said, don't ever do that again.

61
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,446
He stole people that work for me.

62
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,827
I said, don't ever do that again.

63
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,627
He did it again.

64
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,867
And I threw him out of the place.

65
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,728
Persona non grata.

66
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:30,608
Yes.

67
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,249
You all know him as Jeffrey Epstein, the sex trafficker.

68
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,412
But I knew his dark side.

69
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:58,564
He was... I mean, the sex trafficking, I was like, okay.

70
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:04,929
But he was also a low-level employee poacher.

71
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:12,756
And that, I cannot have.

72
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,276
Anyway, Mr. President, do you want to slice this bologna any thinner?

73
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:22,517
By the way, I never went to the island, and Bill Clinton went there supposedly 28 times.

74
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:36,440
You expect me to believe that Bill Clinton went to the island only 28 times?

75
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,236
No way.

76
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:58,352
I mean, if anybody had VIP Diamond Island status, there's probably still parrots alive on that island going, hey, Bill, back again.

77
00:06:58,432 --> 00:06:59,853
Hey, Bill.

78
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:00,774
Hey, Bill.

79
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,436
How you doing, Bill?

80
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,117
What's up, Bill?

81
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,485
But here... Yeah.

82
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:18,965
It's okay.

83
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:19,665
It's okay.

84
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:20,325
I'm okay.

85
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:26,709
That is truly the best parrot impression you'll hear.

86
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,430
Here comes my favorite part of the defense.

87
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:41,534
Trump's ego and narcissism are so central to his being that even his denial of going to the island comes with a caveat.

88
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,376
I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down.

89
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,317
The privilege?

90
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:51,918
What the f***?

91
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,200
Hey, Donald, want to go to the island this weekend?

92
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,941
Well, first of all, Jeffrey,

93
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:01,399
Thank you for thinking of me.

94
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:12,789
Unfortunately, that's the weekend that the teen pageant that I bought is installing the indoor security locker room cabinets.

95
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,211
Really?

96
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,036
But luckily for Trump, it wasn't all Epstein-related pressers.

97
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,140
He was able to get in some of his beloved whack-a-ball.

98
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:30,003
Mr. Trump, are you enjoying the Scottish hospitality?

99
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,045
Are you enjoying the Scottish hospitality?

100
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:36,806
See?

101
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:37,967
There you are.

102
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:38,707
Are you enjoying?

103
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:40,528
Get in my belly.

104
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,628
Are you enjoying?

105
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,269
There you go.

106
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,710
That's what it's about.

107
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,211
That's got to soothe Trump's soul.

108
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:52,333
Mr. Trump, can you escape the Jeffrey Epstein crisis?

109
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:08,893
Is Epstein what they yell in Scotland instead of four?

110
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:11,879
Epstein!

111
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,670
Boy, this is, you know, this is tough.

112
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,811
To extend the golf metaphor, Trump finds himself in the rough.

113
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:27,135
But he's a championship-caliber golfsman, battle-tested, and I think we all know how the best golfers in the world get out of a bad lie.

114
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,216
Donald Trump being busted cheating at golf.

115
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:36,078
We can see a caddy dropping a ball there for the president while he played at one of his courses in Scotland.

116
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,541
When the going gets tough,

117
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,184
The tough pay someone to cheat for you.

118
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:51,749
But this moment on the course, seemingly random, could not be more representative of Trump's entire existence.

119
00:09:52,029 --> 00:10:02,578
He moves with complete confidence in this world because he requires that everyone in his orbit do whatever they can, including cheating, to ensure that things go Trump's way.

120
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:03,658
This has been his whole life.

121
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,220
Don't want to go to Vietnam?

122
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,822
Get a podiatrist friend of the family to bone spur you up.

123
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,928
Your casino is failing?

124
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,550
Perhaps daddy can illegally float you three million in chips to try and save it.

125
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,910
Impeached for an attempted coup?

126
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,312
Your caddy today is the Kentucky Fried Reaper.

127
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,357
Never like to speak ill of the dead.

128
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,538
Why would you even say that?

129
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:54,124
And obviously for the Epstein case, Trump has no shortage of caddies willing to shame themselves.

130
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,207
Here's Congressman Tim Burchett, pre-Trump,

131
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,313
being named in the files.

132
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:06,116
Congressman, why do you think so many Democrats are committed to protecting the list of a dead pedophile?

133
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:11,579
Too many of my colleagues, I'm afraid, are compromised in this area for whatever reason.

134
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,780
The trash can is very deep.

135
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,381
It's not a swamp.

136
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,421
It's an open sewer.

137
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:18,842
It's a sewer.

138
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,983
Democrats are all over the plane logs.

139
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:21,943
It's an open sewer.

140
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,965
I'm sorry, Trump was also on Epstein's plane?

141
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,766
Need a ball drop over here?

142
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:32,907
You know, President Trump admitted that he flew on his dadgum plane.

143
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:36,929
Just because somebody flew on a plane doesn't mean they're a dadgum pedophile.

144
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:38,209
Wow.

145
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:38,530
You know what?

146
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,492
I always find that the worse it is, the folksier they get.

147
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:52,016
Well, Mr. Trump, he's not a dadgum, gosh darn, dagnabbit pedophile.

148
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,958
I mean, kiss my grits.

149
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:01,538
I'll guarantee you, he's not using that terminology in other sex offender cases.

150
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,939
Well, gosh darn, if Diddy ain't two biscuits short of a country biscuit.

151
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,082
He's two biscuits short of a country breakfast, but that don't make everyone at the freak off cracker-barrelers.

152
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:23,993
I honestly think my favorite thing about this is watching conspiracy theorists have to unravel the red string that they themselves originally strung out.

153
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:30,397
Here's the OG conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck at his excitement for Trump's beginning of the second term.

154
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,324
The only thing I care about is the scandal of the pedophiles.

155
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:40,127
And in the next 10 days, you're going to see the Epstein file released.

156
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,189
Day number one, Cash Patel walks in.

157
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,551
By the end of the day, it will be released.

158
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:46,972
Day one!

159
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,434
Deep state exposed.

160
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,415
Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,255
Trump's in the rough?

162
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:54,717
I'll get right on that ball drop.

163
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,820
What the left is saying, and some people now on his team are saying,

164
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:00,752
He's in the report.

165
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:03,534
With 15-year-olds?

166
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:04,976
Really?

167
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:07,258
Do you actually believe that?

168
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,324
I have seen some clips that would be consistent with...

169
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,089
did buy a teenage beauty pageant.

170
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,573
But listen, Beck, you're the master at making connections, so let's see you unconnected.

171
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:26,534
I mean, let's be honest.

172
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:36,141
20 years ago, if, you know, this was like, hey, he was on an island with 25-year-old models, I would be going, probably.

173
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,942
OK?

174
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,044
15, 16-year-olds, that's not Donald Trump.

175
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,785
It's not Donald Trump.

176
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:43,606
I don't believe that.

177
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:45,468
Do you?

178
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,600
I say, that's, no way that's true.

179
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,742
You can't, what, no!

180
00:13:55,302 --> 00:14:01,604
You're not, there's no magic X. You can't just magic X conspiracy.

181
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:05,626
There's white people being replaced by voting illegal immigrants.

182
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,106
No!

183
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,187
The X has spoken.

184
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:14,709
But of course, Trump's caddies can't do everything, and it's given Democrats hope.

185
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,657
that they finally have Donald Trump.

186
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:27,021
For so long, the Democrats have been Wile E. Coyote to Donald Trump's Roadrunner.

187
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,643
The Democrats thought they had Trump with the felony convictions.

188
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,944
They thought they had Trump with the Access Hollywood tape.

189
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,024
But every time he got away.

190
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:52,104
But now, with the reporting on the Epstein files, the only way that this guy wiggles out of this one is if, for some reason, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell swears under oath that Trump had nothing to do with it.

191
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,066
But why would she do that?

192
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,750
Coyote, you finally got the roadrunner.

193
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:04,856
Mr. President, if I could completely rule out a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell who landed, is that something you would ever consider?

194
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:05,877
Pardon for who?

195
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:06,958
For Ghislaine Maxwell.

196
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:15,464
Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon.

197
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:23,070
As we said, Trump is in Scotland right now, seeing as his favorite island destination has been shut down.

198
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:41,567
When a president travels overseas, it's important for them to project strength and dignity, although an uninvited insect made that a little harder for President Trump.

199
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:59,015
Damn, girl, you got moved.

200
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,138
What is this?

201
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,340
Is he voguing?

202
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:14,807
Shoo fly sashay away.

203
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,212
Feels like Trump's accidental dance moves are way more impressive than his intentional ones.

204
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:25,695
Very weird.

205
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,956
Anyway, I do understand why he was so frantic.

206
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:31,937
That mosquito was also asking Trump about Jeffrey Epstein.

207
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:37,659
Now, to be clear, Trump was not just wasting time playing golf.

208
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:40,320
He was also wasting time profiting off golf.

209
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,942
The president capping off his trip by officially opening his latest golf course today in Scotland.

210
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:46,822
Let's go.

211
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,343
One, two, three.

212
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:02,209
Just a reminder, this man is still the president of the United States.

213
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,515
There's a lot going on in the world, and he's at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to promote his golf course?

214
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:12,758
Is this his side hustle, or is America his side hustle?

215
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,179
Who knows?

216
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
I have no idea.

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,662
The point is, we're just used to this now.

218
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:23,928
But imagine if when Obama was in office, he kept flying on Air Force One to open up Pizza Hut Taco Bell franchises.

219
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:33,920
I, uh, want to announce, we killed Bin Laden, and the new Chalupa is half price at 3 p.m.

220
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,082
Liv Moss.

221
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:37,323
Not you, Bin Laden.

222
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:45,953
But don't worry, while Trump was in Scotland, his administration was busy with the hard work of making things weird at home.

223
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:52,157
Looks like the Trump administration is encouraging federal workers to talk about their religion in the workplace.

224
00:17:52,237 --> 00:18:05,089
A memo from the Office of Personnel Management cites the guidance as being protected by the First Amendment and says employees can tell others to rethink their beliefs, but they must stop if their co-workers tell them to.

225
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:06,348
No.

226
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,649
No, absolutely not.

227
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:14,651
If you're going to approach me at work and ask, have you heard the good news, it better mean there are donuts in the break room.

228
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,711
Otherwise, keep it moving, Zachariah.

229
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:25,714
Can you imagine how humiliating it would be to have your fundamental worldview changed by Susan from accounting?

230
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,535
And who would have the balls to convert a co-worker?

231
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,376
I don't even feel comfortable telling my co-worker she should get bangs.

232
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:34,005
She should, though.

233
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,186
Stacey, you should get bangs.

234
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,227
You need bangs.

235
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,433
But Trump's biggest achievement this week was the trade deal he announced with the European Union.

236
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:47,699
And since we all know Trump is so good at deals, it means everything is now going to be cheaper.

237
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:48,595
The U.S.

238
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:52,979
will impose a 15% tariff on most European products we import.

239
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:58,704
American businesses will pay those tariffs and pass the cost along to consumers by raising prices.

240
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:05,890
It is amazing what individual products we could see impacted here from autos to Botox as a result of these tariffs.

241
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,814
Wow, oh my God, that's wild.

242
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,875
Everything from automobiles to Botox?

243
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:17,576
Am I pronouncing that right?

244
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,677
Is that right?

245
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:20,778
I don't know, I'm not there yet.

246
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,262
Just not there yet, don't Google it.

247
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:38,425
But okay, the trade deal is gonna make things more expensive, which makes you wonder, what are we getting out of these tariffs anyway?

248
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:46,730
We have so much money coming in, we're thinking about a little rebate, a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.

249
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,211
Okay.

250
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,633
Now this is the art of the deal.

251
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:56,839
Everyone pays more for everything, and then a few of us maybe get a little bit of our money back.

252
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:01,103
Man, this guy is always playing 5D, hitting yourself in the balls.

253
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:06,375
Keep in mind, Trump also promised rebate checks from Doge.

254
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:11,561
But all we got out of that was Trump calling Elon Musk a drug addict and Elon saying Trump was a pedophile.

255
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,002
You know what?

256
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:12,482
Never mind.

257
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,984
That actually is better than a rebate.

258
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:17,809
So yeah.

259
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,450
Yeah.

260
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:24,011
The whole thing is just a mess, and you know who I feel worse for?

261
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,714
Those poor penguins who we tariffed who now have to suck d**k for rent money.

262
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:36,140
Let's start with Christine Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security and woman who keeps insisting that she and her daughter get mistaken for sisters.

263
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:44,587
She was down in Argentina this week to sign an important visa agreement, so as you would expect, this is the video she released.

264
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,514
Was that government diplomacy or a Valtrex ad?

265
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:13,058
I won't let sores stop me from getting in the saddle.

266
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,462
Can you imagine how nervous that horse was?

267
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:24,047
Remember, Christy Noem shot her dog for talking back and then shot her goat to get rid of the witnesses.

268
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:30,632
She was petting that horse like, this could go one of two ways, Seabiscuit.

269
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,874
I dare you to give me a reason.

270
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:39,941
All kidding aside, breaking news, we actually scored an exclusive interview with that very horse.

271
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,041
Let's go live via satellite to Kristi Noem's horse.

272
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:44,322
Oh.

273
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:47,022
Oh, no.

274
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:48,323
Oh.

275
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:50,904
This is awkward.

276
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:51,484
Never mind.

277
00:21:52,804 --> 00:22:03,227
Let's move on to the Environmental Protection Agency, which used to protect the environment but is now run by this man, Lee Zeldin, seen here watching an oil tanker crash into a coral reef.

278
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:09,437
And he's telling the environment, hey girl, it just feels better without protection.

279
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:14,276
A stunning reversal that could have unprecedented climate impact.

280
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:21,298
The EPA is now looking to repeal a 2009 study linking man-made climate change to health hazards.

281
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:29,141
The 2009 declaration has served as the basis for climate regulations, like limiting emissions from cars and power plants.

282
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:38,285
Now the White House is rolling it back in what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is calling the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.

283
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,462
All right, this is crazy.

284
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,824
What kind of EPA chief wants to make the environment worse?

285
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:48,786
Does he have that Munchausen by proxy thing where he gets off on making the planet sicker?

286
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:52,367
Oh, Earth, you're coughing again.

287
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:56,689
Here, take these special vitamins that are definitely not poison.

288
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,011
But look, how would Zeldin know that climate change was a problem?

289
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,632
It's not like he can just look at what's right in front of him.

290
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:18,153
EPA is proposing to rescind the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment funding to eliminate all of the greenhouse gas emissions regulations that followed, including electric vehicle mandates.

291
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:22,837
126 degrees, or as we'll call it in 20 years, winter.

292
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:23,918
Gosh, in 20 years, I'll be 35.

293
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:24,218
Oh, yikes.

294
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:32,559
Don't Google it.

295
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,945
Let's move on to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the only man who says, I'm all ears and means it.

296
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:46,273
The State Department's latest target is something very close to my heart, cervix.

297
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:55,262
The government may destroy almost $10 million worth of birth control bought with tax dollars instead of sending it to women overseas.

298
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,684
It's sitting in a warehouse in Belgium right now.

299
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:01,447
And most of these items don't expire for another two to three years.

300
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:08,193
But the State Department says they may have to burn all of this birth control now that USAID has been dismantled.

301
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,295
Officials say it'll cost almost $170,000 to destroy all of those contraceptives.

302
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,995
Are you fucking kidding me?

303
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:27,420
They would rather spend $170,000 to destroy $10 million worth of birth control that they already bought rather than give it to women who need it?

304
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,101
At least sell it.

305
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:30,262
You're Donald Trump.

306
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,842
Just slap your name on it.

307
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:37,405
Call them Trump cooter shooters and rake in enough cash to pay down the national debt.

308
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:37,945
I don't know.

309
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:39,186
Figure it out.

310
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:48,669
This is why people should start stocking up on birth control now.

311
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:54,092
Personally, I always have at least seven to nine IUDs implanted at all times.

312
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,634
You never know when the girl in the next stall is going to need one.

313
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:04,958
And finally, let's move on to Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary who puts the tank in another Tanqueray, please.

314
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:09,301
He's only been on the job for a few months, but he's already looking for a promotion.

315
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:18,070
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has privately discussed running for political office next year, specifically for governor in his home state of Tennessee.

316
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,531
Wow, Pete!

317
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,531
What an awesome idea!

318
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,732
You'd be a great governor of Tennessee.

319
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:31,974
I am so sorry, Tennessee, but you're just going to have to take one for the team on this.

320
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:33,255
Thank you.

321
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,381
Oh yeah, wow, it makes so much sense.

322
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,522
You should just leave now and go do it.

323
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:40,662
In fact, why waste time?

324
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:42,003
You should resign yesterday.

325
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,846
Tennessee, we are never gonna forget you.

326
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:47,926
R.I.P.

327
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:08,295
Now, whether Pete would be a good governor or not, he could definitely use a change of scenery, because after six months of dealing with leakers in the Defense Department, he's kind of starting to lose it.

328
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:18,482
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has finally earned a rare rebuke from the White House over his obsessive paranoia about leakers inside the Pentagon.

329
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:24,707
Hegseth was directed by the White House to stop using polygraph tests to search for people leaking information to the media.

330
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:31,591
That's right, Hexeth has been polygraphing so many people, the White House had to tell him to stop.

331
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:39,077
Do you know how paranoid you have to be for even Trump to be like, calm down, not everything's a witch hunt?

332
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:44,772
And by the way, who's Pete Hegseth to be accusing other people of leaking?

333
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:48,215
He's like, if you've got something to say, you don't text a reporter.

334
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:52,039
You come to me, and then I'll leak it to a reporter on a signal chat.

335
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,660
That's the protocol, people.

336
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,981
That's the protocol.

337
00:26:55,262 --> 00:27:00,867
For the past few weeks, the national conversation has been totally dominated by the Jeffrey Epstein story.

338
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:05,911
But who would have thought that the thing that knocked it off the top of the charts would be Sidney Sweeney?

339
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:11,554
doing the most laid-back line delivery I've ever seen in my life.

340
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:20,038
Jeans are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.

341
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,620
My jeans are blue.

342
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,161
Sidney Sweeney, Casper Jeans.

343
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:32,684
Jeans.

344
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,885
Jeans are passed down.

345
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:38,805
My John's are blah.

346
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,545
I love my blah.

347
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:42,506
John's, John's, John's, blah.

348
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:45,347
I love her so much.

349
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,448
OK, so there were a bunch of different reactions to this ad.

350
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:52,949
Some people thought, yeah, pretty standard ad where a hot person tells you to buy stuff.

351
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:58,050
Other people were like, wow, Desi, I saw you in that jeans ad, and you looked great.

352
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,371
And then I had to be like, no, that was Sidney Sweeney.

353
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,572
It's a common mistake.

354
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:09,335
Anyway, but then there was another reaction online, which is that the ad wasn't just selling jeans.

355
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,056
It was also subtly promoting white supremacy.

356
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:16,819
And as you can imagine, that spawned an incredible right-wing backlash.

357
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,882
What these left-wingers don't know is that they are revealing themselves to be the actual racists here, racists against white people.

358
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,824
They're mad because she's young, hot, healthy, white, and blonde.

359
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:30,446
Liberals just, they just hate hot people.

360
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,306
They just do.

361
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:32,066
Yeah.

362
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,127
Yeah, that's a great point.

363
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,020
It's a great point.

364
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,801
It's a great point.

365
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,966
I thought they just hated meat and freedom, but they also hate hot people.

366
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:40,787
They do.

367
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:43,110
By the way, are you guys kidding?

368
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,812
Liberals love hot people.

369
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:48,316
They love hot people so much they're apparently willing to give them one free murder.

370
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,585
But it wasn't just right-wing media.

371
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:02,649
It was also people who you thought had more important things to do, like pick-me Senator Ted Cruz.

372
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,711
Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

373
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:11,417
He wrote on X, wow, now the crazy left has come out against beautiful women.

374
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,519
I'm sure that will pull well.

375
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,182
Yeah, you tell him, Ted Cruz.

376
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:22,387
Hey, if you want to talk shit about a woman and get away with it, you better be talking about my wife.

377
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:36,046
And if you can believe it, it gets grosser than Ted Cruz.

378
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:43,173
She's a hot, beautiful, biological woman, and everybody loves it.

379
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:48,678
I thought it was a joke about her two most prominent assets.

380
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:57,086
I'm sorry, as a red-blooded American male, it's not her blue eyes or her skin that I first see when I look at that picture.

381
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,968
She is a lovely young woman.

382
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:02,229
Too young for me, unfortunately.

383
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,071
Why do you think people are so mad about that ad?

384
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:10,355
It seems much less sensual than the one Brooke Shields did back in the 1980s.

385
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:14,958
Sensual?

386
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,581
Brooke Shields, that was sensual.

387
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:24,565
These guys are so horny for a jeans ad that they started remembering older jeans ads they were horny for.

388
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:29,983
They're withdrawing 40-year-old Treasury bonds from their Spank Bank.

389
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,168
Now Betty Boop, she was sensual.

390
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:40,676
Can Stuart Varney please not say sensual anymore?

391
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:44,221
You celebrate the sensuality that's in those two jeans ads?

392
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:44,662
You like it?

393
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,513
Stop saying sensual!

394
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:53,597
Do you ever see that time-lapse video of a deer decomposing in like 10 seconds?

395
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,860
Every time I hear him say sensual, that's what happens to my uterus.

396
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:04,604
That guy saying sensual can make anything less sensual, and I mean anything.

397
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:07,646
Genes are passed down from parents to offspring.

398
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:08,487
Sensual?

399
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,073
Not sensual, not.

400
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:17,834
Can anyone possibly make this story even more gross?

401
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:18,995
Donald Trump Jr.

402
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:22,515
posted this AI-generated image poking fun at Sidney's commercial.

403
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,716
Donald is so hot right now.

404
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:31,717
Yeah, who wants to f**k my dad?

405
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:36,703
You know what?

406
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:37,384
You know what?

407
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,225
I am done hearing from men on this.

408
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:44,307
Perhaps we can get some sound analysis from someone who isn't suffering from boner brain fog.

409
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:54,412
Finally, we have an actual woman with amazing breasts and an obviously kick-ass body who is in a dress or in her jeans, whatever, and it's wonderful.

410
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:56,453
Jesus.

411
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,635
Megyn Kelly's more horned up than they are.

412
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,917
It's almost making me miss sensual.

413
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:11,777
Basically, Megan thinks the people who oppose this ad are just jealous haters who wish they were as hot as Sidney Sweeney.

414
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:15,959
But come to think of it, I did see someone going after her recently.

415
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:16,780
Who was that again?

416
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,064
Sidney Sweeney, the new toast of the town out there, because she's got these enormous breasts that everybody's obsessed with.

417
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:28,867
Well, well, well, Megan.

418
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,969
One minute you say you love boobs, the next you don't.

419
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,552
What are you, my, in hindsight, very gay high school boyfriend?

420
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:43,686
And by the way, Sydney isn't the first woman Meghan's gone after for being hot.

421
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:47,309
I object to J-Lo and Shakira showing their vag at the Super Bowl.

422
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,752
She dresses like a prostitute.

423
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,193
She looked like a hooker.

424
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:51,693
Look at this.

425
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:57,359
Her enormous breasts and a bathing suit was her chosen outfit.

426
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,122
She hasn't come to grips with the fact that she's not a sex symbol anymore.

427
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:06,247
You seem to be a desperate hoe wanting strangers to admire your vagina.

428
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,404
Yeah, yeah, that's right, women.

429
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:13,305
You listen to Megyn Kelly and hide your sexuality.

430
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:17,127
Unless your body makes liberals mad, in which case, it's a kick-ass body.

431
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,008
Hell yeah.

432
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:18,968
Go, girl.

433
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:20,629
You motorboat those liberals here.

434
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:28,533
But not so much that it threatens Megyn or so, help me God, she will destroy you, hoebags.

435
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:41,834
But remember, this whole thing started because people were calling this ad a racist dog whistle.

436
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:46,765
And whether that was intended or not, the reaction was definitely more of a dog megaphone.

437
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:59,297
and fucking tired of the nonsense where you are not allowed to ever celebrate someone who is white and blonde and blue eyed.

438
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:00,898
We are over this woke agenda.

439
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,019
We're over the Lizzo's.

440
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,180
We're over the Dilla Mulvaney's.

441
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,603
If this was a 300 pound non-binary person, they would be applauding her.

442
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,505
I was so sick of seeing these just

443
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:13,146
fat, unappealing losers who've destroyed their own bodies.

444
00:34:13,326 --> 00:34:17,207
She's not a plus-size swim model on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

445
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,027
She's not a male prom queen.

446
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:23,309
This ad is the final declaration that we're done doing that shit.

447
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:25,309
Guys.

448
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,070
Guys, guys, guys, calm down.

449
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,411
It's just an ad for gynes.

450
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:35,292
Blue gynes.

451
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,581
This is such bullshit.

452
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:45,807
Blonde women have had constant representation in entertainment, in fashion, in letter turning.

453
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:51,151
It's not that they want to see more white women.

454
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,113
It's that they want to see none of anyone else.

455
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:59,778
For a story about boobs, it sure has a hell of a lot of assholes.
