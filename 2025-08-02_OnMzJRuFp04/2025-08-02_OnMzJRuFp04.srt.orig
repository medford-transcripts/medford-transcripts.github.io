1
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:08,336
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's begin tonight with a young man by the name of Donald Aloysius Trump.

2
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, this young man has been embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal and did what anybody who is innocent when facing an accusation of this type, did what anybody who is innocent would do.

3
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,005
[SPEAKER_10]: He fled the country.

4
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,825
[SPEAKER_10]: He fled the country, taking a jaunt to bonnie old Scotland.

5
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,445
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably not the right accent.

6
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:50,808
[SPEAKER_10]: To leave his troubles in the United States behind and finally gain an ocean's distance between himself and the Epstein scandal.

7
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,228
[SPEAKER_10]: And focus on his new trade deal with the EU.

8
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, yes, you there, from the Inverness Castle Times.

9
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:03,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, was part of the rush to get this deal done to not let Jeffrey Epstein's story out?

10
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:04,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you gotta be kidding with that.

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Donald Trump, he's all like, how did you even hear about it?

12
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought, I thought you guys just got Baywatch like three months ago.

13
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:34,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't anybody here have a question about this trade deal sinking both of our economies with tariffs?

14
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:40,185
[SPEAKER_10]: How high do I have to make the tariffs before you guys shut the f*** up about Epstein?

15
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:48,254
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, how do you expect the media to move on when even Trump has trouble doing so?

16
00:01:49,417 --> 00:02:05,945
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was, on the day of striking a trade deal with the EU, Donald Trump presented, once more, this time for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, his classic Epstein defense, 13 reasons why I'm not involved with the pedophile.

17
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Those files were run by the worst scum on earth.

18
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,909
[SPEAKER_13]: If they had something, they would have released.

19
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, they can easily put something in the files that's a phony.

20
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is why I can't release it.

21
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,028
[SPEAKER_10]: It's simple.

22
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:25,750
[SPEAKER_10]: If I, Donald Trump, was in the files, they would have released it.

23
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,611
[SPEAKER_10]: So clearly, I'm not in the files.

24
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,413
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, I'm clearly in the files.

25
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:35,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Which makes them phony.

26
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:39,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what do they even have on Trump?

27
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,039
[SPEAKER_10]: A creepy drawing Trump gave to Epstein?

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't do drawings.

30
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a drawing person.

31
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:59,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Your Honor, I submit to the court, if there is one thing I would never do, it is draw.

32
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:05,258
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, I suffer from tiny hands.

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot physically even perform the task of drawing.

34
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:15,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not possess the motor skills and muscle strength required.

35
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot draw, not now.

36
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:22,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Not ever!

37
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:31,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Although... Sometimes people say, would you draw a building and I'll draw four lines and a little roof, you know, for a charity.

38
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,587
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not a drawing person.

39
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't do drawings of women.

40
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:37,609
[SPEAKER_13]: That I can tell you.

41
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sometimes people would say, would you draw a woman?

42
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:46,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd draw a parentheses for breasts and a triangle for Bush for charity.

43
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,717
[SPEAKER_10]: For charity.

44
00:03:52,016 --> 00:04:00,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't call them drawings, more of a cubist pastiche of punctuation and geometric shapes to trick the eye.

45
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:03,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Some would see a naked woman, of course.

46
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:14,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Others would see an old woman holding a falcon, riding a hoverboard with a triangle for a vagina.

47
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:15,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, the point is this.

48
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't draw.

49
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:25,161
[SPEAKER_10]: In Trump's defense, he did end his relationship with Epstein in the aughts.

50
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps a look into why he ended it will exonerate Trump.

51
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:36,744
[SPEAKER_13]: That's such old history, very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it.

52
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,625
[SPEAKER_13]: He did something that was inappropriate.

53
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:45,347
[SPEAKER_10]: What he said was Epstein had done something inappropriate, and that's why they're no longer friends.

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, Donald Trump recognized that Epstein had finally crossed the line.

55
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:56,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if it were me, obviously, giving this explanation in front of reporters, I probably would have stopped there.

56
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:04,329
[SPEAKER_10]: But since I am not,

57
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:11,804
[SPEAKER_10]: And Trump went on to describe Epstein's inappropriate behavior.

58
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:16,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And wait till you hear what was the Rubicon that Epstein crossed.

59
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:17,805
[SPEAKER_13]: He hired help.

60
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, don't ever do that again.

61
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,446
[SPEAKER_13]: He stole people that work for me.

62
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, don't ever do that again.

63
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,627
[SPEAKER_13]: He did it again.

64
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And I threw him out of the place.

65
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:29,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Persona non grata.

66
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:30,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

67
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,249
[SPEAKER_10]: You all know him as Jeffrey Epstein, the sex trafficker.

68
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,412
[SPEAKER_10]: But I knew his dark side.

69
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:58,564
[SPEAKER_10]: He was... I mean, the sex trafficking, I was like, okay.

70
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:04,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was also a low-level employee poacher.

71
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:12,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, I cannot have.

72
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, Mr. President, do you want to slice this bologna any thinner?

73
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:22,517
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, I never went to the island, and Bill Clinton went there supposedly 28 times.

74
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:36,440
[SPEAKER_10]: You expect me to believe that Bill Clinton went to the island only 28 times?

75
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:40,236
[SPEAKER_10]: No way.

76
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:58,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if anybody had VIP Diamond Island status, there's probably still parrots alive on that island going, hey, Bill, back again.

77
00:06:58,432 --> 00:06:59,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Bill.

78
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:00,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Bill.

79
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,436
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Bill?

80
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,117
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Bill?

81
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:18,485
[SPEAKER_03]: But here... Yeah.

82
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

83
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:19,665
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

84
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:20,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay.

85
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:26,709
[SPEAKER_10]: That is truly the best parrot impression you'll hear.

86
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Here comes my favorite part of the defense.

87
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:41,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Trump's ego and narcissism are so central to his being that even his denial of going to the island comes with a caveat.

88
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down.

89
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,317
[SPEAKER_13]: The privilege?

90
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:51,918
What the f***?

91
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Donald, want to go to the island this weekend?

92
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, Jeffrey,

93
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:01,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for thinking of me.

94
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:12,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, that's the weekend that the teen pageant that I bought is installing the indoor security locker room cabinets.

95
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

96
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,036
[SPEAKER_10]: But luckily for Trump, it wasn't all Epstein-related pressers.

97
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,140
[SPEAKER_10]: He was able to get in some of his beloved whack-a-ball.

98
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:30,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Trump, are you enjoying the Scottish hospitality?

99
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you enjoying the Scottish hospitality?

100
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:36,806
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

101
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:37,967
[SPEAKER_10]: There you are.

102
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:38,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you enjoying?

103
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:40,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Get in my belly.

104
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you enjoying?

105
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,269
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

106
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,710
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it's about.

107
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,211
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got to soothe Trump's soul.

108
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:52,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Trump, can you escape the Jeffrey Epstein crisis?

109
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:08,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Epstein what they yell in Scotland instead of four?

110
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:11,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Epstein!

111
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, this is, you know, this is tough.

112
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,811
[SPEAKER_10]: To extend the golf metaphor, Trump finds himself in the rough.

113
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:27,135
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's a championship-caliber golfsman, battle-tested, and I think we all know how the best golfers in the world get out of a bad lie.

114
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Donald Trump being busted cheating at golf.

115
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:36,078
[SPEAKER_21]: We can see a caddy dropping a ball there for the president while he played at one of his courses in Scotland.

116
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,541
[SPEAKER_10]: When the going gets tough,

117
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,184
[SPEAKER_10]: The tough pay someone to cheat for you.

118
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:51,749
[SPEAKER_10]: But this moment on the course, seemingly random, could not be more representative of Trump's entire existence.

119
00:09:52,029 --> 00:10:02,578
[SPEAKER_10]: He moves with complete confidence in this world because he requires that everyone in his orbit do whatever they can, including cheating, to ensure that things go Trump's way.

120
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:03,658
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been his whole life.

121
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't want to go to Vietnam?

122
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a podiatrist friend of the family to bone spur you up.

123
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Your casino is failing?

124
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps daddy can illegally float you three million in chips to try and save it.

125
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Impeached for an attempted coup?

126
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Your caddy today is the Kentucky Fried Reaper.

127
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Never like to speak ill of the dead.

128
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you even say that?

129
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:54,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously for the Epstein case, Trump has no shortage of caddies willing to shame themselves.

130
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's Congressman Tim Burchett, pre-Trump,

131
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,313
[SPEAKER_10]: being named in the files.

132
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:06,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Congressman, why do you think so many Democrats are committed to protecting the list of a dead pedophile?

133
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many of my colleagues, I'm afraid, are compromised in this area for whatever reason.

134
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,780
[SPEAKER_07]: The trash can is very deep.

135
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a swamp.

136
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an open sewer.

137
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:18,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a sewer.

138
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Democrats are all over the plane logs.

139
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:21,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an open sewer.

140
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Trump was also on Epstein's plane?

141
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Need a ball drop over here?

142
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:32,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, President Trump admitted that he flew on his dadgum plane.

143
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:36,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because somebody flew on a plane doesn't mean they're a dadgum pedophile.

144
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:38,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

145
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:38,530
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

146
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I always find that the worse it is, the folksier they get.

147
00:11:44,252 --> 00:11:52,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Mr. Trump, he's not a dadgum, gosh darn, dagnabbit pedophile.

148
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, kiss my grits.

149
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:01,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll guarantee you, he's not using that terminology in other sex offender cases.

150
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, gosh darn, if Diddy ain't two biscuits short of a country biscuit.

151
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,082
[SPEAKER_10]: He's two biscuits short of a country breakfast, but that don't make everyone at the freak off cracker-barrelers.

152
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:23,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly think my favorite thing about this is watching conspiracy theorists have to unravel the red string that they themselves originally strung out.

153
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:30,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the OG conspiracy theorist Glenn Beck at his excitement for Trump's beginning of the second term.

154
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,324
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I care about is the scandal of the pedophiles.

155
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:40,127
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the next 10 days, you're going to see the Epstein file released.

156
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Day number one, Cash Patel walks in.

157
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,551
[SPEAKER_14]: By the end of the day, it will be released.

158
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:46,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Day one!

159
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Deep state exposed.

160
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Trump's in the rough?

162
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:54,717
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll get right on that ball drop.

163
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,820
[SPEAKER_14]: What the left is saying, and some people now on his team are saying,

164
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:00,752
[SPEAKER_14]: He's in the report.

165
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:03,534
[SPEAKER_14]: With 15-year-olds?

166
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:04,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

167
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:07,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you actually believe that?

168
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I have seen some clips that would be consistent with...

169
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,089
[SPEAKER_10]: did buy a teenage beauty pageant.

170
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,573
[SPEAKER_10]: But listen, Beck, you're the master at making connections, so let's see you unconnected.

171
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:26,534
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's be honest.

172
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:36,141
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 years ago, if, you know, this was like, hey, he was on an island with 25-year-old models, I would be going, probably.

173
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,942
[SPEAKER_14]: OK?

174
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,044
[SPEAKER_14]: 15, 16-year-olds, that's not Donald Trump.

175
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,785
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Donald Trump.

176
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:43,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe that.

177
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:45,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you?

178
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I say, that's, no way that's true.

179
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,742
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't, what, no!

180
00:13:55,302 --> 00:14:01,604
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not, there's no magic X. You can't just magic X conspiracy.

181
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:05,626
[SPEAKER_10]: There's white people being replaced by voting illegal immigrants.

182
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,106
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

183
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,187
[SPEAKER_10]: The X has spoken.

184
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:14,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, Trump's caddies can't do everything, and it's given Democrats hope.

185
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,657
[SPEAKER_10]: that they finally have Donald Trump.

186
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:27,021
[SPEAKER_10]: For so long, the Democrats have been Wile E. Coyote to Donald Trump's Roadrunner.

187
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,643
[SPEAKER_10]: The Democrats thought they had Trump with the felony convictions.

188
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,944
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought they had Trump with the Access Hollywood tape.

189
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,024
[SPEAKER_10]: But every time he got away.

190
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:52,104
[SPEAKER_10]: But now, with the reporting on the Epstein files, the only way that this guy wiggles out of this one is if, for some reason, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell swears under oath that Trump had nothing to do with it.

191
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,066
[SPEAKER_10]: But why would she do that?

192
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Coyote, you finally got the roadrunner.

193
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:04,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I could completely rule out a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell who landed, is that something you would ever consider?

194
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:05,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Pardon for who?

195
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:06,958
[SPEAKER_09]: For Ghislaine Maxwell.

196
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:15,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon.

197
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:23,070
[SPEAKER_05]: As we said, Trump is in Scotland right now, seeing as his favorite island destination has been shut down.

198
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:41,567
[SPEAKER_05]: When a president travels overseas, it's important for them to project strength and dignity, although an uninvited insect made that a little harder for President Trump.

199
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:59,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, girl, you got moved.

200
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,138
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

201
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he voguing?

202
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:14,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoo fly sashay away.

203
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Feels like Trump's accidental dance moves are way more impressive than his intentional ones.

204
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:25,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Very weird.

205
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:28,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I do understand why he was so frantic.

206
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:31,937
[SPEAKER_05]: That mosquito was also asking Trump about Jeffrey Epstein.

207
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:37,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to be clear, Trump was not just wasting time playing golf.

208
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:40,320
[SPEAKER_05]: He was also wasting time profiting off golf.

209
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,942
[SPEAKER_23]: The president capping off his trip by officially opening his latest golf course today in Scotland.

210
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:46,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go.

211
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,343
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, three.

212
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:02,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a reminder, this man is still the president of the United States.

213
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,515
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on in the world, and he's at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to promote his golf course?

214
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:12,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this his side hustle, or is America his side hustle?

215
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

216
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, we're just used to this now.

218
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:23,928
[SPEAKER_05]: But imagine if when Obama was in office, he kept flying on Air Force One to open up Pizza Hut Taco Bell franchises.

219
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:33,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I, uh, want to announce, we killed Bin Laden, and the new Chalupa is half price at 3 p.m.

220
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Liv Moss.

221
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:37,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Not you, Bin Laden.

222
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:45,953
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't worry, while Trump was in Scotland, his administration was busy with the hard work of making things weird at home.

223
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:52,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like the Trump administration is encouraging federal workers to talk about their religion in the workplace.

224
00:17:52,237 --> 00:18:05,089
[SPEAKER_12]: A memo from the Office of Personnel Management cites the guidance as being protected by the First Amendment and says employees can tell others to rethink their beliefs, but they must stop if their co-workers tell them to.

225
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:06,348
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

226
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,649
[SPEAKER_05]: No, absolutely not.

227
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:14,651
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to approach me at work and ask, have you heard the good news, it better mean there are donuts in the break room.

228
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, keep it moving, Zachariah.

229
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:25,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine how humiliating it would be to have your fundamental worldview changed by Susan from accounting?

230
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,535
[SPEAKER_05]: And who would have the balls to convert a co-worker?

231
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even feel comfortable telling my co-worker she should get bangs.

232
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: She should, though.

233
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Stacey, you should get bangs.

234
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:36,227
[SPEAKER_05]: You need bangs.

235
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But Trump's biggest achievement this week was the trade deal he announced with the European Union.

236
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:47,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And since we all know Trump is so good at deals, it means everything is now going to be cheaper.

237
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:48,595
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.

238
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:52,979
[SPEAKER_00]: will impose a 15% tariff on most European products we import.

239
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:58,704
[SPEAKER_00]: American businesses will pay those tariffs and pass the cost along to consumers by raising prices.

240
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:05,890
[SPEAKER_18]: It is amazing what individual products we could see impacted here from autos to Botox as a result of these tariffs.

241
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, oh my God, that's wild.

242
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything from automobiles to Botox?

243
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I pronouncing that right?

244
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

245
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:20,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I'm not there yet.

246
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not there yet, don't Google it.

247
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:38,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay, the trade deal is gonna make things more expensive, which makes you wonder, what are we getting out of these tariffs anyway?

248
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:46,730
[SPEAKER_11]: We have so much money coming in, we're thinking about a little rebate, a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.

249
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

250
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is the art of the deal.

251
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:56,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone pays more for everything, and then a few of us maybe get a little bit of our money back.

252
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:01,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, this guy is always playing 5D, hitting yourself in the balls.

253
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:06,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, Trump also promised rebate checks from Doge.

254
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:11,561
[SPEAKER_05]: But all we got out of that was Trump calling Elon Musk a drug addict and Elon saying Trump was a pedophile.

255
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,002
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

256
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:12,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

257
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually is better than a rebate.

258
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:17,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

259
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

260
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:24,011
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing is just a mess, and you know who I feel worse for?

261
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Those poor penguins who we tariffed who now have to suck d**k for rent money.

262
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:36,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with Christine Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security and woman who keeps insisting that she and her daughter get mistaken for sisters.

263
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:44,587
[SPEAKER_05]: She was down in Argentina this week to sign an important visa agreement, so as you would expect, this is the video she released.

264
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that government diplomacy or a Valtrex ad?

265
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:13,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't let sores stop me from getting in the saddle.

266
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine how nervous that horse was?

267
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:24,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Christy Noem shot her dog for talking back and then shot her goat to get rid of the witnesses.

268
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:30,632
[SPEAKER_05]: She was petting that horse like, this could go one of two ways, Seabiscuit.

269
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I dare you to give me a reason.

270
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:39,941
[SPEAKER_05]: All kidding aside, breaking news, we actually scored an exclusive interview with that very horse.

271
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go live via satellite to Kristi Noem's horse.

272
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:44,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

273
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:47,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

274
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:48,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

275
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:50,904
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awkward.

276
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:51,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

277
00:21:52,804 --> 00:22:03,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the Environmental Protection Agency, which used to protect the environment but is now run by this man, Lee Zeldin, seen here watching an oil tanker crash into a coral reef.

278
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:09,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's telling the environment, hey girl, it just feels better without protection.

279
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:14,276
[SPEAKER_23]: A stunning reversal that could have unprecedented climate impact.

280
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:21,298
[SPEAKER_23]: The EPA is now looking to repeal a 2009 study linking man-made climate change to health hazards.

281
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:29,141
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2009 declaration has served as the basis for climate regulations, like limiting emissions from cars and power plants.

282
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:38,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the White House is rolling it back in what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is calling the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.

283
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this is crazy.

284
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,824
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of EPA chief wants to make the environment worse?

285
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:48,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he have that Munchausen by proxy thing where he gets off on making the planet sicker?

286
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:52,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Earth, you're coughing again.

287
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, take these special vitamins that are definitely not poison.

288
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But look, how would Zeldin know that climate change was a problem?

289
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,632
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like he can just look at what's right in front of him.

290
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:18,153
[SPEAKER_06]: EPA is proposing to rescind the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment funding to eliminate all of the greenhouse gas emissions regulations that followed, including electric vehicle mandates.

291
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:22,837
[SPEAKER_05]: 126 degrees, or as we'll call it in 20 years, winter.

292
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:23,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh, in 20 years, I'll be 35.

293
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:24,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yikes.

294
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:32,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't Google it.

295
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the only man who says, I'm all ears and means it.

296
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:46,273
[SPEAKER_05]: The State Department's latest target is something very close to my heart, cervix.

297
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:55,262
[SPEAKER_22]: The government may destroy almost $10 million worth of birth control bought with tax dollars instead of sending it to women overseas.

298
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,684
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sitting in a warehouse in Belgium right now.

299
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:01,447
[SPEAKER_22]: And most of these items don't expire for another two to three years.

300
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:08,193
[SPEAKER_22]: But the State Department says they may have to burn all of this birth control now that USAID has been dismantled.

301
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:11,295
[SPEAKER_22]: Officials say it'll cost almost $170,000 to destroy all of those contraceptives.

302
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you fucking kidding me?

303
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: They would rather spend $170,000 to destroy $10 million worth of birth control that they already bought rather than give it to women who need it?

304
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: At least sell it.

305
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: You're Donald Trump.

306
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Just slap your name on it.

307
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:37,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Call them Trump cooter shooters and rake in enough cash to pay down the national debt.

308
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:37,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

309
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure it out.

310
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:48,669
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why people should start stocking up on birth control now.

311
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I always have at least seven to nine IUDs implanted at all times.

312
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,634
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know when the girl in the next stall is going to need one.

313
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:04,958
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, let's move on to Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary who puts the tank in another Tanqueray, please.

314
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:09,301
[SPEAKER_05]: He's only been on the job for a few months, but he's already looking for a promotion.

315
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:18,070
[SPEAKER_25]: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has privately discussed running for political office next year, specifically for governor in his home state of Tennessee.

316
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, Pete!

317
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,531
[SPEAKER_05]: What an awesome idea!

318
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be a great governor of Tennessee.

319
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so sorry, Tennessee, but you're just going to have to take one for the team on this.

320
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

321
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, wow, it makes so much sense.

322
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,522
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just leave now and go do it.

323
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:40,662
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, why waste time?

324
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: You should resign yesterday.

325
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Tennessee, we are never gonna forget you.

326
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:47,926
[SPEAKER_05]: R.I.P.

327
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:08,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whether Pete would be a good governor or not, he could definitely use a change of scenery, because after six months of dealing with leakers in the Defense Department, he's kind of starting to lose it.

328
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:18,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has finally earned a rare rebuke from the White House over his obsessive paranoia about leakers inside the Pentagon.

329
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:24,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Hegseth was directed by the White House to stop using polygraph tests to search for people leaking information to the media.

330
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:31,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Hexeth has been polygraphing so many people, the White House had to tell him to stop.

331
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:39,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how paranoid you have to be for even Trump to be like, calm down, not everything's a witch hunt?

332
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:44,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, who's Pete Hegseth to be accusing other people of leaking?

333
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:48,215
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, if you've got something to say, you don't text a reporter.

334
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:52,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You come to me, and then I'll leak it to a reporter on a signal chat.

335
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,660
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the protocol, people.

336
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,981
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the protocol.

337
00:26:55,262 --> 00:27:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past few weeks, the national conversation has been totally dominated by the Jeffrey Epstein story.

338
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But who would have thought that the thing that knocked it off the top of the charts would be Sidney Sweeney?

339
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:11,554
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the most laid-back line delivery I've ever seen in my life.

340
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:20,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Jeans are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.

341
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,620
[SPEAKER_19]: My jeans are blue.

342
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Sidney Sweeney, Casper Jeans.

343
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:32,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeans.

344
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeans are passed down.

345
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:38,805
[SPEAKER_04]: My John's are blah.

346
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my blah.

347
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:42,506
[SPEAKER_04]: John's, John's, John's, blah.

348
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:45,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her so much.

349
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,448
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so there were a bunch of different reactions to this ad.

350
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:52,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people thought, yeah, pretty standard ad where a hot person tells you to buy stuff.

351
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:58,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people were like, wow, Desi, I saw you in that jeans ad, and you looked great.

352
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had to be like, no, that was Sidney Sweeney.

353
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a common mistake.

354
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:09,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but then there was another reaction online, which is that the ad wasn't just selling jeans.

355
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also subtly promoting white supremacy.

356
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:16,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can imagine, that spawned an incredible right-wing backlash.

357
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,882
[SPEAKER_09]: What these left-wingers don't know is that they are revealing themselves to be the actual racists here, racists against white people.

358
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,824
[SPEAKER_18]: They're mad because she's young, hot, healthy, white, and blonde.

359
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:30,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Liberals just, they just hate hot people.

360
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:31,306
[SPEAKER_18]: They just do.

361
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:32,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

362
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a great point.

363
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great point.

364
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great point.

365
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they just hated meat and freedom, but they also hate hot people.

366
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:40,787
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.

367
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:43,110
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, are you guys kidding?

368
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Liberals love hot people.

369
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:48,316
[SPEAKER_05]: They love hot people so much they're apparently willing to give them one free murder.

370
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,585
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't just right-wing media.

371
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:02,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also people who you thought had more important things to do, like pick-me Senator Ted Cruz.

372
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

373
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:11,417
[SPEAKER_24]: He wrote on X, wow, now the crazy left has come out against beautiful women.

374
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,519
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure that will pull well.

375
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you tell him, Ted Cruz.

376
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you want to talk shit about a woman and get away with it, you better be talking about my wife.

377
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:36,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can believe it, it gets grosser than Ted Cruz.

378
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:43,173
[SPEAKER_15]: She's a hot, beautiful, biological woman, and everybody loves it.

379
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:48,678
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was a joke about her two most prominent assets.

380
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:57,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, as a red-blooded American male, it's not her blue eyes or her skin that I first see when I look at that picture.

381
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,968
[SPEAKER_15]: She is a lovely young woman.

382
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:02,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Too young for me, unfortunately.

383
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you think people are so mad about that ad?

384
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:10,355
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems much less sensual than the one Brooke Shields did back in the 1980s.

385
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:14,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Sensual?

386
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Brooke Shields, that was sensual.

387
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:24,565
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are so horny for a jeans ad that they started remembering older jeans ads they were horny for.

388
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:29,983
[SPEAKER_05]: They're withdrawing 40-year-old Treasury bonds from their Spank Bank.

389
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Betty Boop, she was sensual.

390
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Stuart Varney please not say sensual anymore?

391
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:44,221
[SPEAKER_16]: You celebrate the sensuality that's in those two jeans ads?

392
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:44,662
[SPEAKER_16]: You like it?

393
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop saying sensual!

394
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:53,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever see that time-lapse video of a deer decomposing in like 10 seconds?

395
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I hear him say sensual, that's what happens to my uterus.

396
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:04,604
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy saying sensual can make anything less sensual, and I mean anything.

397
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:07,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Genes are passed down from parents to offspring.

398
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:08,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Sensual?

399
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sensual, not.

400
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:17,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Can anyone possibly make this story even more gross?

401
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:18,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Donald Trump Jr.

402
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:22,515
[SPEAKER_05]: posted this AI-generated image poking fun at Sidney's commercial.

403
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Donald is so hot right now.

404
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, who wants to f**k my dad?

405
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

406
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:37,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

407
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I am done hearing from men on this.

408
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:44,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps we can get some sound analysis from someone who isn't suffering from boner brain fog.

409
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:54,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, we have an actual woman with amazing breasts and an obviously kick-ass body who is in a dress or in her jeans, whatever, and it's wonderful.

410
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:56,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

411
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Megyn Kelly's more horned up than they are.

412
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost making me miss sensual.

413
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:11,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Megan thinks the people who oppose this ad are just jealous haters who wish they were as hot as Sidney Sweeney.

414
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But come to think of it, I did see someone going after her recently.

415
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:16,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was that again?

416
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Sidney Sweeney, the new toast of the town out there, because she's got these enormous breasts that everybody's obsessed with.

417
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:28,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, well, well, Megan.

418
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,969
[SPEAKER_05]: One minute you say you love boobs, the next you don't.

419
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,552
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you, my, in hindsight, very gay high school boyfriend?

420
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:43,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, Sydney isn't the first woman Meghan's gone after for being hot.

421
00:32:44,187 --> 00:32:47,309
[SPEAKER_17]: I object to J-Lo and Shakira showing their vag at the Super Bowl.

422
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,752
[SPEAKER_17]: She dresses like a prostitute.

423
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,193
[SPEAKER_17]: She looked like a hooker.

424
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:51,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at this.

425
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:57,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Her enormous breasts and a bathing suit was her chosen outfit.

426
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:01,122
[SPEAKER_17]: She hasn't come to grips with the fact that she's not a sex symbol anymore.

427
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:06,247
[SPEAKER_17]: You seem to be a desperate hoe wanting strangers to admire your vagina.

428
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, that's right, women.

429
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:13,305
[SPEAKER_05]: You listen to Megyn Kelly and hide your sexuality.

430
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:17,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless your body makes liberals mad, in which case, it's a kick-ass body.

431
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

432
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:18,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Go, girl.

433
00:33:19,148 --> 00:33:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You motorboat those liberals here.

434
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But not so much that it threatens Megyn or so, help me God, she will destroy you, hoebags.

435
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:41,834
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, this whole thing started because people were calling this ad a racist dog whistle.

436
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:46,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And whether that was intended or not, the reaction was definitely more of a dog megaphone.

437
00:33:48,648 --> 00:33:59,297
[SPEAKER_17]: and fucking tired of the nonsense where you are not allowed to ever celebrate someone who is white and blonde and blue eyed.

438
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We are over this woke agenda.

439
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: We're over the Lizzo's.

440
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We're over the Dilla Mulvaney's.

441
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,603
[SPEAKER_02]: If this was a 300 pound non-binary person, they would be applauding her.

442
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I was so sick of seeing these just

443
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:13,146
[SPEAKER_18]: fat, unappealing losers who've destroyed their own bodies.

444
00:34:13,326 --> 00:34:17,207
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not a plus-size swim model on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

445
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,027
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not a male prom queen.

446
00:34:19,068 --> 00:34:23,309
[SPEAKER_17]: This ad is the final declaration that we're done doing that shit.

447
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:25,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys.

448
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, guys, guys, calm down.

449
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an ad for gynes.

450
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:35,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue gynes.

451
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,581
[SPEAKER_05]: This is such bullshit.

452
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Blonde women have had constant representation in entertainment, in fashion, in letter turning.

453
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that they want to see more white women.

454
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that they want to see none of anyone else.

455
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:59,778
[SPEAKER_05]: For a story about boobs, it sure has a hell of a lot of assholes.
