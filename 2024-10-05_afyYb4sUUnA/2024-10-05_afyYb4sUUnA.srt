10
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's on January 20th, although with the lunar calendar, it always messes with my mind.

11
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:12,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But Lunar New Year is a time for Asian families in Medford to come back together, for families to travel back to their countries of origin to see their families there.

12
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:16,366
[SPEAKER_04]: or for their family across the country to come to Medford.

00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:34,320

[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

62
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, would you be comfortable summarizing

63
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: the how we got to this point, or?

64
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give, yeah, I can give a brief summary.

65
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:49,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have Attorney Austin on the line as well, who's advised us along this.

66
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give a summary.

67
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got an expert in legal proceedings, so.

68
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:56,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, if our legal counsel present would like to.

69
00:04:56,343 --> 00:05:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Attorney Austin, would you feel comfortable just giving us a summary of what's before us and how we got here?

70
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, members of the council.

71
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:08,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy to be here this evening to advise the council on this matter.

72
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:14,495
[SPEAKER_25]: As you are all aware, this is a remand hearing, a public hearing on a remand decision.

73
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:23,238
[SPEAKER_25]: This matter relates to litigation that was filed by BJ's and I understand that representatives from BJ's are in attendance this evening.

74
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:31,760
[SPEAKER_25]: Essentially, as Madam President has stated, this involves a fuel storage license and the city council is the licensing authority.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,041
[SPEAKER_25]: This was previously before the council several years back,

76
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:51,648
[SPEAKER_25]: There was litigation filed and now the posture of this matter is that it's back before the city council for further review and discussion with representatives from BJ's as well as representatives from any other individuals for public hearing that may want to speak on the application.

77
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:56,470
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm certainly here to answer any questions that the council may have at the outset.

78
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Essentially, this is a remand public hearing.

79
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:03,932
[SPEAKER_25]: Information and evidence will be taken from BJ's from the applicant.

80
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:11,321
[SPEAKER_25]: um, in their representatives and essentially from there, it'll be open to members of the public to comment on the hearing as well.

81
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:19,948
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and from there, the public hearing portion of the meeting will close and the council can deliberate, um, and have any further discussion that it may choose.

82
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, madam president.

83
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, madam president.

84
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:32,558
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, so I, I, I see we have, we've got many papers here from, uh, attorneys representing, uh, both the neighbors and the, um,

85
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,403
[SPEAKER_29]: and BJ's.

86
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:45,713
[SPEAKER_29]: One of the things that's new that wasn't here when BJ's first came up some time ago is we weren't in a gas crisis, with the gas prices.

87
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:54,581
[SPEAKER_29]: So I've been to the BJ's and Stoneham and I see the cars queuing up there, sometimes they're 20 and 30 cars deep.

88
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,285
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't see a plan to deal with that.

89
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:05,480
[SPEAKER_29]: at the BJ's gas station in Medford, because obviously their prices are less than some of the other companies.

90
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:18,910
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think really that's a big change from when we first got here, and I think there should be a plan to figure out where the cars are gonna queue and how many cars, how can I get that?

91
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,113
[SPEAKER_29]: If you've been to Stonehenge, you can see sometimes it's 30, 40 cars and they go right up the street.

92
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:27,536
[SPEAKER_29]: So if they could explain a plan on how that's gonna work, it'd be appreciated.

93
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello, Vice-Chair Bares.

94
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

95
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:38,357
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just ask Attorney Austin a question, maybe to expand upon a little bit more of how we got here.

96
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:49,124
[SPEAKER_07]: When we unanimously denied the original petition in 2021, then BJ filed suit.

97
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:55,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially my understanding of why this case has now been remanded to the council for further consideration is that

98
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:04,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, BJ's, uh, that that are reasons for denying the license were did not meet legal muster.

99
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, is that correct?

100
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney Austin?

101
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,553
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

102
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:18,155
[SPEAKER_25]: BJ's has essentially argued through the litigation that the

103
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:22,369
[SPEAKER_25]: The denial of the prior license was not legally sound.

104
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:28,251
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I don't want to be in a position where I'm providing legal advice to the council in open session on pending litigation.

105
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:34,452
[SPEAKER_25]: But that is the posture of the case and the arguments that are being raised by BJ's at this point.

106
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:43,435
[SPEAKER_25]: And so we are here to review further information that's been submitted by BJ's along with members of the public for the council's good faith review.

107
00:08:44,640 --> 00:09:01,189
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that the council has been provided some additional materials for review tonight, and BJ's as well as members of the public will speak to those but yes, the council is correct that BJ's has challenged the legal sufficiency of the council's prior denial of the fuel storage permit.

108
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:01,749
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

109
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And just further on that.

110
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:11,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, feel free to answer within the bounds of being legal counsel to us while there's pending litigation but.

111
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:39,708
[SPEAKER_07]: my understanding of the consequence if the council maintains its denial of the permit and then the case plays out and it is determined that the council's justification for denying the license was not legally valid, that then the other conditions placed on the license by other city boards and commissions would no longer be in effect.

112
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:46,032
[SPEAKER_25]: I wouldn't necessarily go that far.

113
00:09:46,052 --> 00:10:08,523
[SPEAKER_25]: What could happen is essentially if a judge finds in favor of BJs and this matter isn't reconsidered or resolved in some way, if the matter is resolved in favor of BJs in the current posture of the litigation, then essentially BJs may hold the license.

114
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:12,125
[SPEAKER_25]: So now the council is prepared this evening

115
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:22,913
[SPEAKER_25]: to review the remand materials in good faith and essentially decide whether or not it wants to deny grant or grant with conditions.

116
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:35,861
[SPEAKER_25]: The decisions of other city departments or other city officials are separate and apart from the matter that's before the Superior Court, in my opinion, that brings us here this evening.

117
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, and I'll end it there.

118
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

119
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:58,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, as per the council rules for public hearings, the process we have is to have the petition read into the record, which we have done, and next would be the petitioner provide an explanation of the matter before us for the public hearing, and then we'll open the public hearing.

120
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:04,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the petitioner would like to speak to the paper before us, and just name and address for the record, please.

121
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:05,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Dennis McKenna.

122
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with the Law Office of Raymond Bronstein in Burlington, Massachusetts.

123
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Madam President, Mr. Vice President, members of the City Council.

124
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:28,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Attorney Austin correctly explained, and I agree with the answers she provided, we are back before you on BJA's fuel storage license application as a result of the remand.

125
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:51,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And as part of the presentation, my partner, Mark Vaughn, who appeared before this board in 2021, will just give a brief historical background of some of the other permits that were just mentioned, specifically the one that was issued by the City of Medford Community Development Board regarding site plan.

126
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:58,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And then representatives of VJs who are here will present a detailed presentation, which hopefully

127
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: address.

128
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:09,048
[SPEAKER_05]: We have heard we've been in discussions with city representative your council during the appeal, primarily to see if there were concerns that could be addressed.

129
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:19,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard those concerns up through basically today or two days ago, and we hope that, uh, we can address all of them.

130
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,319
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe we can.

131
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh,

132
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We have additional presentations that will be presented, including on the Zoom platform.

133
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:36,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless any of the city council members have any questions for me, I'll turn it over to my partner, Attorney McLaughlin.

134
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

135
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:40,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, please proceed.

136
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:48,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Madam President.

137
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,047
[SPEAKER_13]: He writes to share, I guess, for the screen.

138
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:52,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.

139
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Under what name?

140
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good?

141
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

142
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:58,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And just name and address for the record.

143
00:12:58,273 --> 00:12:58,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

144
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:08,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Vaughn, with the law firm of Rima Bronstein out of Burlington, Massachusetts here tonight representing BJ's pleasure to be before all of you and happy new year.

145
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:09,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice to see you.

146
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,522
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're here in connection with the fuel storage license application.

147
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:31,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're probably all familiar with the BJ's location here in Medford, but it's a site with access that is, there's an aerial that's on the screen now, but just gives you a sense of the location has access from both Middlesex Avenue and the Fells Way.

148
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,115
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very large site, approximately nine acres in size, with an expansive parking field.

149
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:48,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And as such, the property is what we believe to be ideally set up and situated for the proposed use, which would be to allow for a retail gas offering to be

150
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:54,026
[SPEAKER_13]: in the outer limit of the parking field, which we'll show you in a moment.

151
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:58,409
[SPEAKER_13]: So well removed from the adjacent residential neighborhood.

152
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:07,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So this allows for customers to be able to access the gas station as part of their visit without impacting site operations in the main parking field.

153
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:14,800
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will be prepared through you, Madam President, to address Mr. Caraviello's comment just about queuing.

154
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,962
[SPEAKER_13]: That obviously is something that has been factored into the design.

155
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:33,765
[SPEAKER_13]: So also, I think you can see on this plan too, as I'm sure the council is aware, there is an existing national grid substation facility that does separate the location where we're proposing the retail gas offering from the residential neighborhood along Woodruff.

156
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:42,352
[SPEAKER_13]: So the gas station, just from a permitting history, it's allowed by right under the Medford zoning as the property is in an industrial zone.

157
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:48,197
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it did require what's called major project special permit review by the community development board.

158
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:58,156
[SPEAKER_13]: and that was granted, where all issues pertaining to traffic, landscaping, lighting, public safety were all looked at exhaustively.

159
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:10,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know as part of that hearing process, all city departments as well reviewed the application and provided comments to the CDB, and that resulted in the vote to grant the special permit.

160
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:14,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that was a unanimous vote with one abstention, if I recall.

161
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:25,139
[SPEAKER_13]: As part of that review process and the review of the city departments, there were many improvements that were modified and incorporated into the final design.

162
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:31,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that like Austin Turner in a moment will be able to kind of briefly summarize those and walk through it.

163
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:43,875
[SPEAKER_13]: But variety of pedestrian safety, accessibility improvements, landscaping enhancements, environmental upgrades, sidewalk reconstruction and the like, which we feel will provide

164
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:45,423
[SPEAKER_13]: great benefit.

165
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:54,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the police department had previously commented on this application that they no traffic impact anticipated.

166
00:15:54,926 --> 00:16:05,430
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that the city's traffic engineer taught Blake as well had reviewed the application and concluded that matters pertaining to traffic had been satisfactorily addressed.

167
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,690
[SPEAKER_13]: So

168
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And in addition, the matter was reviewed by the Conservation Commission.

169
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:17,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Technically, there's some off locus wetlands that not on our property, but off of our property, where technically there was some jurisdictional issues.

170
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,179
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went through that process.

171
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:23,222
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Conservation Commission also unanimously approved the project.

172
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:30,567
[SPEAKER_13]: We incorporated some stormwater upgrades and stormwater quality improvements as well as part of that.

173
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:42,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to turn it over in a moment to Patrick Netriba with BJ's, but just very briefly, providing this is an amenity for his customers, which they do at many of their locations.

174
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:53,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really intent to provide a convenience, many of whom are residents of the city of Medford, should they be on site and want to be able to get gas as well.

175
00:16:55,294 --> 00:17:02,445
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually the first club that BJ's opened in its entire portfolio and I know they have a following of

176
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,376
[SPEAKER_13]: of local and loyal residents.

177
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:15,302
[SPEAKER_13]: And just if these may be statements of the obvious, so I apologize if that's the case, but there wouldn't be any vehicle service as part of this.

178
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:17,543
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there's no mechanic space or anything like that.

179
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:22,666
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually no selling of convenience items as well.

180
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,107
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no convenience store element.

181
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,248
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a small kiosk that would be devoted

182
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:35,078
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, really to having an attendant in there that could, uh, assist any, uh, patron that might need assistance in connection with the gas.

183
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:38,960
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, with that, I'd like to turn it over to Patrick Natriva.

184
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:50,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he has been, uh, intimately involved with this for some time and, uh, as well as involved with a number of the conditions and improvements that we're proposing to make sense.

185
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Last time we were before you.

186
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:52,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

187
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,258
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mark.

188
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:53,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

189
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,260
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nice to see you all again.

190
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,142
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nice to meet some of you as well.

191
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,943
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there's been a change.

192
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:00,645
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Patrick Netriba.

193
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:05,991
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the director of real estate for BJS Wholesale Club, and we've been working on this with you for quite some time.

194
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:12,457
[SPEAKER_19]: So we appreciate this opportunity to come back and speak with you and present our new proposal and some findings that we have.

195
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:15,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Mark did a great job with his introduction.

196
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford's a real special club for us.

197
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:19,350
[SPEAKER_19]: It's amazing.

198
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,790
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 1984 when that club opened.

199
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Think about what I was doing before I wasn't up on the podium.

200
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,352
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's something that we hold very dear to us.

201
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:29,332
[SPEAKER_19]: It's our first club.

202
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:35,614
[SPEAKER_19]: And as part of that, we hear a lot from our members who we have a lot of in Medford.

203
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:36,895
[SPEAKER_19]: There's thousands of them.

204
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:38,075
[SPEAKER_19]: I can tell you that.

205
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Who clamor for a gas station.

206
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,556
[SPEAKER_19]: They say, there's one in Revere.

207
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:43,556
[SPEAKER_19]: There's one in Stoneham.

208
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Why can't we have one in Medford?

209
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,359
[SPEAKER_19]: just like any other business.

210
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,861
[SPEAKER_19]: If we don't listen to our customers, we're not going to succeed.

211
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:55,645
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've heard it over many years, and that's what brings us forth to you today.

212
00:18:55,965 --> 00:19:07,933
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that, I wanted to just go through very briefly some of the things that we will commit to here as it relates to your action on fuel storage licenses, of course.

213
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,674
[SPEAKER_19]: And I won't drain the slides here.

214
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:10,495
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll try to be brief.

215
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:11,892
[SPEAKER_19]: on the site maintenance.

216
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:14,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that's been a big issue, and we've talked about that before.

217
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_19]: We will commit to an advanced maintenance program here, where we will have a day porter parking lot sweeping.

218
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,936
[SPEAKER_19]: The day porter will be five days a week to pick up trash.

219
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,197
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm using jargon.

220
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:27,338
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize if you have to ask a question.

221
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:27,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Please stop me.

222
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:30,239
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to make sure the site is clean.

223
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:36,661
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll have someone out there five days a week picking up trash to make sure it's clean, as well as a weekly parking lot sweeping.

224
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:40,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Biannually, in the spring and the fall, we'll do complete site cleanups.

225
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:46,670
[SPEAKER_19]: repair of any kind of issues that are out there from the plow, as well as replanting of landscaping as needed.

226
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Things sometimes don't make it, and we'll make it right, and we'll make it look right, as is shown on the plan.

227
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:57,713
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to make sure that our trash and our dumpsters are all fully sealed.

228
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,954
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an issue with retail shopping centers.

229
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:02,294
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't have a lid on them.

230
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,534
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like a real simple thing.

231
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:09,916
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to make sure that we've got lidded containers and lip containers for everything that we have, as well as making sure that we empty them

232
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:17,579
[SPEAKER_19]: at least two times a week or on an as-needed basis to prevent the debris and the litter from accumulating.

233
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:30,464
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition to that, we also want to give you the assurance that we'll provide you a written summary of all of our maintenance activities and how we are conforming with the things that I'm outlining tonight.

234
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:34,805
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll provide that to you on a yearly basis, written, in terms of what we've complied with,

235
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,281
[SPEAKER_19]: and where we have not been able to supply with the reason being for whatever it happens to be.

236
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:47,043
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll provide that to a designation or a person on your side, whoever you designate.

237
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:48,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Landscaping.

238
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:52,925
[SPEAKER_19]: We've heard a lot about the residents on Woodruff Avenue.

239
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:58,667
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll be the first one to say it's not easy living next to a retail development.

240
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,007
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand that.

241
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:03,489
[SPEAKER_19]: The people who live on Woodruff, I understand that.

242
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:04,729
[SPEAKER_19]: And we want to make it.

243
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,244
[SPEAKER_19]: as best as we can, given the proximity of our facility to their front door.

244
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:32,877
[SPEAKER_19]: As part of that, we are going to, or we would like to commit to an extensive landscaping plan, or a streetscaping plan, I should say, of Woodroof Avenue, as you can see on your screen, where we will replant any and all dead trees that were, or that died, I should say, as part of the city's water maintenance, or excuse me, new waterline installation.

245
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:34,498
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there were some new hydrants that were put there.

246
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:52,054
[SPEAKER_19]: and Austin will get into that in a little bit more detail, but it is a significant streetscape program for Woodroof Avenue, starting from Middlesex Avenue, all the way at the far end where the substation is, to the left-hand side of the screen for the people who are watching at home, where our building terminates.

247
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:57,939
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a good bit of landscaping, and we're happy and proud if we're able to do it.

248
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Furthermore, in terms of the communication,

249
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,321
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a big issue for us.

250
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:11,206
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to be able to communicate to you, as well as the residents in our neighborhood, about how we're doing.

251
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:13,527
[SPEAKER_19]: We've made mistakes in the past.

252
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure we'll make some again in the future.

253
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:19,091
[SPEAKER_19]: If we open up the communication lines, we can do better.

254
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:27,137
[SPEAKER_19]: We will commit to you here and now to provide you with the contact information, as well as a designated representative for our regional maintenance manager.

255
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,958
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not some low-level person.

256
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:37,215
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the person who is in charge of the maintenance for this facility and has decision-making power, who has budgetary authority to fix problems.

257
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:43,401
[SPEAKER_19]: This person can make things happen, and will make things happen, and does make things happen on this site.

258
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:47,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Pedestrians and traffic.

259
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:53,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Austin will get into this a little bit more when he comes up, but we're going to reconfigure the main entrance drive.

260
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:57,768
[SPEAKER_19]: in alignment with your Complete Streets program to make it more pedestrian-friendly.

261
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:03,990
[SPEAKER_19]: When this was built in 1984, the driveway entrance was, Austin, please all help me, it's 40-something feet wide.

262
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,611
[SPEAKER_19]: We've trimmed that down to, is it 30-something feet, Austin, something like that?

263
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:09,951
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll get into the details on it.

264
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:14,573
[SPEAKER_19]: We know you want a pedestrian-friendly city, and we wanna try to help you with that.

265
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:23,135
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition, we're also committed to the Complete Streets program in terms of the bike lanes and other improvements out of Middlesex Avenue.

266
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:29,699
[SPEAKER_19]: that stretch from, Austin will get into the detail of it, a certain distance south of us to the Malden line.

267
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,300
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll have that information for you in a little bit.

268
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:40,083
[SPEAKER_19]: Switching back to some more on-site improvements, we're also committing to you that we will do four EV charging stations in the parking lot.

269
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:52,067
[SPEAKER_19]: These will be high-capacity 220-volt chargers that you can plug in your Prius, your Volt, your Bolt, your Tesla, if you can afford one, whatever works for you.

270
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we know that's the way of the future.

271
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,265
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to be driving gasoline cars forever.

272
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:09,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Lastly, I wanted to talk about another sensitive issue in terms of the trucks that are present on the site, the after hours trucks.

273
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:16,855
[SPEAKER_19]: And even today, I was very disappointed to see this, but there are three semi-trailers parked in our parking lot.

274
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:18,776
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can assure you, and I

275
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:22,697
[SPEAKER_19]: affirm to you right now that they are not our trucks.

276
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:31,189
[SPEAKER_19]: I pounded on the doors 45 minutes ago saying, what are you doing in my parking lot 45 minutes before my hearing.

277
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:33,069
[SPEAKER_19]: They are not our trucks.

278
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:33,930
[SPEAKER_19]: We have reached out.

279
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:40,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I reached out to our senior vice president of asset protection to try to get the Medford police over here because I didn't really want to knock on.

280
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:46,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't really want to be knocking on some truckers door, but we are, I'm acknowledging the problem.

281
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:53,267
[SPEAKER_19]: And as part of our commitment to you here and now we will institute a towing policy with the blessing of the city.

282
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:58,400
[SPEAKER_19]: as part of the ordinances that you have to tow those people and get them out of there.

283
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,741
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could tell them tonight because it's ridiculous.

284
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:10,164
[SPEAKER_19]: It is people who are abusing the fact that we have excess parking and it's the same trucking company.

285
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:12,785
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see it on the side of their truck and it's

286
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:21,764
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you can sense the infuriation that I have here, because it's not what I want to project to you or to the residents of this city.

287
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:28,691
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Austin, who's going to talk a little bit more about the details of our proposal.

288
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:29,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

289
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:30,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

290
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, and for the record, Austin Turner with Bowler.

291
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:48,306
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could be so kind as to give me hosting privileges again.

292
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:51,409
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it dropped the Wi-Fi for a second.

293
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:12,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

294
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:23,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So as Patrick mentioned, we have a long history here in the city, specifically recently with all the permitting efforts we went through.

295
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:30,250
[SPEAKER_11]: The plan that is on those screens went through a significant evolution as part of that process.

296
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,851
[SPEAKER_11]: What I thought I would do tonight

297
00:26:33,841 --> 00:26:38,163
[SPEAKER_11]: for the council is kind of refresh on what the site plan's about, some of the highlights of the site plan.

298
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:50,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And then with this plan, there are very specific and fairly substantial commitments that we're making to the city to improve the neighborhood, the community, and the roadway infrastructure.

299
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I have renderings of what each of those things are intended to look like, which I think will help put a little bit more clarity

300
00:26:58,134 --> 00:26:59,555
[SPEAKER_11]: than just this two-dimensional rendering.

301
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:05,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll start from a high level, then we'll walk down, and I'd be happy to answer any questions that Council might have that make some sense.

302
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:15,601
[SPEAKER_11]: So from a site plan perspective, generally speaking, we're still maintaining the two access points, one on Middlesex and one in the back of the property.

303
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:19,242
[SPEAKER_11]: The one on Middlesex is being substantially upgraded.

304
00:27:19,623 --> 00:27:20,583
[SPEAKER_11]: As Patrick mentioned,

305
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:29,191
[SPEAKER_11]: We're narrowing it, we're improving the geometry, and we're making some significant pedestrian enhancements, which I'll show you in some greater detail momentarily.

306
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:35,235
[SPEAKER_11]: With and through our engagements with the Community Development Board,

307
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:39,726
[SPEAKER_11]: access and traffic were a significant focal point, as you imagine.

308
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:48,112
[SPEAKER_11]: As you mentioned, queuing was something we spent extensive time talking about, and it was part of the city's independent and objective peer review.

309
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:52,135
[SPEAKER_11]: We went through a lot of discussion on that, and I'll get to that in a minute as well.

310
00:27:52,715 --> 00:28:03,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So the site plan itself, as you can see, maybe the cursor on the screen moves, the new fueling facility is going to be kind of in that front right corner of the screen as you're looking at it.

311
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,101
[SPEAKER_11]: We did that with some intent.

312
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,823
[SPEAKER_11]: One, it's nearest to Middlesex.

313
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:12,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, it's furthest from our neighbors.

314
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:16,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And three, it's in a part of the parking lot that we don't utilize.

315
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,490
[SPEAKER_11]: So it made a lot of sense in that regard.

316
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:24,930
[SPEAKER_11]: The project itself is laid out so it was still dimensionally compliant with your underlying zoning.

317
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not here putting a project in and then asking for relief to accommodate said project.

318
00:28:29,372 --> 00:28:30,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still dimensionally compliant.

319
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:36,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It meets all of the requirements of the underlying zoning, and frankly, it fits into the site.

320
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:40,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the things that we did is this access drive.

321
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:41,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll try and zoom in a little bit here.

322
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,060
[SPEAKER_11]: This access drive right here.

323
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I can type that up.

324
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:55,399
[SPEAKER_11]: That used to be a two-way access point, meaning you could come in, go out, you could make a left in, left out, right in, right out.

325
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,360
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an entrance only now.

326
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we've done is we've made this much cleaner from an access point.

327
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:08,324
[SPEAKER_11]: It's much smoother, it's much more refined, and it's much simpler.

328
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:13,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what happens, what we have here is the actual fueling facility.

329
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:17,487
[SPEAKER_11]: There are six dispensers and 12 fueling positions.

330
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,568
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of my segue into the queuing discussion.

331
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:27,250
[SPEAKER_11]: We can accommodate 12 vehicles at fueling positions.

332
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:36,093
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the ability in the back of that to essentially stack another 12 vehicles behind them, another 12 vehicles behind that.

333
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:47,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus with the extended throat that we have, if you will, as we come in here, our total ability to stack vehicles is at or in exceedance of 40 vehicles.

334
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:48,458
[SPEAKER_11]: That is substantial.

335
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:49,863
[SPEAKER_11]: That is substantial.

336
00:29:50,083 --> 00:30:04,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And this site and this layout was driven in large part by that preference because when it went through peer review and community development board, that was one of the primary focal points they told us they wanted consideration of.

337
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:15,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And the site plan was changed and revised to further increase the queuing to a point where their traffic consultant, our traffic consultant, and the community development board felt comfortable and that it was appropriate.

338
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I can keep going if there's any questions or you want to talk.

339
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:26,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing that we did too is there's a fairly substantial landscape volume you can see generally centered on the screen.

340
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:38,075
[SPEAKER_11]: That was requested by the traffic peer review to really formalize traffic and make this a counter-clockwise pattern as you come into the property.

341
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:43,816
[SPEAKER_11]: and have it be very, very uniform, so you don't get vehicles that want to oppose each other.

342
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:57,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very defined, it's very clean, and it gives you a counterclockwise, one-way circulation pattern, and then pushes those vehicles out to this two-way intersection, which is formalized and further away from Middlesex.

343
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:00,648
[SPEAKER_11]: With this Plan 2,

344
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:06,691
[SPEAKER_11]: we've added a substantial amount of green space and landscaping.

345
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:07,531
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see it on this plan.

346
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:15,256
[SPEAKER_11]: It's over 4,000 square feet of landscaping, which may not sound like a lot on the surface, but on a property like this, it is very, very significant.

347
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:20,320
[SPEAKER_11]: So we also worked very closely with conservation.

348
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,563
[SPEAKER_11]: They were paramount in our review process and very thorough.

349
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:30,427
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that was a priority for them was stormwater.

350
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:47,093
[SPEAKER_11]: So the system that we have here and we've designed is a state-of-the-art system, it's a closed drainage network where, frankly, in existing condition, in this particular part of the site, a lot of the runoff was sheet flow, and it wasn't really controlled, it wasn't collected, it wasn't treated.

351
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:59,379
[SPEAKER_11]: With us reducing the amount of impervious, and we're adding technology into the stormwater system to treat, collect, and in some cases detain the runoff before it leaves the property,

352
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:07,404
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a pretty substantial improvement and one that the commission obviously acknowledged by way of their granting of a positive order of conditions.

353
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:15,006
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're seeing here, this graphic, and I'm gonna get to kind of the punchline here momentarily.

354
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:25,528
[SPEAKER_11]: As I've mentioned, there is substantial amount of upgrades that we've done, particularly with a focus on our neighbors, the roadway network,

355
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:39,740
[SPEAKER_11]: and things that the community, both through the discussion we've had in front of this council, but also through our historical conversations with Community Development Conservation Commission that were made quite apparent, that were very, very important to the community.

356
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:49,309
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those things that you can kind of see in this plan, and I'll show you the rendering here momentarily, we are substantially upgrading the landscaping on Woodruff Avenue.

357
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:54,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Historically, there were some trees there, as you'll see here, and I'll bring this up right now,

358
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Those trees, the bottom image is the existing condition.

359
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,631
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a pretty rugged looking photo, to be perfectly candid.

360
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:11,874
[SPEAKER_11]: The trees there got heavily impacted by some of the utility work, I assume their roots got cut.

361
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:13,674
[SPEAKER_11]: They obviously didn't make it through there.

362
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:17,776
[SPEAKER_11]: The top image is what we're proposing.

363
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:21,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a dense, vegetated screen

364
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:29,337
[SPEAKER_11]: on the interior, and by interior, I mean on the woodruff side of the fence, but also some of that landscaping is occurring on the backside of the fence.

365
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:34,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fence is going to be upgraded to where that fence has seen better days.

366
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:38,439
[SPEAKER_11]: The slatting in there is going to be replaced with new slatting.

367
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:39,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be clean.

368
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be far more improved.

369
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And frankly, you might not even see the fence with all the landscaping that we're doing.

370
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:52,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So these trees here are evergreen plantings, something of an arborvitae type, or what's frequently referred to as a green giant.

371
00:33:53,188 --> 00:34:00,012
[SPEAKER_11]: very dense, they're coniferous, they're not gonna lose leaves over the wintertime, so that screening will be year-round.

372
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:17,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Interdispersed amongst that screen wall, we're going to have deciduous trees too, something with a canopy, visual interest to kind of break up the solid wall and provide a little bit more height and complement what we're proposing.

373
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,182
[SPEAKER_11]: This landscaping, for context,

374
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:28,989
[SPEAKER_11]: runs from the point at which Bradbury intersects Woodruff all the way to the back of the building.

375
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:44,382
[SPEAKER_11]: So from this point here, you can see the cursor on the screen, all the way to the right of the screen, that is going to be reestablished, replanted, and as Patrick pointed out, streetscaped.

376
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:49,766
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that was told to us on a number of occasions in a number of public venues

377
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,298
[SPEAKER_11]: was of critical importance.

378
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:57,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And we listened, and that is a pretty significant upgrade.

379
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,861
[SPEAKER_11]: If you spin and turn around, this is essentially the same positioning.

380
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:12,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking back towards Middlesex, back towards where the fueling facility is going to be, we're doing the same thing.

381
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:16,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I only spun the camera here just to give you context looking up and down Woodruff.

382
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:21,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And this screening here is going to extend

383
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:34,779
[SPEAKER_11]: All the way down to Bradbury, there's a fairly established vegetation wall from Bradbury as you approach the substation that we're not going to touch.

384
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,522
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no point in us kind of getting in there and tangling with that.

385
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just ask a question about that.

386
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.

387
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:45,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in the plans, it said something about tree removal for the EV stations.

388
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, where would those be coming from?

389
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,931
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are.

390
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:56,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe we're going to have any tree removal for EVs, so I'll get there.

391
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I'm making it up.

392
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I saw it somewhere.

393
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:05,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So the new, we're proposing four electric vehicle spaces right here.

394
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:10,718
[SPEAKER_11]: We put them in that part of the parking lot because the infrastructure is there and it's not going to require clearing.

395
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:14,361
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had contemplated to your question, we had contemplated earlier

396
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:18,564
[SPEAKER_11]: a different location for the EV space that may have required some tree removal.

397
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:22,446
[SPEAKER_11]: This space does not, and was part of the reason we found it more favorable.

398
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:23,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

399
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:23,766
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome.

400
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:32,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So, this is the substation I'm zooming in on here, you can see it.

401
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:41,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't do a rendering here, but what we're also doing is the vegetation that you saw in those proposed renderings, we are going to supplement

402
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,902
[SPEAKER_11]: the vegetation that's there today.

403
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:49,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if I can get Magic Google Man to show us what that all looks like.

404
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:55,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is what that looks like today.

405
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not lovely.

406
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Those trees there are established.

407
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,386
[SPEAKER_11]: They seem to be in pretty good shape.

408
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:06,027
[SPEAKER_11]: They do actually get green in the spring and summer.

409
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,427
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a pretty high canopy there.

410
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So the intent for us is to blend that in.

411
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:21,207
[SPEAKER_11]: and in locations where that vegetation just simply doesn't exist, like this corner down here, or if it does, it's not wonderful.

412
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:27,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Extend what I showed you on those renderings down to this location.

413
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:34,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So the intent is to make that spot look like this spot to the extent that the overhead wires will accommodate those trees.

414
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:40,498
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea is that there's essentially a solid vegetated wall from the rear of the BJ building

415
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,794
[SPEAKER_11]: to the substation that looks like that.

416
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:52,358
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see from the photo, it does a pretty good job of masking the parking lot and to a large extent, the building.

417
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:56,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And we think that's a pretty significant upgrade over what has historically been there.

418
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:06,906
[SPEAKER_11]: The next part of this conversation was the improvements that we were making and we've committed to make to Middlesex Avenue.

419
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:11,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we heard is that Middlesex Avenue is very,

420
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:12,397
[SPEAKER_11]: very important.

421
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:18,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only was it an important road, it wanted to be substantially more pedestrian and bike friendly.

422
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:32,352
[SPEAKER_11]: What we've done is worked with the Community Development Board with MassDOT to develop a plan that improves nearly a quarter mile of Middlesex Avenue.

423
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:36,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's consistent with the complete streets program that is in the city's master plan.

424
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:44,568
[SPEAKER_11]: and was something that was very significant in its importance as part of our discussions with the Community Development Board.

425
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:50,671
[SPEAKER_11]: What that looks like, something to that effect.

426
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:55,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we've done here is you're standing looking north on Middlesex.

427
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:59,596
[SPEAKER_11]: This driveway on the immediate left of the image is the site driveway.

428
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:02,297
[SPEAKER_11]: That driveway is substantially narrower.

429
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,779
[SPEAKER_11]: As Patrick mentioned, the geometry's been improved.

430
00:39:05,939 --> 00:39:06,660
[SPEAKER_11]: The sidewalk

431
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,071
[SPEAKER_11]: is going to be ADA accessible.

432
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:18,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're reconstructing it along the project frontage, improving the striping, and bringing that into compliance with the current accessibility standards.

433
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:27,865
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of that, this striping here is for a defined and dedicated bike lane on both sides of the road.

434
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:32,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And that extends nearly a quarter mile into this image

435
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:38,559
[SPEAKER_11]: which is approximately 1,400 feet, is the total length of the improvements we're making to Middlesex Avenue.

436
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:47,484
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also superimposed the landscaping improvements, some of the site features here, to the extent that they would show on this image.

437
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:55,769
[SPEAKER_11]: What we didn't have context for in our prior discussions with this council was what this actually looked like.

438
00:39:56,049 --> 00:40:00,531
[SPEAKER_11]: And we realized after the fact that that was pretty impactful.

439
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:24,277
[SPEAKER_11]: In response to that, not only have we prepared these to give you a much better visual depiction of what we expect this to look like, but also have upgraded it significantly since our last discussions to really listen to the feedback you provided, the public had provided, and show that we're committed to being a good neighbor here.

440
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,121
[SPEAKER_11]: With respect to some of the other improvements that we're making, too, I mentioned electric vehicle.

441
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:33,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to dismiss that.

442
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:35,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We are putting EV charging stations in.

443
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:42,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard that on multiple occasions, so Patrick and his team have committed to that and have an agreement in place to install those.

444
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a question on that.

445
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you need a BJ's membership to use those chargers?

446
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe so.

447
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:53,087
[SPEAKER_19]: We're still working out the details for that, to be perfectly honest with you, Madam Chair.

448
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:56,250
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd like to have that be a member benefit.

449
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:03,395
[SPEAKER_19]: People pay for a membership when they come to BJ's, and it's part of the benefits of having a membership.

450
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:06,518
[SPEAKER_19]: But to be candid with you, we haven't quite worked that out on our side yet.

451
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:09,740
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's still up for discussion and consideration.

452
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:10,401
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

453
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:10,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

454
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:19,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And then kind of in conjunction with what I'd mentioned on the Middlesex Ave,

455
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Improvements what we've done too.

456
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:29,955
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked very closely with conservation and community development We extended Pedestrian accommodations all the way interior to the property.

457
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:40,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So there historically has been no sidewalk connection here and we're bringing that all the way in from Right here magical hand is just a question from councilor Scarpelli.

458
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:40,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

459
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep

460
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:57,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Before you move the screen and change the screen, I know that some of the neighbors, one of the questions they had were really when the business was closed, maybe there were racing cars.

461
00:41:58,414 --> 00:42:05,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we putting in speed bumps as race walks on the premises or in the lanes now?

462
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:13,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't put in speed bumps or any of those kind of restrictors, if you will.

463
00:42:14,076 --> 00:42:16,621
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you, and Patrick mentioned it, and you can speak to it too.

464
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:18,993
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very aware of those considerations.

465
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:23,855
[SPEAKER_11]: And Patrick mentioned with the trucks, if he can talk to what operations is doing to kind of combat that.

466
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, Councilor Scrivley, thanks for bringing that up because it is a concern.

467
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:28,996
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've heard that in the past as well.

468
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:34,118
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like those trucks that are parked there right now, I wish I could control these people from doing silly things.

469
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,900
[SPEAKER_19]: But your suggestion of speed bumps is a good one.

470
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
[SPEAKER_19]: We've looked at that in the past.

471
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, we have to plow the area and then a speed bump gets ripped up.

472
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:44,863
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not trying to kind of push back on it.

473
00:42:44,883 --> 00:42:45,783
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to be practical.

474
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:59,032
[SPEAKER_19]: But a better solution that we've identified in the past at other locations is we can track the license plates of these people who are illicitly using our parking field for this silly drag racing and then capture them on camera.

475
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:04,020
[SPEAKER_19]: from a camera that's mounted on a light pole, and then submit that to your police department for enforcement action.

476
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the last thing we want is screeching tires in the middle of the night, and we want them out of there just as much as you do.

477
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:19,303
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are happy to commit to a program like that, where we identify and submit that information to your police department for enforcement action.

478
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,304
[SPEAKER_20]: We appreciate that.

479
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:25,845
[SPEAKER_20]: But I know that talking to some of the residents, probably the worst time is during the spring and summer.

480
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:32,842
[SPEAKER_20]: where I know they have the removable speed bumps.

481
00:43:33,062 --> 00:43:38,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Could that be possibly looked into for spring and summer months that we could put those down?

482
00:43:38,087 --> 00:43:47,194
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that in the city, we've had areas with the temporary raised bumps to try to control the speeding.

483
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:54,100
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, and I know we're not looking in this picture, it's not showing much of the back of the building on the Fellsway side.

484
00:43:54,803 --> 00:44:11,918
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's good to see all the work being done at the front, but on the back, I know that in the past, I know when I used to work there, they used to have a gate that at the end of the evening, we used to close access to the back of the building when businesses closed.

485
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:13,179
[SPEAKER_20]: On the Felsworth side?

486
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,620
[SPEAKER_20]: On the Felsworth side, years ago.

487
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we take delivery trucks on that side.

488
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:18,003
[SPEAKER_19]: We do.

489
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:21,065
[SPEAKER_19]: To try to prevent them being on the residential side.

490
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:29,130
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to keep that open, but I will absolutely acknowledge your suggestion of the removable speed bumps, or whatever you want to call them.

491
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,291
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm happy to commit to that as well.

492
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I appreciate that.

493
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:33,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

494
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:33,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

495
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:34,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice Mayor Bears.

496
00:44:34,532 --> 00:44:36,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick follow up on this one.

497
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:48,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It does look like at the southeast corner of the building, you're adding what looks to me to be maybe some curving to curve the street a little bit, to curve kind of that entryway a little bit more.

498
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:58,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And then is there additional curbing being added in the parking area as well to kind of delineate the roadways more than they currently are delineated now, or does that indicate existing curbing?

499
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:00,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a couple of things.

500
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:01,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, good question.

501
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:05,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It depicts existing curbing to the extent that it's there.

502
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:05,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

503
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:08,296
[SPEAKER_11]: and new curbing where we're proposing it.

504
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:18,982
[SPEAKER_11]: We are proposing a fair amount of new curbing in here to formalize the traffic pattern, to define them, which I think where you're going with this is that that's a physical barrier to people just ripping across the parking lot.

505
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:21,463
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really defines traffic patterns.

506
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,065
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are doing both.

507
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:28,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's existing curbing in certain places, particularly along the main channel here.

508
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:33,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this here, which this has kind of been the biggest speedway, if you will,

509
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,261
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be substantially changed.

510
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:37,261
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of curbing going in.

511
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,162
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a big bumper island that's in place.

512
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:49,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Patrick mentioned, we'll commit to those removable temporary barriers that can be put in seasonally to really make those an impediment.

513
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:49,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

514
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:52,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And then your question about the additional curbing.

515
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:57,250
[SPEAKER_11]: We did try to formalize that approach into the parking lot just a little bit more.

516
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,871
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted people turning in and not running parallel to the extent that we could.

517
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:05,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wasn't a major geometric improvement, but we think it's an improvement nonetheless.

518
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:07,313
[SPEAKER_11]: We've kind of generalized it a bit better.

519
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I notice it's a tight corner.

520
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:16,716
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, you could probably swing a pretty straight shot all the way from the back of the building all the way to the substation.

521
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like there's going to be some stuff to mitigate that.

522
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:19,957
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to discourage that.

523
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:20,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.

524
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:23,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions at this time?

525
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:26,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Please continue.

526
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:35,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I've reached a point where I'm happy to kind of get into any additional questions, details that the council may wish to discuss.

527
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

528
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:38,505
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Rowland.

529
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:40,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for the thorough overview.

530
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:50,971
[SPEAKER_22]: On the vegetative screening along Woodruff Avenue, I'm just curious, what's the timeline on the sort of what, if that were to go in, when can residents expect to be able to fully enjoy that?

531
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:52,272
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know to what extent it's

532
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:56,806
[SPEAKER_22]: planting of existing adolescent trees or waiting for a lot of growth to happen?

533
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:58,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good question.

534
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:06,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we've selected here, the green giant, for example, they can grow up to 350 a year after the first year.

535
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:14,379
[SPEAKER_11]: We're showing these, I wouldn't say at full maturity, but a couple of years into their growth pattern, those are approximately 6 to 8 feet tall.

536
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,441
[SPEAKER_11]: When you buy them, they might be in the 5 to 6 foot range.

537
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:21,144
[SPEAKER_11]: You might see a year or two that you'd see those green giants get to the height we're showing in here.

538
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:33,338
[SPEAKER_11]: what we'd like to do in a perfect world, and I'm being a bit presumptuous, but to kind of get these going in the spring, as soon as we're able to plant, we'd get this going almost immediately.

539
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:48,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and then furthering that, Councilor Collins, we will commit to installing that landscaping as the first phase of this project before we put a shovel in the ground or anything related to the other work that's proposed, we shall do this landscaping first.

540
00:47:49,123 --> 00:47:49,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

541
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:52,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

542
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,640
[SPEAKER_11]: People I, I'm still the host and there's a couple of folks that want to get in.

543
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I admit or with great power.

544
00:47:58,881 --> 00:47:59,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

545
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:02,142
[SPEAKER_11]: As Patrick mentioned about the trucks parking isn't just your parking lot.

546
00:48:12,762 --> 00:48:14,483
[SPEAKER_29]: They park at the Felsbury Plaza.

547
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,305
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an issue throughout the city.

548
00:48:17,386 --> 00:48:21,189
[SPEAKER_29]: The city has towed a bunch of some other properties already.

549
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:26,813
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's an issue, not your fault, but it's happening all over the city.

550
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,995
[SPEAKER_29]: We seek to resolve it, thank you.

551
00:48:31,797 --> 00:48:39,923
[SPEAKER_29]: Being a customer and buying gas from you, what happens is people are confused when they're in that queue there.

552
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:59,216
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think if, and as I say, I've seen it at your other stations, if you can get the guy to come out of that little boot there and kind of guide the cars into it, because sometimes, you know, the gas tanks are left, right, and people stand there and there's all these open pumps and no one guides them to the openings.

553
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:06,420
[SPEAKER_29]: So in critical peak times when the cars are queuing, if the gentleman or the person who was in that little boot there

554
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:13,049
[SPEAKER_29]: comes out there and kind of goes out there and guides them into the spots, I think that would be a help also.

555
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,231
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

556
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:20,280
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I've seen people, they get frustrated because they're looking at the scene, six pumps are open and there's cars waiting.

557
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,722
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that would be a...

558
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:29,468
[SPEAKER_29]: when the line does get a little bit, if the president come out and just kind of get him into the spot, push him up a little bit.

559
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,411
[SPEAKER_29]: That would help alleviate some of the traffic that's up.

560
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:34,532
[SPEAKER_19]: You're absolutely right.

561
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,734
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a pinch point and we've dealt with that.

562
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,597
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, I wish I could control what the public does, but you're absolutely right.

563
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:41,517
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a good suggestion.

564
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:42,698
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll be happy to look into that.

565
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:43,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

566
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:43,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

567
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

568
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:47,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

569
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:48,603
[SPEAKER_22]: One more question while you're up here.

570
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:50,464
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the notes about

571
00:49:52,107 --> 00:49:56,490
[SPEAKER_22]: pursuing better signage and a towing policy for unauthorized trucks in the parking area.

572
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:06,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that we also heard from residents about some problems, noise pollution coming from potentially authorized trucks with a lot of offloading happening into the evening hours.

573
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,879
[SPEAKER_22]: I was curious if, is there currently a policy around that?

574
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:12,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that something that could be resolved as well?

575
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:17,670
[SPEAKER_19]: probably referring to the backup sounds that the trucks have made.

576
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,753
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take a leap and just make that assumption.

577
00:50:19,813 --> 00:50:26,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, every time a truck backs up in this country, that's the sound it makes, and we're not able to mute that.

578
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:28,025
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could, but we

579
00:50:30,048 --> 00:50:30,808
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't.

580
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,209
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to comply with the law there.

581
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:37,731
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of our loading facility, we have a no idle policy.

582
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:40,452
[SPEAKER_19]: There's what's called an APU, which is an alternate power source.

583
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:47,154
[SPEAKER_19]: It powers both the cab so the battery doesn't drain, as well as the refrigeration unit if there is a refrigerated trailer.

584
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:55,357
[SPEAKER_19]: So unlike those people who are in our parking lot right now idling their truck and being a disturbance, we do not do that.

585
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:56,958
[SPEAKER_19]: And we make it a policy not to do that.

586
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:05,457
[SPEAKER_19]: because it's a waste of gas, it's a waste of resources, and it does create a sound issue, and that's not what we do, and that's not our policy.

587
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:07,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hope that answers your question.

588
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:07,941
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

589
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:08,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

590
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tsengh.

591
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:10,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

592
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:12,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tsengh, I heard you.

593
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:12,668
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go back to you.

594
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to you.

595
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:16,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, mine's quick.

596
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:20,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the, in a similar vein to Councilor Collins' question.

597
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We also heard from residents about odor, odor concerns with the new gas station coming in.

598
00:51:26,944 --> 00:51:33,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you guys can do to minimize that effect of the odor of gasoline?

599
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:39,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there anything that you guys are, that's already in this plan that speaks to that?

600
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:40,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, yeah.

601
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:42,476
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, and I've got a control image in here, Jason.

602
00:51:42,756 --> 00:51:43,817
[SPEAKER_19]: You can come up and speak to it.

603
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:47,825
[SPEAKER_19]: the technical aspects of that, but the station is fully self-contained.

604
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,550
[SPEAKER_19]: There are no odors that emanate.

605
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:51,936
[SPEAKER_19]: many from it.

606
00:51:53,157 --> 00:52:00,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, if there's a small spill, everyone has a drip along the ground, you might smell something locally.

607
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:06,561
[SPEAKER_19]: But Jason can speak to the odor potential for the station as it relates to fill up or fueling.

608
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:08,482
[SPEAKER_19]: So why don't you give a quick summary on that, Jason.

609
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:09,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is Jason Carr.

610
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:10,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm with Stantec Consulting.

611
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:12,924
[SPEAKER_14]: We're fuel system engineers.

612
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:14,284
[SPEAKER_14]: We're BJs.

613
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:16,385
[SPEAKER_14]: So a quick

614
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,126
[SPEAKER_14]: overview of the gas station vapor controls.

615
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:24,028
[SPEAKER_14]: The underground storage tanks have what is called stage one vapor recovery.

616
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:31,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So during any fuel transfers, all the fuel that goes into the tank is recovered inside the tank inside of a closed system.

617
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:36,585
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's recovered into the bulk fuel carrier where it's transported off site.

618
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:40,067
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is no emissions at all during the fuel transfer.

619
00:52:40,687 --> 00:53:00,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And likewise, during the fuel delivery into their fuel transfer into your personal vehicle, that also has a recovery built in where those any emissions during the fuel transfer is actually recovered inside the vehicle and also inside the dispenser and goes back into the underground storage

620
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:03,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a completely closed system.

621
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:07,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is a Massachusetts DEP and EPA requirement.

622
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:15,703
[SPEAKER_14]: And it does provide a very, there's no direct emissions coming out of any of the vent stacks.

623
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:19,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are just, those are there as relief in the event of an unusual operating condition.

624
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:22,388
[SPEAKER_14]: But that, you know, that's a closed system.

625
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

626
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that answers your question.

627
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

628
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:28,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

629
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:33,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumping back to the late night sound and cleaning issues.

630
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:42,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think one of the issues that I, you know, we've had a lot of email chains around the property over time because of stuff happening late at night.

631
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it may be trucks that aren't your guys.

632
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Some days it might be the backup noise from delivery from your trucks.

633
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:54,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I think recently it was actually like vacuum trucks of some kind sweeping.

634
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like street sweepers and they were just there late at night.

635
00:53:57,462 --> 00:54:04,592
[SPEAKER_07]: And it ended up being, and I'm not sure you're aware of it, or I'm not sure exactly how it was dispensed of, but it was a violation of the city noise ordinance.

636
00:54:04,652 --> 00:54:09,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe the police were notified, code enforcement was notified, and like a ticket was issued, or at least a warning was issued.

637
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:13,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that was probably authorized activity.

638
00:54:14,605 --> 00:54:22,310
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, or I don't know if you've cleaned a lot regularly or we do, and that is not our policy, because it just doesn't make sense.

639
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,171
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, sorry about that.

640
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that is not how we roll.

641
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:32,417
[SPEAKER_19]: If you pardon the expression, but we'll be happy to commit to no overnight street sweeping.

642
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,918
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awful.

643
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:35,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

644
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:36,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.

645
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:41,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And so and the reason I bring it up, and I appreciate that, that commitment, I think, you know,

646
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of this is going to be about coming up with a framework of a system where we can be in dialogue.

647
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:49,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And when things come up, we can engage more directly.

648
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:55,510
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I mentioned in my opener there about establishing those communication lines with the regional maintenance manager.

649
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,031
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not a low level person.

650
00:54:57,271 --> 00:55:03,494
[SPEAKER_19]: It's someone who works at the home office with me who lives in this area, who knows this club very well.

651
00:55:03,514 --> 00:55:04,855
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're absolutely right.

652
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:07,776
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're happy to engage in that dialogue to

653
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:09,272
[SPEAKER_19]: course correct when we have to.

654
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:09,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

655
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:15,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, you know, I want to acknowledge that that's a, that's a piece of kind of what we're looking at as a sort of a conditions for, for this license.

656
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:16,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate that.

657
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:26,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we're going to, you know, iterate and work through that over time, um, where that, you know, there's going to be things that fall through the cracks and we're going to need to make sure that, uh, you know, accountability is there when that happens.

658
00:55:26,977 --> 00:55:36,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I just wanted to flag that because, you know, for, for, uh, the advanced maintenance program of the weekly sweeping and the day Porter service, you said it's five days a week of the day Porter service.

659
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:44,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and the spring and fall landscaping vacuuming emptying of dumpsters and stuff, you know, that's all going to happen.

660
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:50,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that's happening before 10pm at night, you know, is that Yeah, absolutely.

661
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:59,595
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I wasn't clear on that in my opener, I'm happy to to affirm that to you now that we will we will not do any overnight street sweeping that

662
00:56:00,592 --> 00:56:01,752
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry somebody did that.

663
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,053
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just stupid.

664
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:03,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

665
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:08,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, again, it was, you know, it hasn't happened since the resident reported it and it was addressed.

666
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:12,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if the on-site person, something happened and I understand there's contracts.

667
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:25,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I'm not trying to place blame, just say what happened and mention that that's, you know, I think the goal of whatever we agree to and come up with should be that if there are issues, they're addressed promptly and don't happen again.

668
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:26,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it seems like there's a commitment there.

669
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: On dumpsters and trash receptacles and, you know, maintenance of landscaping.

670
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:39,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to flag for you guys that probably makes sense for your

671
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:58,322
[SPEAKER_07]: maintenance team to just review the city did pass a road road and control ordinance recently I haven't heard anything specific about the site around that so I'm not making any allegations of such but it's just a new ordinance that we passed recently that I think would make sense for the folks involved and on the ground to be aware of so that if there are issues they're just there in compliance in advance.

672
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:07,544
[SPEAKER_07]: On the landscaping maintenance, I know that you did commit to landscaping the new on-site pieces.

673
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:16,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Now for the Woodrofab and for the Woodrofab improvements that are technically not on the property of BJ's, are those going to be maintained over time by BJ's as well?

674
00:57:16,447 --> 00:57:25,550
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we'll do there is we'll provide a one year warranty, either one growing season or one year, however that works out depends on when you plant them to make sure they have taken.

675
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:29,568
[SPEAKER_19]: and that'll be as part of the contract that we get, but then they'll be in the public right away.

676
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:46,218
[SPEAKER_19]: So that'd be the responsibility of the city, but we're happy to work with this Community Development Board and their professionals to pick drought tolerant plants that make sense for our setting and our climate region so that we can ensure their survival.

677
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:49,620
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want to plant things that are just gonna die in a couple of years.

678
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,960
[SPEAKER_19]: That doesn't make any sense.

679
00:57:51,621 --> 00:57:55,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and on that front, you know, I think the,

680
00:57:57,317 --> 00:58:04,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And from the renderings it looks like that's going to provide a real natural vegetative barrier that's going to help with sound at site issues, which I think is great.

681
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:15,252
[SPEAKER_07]: The flip side of that is that looks like a lot of stuff to maintain to me and and you know and I'm not an expert in landscaping or maintenance of landscaping but

682
00:58:16,565 --> 00:58:22,047
[SPEAKER_07]: You noted in the presentation that there was utility work done and trees ended up dying.

683
00:58:22,907 --> 00:58:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've kind of seen that the city has not had the resources to go back and fix that issue on our own.

684
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:32,631
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very tight for money and it's a constant issue on all fronts.

685
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:36,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to, I appreciate the one year warranty and I appreciate the improvements.

686
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:42,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want us to be back here in five years and half of it's dead and the city saying we can't really maintain this or we don't have the funds too.

687
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:44,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to kind of play that out a little bit.

688
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:46,240
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good point.

689
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:55,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I think to kind of further Patrick's discussion, what we've selected here are plants that are intended to be low maintenance.

690
00:58:55,944 --> 00:59:08,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But as Patrick pointed out in his opening remarks, and he reiterated just a moment ago, the intent here is that you have a live human being who you can reach out to that Patrick knows that we can connect with.

691
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the city sees something

692
00:59:10,655 --> 00:59:14,456
[SPEAKER_11]: with the vegetation that say, hey, this thing's becoming unruly, say, right?

693
00:59:14,956 --> 00:59:17,416
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could use some help here to take care of that immediately.

694
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:24,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And Patrick has, and he does currently have and will continue to have a landscaping maintenance contract for the property.

695
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:30,359
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're aware of something that needs attention, we can address that and work with you to do it.

696
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:34,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would even be for the landscaping that's on the public right away?

697
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think so, because it's going to be part of that whole offer.

698
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:38,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It's contiguous.

699
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:42,843
[SPEAKER_11]: The landscaping is not going to really know that it's on one side of the boundary or another.

700
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:45,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can work with you to identify something.

701
00:59:45,524 --> 00:59:48,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We're happy to help you figure that out.

702
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:48,866
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the intent.

703
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not to set it and forget it.

704
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:50,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your problem now.

705
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,848
[SPEAKER_11]: The intent is that this is going to be a collaboration.

706
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:55,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

707
00:59:55,349 --> 01:00:01,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I guess could we, you know, would you be comfortable if we kind of formalize that in more specific written language as a condition that the

708
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:08,988
[SPEAKER_07]: that there'd be the potential for the landscaping, on-site landscaping to address issues in the public right away on Woodruff Ave or, you know.

709
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:17,550
[SPEAKER_19]: I think what you're saying, Councilor, and I'll take it even one step further, is that you want, and I'll tell you what, I want that buffer to be maintained.

710
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:17,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

711
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,150
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand that.

712
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,811
[SPEAKER_19]: So how about we do this?

713
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,612
[SPEAKER_19]: We shall commit to the, not the maintenance of the buffer, but the preservation of the screening.

714
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:28,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So if there's a dead plant,

715
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,451
[SPEAKER_19]: we shall replace it.

716
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:36,534
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're not going to mow the grass over there or do the normal maintenance things that you have.

717
01:00:37,414 --> 01:00:38,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly, yeah.

718
01:00:38,114 --> 01:00:45,538
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys have your program, but in year five, if there's a arborvitae that dies, we will replace that.

719
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:46,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think that's exactly right.

720
01:00:46,718 --> 01:00:51,901
[SPEAKER_19]: And maintain that screen for our neighbors on Woodruff Ave, because it's the right thing to do.

721
01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:52,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

722
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:54,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sounds right.

723
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:57,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And really where I'm getting at here is I think the goal here, and I think

724
01:00:58,517 --> 01:01:01,899
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of how we all got to this point, is a lack of trust.

725
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:19,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you know, and I think you've done, basically, however we can structure an agreement to build trust, rebuild it, and then maintain it in the long run, so that the city government, you guys on your end, and the residents all have certainty and clarity about how that arrangement's gonna work, is, I think, really important.

726
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:22,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate that, and I think that that would go a long way on that front.

727
01:01:23,353 --> 01:01:24,274
[SPEAKER_19]: We seek the same thing.

728
01:01:26,634 --> 01:01:32,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Just on the last couple of things, I have a few more things, and I apologize for monopolizing time.

729
01:01:33,461 --> 01:01:41,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Just on the annual report, could we just put in a specific date of it will be annually by May 31st?

730
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a comfortable, acceptable to you all?

731
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:45,213
[SPEAKER_19]: How about we do it?

732
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:48,225
[SPEAKER_19]: But how about January 31st?

733
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:50,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's been our fiscal year.

734
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:51,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

735
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:51,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

736
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:53,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to keep it consistent with our reporting.

737
01:01:54,288 --> 01:01:55,208
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds great to me.

738
01:01:55,288 --> 01:01:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think any annualized date will help.

739
01:01:57,549 --> 01:02:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we know when it's coming, and we're not asking around for it, and you guys aren't wondering if you've met the deadline.

740
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:09,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Last couple things on the BJ's representative, I appreciate that as well.

741
01:02:09,573 --> 01:02:12,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Something, if you would be comfortable with it, would you be

742
01:02:14,145 --> 01:02:20,809
[SPEAKER_07]: amenable to us, the city of Medford making that person's contact information in some form available on our city website.

743
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Making that as part of the public sphere is.

744
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:27,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like you to have access to it.

745
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:32,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like you to distribute it to anyone who has concerns with putting the gentleman's phone number on the website.

746
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:36,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, not necessarily his personal information.

747
01:02:36,129 --> 01:02:43,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no, this is his personal cell phone that we are willing to provide you because we want you to have that access to that information.

748
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:47,658
[SPEAKER_19]: So why don't we leave it as a condition that we will provide you that information.

749
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:52,662
[SPEAKER_19]: And if anybody in the public would like to get that information that you can broker that

750
01:02:53,955 --> 01:02:54,955
[SPEAKER_19]: easily and quickly.

751
01:02:56,116 --> 01:02:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

752
01:02:56,756 --> 01:03:01,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there an email address, maybe a general email address, a customer service email address, or something like that?

753
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:08,040
[SPEAKER_19]: We shy away from those because it gets flooded with spam, unfortunately.

754
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,660
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've set those up in the past.

755
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,481
[SPEAKER_19]: And then all of a sudden, it's full of stuff from Russia.

756
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,703
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would like to say yes and tell you that it's going to work out great.

757
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:20,864
[SPEAKER_19]: But over several months, the bots, they get you.

758
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:21,644
[SPEAKER_19]: And all of a sudden, it's

759
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,751
[SPEAKER_09]: You sound like that Nigerian Prince I get the emails from today.

760
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:31,673
[SPEAKER_19]: We will ensure that this representatives needs to regional maintenance managers contact information is provided updated, so that direct lines of communication can be established between the city or the public

761
01:03:46,872 --> 01:03:48,973
[SPEAKER_19]: and this individual so that issues can be resolved.

762
01:03:49,014 --> 01:03:50,014
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's what you're driving at.

763
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did not realize it was going to be a personal cell phone number.

764
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:55,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not ask that to be placed on the city website.

765
01:03:56,379 --> 01:04:02,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, something, and kind of in addition to a slash around this, I don't know how your website structure works.

766
01:04:02,783 --> 01:04:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if you are an expert on that.

767
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:09,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But is there a page for this specific store somewhere on the BJ's website?

768
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:09,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

769
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:14,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you put something on there pointing to the city of Medford, you know, if you have

770
01:04:14,987 --> 01:04:17,268
[SPEAKER_07]: question or concern, you can reach the City of Medford.

771
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:21,030
[SPEAKER_07]: The City of Medford can help you reach us to address it or something like that, you know.

772
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:35,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many people are going to your website to complain about you, quite frankly, but, you know, I'm just trying to think of ways that we can make it clear to people that there is an option here that if you have a question or concern that you want addressed, you know, and if you come to the city website, it tells you who here can help you address that.

773
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:39,720
[SPEAKER_07]: If it goes to your website, you could say the city, we have an arrangement with the city or

774
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,362
[SPEAKER_19]: We could look into that we, we've never done that in the past.

775
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:50,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I prefer to be through through your, not your body but through through the city's organization, understand you don't mind.

776
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:50,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

777
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:53,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's where I land on that.

778
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:54,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's fine.

779
01:04:54,249 --> 01:05:03,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was just kind of exploring that one out a little bit more but, again, I think the someone in the city having a personal phone number being able to have that direct contact is very important to us.

780
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:13,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Last couple things, or last final thing, actually, is on the improvements on Middlesex Ave.

781
01:05:14,163 --> 01:05:22,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those, and again, you're not MassDOT and you're not the city of Medford in terms of opening roads, so I appreciate the...

782
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:26,137
[SPEAKER_07]: commitment to making some significant improvements to the roadscape on Middlesex Ave.

783
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:33,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Just my question, I couldn't quite tell from the plans, are those going to dead end at the Malden line and then at whatever that barrier is to the south?

784
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:36,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it connecting to an existing bike lane or other improvement?

785
01:05:40,966 --> 01:05:43,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we've got our traffic engineer.

786
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:45,980
[SPEAKER_19]: from the VA.

787
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Sean.

788
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:46,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

789
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Madam President, members of the Council.

790
01:05:50,061 --> 01:05:51,422
[SPEAKER_08]: It would dead end, ultimately.

791
01:05:51,942 --> 01:05:56,283
[SPEAKER_08]: At First Street, we'd be transitioning to Sherwood Lanes, and that would carry to Fifth, and then the bike lanes would end there.

792
01:05:56,343 --> 01:06:04,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So in total, it's about 1,400 feet of exclusive bike lanes, and then to the south, another 1,000 feet of Sherwood as the Sherwood Lane, and then it goes back to existing condition.

793
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:04,746
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

794
01:06:05,106 --> 01:06:06,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Just your name for the record, please.

795
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:09,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean Kelly with the NASA Associates out of Andover, Massachusetts.

796
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

797
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:11,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

798
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's just helpful for me to know.

799
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:18,715
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obviously a jurisdictionally difficult area, so I understand why some of that is the way it is.

800
01:06:18,915 --> 01:06:19,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

801
01:06:19,616 --> 01:06:20,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm done.

802
01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:20,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

803
01:06:21,697 --> 01:06:22,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

804
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:24,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

805
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the team from BJS for being here this evening.

806
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:31,884
[SPEAKER_09]: This has been quite a long dance for all of us, I think.

807
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:42,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end of the day, looking at what's before us here and the proposals that have been made and the concessions that have been made, the mitigation efforts that have been made, can you just give me

808
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:51,870
[SPEAKER_09]: the ballpark cost as to how much all these extras for mitigation are going to cost PJs at this point?

809
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,252
[SPEAKER_19]: You're talking about the work that's outside of our scope of building a gas station?

810
01:06:56,272 --> 01:06:56,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

811
01:06:56,552 --> 01:07:01,155
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I mean, it's several hundred thousand dollars.

812
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:02,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd venture a guess that we're in

813
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:08,062
[SPEAKER_19]: for over probably a half a million dollars at this rate, probably even a little bit more than that.

814
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:11,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's important to show that you're making an investment.

815
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:17,767
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think about DJs, this is your first store, your landmark store.

816
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:22,570
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about the history of the issues that we've had there, but ultimately you're a large employer here in this community as well.

817
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,151
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think you bring a lot of good to the community.

818
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:33,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, these quality of life issues are going to come with any big business that's located in an area that abuts a residential neighborhood.

819
01:07:34,655 --> 01:07:42,578
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's important, I think, to point out the fact that you put money where your mouth is when you're investing in the neighborhood and investing in the community through the proposal that you made for us this evening.

820
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:47,860
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I do have concern about would be an application for extended hours for operation of the gas station.

821
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that's something that I don't think the neighbors would particularly care for.

822
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:57,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that's something that I think that, you know, we'd have to address, you know, going going forward.

823
01:07:57,285 --> 01:08:01,548
[SPEAKER_09]: If you came forward with that application, I don't want to end up in a situation that we're in right now.

824
01:08:01,588 --> 01:08:03,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we don't we don't have any mark.

825
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that.

826
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:10,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the City Council has a provision in the ordinance that anything beyond 7 a.m.

827
01:08:10,293 --> 01:08:10,573
[SPEAKER_13]: to 11 p.m.

828
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:16,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so we're not looking to have anything right because I just don't want to see us doing this again where you know the neighbors don't want it.

829
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:21,658
[SPEAKER_09]: We get to this long Toronto Priya fight about you know what's going to happen for a couple hours.

830
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:23,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Stay with that.

831
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:26,060
[SPEAKER_15]: You're late on this.

832
01:08:27,661 --> 01:08:27,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

833
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:28,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

834
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate you guys taking the time.

835
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:31,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

836
01:08:31,903 --> 01:08:33,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, thank you for presentation.

837
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:35,824
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you have been very thorough and

838
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:39,228
[SPEAKER_20]: answer our questions.

839
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:45,532
[SPEAKER_20]: But most importantly, I think you realize most of these questions derived from the most important people.

840
01:08:45,592 --> 01:08:48,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are our butters and residents live around the area.

841
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:56,719
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, we appreciate that you acknowledge that 1986 and being the, you know, the first B. J. That opens.

842
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,282
[SPEAKER_20]: But, um, I'm sure you've heard from the neighbors that

843
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:02,942
[SPEAKER_20]: it didn't show it.

844
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:04,783
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's what they were concerned with.

845
01:09:05,043 --> 01:09:07,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And, uh, this is good faith and movement.

846
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:15,325
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that, um, it's important that they have a voice and they have someone they can talk to.

847
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:22,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, even if it is through the city in the code enforcement officer, let's say that has a contact number.

848
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:26,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's something that I wanted to make sure we had, and I appreciate that's in there.

849
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:39,172
[SPEAKER_20]: And going the extra mile and giving that person's personal information I think shows the commitment that we haven't seen from BJ's for a long time with our neighbors.

850
01:09:39,232 --> 01:09:42,873
[SPEAKER_20]: So those pitches are pretty drastic.

851
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:51,404
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, with the fencing and the garbage that went through onto Bradbury or Woodruff.

852
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:56,091
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that those are the concerns where you've addressed.

853
01:09:56,152 --> 01:09:58,395
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think the trucks that

854
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,240
[SPEAKER_20]: what frustrates you frustrates all of us.

855
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:14,233
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's something that we as a council have to have a separate meeting with the traffic enforcement, the chief of police and make sure we do we do our job to make sure that that stops.

856
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:17,417
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I appreciate it.

857
01:10:17,617 --> 01:10:18,518
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

858
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:19,819
[SPEAKER_20]: You made

859
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:36,884
[SPEAKER_20]: not just some half remarks saying that you'll try, but you're committed to a lot of these, even with the speed bumps, something that being creative and looking at seven months out of the year, that we can definitely stop that process of speeding down those lanes.

860
01:10:36,924 --> 01:10:39,885
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that is exactly what I was looking for tonight.

861
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:40,946
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate the effort.

862
01:10:41,406 --> 01:10:41,726
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

863
01:10:41,906 --> 01:10:42,246
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

864
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Carbelli.

865
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the Council at this time?

866
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:48,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding that we still do have to open the public hearing.

867
01:10:51,076 --> 01:10:53,918
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, at this point, we will open the public hearing.

868
01:10:54,939 --> 01:11:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us, please come to the podium and speak at this time.

869
01:11:06,886 --> 01:11:12,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would anyone from BJ's, assuming you're in favor of the paper you just presented on, like to just speak in favor of the paper at this time?

870
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the official process of the public hearing.

871
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:16,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone just has to say that they're in favor.

872
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:16,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

873
01:11:17,293 --> 01:11:19,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Austin Turner with Kohler, very much in favor.

874
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:20,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

875
01:11:22,254 --> 01:11:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the paper at this time?

876
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:35,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Tony on Zoom, and this is to speak in favor of the petition at this time.

877
01:11:36,377 --> 01:11:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, I will unmute you if you could to share your name and address for the record, please.

878
01:11:41,038 --> 01:11:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Tony Puccio, Taylor Street, Medford Mass.

879
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:45,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

880
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to mention real quick that I worked there back in 1986, and I've been a member for 30 years.

881
01:11:52,192 --> 01:11:54,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to see businesses thriving in Medford.

882
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that they get the support of the city council.

883
01:11:58,117 --> 01:12:00,859
[SPEAKER_03]: BJ's has been a great supporter of many events in this community.

884
01:12:00,879 --> 01:12:13,551
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always very supportive when I've approached them to ask for sponsorships or money for many of the sports leagues and things that I've worked for, coached for, and also other events that I've tried to raise money for.

885
01:12:14,891 --> 01:12:17,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to see them grow and I hope they, like I said, they get the support.

886
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:19,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a quick question.

887
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:20,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm allowed or not.

888
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering if this was a self-serve station, which I believe it is, if they will have an attendant present for the disabled and the elderly.

889
01:12:29,858 --> 01:12:32,059
[SPEAKER_03]: If that was an answerable question, that would be great.

890
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I just hope that they get support this time because they have supported us.

891
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:45,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad to see a commercial base growing in Medford to help alleviate the tax burden that we all seem to be complaining about all the time.

892
01:12:46,068 --> 01:12:46,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

893
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:48,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that question.

894
01:12:48,902 --> 01:12:53,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Answering the gentleman's question, yes, it is a self-serve facility and state law compels us.

895
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:57,848
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course we would comply with any ADA laws that are out there for someone who needed help.

896
01:12:58,048 --> 01:12:59,729
[SPEAKER_19]: That's standard practice for us.

897
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:00,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

898
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:00,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

899
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:04,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper at this time?

900
01:13:07,253 --> 01:13:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

901
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:13,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of this paper at this time?

902
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:16,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

903
01:13:17,845 --> 01:13:18,726
[SPEAKER_02]: please come up to the podium.

904
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

905
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:30,057
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Stephen Brodley from the law firm Heron Fox Schiff.

906
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:39,283
[SPEAKER_26]: And I submitted to each of the members a brief package, which merely has three elements.

907
01:13:39,343 --> 01:13:49,087
[SPEAKER_26]: It has the affidavit sort of of many members of the community who spoke after the last vote and were happy with that last vote.

908
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:51,988
[SPEAKER_26]: I also submitted a copy of the letter

909
01:13:52,553 --> 01:14:00,760
[SPEAKER_26]: that was provided to the city council by Jessica Wall before its prior hearing, which has a lot of the good details about the issues that have to be dealt with.

910
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:10,428
[SPEAKER_26]: And I submitted some pictures that were taken, mostly along Woodruff, showing the condition of the fence and the ground in that area as of last month.

911
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:18,815
[SPEAKER_26]: The city council here is sort of the last resort for the community.

912
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:28,235
[SPEAKER_26]: They can go to the Conservation Commission and the other folks and satisfy the statutory and regulatory requirements.

913
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:34,336
[SPEAKER_26]: And they can come back here and provide you with more pictures and more details.

914
01:14:35,956 --> 01:14:42,477
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'd like you really to think about what's changed since they were here in April, two years ago.

915
01:14:43,298 --> 01:14:45,098
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think the answer is not much.

916
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:50,589
[SPEAKER_26]: I heard one Councilor say, the issue here is rebuilding trust.

917
01:14:52,330 --> 01:15:07,273
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would say to you, that in the 20 months since they were here the last time, they've hired some folks to make more pictures, they've made a longer list of promises, but it's like the song, promises, promises.

918
01:15:07,994 --> 01:15:13,135
[SPEAKER_26]: They have not gone, to my knowledge, and done anything that you could go out to the site

919
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:17,583
[SPEAKER_26]: and C was evidence, physical evidence of their good faith.

920
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,044
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all down the road.

921
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,525
[SPEAKER_26]: It's all if you give us what we want.

922
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:29,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Not that we have a duty that already exists to be a good neighbor to this community, but if you give us something else, then we'll do something else.

923
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:42,852
[SPEAKER_26]: They should be showing what it is that they can do and what they're able to do so that the people in the community can say, well, maybe there is some trust we can give these folks.

924
01:15:43,866 --> 01:15:45,086
[SPEAKER_26]: So far, it's just talk.

925
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:49,888
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just talk, and it has details, and you got a number, half a million dollars, maybe.

926
01:15:50,368 --> 01:15:50,708
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe.

927
01:15:51,408 --> 01:15:51,708
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe.

928
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:52,569
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows?

929
01:15:53,089 --> 01:15:53,729
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't know.

930
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:58,130
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't get pushed to go do anything between the last time they were here and now.

931
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:01,972
[SPEAKER_26]: They went to the court and said, no, there's something wrong.

932
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:03,092
[SPEAKER_26]: They were irregular.

933
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:03,932
[SPEAKER_26]: They did this wrong.

934
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:04,752
[SPEAKER_26]: They did that wrong.

935
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:05,613
[SPEAKER_26]: They spoke in favor.

936
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:06,553
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't speak in favor.

937
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,383
[SPEAKER_26]: But what they didn't do was to go out and show good faith on the ground.

938
01:16:12,063 --> 01:16:14,525
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what you should be looking for.

939
01:16:14,785 --> 01:16:17,767
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's what I submit to you that you're not going to find.

940
01:16:18,527 --> 01:16:30,215
[SPEAKER_26]: And I don't need to go through all of the details that were analyzed and discussed in the earlier letter by Jessica Wall and that you all have heard before.

941
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:32,797
[SPEAKER_26]: All the details, the smoke.

942
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,915
[SPEAKER_26]: the smell, the this, the broken fence.

943
01:16:36,115 --> 01:16:37,838
[SPEAKER_26]: They're all there and they're still there.

944
01:16:37,878 --> 01:16:38,960
[SPEAKER_26]: The history is still there.

945
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,250
[SPEAKER_26]: If this was a flagship store, 38 and a half years later, doesn't look like a flagship store.

946
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,211
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't.

947
01:16:47,307 --> 01:16:49,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And they can say, we really honor this place.

948
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:54,513
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a special plaque in our home office about this store.

949
01:16:55,154 --> 01:16:58,537
[SPEAKER_26]: But when you go out and look at this store, you're not seeing the flagship.

950
01:16:58,837 --> 01:16:59,537
[SPEAKER_26]: You're just not.

951
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:03,501
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that you have to decide now.

952
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:12,128
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to decide what happened in the last 20 months to make at least five people in this room

953
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:13,448
[SPEAKER_26]: say, you know what?

954
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:15,049
[SPEAKER_26]: We made the right decision.

955
01:17:15,549 --> 01:17:16,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Or we didn't make the right decision.

956
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:25,595
[SPEAKER_26]: If there's something there that you can seize on, that you think shows that good faith and shows something different, okay.

957
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:35,900
[SPEAKER_26]: But I would suggest that I'm sitting in the back and I haven't heard anything but more explanations, more details, and a few more pictures.

958
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,201
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just don't think that does it.

959
01:17:38,978 --> 01:17:43,851
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, it's your decision, but you are the last resort for members of your community.

960
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:50,523
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't live in the community, and there may be one or two folks here who do, who would like to speak as well.

961
01:17:50,844 --> 01:17:52,024
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want to take their time.

962
01:17:52,705 --> 01:18:04,693
[SPEAKER_26]: My material has been submitted to you in writing, and I've tried to highlight it in these few minutes, just why I think that this is something that you can't just say, well, we kind of got all buddy-buddy in this conversation here.

963
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:07,635
[SPEAKER_26]: You're going to promise this, you promise this, make a nice list of the promises.

964
01:18:08,756 --> 01:18:11,918
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'll give you the name of somebody that you can call when there's a problem.

965
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:14,300
[SPEAKER_26]: Why didn't that happen before?

966
01:18:15,442 --> 01:18:16,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Why wasn't that out there?

967
01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:21,784
[SPEAKER_26]: So they could come in and say, here's what we've shown you now.

968
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:23,484
[SPEAKER_26]: We've accomplished something.

969
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:26,045
[SPEAKER_26]: You should believe us that we'll do more.

970
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:32,886
[SPEAKER_26]: They should go first with the action and then look to see if the city wants to give them something else.

971
01:18:33,406 --> 01:18:35,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Instead, it's no, no, no, we'll wait.

972
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:44,529
[SPEAKER_26]: And you heard in the last hearing, well, five of you heard in the last hearing, somebody was asked and said, well, if you don't get this storage permit,

973
01:18:45,358 --> 01:18:47,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Are you gonna do those things with the trees and the fence?

974
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,961
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, that's part of the plan.

975
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:53,583
[SPEAKER_26]: That's part of the plan if we get what we want.

976
01:18:54,304 --> 01:18:58,306
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not something we feel we have a duty to do unless you give us something first.

977
01:18:59,187 --> 01:19:02,069
[SPEAKER_26]: And I would suggest to you, they haven't done their job.

978
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:03,790
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

979
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

980
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

981
01:19:09,293 --> 01:19:10,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come up to the podium.

982
01:19:17,134 --> 01:19:18,295
[SPEAKER_02]: just name and address for the record, please.

983
01:19:18,315 --> 01:19:21,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt Woods, Fabry Avenue, with an interest on Woodruff Avenue.

984
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:25,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually have a family home on Woodruff Avenue as well, and I have since 1986.

985
01:19:25,659 --> 01:19:32,843
[SPEAKER_18]: I grew up in Wellington on 4th Street, been going down to BJ's before it was BJ's.

986
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,745
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a brickyard, so I'm familiar with it from its inception until today.

987
01:19:37,746 --> 01:19:40,447
[SPEAKER_18]: I just noticed today, so I'm gonna hop around a little bit.

988
01:19:40,888 --> 01:19:44,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that the city had an agreement with BJ's when they first came in,

989
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:54,452
[SPEAKER_18]: and you all might have this in the paperwork somewhere locked away, but they have two gates on each side of BJ's, and they have since the beginning.

990
01:19:54,752 --> 01:20:11,936
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe the city had an agreement with BJ's that those gates would each be locked in the evening time, which would do away with the racing cars, which would do away with the trucks idling, which would do away with the street cleaning in the middle of the night, which would do away from the 2 a.m., 3 a.m.

991
01:20:11,956 --> 01:20:13,917
[SPEAKER_18]: snow removal that they do.

992
01:20:14,545 --> 01:20:16,386
[SPEAKER_18]: on a regular basis at the wintertime.

993
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:35,281
[SPEAKER_18]: But those gates are locked, and the reason why they unlocked them, my understanding is, is that the semi-trailers would start to back up, start to honk the horn, start to waiting on the streets, so they couldn't get into the BJs in order to either drop off goods during business hours or just before business hours.

994
01:20:35,862 --> 01:20:38,224
[SPEAKER_18]: But I believe that that was the original agreement with the city.

995
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:44,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, another question I had wasn't addressed.

996
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:45,666
[SPEAKER_18]: If it was, maybe I missed it.

997
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:52,970
[SPEAKER_18]: But there's a stream that runs along the side of BJ's, along the railroad tracks, where the gas station is proposed.

998
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:57,392
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure if the EPA has been notified, if they've looked into whether or not any kind of runoff.

999
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:01,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's a self-contained system, as stated by the attorneys earlier.

1000
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:07,817
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's also been stated that it's going to be self-serve.

1001
01:21:07,937 --> 01:21:09,318
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to pump your own gas.

1002
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:11,484
[SPEAKER_18]: And with that, you're going to have human effort.

1003
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:13,526
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have patrons spilling gas.

1004
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:14,426
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have the odors.

1005
01:21:14,446 --> 01:21:17,088
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have, you know, shortly contained.

1006
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:24,614
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure what the process is that they'll have in place in order to contain that down in the future, but that's something to consider as well.

1007
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:32,400
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as the trees along Winter Fountain is concerned, this has been happening over a long period of time, years.

1008
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,663
[SPEAKER_18]: My belief is that it's not due to the

1009
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:41,972
[SPEAKER_18]: recent activity or the digging up of the pipes along Woodruff Avenue.

1010
01:21:42,072 --> 01:21:56,325
[SPEAKER_18]: My belief is that it's because of the plows in the wintertime that removes the snow off BJ's and pushes it up against the fence, which separates the fence where you see all the trash come onto Woodruff Avenue and up Bradbury Avenue.

1011
01:21:56,365 --> 01:22:04,752
[SPEAKER_18]: It loosens all the metal that's attached to the fence to the poles every year once winter comes around.

1012
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:13,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's blown under the fence because of the snow that's packed up against it from the parking lot.

1013
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:32,612
[SPEAKER_18]: My belief is that not only is the snow, but of course, whatever's on the ground, the chemicals that are on the ground from the snow removal, whether it be the salt or whatever else they use to melt the snow on the premises, is getting dumped into the soil along Woodruff Avenue, which has killed the plants.

1014
01:22:33,312 --> 01:22:36,793
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it would be in the city's best interest to get a soil sample.

1015
01:22:37,393 --> 01:22:45,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Prior to planting any new vegetation, we will get a one-year or a five-year guarantee on those plants.

1016
01:22:45,474 --> 01:22:59,036
[SPEAKER_18]: And then once the soil that they, the ball of the soil that they put into the ground, once that starts to get more solid from the surrounding infected, what I believe to be infected soil, they'll start to die off.

1017
01:22:59,116 --> 01:23:01,677
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it will be the same problem over and over again.

1018
01:23:04,992 --> 01:23:07,512
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said, the fence is a constant problem.

1019
01:23:07,552 --> 01:23:08,413
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always been that way.

1020
01:23:08,473 --> 01:23:11,194
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's always been a chintzy fence.

1021
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:14,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1022
01:23:17,616 --> 01:23:22,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone mentioned earlier the running trucks or the idling vehicles back there.

1023
01:23:23,257 --> 01:23:23,698
[SPEAKER_18]: It's true.

1024
01:23:23,738 --> 01:23:24,678
[SPEAKER_18]: That constantly happens.

1025
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:29,780
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Massachusetts actually has a law that you can only idle for five minutes or something along those lines.

1026
01:23:32,837 --> 01:23:37,962
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, the snow removal, I mean, I've lived there for years.

1027
01:23:38,703 --> 01:23:40,204
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll do it 2 o'clock in the morning.

1028
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:44,628
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not sure that, you know, BJs may or may not be aware of it.

1029
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:46,891
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure they hire contractors.

1030
01:23:46,951 --> 01:23:49,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Contractors show up when it's convenient for them.

1031
01:23:51,012 --> 01:23:53,914
[SPEAKER_18]: the gates unlocked, they can come in and out all the time.

1032
01:23:54,335 --> 01:24:02,761
[SPEAKER_18]: But I would ask the city to go back and take a look at whether or not that agreement's in place, that they were supposed to maintain those locked gates.

1033
01:24:03,602 --> 01:24:06,284
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it's there, it may be reinstituted.

1034
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:07,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1035
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:07,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1036
01:24:07,825 --> 01:24:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us tonight?

1037
01:24:16,772 --> 01:24:18,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone on Zoom or anyone in person?

1038
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1039
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:30,418
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Mario Cedrano.

1040
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:32,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on 34 Woodruff Ave.

1041
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:37,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in this section of Wellington approximately since the late 60s.

1042
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:42,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And BJ is definitely not a good neighbor to us.

1043
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:53,591
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can't stay at your comfort of your home and watch TV with all these spotlights they have in a parking lot, it's a problem for neighbors.

1044
01:24:54,635 --> 01:25:04,099
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm concerned about the 64,000 gallon capacity of gasoline next to next to Woodrow Favre, it's a no-no.

1045
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:13,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go back a little further where Beecher's location was owned by Prost and Creep which used to produce blocks at the location.

1046
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:18,006
[SPEAKER_01]: The Creep brothers went out for a permit to install

1047
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:26,569
[SPEAKER_01]: 2500 gallon rich oil tank above ground, and it was rejected.

1048
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:40,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally, as a contractor, was hired to build a vault around this tank, a 5000 gallon capacity, so in case there was a spill, we're going to be able to maintain the oil at that location.

1049
01:25:41,394 --> 01:25:42,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was rejected.

1050
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:44,255
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

1051
01:25:45,825 --> 01:25:49,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the county should think about this.

1052
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:57,789
[SPEAKER_01]: A 64,000 gallon capacity for that location is definitely a no-no.

1053
01:25:57,829 --> 01:25:59,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm against it 100%.

1054
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:00,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1055
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1056
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:07,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of this paper?

1057
01:26:07,373 --> 01:26:10,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Either in person or on Zoom?

1058
01:26:13,466 --> 01:26:14,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing any hands on zoom.

1059
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:15,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else would like to speak in opposition?

1060
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:23,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing no one else close this portion of the hearing.

1061
01:26:25,754 --> 01:26:27,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now up for deliberation for the council.

1062
01:26:27,995 --> 01:26:29,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a motion?

1063
01:26:29,956 --> 01:26:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Any additional questions at this time or discussion?

1064
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:45,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do also want, for just procedural, we are required to have a response to the court by February 17th.

1065
01:26:46,503 --> 01:26:54,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also just a reminder that any commitments agreed to by BJs would be enforceable as a condition of the permit.

1066
01:26:54,947 --> 01:27:01,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand the concerns around it being talked, but these would be conditions that would be enforceable for the permit itself.

1067
01:27:03,443 --> 01:27:17,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Madam President, if I may, by way of the rules, isn't there a seven-day waiting period, six-day waiting period to allow for comments from individuals that may not have participated in the public hearing but wanted to exercise their opinion in writing?

1068
01:27:17,788 --> 01:27:27,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for those who couldn't hear Councilor Knight, the Council has rules that there's a six-day waiting period to allow folks to submit comments who may not have been able to attend tonight or share comments in advance.

1069
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:29,852
[SPEAKER_20]: If I can, I think that the

1070
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:48,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Council for the neighbors makes a point that I think that we addressed with the representative of BJ's that holds the restrictions to the permits that we have that meeting once a year to make sure that we follow through with these these these concerns in the neighbors.

1071
01:27:49,403 --> 01:27:54,086
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I think that the representative for BJ's weren't there in 1986, I would take.

1072
01:27:55,366 --> 01:28:00,849
[SPEAKER_20]: But you would also understand the neighbors that see what they're living in right now.

1073
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:09,114
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what they were living in before the permit request came before us about building this gas station.

1074
01:28:09,194 --> 01:28:11,255
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can understand the frustration.

1075
01:28:11,275 --> 01:28:12,115
[SPEAKER_20]: I think all of you can.

1076
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:16,378
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that it would be disingenuine

1077
01:28:17,018 --> 01:28:39,934
[SPEAKER_20]: that if it's not followed through, and I hope you meant your word, and we have the restrictions in place to make sure that if we follow through and vote in favor of this tonight, that our neighbors will have a voice from here on out, and that area, their neighborhood, will be represented by someone from BJ's on a phone call basis, so I appreciate that.

1078
01:28:40,873 --> 01:28:41,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam President.

1079
01:28:41,653 --> 01:29:00,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to clarify that with the neighbors, some that are very close to me, that I grew up with, that had the same concerns or proud of us at the same time that we voted no, then understanding the process that we went through that evening that caused this to go to a legal format and this be heard in front of a judge.

1080
01:29:01,645 --> 01:29:05,487
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's important that people realize

1081
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:15,356
[SPEAKER_20]: The biggest issue for this council was not having legal representation in that room that evening that brought us to this point.

1082
01:29:15,936 --> 01:29:24,202
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that it's important that we still hold the administration accountable for this process.

1083
01:29:26,543 --> 01:29:28,065
[SPEAKER_20]: We do not claim to be attorneys.

1084
01:29:28,645 --> 01:29:35,570
[SPEAKER_20]: We do not claim to have all of our rules and regulations memorized on the tip of our tongues, but at the same time,

1085
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:42,002
[SPEAKER_20]: we didn't have support that we needed to make this council work for the people that we should have.

1086
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:50,165
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want people in the public to realize that, especially our neighbors that live in the Wellington area.

1087
01:29:50,485 --> 01:30:00,029
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something I regret and wish we could turn the clock back and have the city solicitor that we asked for for years in that room to support us.

1088
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:01,510
[SPEAKER_20]: So again,

1089
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:15,477
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that does handcuff us in a sense, but at the same time, it also brought us to what I feel is a pretty reasonable and committed relationship with our partners at BJ.

1090
01:30:15,497 --> 01:30:16,998
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, Madam President.

1091
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1092
01:30:19,219 --> 01:30:21,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight, the Vice Chair.

1093
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1094
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:25,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think it's very important to point out what exactly

1095
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:28,842
[SPEAKER_09]: It is that we're being asked to vote on.

1096
01:30:29,782 --> 01:30:36,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, we're being asked to vote on a permit for an underground storage tank.

1097
01:30:38,047 --> 01:30:40,509
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a special permit that's allowed by right.

1098
01:30:42,309 --> 01:30:44,790
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it's allowed by right, but requires a special permit for use.

1099
01:30:46,551 --> 01:31:02,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about this proposal and the fact that it's been vetted and revetted, you know, both locally and legally, ultimately this matter wasn't remanded back to the city council for a public hearing because our rationale was on strong legal footing.

1100
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:08,320
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the applicant also recognizes that the history

1101
01:31:09,495 --> 01:31:15,939
[SPEAKER_09]: between the city, the neighborhood, and the applicant's business hasn't been great.

1102
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:30,249
[SPEAKER_09]: But they've put a foot forward and made an effort both, I'd say, financially and physically to improve some of the quality of life issues in our community.

1103
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:33,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a positive sign.

1104
01:31:33,731 --> 01:31:36,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a step in the right direction because ultimately,

1105
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:43,636
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look backwards at everything that's gone wrong, then we're never going to be able to make progress.

1106
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:56,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's pretty clear that when we did that during the initial public hearing, it wasn't the rational basis for a denial or the paper wouldn't have been sent back to us for this proceeding this evening.

1107
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:07,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd certainly like to hear additional feedback from the neighborhood, from the residents during the six day waiting period before I make a commitment as to which way I'm going to vote.

1108
01:32:08,431 --> 01:32:26,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to recognize the efforts that the applicant has put forward in trying to rebuild this relationship and also investing in our community and addressing some of the things that are important to us that will mitigate and offset some of the impacts of the gas station should this underground storage permit be authorized.

1109
01:32:26,796 --> 01:32:27,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1110
01:32:27,456 --> 01:32:30,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So would that be a motion to leave the hearing open until our next regular meeting?

1111
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,439
[SPEAKER_09]: It's practice anyway, I believe, right?

1112
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:34,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1113
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,261
[SPEAKER_09]: By rule rather, so yes, I would not make a motion to waive it.

1114
01:32:37,661 --> 01:32:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1115
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:39,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Colle.

1116
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:50,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just want to confirm, so Attorney Austin, would that, if we were to leave the public hearing open as is our practice, our next regular meeting being on January 31st,

1117
01:32:52,365 --> 01:32:57,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that fit within the timeline when we need to get an answer back to the courts?

1118
01:32:58,930 --> 01:32:59,971
[SPEAKER_25]: That would.

1119
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:05,736
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd need to provide a status update by February 17th, 2023, Madam President.

1120
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:07,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1121
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:10,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Collins.

1122
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:18,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Rowe, and I appreciate everybody who spoke tonight from the

1123
01:33:19,716 --> 01:33:28,161
[SPEAKER_22]: the web of BJ's related individuals and constituents and those representing the constituents local to this site as well.

1124
01:33:30,362 --> 01:33:35,485
[SPEAKER_22]: I think my fellow Councilors who have kind of spoken and in summation, I think they've put it well.

1125
01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:37,946
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been a pretty long road.

1126
01:33:38,006 --> 01:33:40,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of this happened before I took office last year.

1127
01:33:40,808 --> 01:33:48,552
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, I just wanna acknowledge the community of neighbors that have lived through the nuisances created by BJ's sometimes for decades.

1128
01:33:49,780 --> 01:34:00,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure that if I don't I don't live in the Wellington neighborhood I live in South Medford but I'm sure if I was one of those neighbors I would also have the, I'll believe it when I see it kind of attitude that we're hearing I think that's really understandable I think that's really justified.

1129
01:34:02,748 --> 01:34:10,291
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is, I think the context is helpful here, the legal context and the very kind of strict parameters that we ultimately have to operate within.

1130
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:18,233
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think this situation where we are trying to do the least harm overall and end up with the best outcome possible.

1131
01:34:18,253 --> 01:34:19,934
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, that's very constrained.

1132
01:34:22,855 --> 01:34:23,395
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that

1133
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:36,035
[SPEAKER_22]: We've gotten to a place where this special permit application is now attached to a whole slate of mitigating and improving conditions that is broadened, even from what was looked at two years ago.

1134
01:34:38,716 --> 01:34:39,476
[SPEAKER_22]: It's my hope that

1135
01:34:40,345 --> 01:34:52,128
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, this process, while unfortunate, you know, it's the type of thing, as Councilor Scarpelli said, I wish that we never had to go through this version of this special permit review process in the first place.

1136
01:34:53,108 --> 01:34:59,690
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's my hope that we've been able to use this to negotiate the best possible terms under which this gas station might come in.

1137
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:08,352
[SPEAKER_22]: And I appreciate that investment, that renewed and increased investment that has been proposed for all the work done to create that and for all the work ahead.

1138
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:13,012
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and, um, you know, it's to the constituents.

1139
01:35:13,052 --> 01:35:23,219
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I want all the residents of this neighborhood to know that if this goes forward, you know, of course, we'll be holding BJ's accountable to its promises to be a good neighbor going forward.

1140
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:24,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1141
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:26,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1142
01:35:27,187 --> 01:35:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

1143
01:35:28,648 --> 01:35:32,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I did grow up in the Wellington neighborhood, and I still spend a lot of time there with family.

1144
01:35:34,452 --> 01:35:39,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And I truly do understand and feel the frustrations from the neighbors.

1145
01:35:40,495 --> 01:35:42,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember the vote back

1146
01:35:43,257 --> 01:35:50,165
[SPEAKER_04]: When the initial vote that so many residents supported, and I remember that I supported that vote as well.

1147
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:57,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, unfortunately, the legal context, and the, the practical context is necessary in this case.

1148
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:07,254
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Councilor Scarpelli's right to bring up the more systemic failure of not having a legal representation at the meeting.

1149
01:36:08,855 --> 01:36:12,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately that has hamstrung us in our current position.

1150
01:36:13,577 --> 01:36:14,837
[SPEAKER_04]: When I look at the,

1151
01:36:17,878 --> 01:36:26,006
[SPEAKER_04]: the situation in front of us, I do think it is important to note that BJ's has come to the table.

1152
01:36:27,347 --> 01:36:39,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We have started to establish a more consistent form of communication that I hope is the groundwork for a new relationship with BJ's in our community.

1153
01:36:42,688 --> 01:36:45,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I do appreciate the BJ's rep being available to us.

1154
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:50,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the deal that we have in front of us.

1155
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:59,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a different deal than what was before the council back when the council was first looking at this permit.

1156
01:37:02,435 --> 01:37:10,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I appreciate all the feedback that we have heard from residents.

1157
01:37:10,685 --> 01:37:17,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll continue to appreciate the feedback that we'll get in the next seven days, but I just wanted to...

1158
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:34,833
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, express my sympathy and my understanding, you know, as someone who's lived in that neighborhood for a while, for most of my life, and who still goes to that neighborhood quite a lot, I understand the frustration, but we can't divorce it from the context as well.

1159
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1160
01:37:39,274 --> 01:37:39,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice-Chair Bears.

1161
01:37:40,414 --> 01:37:41,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1162
01:37:41,354 --> 01:37:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to my fellow councilors.

1163
01:37:42,974 --> 01:37:44,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to everyone who's spoken tonight.

1164
01:37:46,955 --> 01:37:47,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,

1165
01:37:47,967 --> 01:37:53,510
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever it was, 20 months ago, I was the one who said, I don't think we should ever build a gas station in Medford again.

1166
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I still believe that.

1167
01:37:57,572 --> 01:38:04,476
[SPEAKER_07]: However, although it wasn't cited in the case, I don't believe that statement.

1168
01:38:04,496 --> 01:38:12,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I have learned a lot about what our authority and power is, not just from this case, but from other cases.

1169
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:22,492
[SPEAKER_07]: what are rationales that we are able to use or not able to use to accept or deny special permits and licenses of this manner.

1170
01:38:24,033 --> 01:38:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And while I would like to see potentially changes to state law, or I don't even know if it's doable by local ordinance or not, to say that

1171
01:38:35,413 --> 01:38:42,183
[SPEAKER_07]: The transition that we're making away from fossil fuel use and cars is a valid reason that you know we should not build more gas stations in the city.

1172
01:38:42,203 --> 01:38:46,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not my understanding from the council that we've received.

1173
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:54,722
[SPEAKER_07]: a reason to deny a business a license or a permit for something that is allowed by our zoning code.

1174
01:38:55,843 --> 01:39:13,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Given that statement, you know, I'm at this point tend to agree with my fellow Councilors about which way this is leaning, given that we are going to keep the public hearing open through our January 31st meeting to allow for a six day public comment period, I would also further move, and the clerk's gone.

1175
01:39:17,502 --> 01:39:18,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a charger.

1176
01:39:18,222 --> 01:39:20,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if I can vamp long enough.

1177
01:39:20,063 --> 01:39:22,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know you were gonna make a motion, so.

1178
01:39:22,985 --> 01:39:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna make a motion.

1179
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:24,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1180
01:39:24,986 --> 01:39:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You sit tight for a moment.

1181
01:39:26,266 --> 01:39:26,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I can sit tight.

1182
01:39:27,147 --> 01:39:28,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there someone else who wants to say something else?

1183
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I mean, it's, yeah.

1184
01:39:34,271 --> 01:39:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent him away because my phone's dying, so that's fully on me.

1185
01:39:39,594 --> 01:39:42,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he already went downstairs to get me one.

1186
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:43,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

1187
01:39:43,923 --> 01:39:58,427
[SPEAKER_02]: going to I mean, I mean, I could also if there's any other councils of which to speak at this time, I think I also will ask for clarity on the motions, but I will wait till the clerk returns.

1188
01:39:59,007 --> 01:40:02,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to affirm what many councils have said.

1189
01:40:02,328 --> 01:40:08,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with vices and bears that I don't think we should add another fossil fuel station, another gas station in the city, period.

1190
01:40:09,247 --> 01:40:12,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that is not the power we have right now.

1191
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:19,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very much understand the, and I should say not the power we have, but I mean for the power for that to uphold in core.

1192
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:25,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very much understand what the letter from the neighbors noted that the state's climate action plan.

1193
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:36,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the state puts these things on cities and then doesn't give us the power to enact things that would be powerful movement towards moving away from fossil fuel.

1194
01:40:37,559 --> 01:40:42,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, in this position as Councilors, sometimes we have to make the least bad decision.

1195
01:40:45,082 --> 01:40:46,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't want to permit this.

1196
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:59,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we have been basically told by the courts that we get this or we go back to court and we don't address any of the issues that residents have before us, that neighbors have before us that are very valid issues.

1197
01:40:59,466 --> 01:41:04,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I see before us is an opportunity, not the way I would like to address some of those issues.

1198
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:11,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, I want to make sure that I support the Councilors motions to keep this open here.

1199
01:41:11,087 --> 01:41:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Additional public comment on this.

1200
01:41:12,848 --> 01:41:17,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as we do still have a little bit of time, be able to hear additional public comment on this.

1201
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'll wait for the clerk to return.

1202
01:41:21,073 --> 01:41:23,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyone else to speak?

1203
01:41:29,031 --> 01:41:32,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I made up.

1204
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to trying to guess based on how how verbose you guys are and I guess wrong.

1205
01:41:38,006 --> 01:41:39,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you, Madam President.

1206
01:41:39,307 --> 01:41:42,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured since you were talking, I figured there was time.

1207
01:41:43,068 --> 01:41:44,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expected to speak.

1208
01:41:45,269 --> 01:41:46,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll do so then.

1209
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:47,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he back?

1210
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:48,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's back.

1211
01:41:48,711 --> 01:41:49,731
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I only have 10 seconds.

1212
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:58,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to further just indicate that the intent here is to make sure that whatever conditions are applied to this permit are not just enforceable, but enforced.

1213
01:41:59,356 --> 01:42:04,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of building trust and building a strong and accountable relationship is going to be holding us accountable to the agreement we make.

1214
01:42:05,098 --> 01:42:06,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make that very clear.

1215
01:42:06,945 --> 01:42:07,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1216
01:42:07,205 --> 01:42:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to build off that point, I think part of the reason, again, this extended public comment period, this is a different project, but I think the council permitted a large project in a similar area, in the area in the same neighborhood.

1217
01:42:20,089 --> 01:42:28,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some issues that have come up with it that I think if we had foreseen those issues, we absolutely would have put conditions on it so that we can do the best for our neighbors, for the abutters.

1218
01:42:28,951 --> 01:42:31,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a really important process or the process we have.

1219
01:42:32,882 --> 01:42:34,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears is about to make a motion.

1220
01:42:34,603 --> 01:42:35,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1221
01:42:36,103 --> 01:42:37,084
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're ready, Mr. Clerk.

1222
01:42:38,584 --> 01:42:38,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1223
01:42:39,044 --> 01:42:48,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a motion that the city council president, the city clerk and legal counsel assigned to the city council by the administration.

1224
01:42:49,808 --> 01:43:01,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Compile the list of conditions, uh, that I think have been discussed tonight into a single document that that be shared with all parties involved prior to the 1 31 meeting.

1225
01:43:02,773 --> 01:43:06,454
[SPEAKER_07]: or prior to the continuation of the public hearing on January 31st.

1226
01:43:07,134 --> 01:43:07,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1227
01:43:07,454 --> 01:43:15,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also seek a motion just explicitly continuing the hearing, keeping the hearing open 31st.

1228
01:43:15,216 --> 01:43:19,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll move to keep the public hearing open to our January 31st regular meeting.

1229
01:43:19,196 --> 01:43:21,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1230
01:43:22,717 --> 01:43:24,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Attorney Austin, would that satisfy?

1231
01:43:24,937 --> 01:43:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what's in front of us tonight?

1232
01:43:30,675 --> 01:43:31,635
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

1233
01:43:31,835 --> 01:43:50,862
[SPEAKER_25]: In my opinion, it would and I can certainly work not only with council for BJ's but also based on my notes from this evening and to compile a list of conditions based on what represent representatives from BJ's had agreed upon as proposed conditions for the council's next meeting.

1234
01:43:52,382 --> 01:43:54,303
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could also add to that, or.

1235
01:43:55,482 --> 01:44:11,150
[SPEAKER_07]: just an understanding that there's some conditions that were discussed tonight that are kind of had never been discussed before, like the speed bumps and not maintenance, but the maintaining preservation.

1236
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:11,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1237
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:13,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could include those in that list as well.

1238
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:14,511
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course.

1239
01:44:14,651 --> 01:44:21,515
[SPEAKER_25]: And just for, would the council like me to just confirm that or confirm what I have in my notes?

1240
01:44:23,325 --> 01:44:26,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if you could, to make sure we don't have anything missed from what was brought up.

1241
01:44:26,968 --> 01:44:28,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, sorry.

1242
01:44:28,189 --> 01:44:30,451
[SPEAKER_25]: Just for clarification for all those present.

1243
01:44:30,551 --> 01:44:31,571
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

1244
01:44:31,752 --> 01:44:44,502
[SPEAKER_25]: I have, in addition to the items that were set forth in the correspondence from BJ's council to myself dated January 13th, 2023, which I understand is before the council this evening.

1245
01:44:44,982 --> 01:44:49,205
[SPEAKER_25]: In addition to those proposed conditions, I have removable speed bumps.

1246
01:44:49,906 --> 01:44:52,588
[SPEAKER_25]: I have that landscaping would be conducted along

1247
01:44:53,059 --> 01:44:55,881
[SPEAKER_25]: Woodroof Avenue in the first phase of the project.

1248
01:44:56,561 --> 01:45:09,828
[SPEAKER_25]: I have that there would be a commitment by BGs to maintain the screening, not a landscaping maintenance plan, but to replace any screening or any dead trees along that fencing area.

1249
01:45:10,808 --> 01:45:21,814
[SPEAKER_25]: I have that the annual report deadline as itemized in the January 13th, 2023 correspondence, that the date for submission of that would be by January 31st,

1250
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:23,915
[SPEAKER_25]: each year.

1251
01:45:24,816 --> 01:45:28,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that was all I had in my notes, unless the council has anything further.

1252
01:45:28,137 --> 01:45:38,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds comprehensive to me, Madam President, just that it be the screening that's in the public right-of-way would be replaced if it dies for that one.

1253
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's because they have the maintenance of what's on their property, and then they also agreed to something around the public right-of-way as well, that the screening, if things die, would be replaced.

1254
01:45:49,884 --> 01:45:50,284
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1255
01:45:51,582 --> 01:45:54,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, and I appreciate that super comprehensive.

1256
01:45:54,044 --> 01:45:54,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, council.

1257
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion at this time?

1258
01:45:57,306 --> 01:46:00,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take the motion to continue first since the other motion is predicated on that.

1259
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears to keep the hearing open until our next regular meeting date on January 31st, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1260
01:46:11,057 --> 01:46:12,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, do you need a roll call for that?

1261
01:46:12,218 --> 01:46:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll take a roll call.

1262
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,192
[SPEAKER_15]: and when you're ready.

1263
01:46:32,232 --> 01:46:32,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1264
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:32,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1265
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:33,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1266
01:46:33,893 --> 01:46:34,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1267
01:46:34,814 --> 01:46:35,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1268
01:46:35,074 --> 01:46:35,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1269
01:46:35,474 --> 01:46:35,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1270
01:46:36,695 --> 01:46:43,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the infirmary is during the night of the motion passes.

1271
01:46:44,501 --> 01:46:51,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a second motion from vice president bears to compile all the conditions as presented by BJ's the council tonight.

1272
01:46:51,986 --> 01:46:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And does that cover it and disseminate to the council?

1273
01:46:56,722 --> 01:46:57,423
[SPEAKER_16]: To all parties.

1274
01:46:57,483 --> 01:46:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: To all parties involved.

1275
01:46:58,984 --> 01:47:00,365
[SPEAKER_16]: As long as council says that's okay.

1276
01:47:02,947 --> 01:47:03,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair, she's nodding, great.

1277
01:47:05,329 --> 01:47:05,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1278
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:06,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1279
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of vices and bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1280
01:47:11,013 --> 01:47:11,754
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1281
01:47:11,774 --> 01:47:12,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1282
01:47:12,774 --> 01:47:13,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1283
01:47:14,396 --> 01:47:15,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1284
01:47:17,838 --> 01:47:18,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

1285
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:20,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see you back on the 31st.

1286
01:47:21,927 --> 01:47:22,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1287
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good evening.

1288
01:47:23,974 --> 01:47:24,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1289
01:47:24,637 --> 01:47:25,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all very much for your time.

1290
01:47:25,841 --> 01:47:26,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Really appreciate it.

1291
01:47:26,784 --> 01:47:27,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1292
01:47:37,502 --> 01:48:02,702

1300
01:48:47,203 --> 01:48:50,185
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Medford is an EEOAA 504 employer.

1301
01:48:50,286 --> 01:48:57,852
[SPEAKER_02]: By order of the city council, signed Adam Herbies, city clerk, advertised in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal on June 30th and July 7th.

1302
01:49:00,462 --> 01:49:18,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I we do have the petitioner on the line, unless Council has Councilors have any questions first we can hear a brief summary of the people before us from the petitioner going to Madam President, if I may, I do believe that this paper was tabled but not for any other reason but because the fact that I'm Starbucks was involved in quite a very

1303
01:49:19,927 --> 01:49:23,810
[SPEAKER_09]: well-publicized labor dispute with its employee organization.

1304
01:49:24,490 --> 01:49:34,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason that this paper was tabled was because we wanted to allow Starbucks the opportunity to right the wrongs that have been going on with their anti-union campaign.

1305
01:49:35,658 --> 01:49:40,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's my understanding that this anti-union campaign still prevails.

1306
01:49:41,302 --> 01:49:46,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm certainly not opposed to giving this ample consideration, but I'm not going to give a consideration

1307
01:49:46,974 --> 01:49:53,299
[SPEAKER_09]: at a point in time where the workers feel as though they're being mistreated, and they feel as though their ability to organize is being impeded.

1308
01:49:53,999 --> 01:50:01,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, this is certainly something that I have an open mind to, but right now I don't feel as though the temperature is right for this council to make a vote on this.

1309
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:06,409
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask the applicant to withdraw or refile when the labor situation gets resolved.

1310
01:50:07,209 --> 01:50:07,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1311
01:50:09,231 --> 01:50:10,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the council?

1312
01:50:11,292 --> 01:50:11,893
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd support that.

1313
01:50:13,498 --> 01:50:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for some bears going to Daniel Brennan if you could just give us a brief summary of the petition before us.

1314
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:26,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, thank you Madam Chair, council members, my name is Daniel Brennan I handle permits and licenses for Starbucks.

1315
01:50:28,859 --> 01:50:38,665
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't sure on the specifics on what the objection was last time as far as not treating their employees properly.

1316
01:50:38,686 --> 01:50:53,816
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know that there has been many stores across the country that have been in negotiations and unionized to address specific store conditions that they want heard.

1317
01:50:54,636 --> 01:50:58,619
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe they take it on a case by case basis.

1318
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:19,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Individual stores are unionizing so their voices can be heard and I believe Starbucks has always worked with them and they are in negotiations on a consistent basis, but it is above what I typically deal with so I'm not sure if the council members

1319
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:36,666
[SPEAKER_12]: want to discuss or reconsider, but I've always known Starbucks to be a very good place to work for they provide good health benefits, continuing education benefits and I believe that

1320
01:51:38,867 --> 01:51:51,355
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that they are in these discussions with individual stores that are unionizing just goes to show that they are serious about treating their employees correctly.

1321
01:51:51,396 --> 01:52:01,903
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually call them partners because they do give their employees, they call partners, stock options, retirement plans,

1322
01:52:02,743 --> 01:52:14,095
[SPEAKER_12]: They do tend to go above and beyond what your typical corporate employer would do for a customer service establishment.

1323
01:52:14,235 --> 01:52:17,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all I can say on the matter.

1324
01:52:17,859 --> 01:52:20,502
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more than I know about.

1325
01:52:20,562 --> 01:52:21,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's

1326
01:52:21,752 --> 01:52:31,637
[SPEAKER_12]: been politicized and I believe last time it was mentioned, there was a strike over at one of our stores over in Brookline.

1327
01:52:32,257 --> 01:52:39,921
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, it's a continuing discussion with Starbucks partners and the corporation.

1328
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:45,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, that's really all I can say on the matter.

1329
01:52:45,724 --> 01:52:48,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know the full scope of it, but

1330
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:57,588
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, we're just trying to open up a couple hours earlier over at our new coffee shop.

1331
01:52:58,068 --> 01:53:02,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a small 1500 square foot store, no seats.

1332
01:53:03,091 --> 01:53:06,974
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't impact the public in an adverse way.

1333
01:53:07,674 --> 01:53:09,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Coffee's enjoyed in the early morning hours.

1334
01:53:10,636 --> 01:53:13,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be a good service to the community.

1335
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,201
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all I have.

1336
01:53:17,681 --> 01:53:17,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1337
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:22,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, any further discussion from the council at this time?

1338
01:53:26,117 --> 01:53:31,381
[SPEAKER_02]: As this is a public hearing, although the public hearing was already, the public hearing was left open for 90 days.

1339
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:50,455
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to close the public hearing and institute a six day waiting period until a vote is taken or take a vote and then have the six day waiting period

1340
01:53:59,100 --> 01:53:59,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Pearce.

1341
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we still have Attorney Austin?

1342
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:02,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't.

1343
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I can text her and see if she can come back because I do have, I have questions.

1344
01:54:11,826 --> 01:54:12,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1345
01:54:12,046 --> 01:54:27,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, I just think we're walking into this, like if we had, I can't, I can't remember his name, but we had the attorney who was here for when we were discussing FlexRide in public session, who basically said there was, you know, just cause you don't like the business model, you can't deny the special permit.

1346
01:54:28,138 --> 01:54:31,620
[SPEAKER_07]: for Lyft, you know, so I don't wanna get us in that situation here again.

1347
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:35,802
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be where my questions lie.

1348
01:54:35,882 --> 01:54:36,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so.

1349
01:54:37,002 --> 01:54:42,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, yeah, we can close the public hearing.

1350
01:54:44,206 --> 01:54:46,207
[SPEAKER_02]: The public hearing was left open for 90 days.

1351
01:54:46,227 --> 01:54:47,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion to close.

1352
01:54:49,168 --> 01:54:53,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna make a decision without council present.

1353
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:56,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm also, it's five to 7 a.m.

1354
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:02,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't want to vote for it.

1355
01:55:02,673 --> 01:55:03,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

1356
01:55:06,195 --> 01:55:06,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

1357
01:55:09,157 --> 01:55:12,240
[SPEAKER_22]: Partially an attempt to see if we can get Attorney Austin back on the line.

1358
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:14,221
[SPEAKER_22]: I have shared the same concerns.

1359
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:19,305
[SPEAKER_22]: She can't come back.

1360
01:55:20,586 --> 01:55:21,086
[SPEAKER_02]: She can't come back.

1361
01:55:28,234 --> 01:55:28,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, fair enough.

1362
01:55:28,854 --> 01:55:44,544
[SPEAKER_22]: In that case, I mean, questions I'd love to have answered by somebody with a JD is, it's my impression that this application to have special early, it's not similar to BJ's in that it's opening at 5 a.m.

1363
01:55:44,564 --> 01:55:45,445
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not allowed by right.

1364
01:55:47,266 --> 01:55:49,347
[SPEAKER_22]: That said, you know, I don't know.

1365
01:55:50,989 --> 01:55:51,849
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have a legal degree.

1366
01:55:53,820 --> 01:56:10,566
[SPEAKER_22]: In an ideal world, I would love for this council to be able to stand up for organized labor in Medford by saying, you know, why don't you follow through on those great rhetorical commitments to the value of your employees by collectively bargaining with them, and then we'll see if, you know, you can open your store.

1367
01:56:11,246 --> 01:56:14,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Earlier enough that, you know, for example, it's harder to get here in public transportation.

1368
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:20,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I think these are all conditions for why it's especially important to have an organized labor force in such an establishment.

1369
01:56:21,137 --> 01:56:24,439
[SPEAKER_22]: That being said, this is a quagmire.

1370
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,200
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we'd like to know that beforehand.

1371
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:34,644
[SPEAKER_22]: So something along the lines of if we have the time to table to our next regular meeting or to the waiting period, those are motions that I'd be in favor of.

1372
01:56:34,664 --> 01:56:41,588
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam President, can we just keep the hearing open for similar to the last one?

1373
01:56:42,128 --> 01:56:43,509
[SPEAKER_02]: We already kept it open for 90 days.

1374
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:43,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

1375
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:45,931
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't do any more than that, right?

1376
01:56:45,951 --> 01:56:46,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe so.

1377
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak to that.

1378
01:56:47,912 --> 01:56:50,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Given what Councilor Collins just said, which is a really, sorry.

1379
01:56:51,377 --> 01:56:55,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have, I have someone from Starbucks who has their hand up as well.

1380
01:57:00,429 --> 01:57:04,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamila Fines, if you'd like to speak, I just ask you to unmute and give an address for the record, please.

1381
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, hello, how are you?

1382
01:57:06,341 --> 01:57:08,463
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jamila Fines.

1383
01:57:09,244 --> 01:57:14,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in government affairs here at Starbucks and definitely honored to be here amongst everyone.

1384
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:21,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to note really quickly that some other reasons why we really wanted to extend the hours was because

1385
01:57:21,772 --> 01:57:25,674
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize that the Green Line is also up and running.

1386
01:57:25,714 --> 01:57:32,557
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we're able to service those individuals that are coming and going in that regard.

1387
01:57:32,857 --> 01:57:39,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of the other competitors that we have in the area definitely opened, some as early as 3 a.m.

1388
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:48,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just want to be able to also service individuals who are up that early that are looking, you know, to have a cup of coffee in the morning.

1389
01:57:52,964 --> 01:57:53,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

1390
01:57:54,285 --> 01:57:55,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, sorry, Madam President.

1391
01:57:55,887 --> 01:57:56,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna be short.

1392
01:57:56,847 --> 01:58:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, to his papers are still here.

1393
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:02,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, um, there's a sign.

1394
01:58:02,292 --> 01:58:07,156
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a sign, uh, to Councilor Collins point, which I had not considered at all.

1395
01:58:07,797 --> 01:58:08,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

1396
01:58:08,157 --> 01:58:09,678
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not asking for something that's by right.

1397
01:58:09,698 --> 01:58:15,043
[SPEAKER_07]: They're asking for an exception to our legal ordinances to be allowed to operate outside of normal operating hours.

1398
01:58:15,523 --> 01:58:21,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, which again, you know, I'd like to ask counsel, so I don't know if maybe we close the public hearing, but, uh,

1399
01:58:22,582 --> 01:58:24,604
[SPEAKER_07]: we close the public hearing and table deliberation further?

1400
01:58:25,425 --> 01:58:26,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that possible or?

1401
01:58:27,627 --> 01:58:29,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, what if we just do with this?

1402
01:58:29,668 --> 01:58:30,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1403
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we do that.

1404
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:40,078
[SPEAKER_07]: But given what Councilor Collins is very cogent point that this is a completely different contextual situation around what we're, we may have different options before us.

1405
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:43,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be my question.

1406
01:58:44,662 --> 01:58:48,305
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a so I would move to close the close the public hearing, but

1407
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:50,390
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to move on to the next item.

1408
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:55,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep keep this on our agenda as the six for our next meeting as the 60 public comment period continues.

1409
01:58:56,312 --> 01:58:57,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd further motion to request.

1410
01:58:59,173 --> 01:59:03,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That council provide us with, uh.

1411
01:59:05,975 --> 01:59:10,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Basic list of reasons that what is what are our options when it comes to approval or denial of the permit?

1412
01:59:10,756 --> 01:59:11,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And what reasons do we have

1413
01:59:17,977 --> 01:59:23,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion to close the public hearing and a table of paper to a date certain being our next regular meeting on January 31st.

1414
01:59:23,922 --> 01:59:24,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1415
01:59:25,043 --> 01:59:26,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President.

1416
01:59:26,564 --> 01:59:27,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

1417
01:59:27,925 --> 01:59:37,173
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we're gonna get into some trouble here because we've given extended hours in Dunkin Donuts and many other companies and other restaurants, anything for extended hours.

1418
01:59:37,233 --> 01:59:44,079
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is, as I said, the legal chairman says arbitrary and capricious decision, which is gonna get us in trouble.

1419
01:59:44,459 --> 01:59:45,560
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm asking for.

1420
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:53,384
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, like I said, we've done it for all these other sandwich shops and restaurants.

1421
01:59:54,325 --> 01:59:56,466
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think we're walking into another minefield.

1422
01:59:56,806 --> 01:59:58,087
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, up to you all.

1423
01:59:59,948 --> 02:00:00,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just one of seven.

1424
02:00:01,309 --> 02:00:02,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can make the motion and we can.

1425
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:06,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll withdraw my motion for another motion if that.

1426
02:00:07,592 --> 02:00:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't motion, so.

1427
02:00:19,124 --> 02:00:20,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Navarre, name and address for the record, please.

1428
02:00:27,628 --> 02:00:29,508
[SPEAKER_24]: There we go.

1429
02:00:29,528 --> 02:00:31,609
[SPEAKER_24]: 108 Medford Street, number 1B, William Navarre.

1430
02:00:32,129 --> 02:00:39,232
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to say, I mean, as far as I understand, this worst case that happens is we got a Starbucks open at 5 a.m.

1431
02:00:39,772 --> 02:00:42,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Seems like a pretty good chance to just make, 5 a.m.

1432
02:00:42,713 --> 02:00:42,934
[SPEAKER_24]: is it?

1433
02:00:43,194 --> 02:00:43,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1434
02:00:43,454 --> 02:00:43,914
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, okay.

1435
02:00:45,018 --> 02:00:48,441
[SPEAKER_24]: seems to me it's a pretty good opportunity to go to bat for labor.

1436
02:00:49,142 --> 02:00:50,943
[SPEAKER_24]: This council talks a big game about that.

1437
02:00:50,963 --> 02:00:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can accept that.

1438
02:00:52,105 --> 02:00:55,388
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst that happens is we get sued and it costs the city a significant amount of money.

1439
02:00:56,549 --> 02:00:57,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to make that clear.

1440
02:00:57,770 --> 02:00:59,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sometimes that gets lost.

1441
02:00:59,031 --> 02:01:00,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I'm glad I made that point.

1442
02:01:00,472 --> 02:01:01,373
[SPEAKER_24]: That's because I didn't know that.

1443
02:01:01,393 --> 02:01:02,874
[SPEAKER_24]: Now everybody else listening knows that.

1444
02:01:02,914 --> 02:01:03,755
[SPEAKER_24]: So I appreciate that.

1445
02:01:04,136 --> 02:01:04,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course.

1446
02:01:04,676 --> 02:01:05,857
[SPEAKER_24]: We made good use of that time.

1447
02:01:07,939 --> 02:01:10,902
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had a city solicitor would not cost as much.

1448
02:01:18,111 --> 02:01:19,271
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at a stalemate.

1449
02:01:20,012 --> 02:01:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make a motion.

1450
02:01:22,153 --> 02:01:23,594
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, do I have a motion on the floor?

1451
02:01:28,257 --> 02:01:34,922
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, I think it's just Vice President Berzina had a motion.

1452
02:01:35,922 --> 02:01:36,343
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong?

1453
02:01:36,503 --> 02:01:36,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1454
02:01:38,344 --> 02:01:41,146
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello to approve seconded by

1455
02:01:43,787 --> 02:01:46,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are killing me.

1456
02:01:48,911 --> 02:01:51,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a second?

1457
02:01:51,973 --> 02:01:52,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1458
02:01:53,134 --> 02:01:55,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume we're ready to roll a poll vote.

1459
02:01:55,736 --> 02:01:55,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1460
02:02:16,258 --> 02:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1461
02:02:16,478 --> 02:02:16,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yes.

1462
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:16,819
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1463
02:02:16,839 --> 02:02:16,919
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1464
02:02:16,939 --> 02:02:17,019
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1465
02:02:17,039 --> 02:02:17,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1466
02:02:17,299 --> 02:02:17,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1467
02:02:48,196 --> 02:02:49,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in the affirmative.

1468
02:02:50,937 --> 02:02:52,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

1469
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:53,998
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

1470
02:02:54,378 --> 02:02:56,458
[SPEAKER_02]: The extended hours are graded.

1471
02:02:57,859 --> 02:03:00,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear about that on Facebook tomorrow.

1472
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:01,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1473
02:03:04,741 --> 02:03:06,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Reaching across the aisle for coffee.

1474
02:03:15,128 --> 02:03:19,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to keep the six-day waiting period pending the six-day waiting period?

1475
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1476
02:03:21,332 --> 02:03:24,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motion is approved pending the six-day comment period.

1477
02:03:26,276 --> 02:03:26,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1478
02:03:28,137 --> 02:03:29,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys could follow that, but it was approved.

1479
02:03:30,419 --> 02:03:30,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1480
02:03:30,999 --> 02:03:32,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate that.

1481
02:03:33,441 --> 02:03:33,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1482
02:03:42,272 --> 02:03:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: motions, orders, and resolutions.

1483
02:03:45,634 --> 02:03:59,862
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-012 offered by Vice President Bears, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests that DCR share its plan to fix issues this spring with empty dirt pits and patches of weeds that have gone unfilled on the Fellsway and Fellsway West due to recent sidewalk and curb construction.

1484
02:04:00,377 --> 02:04:04,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that Traffic and Transportation Director Blake share any updates he can provide.

1485
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:11,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the Mayor update the Council on the status of the on-site visit by DCR Commissioner requested in paper 22-353.

1486
02:04:11,162 --> 02:04:13,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

1487
02:04:13,923 --> 02:04:14,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1488
02:04:16,912 --> 02:04:22,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that we did not have to discuss the open dirt pits on the Fellsway so often in this forum, but here we are.

1489
02:04:23,595 --> 02:04:29,037
[SPEAKER_07]: There are open dirt pits on the Fellsway, still from the construction that's been happening over the last nine months.

1490
02:04:29,617 --> 02:04:40,302
[SPEAKER_07]: In many areas, it's like a four inch drop off of the sidewalk, which could lead to falls, injuries and other issues, nevermind the aesthetic issues going on.

1491
02:04:41,552 --> 02:04:46,094
[SPEAKER_07]: heard from a number of residents in recent weeks and months who are concerned about this.

1492
02:04:47,715 --> 02:05:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear if there's any any communication from DCR to the city about, you know, we have to wait till spring to put certain things in or why it's been left this long and make sure that there's a commitment that it's not just going to be left in its current state, which is deplorable.

1493
02:05:04,502 --> 02:05:14,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, when it comes to DCR, I requested almost at least six months ago at this point for the mayor to work with Senator Jalen's office.

1494
02:05:14,711 --> 02:05:27,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Jalen's office graciously offered to help schedule an onsite visit from the DCR commissioner to the city to look at a number of problem issues like the river bank, maintenance of the Mystic Valley Parkway, Fellsway, Fellsway West, et cetera.

1495
02:05:27,882 --> 02:05:31,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And that still has, I have not heard back on when that's gonna be scheduled.

1496
02:05:32,557 --> 02:05:49,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, it's just still a mess with DCR and it really needs to get fixed because there's situations all over the city that from not just aesthetics, but from, you know, physical potential or physical injury could cause serious harm to members of the city and community who just want to walk down the street.

1497
02:05:49,464 --> 02:05:51,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd really like an urgent response here.

1498
02:05:51,265 --> 02:05:51,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1499
02:05:53,708 --> 02:05:56,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate Councilor bears putting this on the agenda.

1500
02:05:57,029 --> 02:06:14,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I really want to underscore the urgency of this issue I was, I was walking along the whole fells way with some friends, just, just for a walk on the other day, and I, this was the most shocking thing to me, and I mean, we as a council we've already criticized the.

1501
02:06:16,897 --> 02:06:30,168
[SPEAKER_04]: the state government for not being clear to us about why they're repaving perfectly paved sidewalk with asphalt, why they're leaving things half constructed, why they haven't been up front with residents about noise.

1502
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:36,573
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, it is shocking that such a construction has been left in half

1503
02:06:38,351 --> 02:06:38,791
[SPEAKER_04]: halfway.

1504
02:06:39,332 --> 02:06:46,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are even benches along the fells way that are tied to trees using I'm using zip ties, which is not safe.

1505
02:06:47,654 --> 02:06:49,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I support this motion I would second it.

1506
02:06:51,675 --> 02:06:51,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1507
02:06:58,869 --> 02:07:09,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think it's also very important to point out that the City of Medford has maintenance and upkeep agreements with the DCI for a number of DCI-owned and controlled properties, Sleepy Hollow being one of those locations.

1508
02:07:11,486 --> 02:07:31,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might be in our best interest to also take a look internally through our DPW commissioner to see if in fact this area is an area that has a maintenance and upkeep agreement with the DCR, because it might actually be the city's responsibility, not the DCR's to maintain this area due to the agreement that they had to do, I think back under the Romney administration.

1509
02:07:32,179 --> 02:07:32,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1510
02:07:32,859 --> 02:07:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see we have Todd Blake on the call.

1511
02:07:36,661 --> 02:07:39,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Blake, are you able to provide any update on this?

1512
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:42,937
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're still there, it's been a while.

1513
02:07:45,879 --> 02:07:52,021
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I don't have any updates at this time, but I do have a request out to DCR, so I'll get back to you as soon as we can on that.

1514
02:07:53,982 --> 02:07:54,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Todd.

1515
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1516
02:08:16,321 --> 02:08:16,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1517
02:08:16,662 --> 02:08:16,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1518
02:08:17,382 --> 02:08:19,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thank you, Director Blake.

1519
02:08:19,143 --> 02:08:19,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1520
02:08:19,263 --> 02:08:20,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having some confusion on the previous vote.

1521
02:08:22,324 --> 02:08:27,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on this paper on the motion of Councilor Kirby?

1522
02:08:27,086 --> 02:08:28,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sure.

1523
02:08:28,727 --> 02:08:29,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1524
02:08:43,052 --> 02:08:49,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1525
02:08:49,936 --> 02:08:50,596
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

1526
02:08:50,616 --> 02:08:50,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1527
02:08:51,316 --> 02:08:52,077
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1528
02:08:52,137 --> 02:08:52,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1529
02:08:52,817 --> 02:09:06,103
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-013 offered by Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the City Council ask the City Administration to look into creating an expanded list of sites around the city where city-sponsored events can be held in order to expand accessibility and build a wider sense of community.

1530
02:09:06,484 --> 02:09:06,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

1531
02:09:07,735 --> 02:09:09,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

1532
02:09:09,197 --> 02:09:13,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week, we heard a presentation about the McGlynn Playground and the upgrades to it.

1533
02:09:13,883 --> 02:09:24,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And a very big part of that presentation was how they envisioned to use the McGlynn Playground and the area around it as a venue for community.

1534
02:09:24,517 --> 02:09:25,478
[SPEAKER_04]: and for community events.

1535
02:09:25,698 --> 02:09:30,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do hold our Harvester Energy Festival around there.

1536
02:09:30,441 --> 02:09:43,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that event really underscores the need to go into different neighborhoods in our city and how that brings together people who might not normally show up at city-sponsored events.

1537
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:47,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday, there was a beautiful event at the West Bedford Community Center.

1538
02:09:47,992 --> 02:09:49,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a few of our

1539
02:09:49,773 --> 02:09:51,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilors and state reps there as well.

1540
02:09:52,954 --> 02:10:12,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, again, another example of an activity where a city sponsored activity where when we move it out of City Hall move it out of the normal places where we congregate Medford Square, for example, we're able to bring in people from different backgrounds and get input from different residents as well.

1541
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:20,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That event yesterday, a big theme of it was that we are a big city with a lot of bridges to build.

1542
02:10:21,248 --> 02:10:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to build bridges with our neighborhoods that don't feel maybe don't feel as much represented with neighbors who might not know about city events going on.

1543
02:10:32,156 --> 02:10:35,339
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have spaces we have parks that we can use.

1544
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:38,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And this resolution speaks to.

1545
02:10:41,302 --> 02:10:49,724
[SPEAKER_04]: speaks to that, you know, speaks to the need for greater consideration of equity and accessibility for residents when it comes to our city events.

1546
02:10:51,965 --> 02:10:52,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1547
02:10:53,565 --> 02:10:57,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Knight?

1548
02:10:59,006 --> 02:11:00,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1549
02:11:00,526 --> 02:11:01,146
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1550
02:11:01,166 --> 02:11:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1551
02:11:01,907 --> 02:11:02,707
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1552
02:11:03,107 --> 02:11:03,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1553
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:22,519
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-014 offered by Councilor Tseng be a source of the city council asked the city administration to increase access to sharps disposal in our city focusing on accessibility convenience and cleaning up refuse from what spaces Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President morale on this came out of conversations with residents.

1554
02:11:24,557 --> 02:11:29,860
[SPEAKER_04]: just generally, but especially with residents who use EpiPens.

1555
02:11:30,181 --> 02:11:43,249
[SPEAKER_04]: A resident reached out to me last week saying that one of the sharps disposal sites in the city, the police station, she was told by an officer that they're no longer accepting sharps at that location.

1556
02:11:43,389 --> 02:11:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I have reached out to the mayor and the health department here, and they're still looking into it.

1557
02:11:50,214 --> 02:11:52,355
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't gotten back to me on that point yet.

1558
02:11:53,836 --> 02:12:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, you know, increasing access to disposal in our city only would reduce waste, you know this.

1559
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:07,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to see sharps around our city.

1560
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:31,180
[SPEAKER_04]: resolution increasing access would give residents a chance to dispose of their sharps safely, in a safe manner, in a clean manner, in a healthy manner, without necessarily, in their convenience, I guess.

1561
02:12:34,122 --> 02:12:42,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this also underscores the need for our city to be better at our communications when it comes to changes that might affect people's everyday lives.

1562
02:12:42,767 --> 02:12:50,552
[SPEAKER_04]: If a parent needs to dispose of their kid's EpiPens, they should know where to go without having to run across town.

1563
02:12:51,733 --> 02:12:59,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And even in this building, the only available one right now is on the third floor, and that also can pose an accessibility problem as well.

1564
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:02,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So this proposal is really about

1565
02:13:03,168 --> 02:13:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: accessibility, it's really about convenience for our residents, about communication and also about beautifying our city.

1566
02:13:10,115 --> 02:13:10,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1567
02:13:11,636 --> 02:13:12,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

1568
02:13:12,377 --> 02:13:12,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Move.

1569
02:13:13,518 --> 02:13:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: On a motion of Councilor Caraviello to approve, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1570
02:13:18,802 --> 02:13:19,463
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1571
02:13:19,483 --> 02:13:19,843
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

1572
02:13:20,244 --> 02:13:20,944
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1573
02:13:20,984 --> 02:13:21,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1574
02:13:21,525 --> 02:13:26,309
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam President, motion to suspend the rules for voter reconsideration on 22412.

1575
02:13:27,693 --> 02:13:33,916
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, I'll just suspend the rules for a reconsideration of the vote on 22-412.

1576
02:13:36,418 --> 02:13:39,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, it's a voice vote.

1577
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:43,121
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have taken more time than it would have.

1578
02:13:43,221 --> 02:13:45,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry?

1579
02:13:46,343 --> 02:13:47,103
[SPEAKER_29]: I am on the prevailing side.

1580
02:13:47,123 --> 02:13:47,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well.

1581
02:13:48,484 --> 02:13:49,325
[SPEAKER_29]: I am on the prevailing side.

1582
02:13:49,425 --> 02:13:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it, I erroneously called it the prevailing side, so I know we can be stuck in legal limbo.

1583
02:13:53,987 --> 02:13:55,448
[SPEAKER_29]: No, that's right, there is no prevailing side.

1584
02:13:55,508 --> 02:13:55,748
[SPEAKER_02]: There is?

1585
02:13:55,768 --> 02:13:57,129
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no prevailing side.

1586
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:10,225
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion of Councilor Caraviello to suspend the rules to reconsider 22-412 seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1587
02:14:10,245 --> 02:14:10,826
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1588
02:14:10,846 --> 02:14:12,206
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1589
02:14:12,286 --> 02:14:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1590
02:14:13,027 --> 02:14:20,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So I erroneously called this paper as passing when it actually did not because it is a zoning change.

1591
02:14:20,251 --> 02:14:24,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It would require a super majority of five votes and we did not have that.

1592
02:14:25,322 --> 02:14:28,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a motion on the floor for this paper.

1593
02:14:31,065 --> 02:14:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion reconsider.

1594
02:14:32,446 --> 02:14:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1595
02:14:33,126 --> 02:14:41,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a motion to reconsider the vote on a motion of cancer Harvey L to reconsider second by second.

1596
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,000
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1597
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1598
02:14:48,381 --> 02:14:48,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1599
02:14:49,322 --> 02:14:49,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

1600
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:54,884
[SPEAKER_29]: Madam President, I think we made a mistake here and we didn't have the five votes.

1601
02:14:54,904 --> 02:14:58,966
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'd like to ask that this be voted on again.

1602
02:14:58,986 --> 02:15:03,228
[SPEAKER_29]: And for the same reasons, I think this is an arbitrary decision.

1603
02:15:03,888 --> 02:15:09,150
[SPEAKER_29]: We've given it to many other restaurants and donut shops and coffee shops.

1604
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:13,492
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, I understand the labor part of the agreement,

1605
02:15:14,612 --> 02:15:19,533
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this opens us up to something that we just got through spending the last two hours on.

1606
02:15:20,614 --> 02:15:22,894
[SPEAKER_29]: We're gonna walk into another minefield.

1607
02:15:22,914 --> 02:15:26,195
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I motion for approval for the license.

1608
02:15:26,495 --> 02:15:27,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Cabrera.

1609
02:15:27,556 --> 02:15:28,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice Mayor Bears.

1610
02:15:28,176 --> 02:15:31,397
[SPEAKER_07]: To that point, I don't think that the vote's gonna go any different if we vote it now.

1611
02:15:33,077 --> 02:15:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I would move to table this to our January 31st meeting and request both the,

1612
02:15:41,435 --> 02:15:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: the presence of legal counsel at that meeting because I think the real answer here is to your point which is we, I'm not even sure the quantum is five quite frankly on this, I'd have to double check on it.

1613
02:15:51,006 --> 02:15:59,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm not sure how many votes we need and I'm not sure what our authority is to approve or deny zoning thing it did need to five so we are okay so okay but

1614
02:16:00,237 --> 02:16:06,723
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you know, so I just think to Councilor Scarpelli's initial point around this whole thing, we're better off having council in the room when we make decisions like this.

1615
02:16:08,385 --> 02:16:11,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would move to table till January 31st meeting and request the presence of council.

1616
02:16:11,828 --> 02:16:12,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I would second.

1617
02:16:12,809 --> 02:16:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you withdraw your motion?

1618
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:14,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I withdraw the motion.

1619
02:16:14,991 --> 02:16:17,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears to table to the January 31st.

1620
02:16:24,128 --> 02:16:26,332
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we already voted for reconsideration.

1621
02:16:26,352 --> 02:16:27,935
[SPEAKER_02]: His motion was to approve.

1622
02:16:27,995 --> 02:16:29,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we voted for reconsideration.

1623
02:16:30,118 --> 02:16:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he just submitted a new motion to approve.

1624
02:16:33,684 --> 02:16:34,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's withdrawing it.

1625
02:16:35,267 --> 02:16:36,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But we already voted affirmatively to reconsider.

1626
02:16:40,255 --> 02:16:40,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1627
02:16:40,795 --> 02:16:51,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears to table the petition until the January 31st meeting and request the presence of legal counsel as seconded by, I think it was Councilor Tseng, seconded by everyone.

1628
02:16:52,042 --> 02:16:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thirded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1629
02:16:57,005 --> 02:16:59,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, please roll call, just for...

1630
02:17:00,905 --> 02:17:07,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we got a little too well the boat was taken.

1631
02:17:07,089 --> 02:17:07,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1632
02:17:07,289 --> 02:17:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1633
02:17:26,838 --> 02:17:28,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1634
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1635
02:17:30,282 --> 02:17:31,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1636
02:17:33,166 --> 02:17:38,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to revert back to regular order is on the motion of Vice President Harris to revert back to regular order of business.

1637
02:17:38,974 --> 02:17:39,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Second by Councilor Tseng.

1638
02:17:39,895 --> 02:17:40,556
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1639
02:17:40,576 --> 02:17:40,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1640
02:17:41,137 --> 02:17:41,757
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

1641
02:17:41,777 --> 02:17:42,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1642
02:17:44,841 --> 02:17:59,320
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council renew its efforts on reducing nip litter around the city including what not limited to the following actions, a following up on resolution, which requested the licensing commission examine the feasibility of the following.

1643
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: One, implementation of a no-nip condition on the transfer of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on premises.

1644
02:18:08,363 --> 02:18:14,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, implementation of a no-nip condition on the issuance of new licenses for the sale of alcohol beverages not to be drunk on premises.

1645
02:18:14,986 --> 02:18:22,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, increasing the renewal fees of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on premises for establishments engaged in the sale of nips.

1646
02:18:23,178 --> 02:18:40,148
[SPEAKER_02]: B, exploring a city ordinance regulating NIP sales along the lines of the thin film plastic bags ordinance for a mandatory level, and C, reaching out to our state delegation to ask them to support and continue their advocacy for bills in the state legislature which would promote the proper disposal of NIPs and include NIPs in ball deposit programs.

1647
02:18:40,168 --> 02:18:40,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

1648
02:18:41,093 --> 02:18:42,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

1649
02:18:43,254 --> 02:18:50,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to offer this resolution as a way to start a conversation about nipple litter in our city.

1650
02:18:50,917 --> 02:19:06,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw, when I was doing research on it, I saw that Councilor Knight had proposed resolution 19-516, which I quoted here, which I was interested where that discussion went, because I couldn't find a record of that.

1651
02:19:08,967 --> 02:19:19,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I put this on the agenda because I received quite a few messages on social media from younger folks, especially, and some emails about this issue.

1652
02:19:21,857 --> 02:19:24,958
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of younger folks, I guess they've seen the TikTok going around.

1653
02:19:25,278 --> 02:19:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Medford talk has become a thing.

1654
02:19:27,418 --> 02:19:30,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are quite a lot of TikToks about this issue now.

1655
02:19:31,819 --> 02:19:41,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And I figured that this was, it was important to address this issue to get ahead of the spring and summer seasons, the warmer weather when we might see more of the slitter around.

1656
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is an image issue as well.

1657
02:19:45,882 --> 02:19:50,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to make sure that our city is beautified and that this isn't the impression that we give our city.

1658
02:19:51,463 --> 02:19:58,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I also heard from some pet owners who walked their dogs in the park who are concerned by the litter as well.

1659
02:19:59,385 --> 02:20:02,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, this is really just to start a conversation.

1660
02:20:02,846 --> 02:20:07,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I've included a whole range of ideas in here, some of which I prefer.

1661
02:20:08,468 --> 02:20:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I personally see this is that it's an externality issue.

1662
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:13,451
[SPEAKER_04]: The market only goes so far.

1663
02:20:13,931 --> 02:20:15,232
[SPEAKER_04]: The free market only goes so far.

1664
02:20:15,332 --> 02:20:18,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we can all acknowledge that net litter is bad.

1665
02:20:19,054 --> 02:20:34,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I personally would like to address or like to see if legally we could levy a per bottle fee on this issue like we often do with plastic bags and stuff like that.

1666
02:20:37,214 --> 02:20:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm open to advice and feedback from councillors.

1667
02:20:40,877 --> 02:20:51,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard from residents who have noted that nips are important for liquor usage as well in terms of regulating their consumption as well.

1668
02:20:51,987 --> 02:20:57,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think perhaps the ban might go too far, but again, this is to really start a conversation.

1669
02:20:58,574 --> 02:20:59,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1670
02:21:00,054 --> 02:21:00,695
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Madam President.

1671
02:21:00,735 --> 02:21:01,935
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Councilor, for bringing this up.

1672
02:21:01,955 --> 02:21:07,196
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, this is something that was brought up before, and it is, I agree with you 100%.

1673
02:21:07,536 --> 02:21:08,997
[SPEAKER_29]: It is a beautification issue.

1674
02:21:09,017 --> 02:21:09,877
[SPEAKER_29]: They're all over the place.

1675
02:21:09,917 --> 02:21:11,338
[SPEAKER_29]: Everyone gets them in front of their own houses.

1676
02:21:12,138 --> 02:21:17,919
[SPEAKER_29]: But on the flip side, you know, this is a pretty big business for these small package stores.

1677
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:26,602
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't buy NIPS, I mean, but I would think that maybe we should, for the Economic Development Committee for discussion, and invite the,

1678
02:21:27,825 --> 02:21:32,247
[SPEAKER_29]: Package Store Owners, Liquor Commission, and the Chamber of Commerce to that next meeting.

1679
02:21:33,348 --> 02:21:35,469
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know who's on the Economic Committee.

1680
02:21:35,989 --> 02:21:36,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look it up.

1681
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we renamed everyone.

1682
02:21:41,312 --> 02:21:43,053
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, me, I guess it's me.

1683
02:21:43,213 --> 02:21:44,734
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it's you, it's all of us.

1684
02:21:44,774 --> 02:21:45,775
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all of us.

1685
02:21:45,975 --> 02:21:57,541
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, if we could refer that discussion and invite all the parties, let's say the Chamber of Commerce, the Package Store Owners, and the Liquor Commission, and some legal counsel too,

1686
02:21:58,321 --> 02:21:59,022
[SPEAKER_29]: if we can even do that.

1687
02:22:13,278 --> 02:22:14,019
[SPEAKER_29]: getting it going again.

1688
02:22:14,239 --> 02:22:17,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really grateful for your for your comments.

1689
02:22:17,321 --> 02:22:18,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a good idea.

1690
02:22:18,362 --> 02:22:25,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I mean, I don't want the government regulating personal behavior as well.

1691
02:22:25,427 --> 02:22:29,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And it isn't I recognize it's important for package stores as well.

1692
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:35,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.

1693
02:22:35,294 --> 02:22:35,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Further discussion.

1694
02:22:37,622 --> 02:22:38,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, thank you very much.

1695
02:22:39,443 --> 02:22:42,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, I don't think this is something that should be explored any further.

1696
02:22:42,904 --> 02:22:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty simple, all right?

1697
02:22:44,364 --> 02:22:46,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Either we want NIPS in our community or we don't, okay?

1698
02:22:46,965 --> 02:22:49,606
[SPEAKER_09]: We have no problem banning leaf blowers, but we can't ban NIPS.

1699
02:22:50,066 --> 02:22:51,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on, let's be serious here.

1700
02:22:51,587 --> 02:22:56,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be clear, we have not banned leaf blowers just before people start talking about it.

1701
02:22:56,168 --> 02:22:59,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, not yet, but if I was a betting man- And we never will.

1702
02:22:59,569 --> 02:23:04,671
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was a betting man, I'd say a few years down the line, it's just gonna come into effect.

1703
02:23:06,456 --> 02:23:12,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, the delayed implementation, they call it, I think, is what happens.

1704
02:23:12,439 --> 02:23:15,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Effective four years from now, they'll be banned.

1705
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,481
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was a betting man, I'd say that's what's gonna happen.

1706
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a betting man?

1707
02:23:22,363 --> 02:23:25,144
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't understand why we can't ban nips.

1708
02:23:25,204 --> 02:23:27,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, ultimately, if we want them in our community, we don't.

1709
02:23:27,545 --> 02:23:31,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And the argument that was made by the gentleman that owned the liquor store that

1710
02:23:32,397 --> 02:23:45,481
[SPEAKER_09]: People with drinking problems use NIPS to regulate their consumption is, quite frankly, probably in contradiction and contrast to every single public health advisory that you could ever read when it comes down to somebody who's dealing with addiction.

1711
02:23:45,981 --> 02:23:46,781
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1712
02:23:46,861 --> 02:23:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So that argument, I don't think holds any water in this community.

1713
02:23:50,542 --> 02:23:55,444
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that's been laying around, just like many things that have been laying around when we send it across the hall to the administration.

1714
02:23:55,684 --> 02:23:55,924
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1715
02:23:56,345 --> 02:23:59,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So the conversation should have been started a long time ago.

1716
02:23:59,129 --> 02:23:59,430
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1717
02:23:59,710 --> 02:24:01,332
[SPEAKER_09]: We jumped out of this conversation already.

1718
02:24:01,372 --> 02:24:02,354
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked for feedback.

1719
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:04,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We asked to get a response from the administration.

1720
02:24:04,317 --> 02:24:04,737
[SPEAKER_09]: We got nothing.

1721
02:24:05,418 --> 02:24:05,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again.

1722
02:24:06,233 --> 02:24:06,493
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1723
02:24:06,653 --> 02:24:09,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, so we can either go down this road again, right.

1724
02:24:09,894 --> 02:24:11,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we can say that we're going to take affirmative steps and do it.

1725
02:24:12,514 --> 02:24:15,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, I, for one think that they should just be banned in the community.

1726
02:24:16,295 --> 02:24:21,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'm not crazy about the 5 cent nickel, you know, return the bottle redemption on them.

1727
02:24:22,397 --> 02:24:26,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, because it's still going to leave us with the same problem that they're going to be everywhere.

1728
02:24:26,257 --> 02:24:29,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to rely on somebody who wants to make a nickel to go around and pick them up.

1729
02:24:29,836 --> 02:24:31,216
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be the city that's picking them up.

1730
02:24:31,496 --> 02:24:32,697
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still going to have the same problem.

1731
02:24:33,017 --> 02:24:40,098
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to try to create a revenue source to somebody who has the wherewithal and the work ethic to want to go around and pick them up and turn them in.

1732
02:24:40,118 --> 02:24:41,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's the way that we should be handling this.

1733
02:24:42,159 --> 02:24:45,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is something that should be just blanket banned.

1734
02:24:45,279 --> 02:24:47,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a one ounce plastic bottle.

1735
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:48,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a single use bottle.

1736
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,180
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd be in single use bags.

1737
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,500
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to be in a single use bottle.

1738
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:56,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would make sense, but I will support the motion this evening, but this is something that I think should have been done already.

1739
02:24:57,442 --> 02:24:58,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1740
02:24:58,502 --> 02:24:59,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

1741
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of cancer car VLO as seconded by cancer saying, all those in favor.

1742
02:25:06,946 --> 02:25:07,707
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed.

1743
02:25:08,307 --> 02:25:08,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1744
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:21,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Communications from the mayor to three dash 016 to the honorable president members of the Medford City Council proposed our project in excess of $250,000 dear President Morell and members of the City Council.

1745
02:25:21,921 --> 02:25:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body allow time for a discussion on supporting the affordable housing project, which is starting demolition and construction in 2023 by the Medford Housing Authority for 121 Riverside Avenue.

1746
02:25:34,389 --> 02:25:38,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The $400,000 in ARPA funds will pay for a portion of the permit fees.

1747
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:39,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1748
02:25:40,472 --> 02:25:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, Rana Lungokaran, Mayor.

1749
02:25:42,834 --> 02:25:43,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, if you can.

1750
02:25:44,475 --> 02:25:45,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1751
02:25:45,235 --> 02:25:48,277
[SPEAKER_20]: Before we get started, I think that as we get these

1752
02:25:50,447 --> 02:25:54,071
[SPEAKER_20]: these outlets from the mayor.

1753
02:25:54,452 --> 02:25:59,157
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we should set precedent to make sure everybody understands before anybody speaks on it.

1754
02:26:00,579 --> 02:26:04,424
[SPEAKER_20]: This is done anyway, whether the council supports it or doesn't.

1755
02:26:04,484 --> 02:26:09,329
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just, I think, a platform for the administration just to speak on it.

1756
02:26:09,978 --> 02:26:11,800
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that there isn't any discussion.

1757
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:19,027
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really just a platform for the mayor to tell everybody what she feels is important for the opera.

1758
02:26:19,387 --> 02:26:25,293
[SPEAKER_20]: I have we gotten a report before we start this and what would where the opera money is.

1759
02:26:25,313 --> 02:26:26,735
[SPEAKER_20]: Have we gotten any updates on that?

1760
02:26:27,781 --> 02:26:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe we've gotten a report since the presentation.

1761
02:26:31,303 --> 02:26:31,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1762
02:26:31,863 --> 02:26:42,448
[SPEAKER_20]: So I, you know, I appreciate this coming forward and I'll make a resolution, put a resolution through as we move forward for next week that we get an update on where we are with the offer money.

1763
02:26:44,049 --> 02:26:46,250
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I just want the public to realize this.

1764
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:49,070
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that we're going to have to vote on.

1765
02:26:49,491 --> 02:26:59,954
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that is just sharing with us and something she's moving forward, not to say it's bad or good, but it has no bearing with this council with any decision.

1766
02:26:59,994 --> 02:27:00,494
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

1767
02:27:00,874 --> 02:27:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1768
02:27:01,234 --> 02:27:04,415
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, Madam President.

1769
02:27:04,515 --> 02:27:08,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Vice President Bears and Councilor Knight.

1770
02:27:08,976 --> 02:27:12,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam President, I said this before, I see this as nothing more than

1771
02:27:13,353 --> 02:27:15,434
[SPEAKER_09]: campaign tactic by the administration.

1772
02:27:15,535 --> 02:27:17,076
[SPEAKER_09]: These are papers that we do not have to vote on.

1773
02:27:17,636 --> 02:27:19,197
[SPEAKER_09]: These are papers that are financial in nature.

1774
02:27:20,078 --> 02:27:22,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have not gotten the Warren articles.

1775
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,601
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we still haven't gotten them.

1776
02:27:25,041 --> 02:27:28,763
[SPEAKER_09]: But three weeks in a row now we've gotten papers saying this is how we're going to spend your APA money.

1777
02:27:29,624 --> 02:27:31,285
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so something's wrong.

1778
02:27:31,765 --> 02:27:33,407
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, something smells rotten in Denmark.

1779
02:27:34,322 --> 02:27:36,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is, but something smells rotten.

1780
02:27:36,924 --> 02:27:39,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not adding up, Madam President.

1781
02:27:40,065 --> 02:27:42,447
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not adding up.

1782
02:27:42,607 --> 02:27:43,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why.

1783
02:27:43,608 --> 02:27:53,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Where they're spending the money is such a secret, but then every week we can have somebody from the administration come and tell us where they're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, which this council has no oversight authority on.

1784
02:27:54,954 --> 02:27:59,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I really think it's nothing more than an effort to campaign from the rail because the mayor has an opponent.

1785
02:28:00,497 --> 02:28:01,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the good stuff I'm doing now.

1786
02:28:01,798 --> 02:28:02,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the good stuff I'm doing now.

1787
02:28:02,918 --> 02:28:04,099
[SPEAKER_09]: For three years, I wouldn't talk to you.

1788
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:08,061
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, the kitchen's getting a little warm.

1789
02:28:09,233 --> 02:28:10,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to come out and show my face.

1790
02:28:10,814 --> 02:28:14,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So quite frankly, I think it's an exercise in futility, number one.

1791
02:28:14,618 --> 02:28:19,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, only a Councilor can put forward a measure that goes on the agenda, right?

1792
02:28:19,162 --> 02:28:22,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Every rule of resolution, every order of resolution has to be sponsored by a member of the council.

1793
02:28:22,945 --> 02:28:24,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is three weeks in a row the mayor's put money papers on.

1794
02:28:25,287 --> 02:28:26,708
[SPEAKER_09]: We've asked her for a financial plan.

1795
02:28:26,949 --> 02:28:29,611
[SPEAKER_09]: We've asked her to show us what's going on with the money, right?

1796
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:31,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And we haven't seen that.

1797
02:28:31,312 --> 02:28:34,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're getting fed piecemeal week after week, right?

1798
02:28:34,715 --> 02:28:39,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you think back to the beginning of this fiscal year, how many supplemental appropriations have we been asked to make so far?

1799
02:28:39,999 --> 02:28:41,480
[SPEAKER_09]: How many jobs we've been asked to create?

1800
02:28:42,301 --> 02:28:43,762
[SPEAKER_09]: None of it fits into the financial plan.

1801
02:28:44,162 --> 02:28:45,323
[SPEAKER_09]: None of it fits into the capital plan.

1802
02:28:46,304 --> 02:28:48,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But because we're being fed piecemeal,

1803
02:28:49,933 --> 02:28:57,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And because we're not being provided with the documentation that we've requested now going on in an inordinate amount of time, years, we're unable to make informed decisions.

1804
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:01,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So then we all sit up here looking like a bunch of goobers, right?

1805
02:29:01,922 --> 02:29:07,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back and forth, not being able to make a decision because we all wanna do the right thing and we can't because we're not given the tools in the toolbox.

1806
02:29:08,747 --> 02:29:19,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So last June, when we sat here and the mayor said that we'd have an assistant city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor will be at our meeting and they should be sitting right here right now, but the job hasn't even been posted yet.

1807
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:21,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's the sucker?

1808
02:29:21,761 --> 02:29:23,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We are, once again, right?

1809
02:29:23,421 --> 02:29:24,762
[SPEAKER_09]: We look like the big dummies in the room.

1810
02:29:26,763 --> 02:29:28,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We look like the big dummies in the room.

1811
02:29:28,124 --> 02:29:28,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough's enough.

1812
02:29:29,205 --> 02:29:33,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough's enough with this administration and the spending and the lack of fiscal transparency.

1813
02:29:34,047 --> 02:29:36,188
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it's not fair to us, it's not fair to the taxpayers.

1814
02:29:36,829 --> 02:29:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're hired to do a job.

1815
02:29:39,390 --> 02:29:44,193
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor sat here right next to me for a decade and she said, our number one job is to be fiscal watchdogs.

1816
02:29:45,547 --> 02:29:48,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she ran on a platform of unity, community, and transparency.

1817
02:29:49,128 --> 02:29:50,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen any community.

1818
02:29:50,548 --> 02:29:52,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen any unity with this body, especially.

1819
02:29:53,188 --> 02:29:56,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't seen any transparency when it comes to the finances in this community.

1820
02:29:56,709 --> 02:29:57,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're out.

1821
02:29:57,909 --> 02:29:58,509
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on?

1822
02:29:58,909 --> 02:30:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on with that financial picture?

1823
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:03,210
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look on the agenda, Madam President, you'll see a paper.

1824
02:30:03,630 --> 02:30:05,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a spending moratorium until the mayor complies.

1825
02:30:06,831 --> 02:30:07,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talked about it.

1826
02:30:07,611 --> 02:30:08,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And we said, let's give the mayor a chance.

1827
02:30:09,451 --> 02:30:12,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's give the mayor an opportunity to come around.

1828
02:30:16,006 --> 02:30:19,008
[SPEAKER_09]: the sacrificial lamb, Mr. Dickinson up here a couple of weeks ago.

1829
02:30:20,429 --> 02:30:22,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, I don't even know what you're talking about.

1830
02:30:22,611 --> 02:30:23,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Warren articles.

1831
02:30:23,271 --> 02:30:23,732
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean?

1832
02:30:23,952 --> 02:30:24,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Warren articles.

1833
02:30:24,712 --> 02:30:25,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

1834
02:30:26,774 --> 02:30:30,056
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration, we've been talking about this now for three years.

1835
02:30:30,076 --> 02:30:32,558
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration has never even said it to the finance director.

1836
02:30:33,118 --> 02:30:34,840
[SPEAKER_09]: The left hand does not know what the right is doing.

1837
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can't keep spending money.

1838
02:30:36,821 --> 02:30:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: If the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, because this body right here certainly doesn't know what's going on because we haven't been provided the information that we need.

1839
02:30:43,252 --> 02:30:47,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is just another perfect example of spending for the purpose of press releases.

1840
02:30:48,078 --> 02:30:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, when I look at these papers that come before the body, I look at the issues that are facing this community.

1841
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:58,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng said it best.

1842
02:30:59,786 --> 02:31:00,947
[SPEAKER_09]: government by social media.

1843
02:31:01,127 --> 02:31:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what this is Medford talk.

1844
02:31:02,649 --> 02:31:04,050
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of tech talks about Medford.

1845
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:05,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that's how we're going to make our decisions.

1846
02:31:06,072 --> 02:31:07,213
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not how government works.

1847
02:31:08,154 --> 02:31:08,334
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1848
02:31:08,354 --> 02:31:09,575
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not how government works.

1849
02:31:09,655 --> 02:31:15,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook, Facebook, TikTok, social media, not real life, fake life, not real life, not real life.

1850
02:31:16,181 --> 02:31:23,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I, I'm looking at this madam president and I'm scratching my head and I'm saying that's another half a million bucks that the city administration spent.

1851
02:31:24,272 --> 02:31:25,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem with the project.

1852
02:31:25,474 --> 02:31:26,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great project.

1853
02:31:26,195 --> 02:31:31,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known about this project for well over a year because the executive director at the housing authority came to us over a year ago.

1854
02:31:31,902 --> 02:31:34,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And he told us this is what they're doing.

1855
02:31:34,526 --> 02:31:35,948
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said he was going to ask for the funds.

1856
02:31:36,469 --> 02:31:39,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to your point, we did receive an extensive presentation on this project.

1857
02:31:40,150 --> 02:31:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: through the Community Preservation Act, just to make that clear.

1858
02:31:43,652 --> 02:31:44,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

1859
02:31:44,292 --> 02:31:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: But we knew about it, not because of the actions of the administration, because the act is the Director of the Housing Authority, the person who's looking for the money, all right?

1860
02:31:51,536 --> 02:31:55,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And we still, again, have no idea what the financial picture is in this community.

1861
02:31:58,099 --> 02:31:58,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1862
02:31:59,240 --> 02:31:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Barros.

1863
02:32:00,141 --> 02:32:00,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1864
02:32:01,321 --> 02:32:08,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be as brief as I can on this, because I generally tend to agree with the analysis from Councilor Knight when it comes to the fact that we

1865
02:32:09,382 --> 02:32:20,130
[SPEAKER_07]: are still waiting to have that full comprehensive budget meeting with all the materials that we requested, including the past three years of Warren articles of which we've now received a grand total of one month, along with the other financial information we need.

1866
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:26,414
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I just do want to just say to the council and I believe we were all on the communication so I don't think I'm breaking any news here.

1867
02:32:30,708 --> 02:32:35,012
[SPEAKER_07]: whether I may have given the mayor the idea to start putting these on the agenda.

1868
02:32:35,673 --> 02:32:38,435
[SPEAKER_07]: When I said, you know, we were kind of getting emails back and forth.

1869
02:32:38,455 --> 02:32:39,076
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about ARPA?

1870
02:32:39,096 --> 02:32:39,917
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about this?

1871
02:32:39,957 --> 02:32:43,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, you know, we're not really having votes.

1872
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:44,821
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not being consulted.

1873
02:32:44,841 --> 02:32:45,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we should be.

1874
02:32:45,742 --> 02:32:52,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And she basically went all the way there, but then stopped short of actually giving us the decision-making power to approve or deny large appropriations, which is what I was requesting the whole time.

1875
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:55,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to put that out there and say, you know,

1876
02:32:59,125 --> 02:33:12,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this may be an attempt to meet what we were asking for when it comes to being truly consulted and having authority over ARPA, I don't think it meets that mark because at the end of the day there's no authority give it to the council to actually approve them but I just want to put that context out there.

1877
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:23,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think people should know, you know, what we asked for was that present, or at least what I asked for and shared with the council was that it must be presented the council and we'd be able to approve them or deny them.

1878
02:33:23,666 --> 02:33:32,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got them presented to us but without any authority to actually approve or deny them so all we can do is really say hey we like this we don't like this and it may be considered it may not be considered.

1879
02:33:33,412 --> 02:33:35,373
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would second the motion to receive in place on file.

1880
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:39,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Cariollo.

1881
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:40,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1882
02:33:41,121 --> 02:33:42,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see a hand up from Madam Chief of Staff.

1883
02:33:43,922 --> 02:33:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Chief of Staff.

1884
02:33:47,683 --> 02:33:51,745
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President Morell and to members of the CACU and members of the Council.

1885
02:33:52,165 --> 02:33:54,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Just want to clarify a couple points.

1886
02:33:54,626 --> 02:34:01,188
[SPEAKER_28]: The first is I have recently received communication from the mayor with regard to these ARPA funded requests.

1887
02:34:01,569 --> 02:34:03,849
[SPEAKER_28]: She would like this guidance from the City Council.

1888
02:34:03,889 --> 02:34:05,230
[SPEAKER_28]: She would like the feedback.

1889
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:10,321
[SPEAKER_28]: as has been communicated to the council with regard to ARPA spending.

1890
02:34:10,721 --> 02:34:21,467
[SPEAKER_28]: There was also an email communication to the council requesting feedback on the overall plan, asking if the council has suggestions on the way that, you know, funding be spent.

1891
02:34:22,147 --> 02:34:28,770
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of the major feedbacks that the members of the council provided was with regard to affordable housing.

1892
02:34:28,890 --> 02:34:31,211
[SPEAKER_28]: This particularly is in line with that.

1893
02:34:31,892 --> 02:34:34,653
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, the mayor has taken the opportunity to look at

1894
02:34:35,114 --> 02:34:39,556
[SPEAKER_28]: that feedback as well as what affordable housing opportunities that there may be.

1895
02:34:39,957 --> 02:34:41,498
[SPEAKER_28]: And this is presented here for that.

1896
02:34:42,698 --> 02:34:49,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I just want to point out to the council that there are quarterly reports on the city's website for ARPA funding.

1897
02:34:49,842 --> 02:34:53,924
[SPEAKER_28]: Those quarterly reports are required to be filed with the federal government.

1898
02:34:54,104 --> 02:34:59,767
[SPEAKER_28]: And there as of September, 2022, I'm certain that the next quarterly report is right around the corner.

1899
02:34:59,807 --> 02:35:01,308
[SPEAKER_28]: I know it's due in like 15 days.

1900
02:35:01,388 --> 02:35:04,330
[SPEAKER_28]: I got an email notification recently from the federal government on that.

1901
02:35:04,831 --> 02:35:08,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Our federal funds manager will be working diligently on that.

1902
02:35:08,974 --> 02:35:13,357
[SPEAKER_28]: As far as warrants are concerned, previously, we have provided some information.

1903
02:35:14,697 --> 02:35:19,381
[SPEAKER_09]: When are we gonna get the information, the financial information that we've requested now going on about about a 24 months?

1904
02:35:22,142 --> 02:35:31,188
[SPEAKER_28]: President Morell, through you to Councilor Knight, as the city council knows, and perhaps the city council, perhaps Councilor Knight,

1905
02:35:32,908 --> 02:35:39,810
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know, is not comfortable with this, but the reality of the situation is we didn't have a finance director for 11 months.

1906
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:41,990
[SPEAKER_28]: We've been doing a bit of catch up from then.

1907
02:35:42,370 --> 02:35:47,431
[SPEAKER_28]: We have been providing, we've identified a rollout basis in which we're going to provide warrants.

1908
02:35:47,792 --> 02:35:50,672
[SPEAKER_28]: We've got clarification and recently issued that information.

1909
02:35:50,952 --> 02:35:52,133
[SPEAKER_28]: It takes time to do that.

1910
02:35:52,453 --> 02:35:57,334
[SPEAKER_28]: And obviously provide the redacted versions of the warrants.

1911
02:35:57,354 --> 02:35:58,074
[SPEAKER_09]: This is ridiculous.

1912
02:35:58,114 --> 02:36:01,015
[SPEAKER_09]: This is nothing more than an end around than a lack of transparency.

1913
02:36:01,055 --> 02:36:01,815
[SPEAKER_09]: They're hiding something.

1914
02:36:02,608 --> 02:36:03,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow the money.

1915
02:36:03,329 --> 02:36:04,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody says follow the money.

1916
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:11,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't follow the money because they're not showing us where it's going, which leads me to believe that they're hiding something.

1917
02:36:12,636 --> 02:36:18,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a motion on the floor to receive and place on file seconded by I believe Vice President Bears.

1918
02:36:18,982 --> 02:36:19,682
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor.

1919
02:36:20,363 --> 02:36:21,123
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed.

1920
02:36:21,143 --> 02:36:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_02]: 23-017.

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to table.

1923
02:36:31,989 --> 02:36:37,733
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to table the home rule petition, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1924
02:36:37,773 --> 02:36:38,614

[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1928
02:36:43,237 --> 02:36:47,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Public participation, is there anyone who would like to speak for public participation at this time?

1929
02:36:47,460 --> 02:36:52,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, and the chamber's being essentially empty.

1930
02:36:55,406 --> 02:36:57,807
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion, sorry, I do see a hand from

1931
02:36:59,567 --> 02:37:01,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew Fleming or accidental.

1932
02:37:01,748 --> 02:37:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1933
02:37:03,449 --> 02:37:10,893
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to adjourn seconded by Councilor Caraviello all those in favor.

1934
02:37:10,913 --> 02:37:12,414
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all those opposed.
