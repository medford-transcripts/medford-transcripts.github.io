[SPEAKER_13]: Can I confirm it's a different link or is it the same link?

66
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:26,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Just so the public knows.

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I saw two links.

68
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:30,614
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I'm asking somebody from the admin.

69
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be the same link.

00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:25,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing and seeing none, I'm going to move on to the consent agenda.

78
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:31,544
[SPEAKER_13]: We have bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes from March 18, 2024.

83
00:57:59,178 --> 00:58:14,741

84
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:26,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you can just motion to amend the minutes and maybe shoot an email over to, is it Lisa who drafted Ms.

[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also just noticing another error in the minutes, so I'm gonna abstain from this one, which might be the same thing that, I'm sorry, clarification, Member Reinfeld, are you mentioning the vote on the stabilization fund?

00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:21,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I am.

100
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:26,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so yeah, so as amended, then yes, I vote to approve, sorry.

00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:52,533

[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,122
[SPEAKER_01]: April is Autism Acceptance Month.

116
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:20,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you remember this observance previously being called Autism Awareness Month, but thanks to the wonderful advocacy of individuals with autism and their supporters around the world, we're making an intentional positive shift to emphasizing acceptance of all neurodiverse people.

117
01:00:21,236 --> 01:00:26,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Their perspectives and experiences enrich and improve our community every day.

118
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,101
[SPEAKER_01]: April is also Arab American Heritage Month.

119
01:00:31,782 --> 01:00:38,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout American history, Arab Americans have made so many contributions to our country and our society.

120
01:00:39,184 --> 01:00:45,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, approximately 3.7 million Arab Americans call the United States their home.

121
01:00:47,551 --> 01:00:52,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, April is an opportunity to mark OT month.

122
01:00:52,756 --> 01:01:07,369
[SPEAKER_01]: In Medford Public Schools, we are lucky to have skilled and compassionate occupational therapy practitioners in every school and serving students at every grade and age level.

123
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:22,462
[SPEAKER_01]: OT makes a big difference for our kids, starting with therapeutic early intervention services and extending all the way to post-graduation transition services for students with disabilities.

[SPEAKER_01]: Another reminder that this Wednesday, April 10th, schools are closed in observance of Eid al-Fitr.

126

01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:14,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students and staff may take time away from school for religious observances, particularly on the first two days of Passover, when the Seder meal is typically celebrated with loved ones.

139
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:25,821
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very proud of our Mustang guard.

140

01:04:30,418 --> 01:04:32,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Please take a moment to complete it.

152
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:43,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It will help us identify routes and other resources to encourage and enable more Medford students to walk, bike, and roll to school.

153
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:49,649
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey asks about a student's mode of transportation to and from school.

154
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:55,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes less than five minutes to complete and is available in 10 languages.

155
01:04:57,716 --> 01:05:02,720
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey can be found on our MPS website and Facebook page.

156
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:13,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Schools with 50% or higher participation will receive an incentive from the Massachusetts Safe Routes to School Program.

157
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:20,572
[SPEAKER_01]: For everyone logged in on Zoom, Thomas will share the survey link in the chat.

158
01:05:21,112 --> 01:05:23,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Thomas Dalton, for doing that.

159
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:28,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight's meeting, we have another busy agenda this evening.

160
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:35,879
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we'll present several generous donations offered by our community for the direct support of our students.

161
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:55,724
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll discuss each of these donations in more detail, but I wanted to begin by saying a warm thank you to the Medford Educational Foundation, the Medford Kiwanis Club, and the Medford Rotary Club for their reliable and impactful partnership and support of public schools.

162
01:05:57,043 --> 01:06:03,849
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, Dr. Suzanne Colussi will present a report on substitute teacher pay and staffing.

163
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:15,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate and reliable substitute staffing has been a prominent challenge for all public schools.

164
01:06:15,758 --> 01:06:16,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is no exception.

165
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look forward to this informative and important presentation.

166
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:28,464
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have also noticed that I called our assistant superintendent, Galusi, doctor.

167
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:30,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed, I did.

168
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:44,872
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may have read in my Friday memo last week, Dr. Galusi defended, successfully defended her doctoral thesis without any revisions, which is a phenomenal feat.

169
01:06:45,612 --> 01:06:50,553
[SPEAKER_01]: last month at Boston College, the Lynch School of Education.

170
01:06:50,613 --> 01:07:03,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations, Dr. Galussi, and her original research for her doctorate in educational leadership focused on transformational and culturally responsive leadership.

171
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:05,917
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so proud of you, Dr. Galussi.

172
01:07:07,478 --> 01:07:08,218
[SPEAKER_01]: In your packets,

173
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:17,797
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also find a draft report on the district wide suspension and discipline report that was requested by the committee earlier this year.

174
01:07:18,558 --> 01:07:22,561
[SPEAKER_01]: The final report will be presented to the committee on April 29th.

175
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:34,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do look forward to you communicating directly with me to send questions, additional pieces of data that you may be looking for so that I can add that to the draft.

176
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:47,958
[SPEAKER_01]: District staff are also working with the school building leaders and staff to develop this report while providing the appropriate and useful context for all of the data that it represents.

177
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:59,184
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, we are working hard to ensure that the report does not inadvertently convey any identifying details about individual students.

178
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:02,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we invite and welcome your feedback and input

179
01:08:04,386 --> 01:08:08,007
[SPEAKER_01]: for the final product to be delivered to you.

180
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:15,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, in your packets, you also received school handbooks for all of our schools.

181
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:29,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high school version of the handbook that you received will be completely finalized in time for the high school presentation that will be taking place on May 6th.

182
01:08:30,675 --> 01:08:40,544
[SPEAKER_01]: The high school handbook will include our Medford High School, which includes the vocational school, and also inclusive of the Curtis Tufts High School.

183
01:08:40,945 --> 01:08:45,749
[SPEAKER_01]: So all three schools will be represented in that one handbook for your review.

184
01:08:46,610 --> 01:09:01,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So these important guiding documents are developed by school principals, assistant principals, school site councils, input from staff, and again, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on the handbooks.

185
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:04,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and I look forward to this evening's meeting.

186
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:08,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

187
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:14,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We have, like you said, three recommendations to approve donations.

188
01:09:15,043 --> 01:09:17,267
[SPEAKER_13]: The first up is $3,180.11 from the Medford Educational Foundation.

189
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:33,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so the Medford Educational Foundation earlier this year, they already donated $13,000 to Medford Public Schools, which was a very generous donation.

190
01:09:33,968 --> 01:09:37,911
[SPEAKER_01]: They received an additional $8,949 in requests from teachers and educators.

191
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:44,438
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to fund $3,180.

192
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:55,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And of that money, one of the things they were able to help purchase from one of our music teachers, Ms.

193
01:09:55,209 --> 01:10:00,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah Grant, she requested four keyboards to be added to the Curtis Tufts programming.

194
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:11,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're very happy and very grateful to the Medford Educational Foundation for their generous contribution to that program.

195
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:22,085
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we also want to thank Needham Bank and their branch manager, Jean K. Lau, for their continued generous donations to the Medford Public Schools.

196
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:25,486
[SPEAKER_01]: through Medford Education Foundation.

197
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: They recently donated $5,000.

198
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to ask the committee to approve this generous donation in the amount of $3,180.11 to be added to the Medford Public Schools coffers.

199
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:36,810

01:15:12,616 --> 01:15:16,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up is substitute pay report, Dr. Susan Glusi.

303
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction.

304
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:20,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll turn it over to you.

305
01:15:23,259 --> 01:15:24,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

306
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:28,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing's going to present the small slide deck.

307
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:34,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So while he's searching for it, I'm just gonna kind of start.

308
01:15:34,694 --> 01:15:38,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

309
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:40,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Dr. Cushing.

310
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:46,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, I'm presenting the requested substitute teachers supply and demand report.

311
01:15:46,923 --> 01:15:52,647
[SPEAKER_07]: As background information, the school committee stated the following rationale for requesting this report.

312
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: First, substitute teachers play a critical role in maintaining educational continuity and quality.

313
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,792
[SPEAKER_07]: when regular teachers are absent.

314
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:04,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, Medford appears to struggle to obtain enough substitutes to cover the need.

315
01:16:06,016 --> 01:16:17,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, concerns have been raised for a long while regarding the adequacy of compensation for substitute teachers and the potential effect of compensation on the quality and availability of substitutes.

316
01:16:18,024 --> 01:16:27,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And third, understanding patterns and reasons for teacher absenteeism is crucial for addressing any underlying issues and ensuring the effective allocation of resources.

317
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:33,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So as such, the slides presentation for this report will cover the sections listed within the request.

318
01:16:34,353 --> 01:16:42,615
[SPEAKER_07]: The first section as listed here covers substitute teacher compensation and district comparisons of substitute pay rates.

319
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:44,976
[SPEAKER_07]: You can advance the slide.

320
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:46,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

321
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:57,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So the table presented here displays the details of the current substitute compensation for Metro Public Schools, which you will see has the blue highlight going right through.

322
01:16:59,008 --> 01:17:02,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to see the comparison of surrounding districts.

323
01:17:03,392 --> 01:17:13,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You will notice a variance in daily rates ranging from the high end of $150 per day to Medford Public Schools at $90 per day with Woburn Public Schools, oh, thank you, at 110.

324
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:16,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing's trying out his pointer.

325
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:35,121
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll also notice that some districts have set a different long-term daily sub rate, and some districts have not.

326
01:17:36,001 --> 01:17:45,067
[SPEAKER_07]: At the current time, Medford does have two separate scales for substitutes that are working in long-term coverage needs.

327
01:17:45,568 --> 01:17:46,609
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're licensed, it's $125.

328
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:47,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, it's about $100.

329
01:17:51,912 --> 01:18:02,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently Medford, as you'll notice, Malden has a tiered approach, which reflects the substitute's education, experience, and licensure.

330
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently Medford does not have a tiered approach.

331
01:18:10,538 --> 01:18:11,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving.

332
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:13,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

333
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So the second section covers substitute need and availability.

334
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:42,275
[SPEAKER_07]: and you can go to the, so the chart that is displayed on here correlates the total number of teacher absences to the total number filled by a substitute for school year 23, excuse me, 22-23, which is highlighted in the gray bars, and then currently for school year 23-24.

335
01:18:44,615 --> 01:18:46,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important to note a few things here.

336
01:18:47,096 --> 01:19:11,781
[SPEAKER_07]: First, absences reflect a variety of reasons, ranging from sick days, personal days, jury duty, bereavement, religious observances, professional development or conference needs, and then various forms of a leave of absence, which could be family medical leave act, maternity,

337
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:14,502
[SPEAKER_07]: workman's compensation, et cetera.

338
01:19:15,203 --> 01:19:25,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the third column, which for each school year is just a data point to acknowledge that there are leaves of absence.

339
01:19:27,031 --> 01:19:35,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And each leave of absence ranges drastically in the amount of days that a teacher may be out.

340
01:19:36,497 --> 01:19:41,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So that data point is going to fluctuate drastically.

341
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:49,209
[SPEAKER_07]: You will also notice that the amount of, this data is just for teachers.

342
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:51,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does not include any other staff.

343
01:19:51,991 --> 01:19:58,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And the number of total teachers is listed underneath the school name.

344
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:02,417
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two asterisks at the bottom of this chart that I think are important to note.

345
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:07,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And one is that there are 17 teachers who have like a district wide status.

346
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're not reflected in this chart.

347
01:20:10,521 --> 01:20:18,905
[SPEAKER_07]: and that the total number of teachers active also fluctuates due to various needs for leave of absence.

348
01:20:19,425 --> 01:20:26,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, there are 495 employed teachers, but 489 are currently active as of right now.

349
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,631
[SPEAKER_07]: In looking at, you can see that there are trends.

350
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:36,933
[SPEAKER_07]: The total absences by building for last year,

351
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:44,357
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part, absences have drastically fell for this school year.

352
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:46,938
[SPEAKER_07]: In some schools, maybe not all.

353
01:20:47,839 --> 01:20:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we're seeing that kind of, as we move closer away from the pandemic will start to see these numbers.

354
01:20:57,563 --> 01:21:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: improve a bit, but last year if we averaged out the daily need for a sub, it was 55 subs district-wide.

355
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:09,593
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes all reasons for absences.

356
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:17,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this year our average daily need for substitutes is about 32 people.

357
01:21:21,162 --> 01:21:25,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there'll be questions, but I don't know if you want me to pause or continue going.

358
01:21:26,357 --> 01:21:27,478
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm gonna continue going.

359
01:21:27,558 --> 01:21:36,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So the third section in this report covers the substitute pool and the current coverage structure for Medford Public Schools.

360
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:43,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So our active pool of substitutes for school year 22-23 consisted of 38 substitutes.

361
01:21:43,672 --> 01:21:45,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Three of those were assigned as long-term subs.

362
01:21:52,495 --> 01:22:02,884
[SPEAKER_07]: While this year, our current active pool is 46 substitutes, and six of those have been assigned as long-term substitutes.

363
01:22:02,904 --> 01:22:11,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have been increasing the pool of substitutes from year to year, but it still cannot meet the current demand.

364
01:22:13,332 --> 01:22:22,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of our substitute pool comprises of college students, current Medford Public Schools, caregivers, and retired professionals.

365
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:39,808
[SPEAKER_07]: The availability of substitutes, because of that compromise of pool, does fluctuate throughout the school year, especially around college students and their availability in the months of January, May, and June.

366
01:22:41,075 --> 01:22:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important to note at the end of each school year, substitutes are classified as inactive until they complete the yearly CORI, which is like the background check, and then they're activated again within our system and able to continue working.

367
01:22:55,967 --> 01:22:58,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing, if you mind going to the next slide.

368
01:22:59,069 --> 01:23:07,893
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a current structure of some internal coverage that we try to employ within the Medford Public Schools.

369
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:10,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, there are instructional support staff.

370
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, aka, these are the building substitutes.

371
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:17,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have

372
01:23:18,544 --> 01:23:21,727
[SPEAKER_07]: through ESSER, but we have one budgeted position at each school.

373
01:23:22,368 --> 01:23:27,793
[SPEAKER_07]: However, not each school has been able to fill the need of one dedicated position.

374
01:23:28,314 --> 01:23:36,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, the Curtis Tufts, the McGlynn Elementary School, the Brooks, and the Andrews has a dedicated, what we call ISS, or building sub.

375
01:23:37,663 --> 01:23:42,648
[SPEAKER_07]: The Roberts, the Missituck, and the McGlynn Middle have not been able to fill this position to date.

376
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:46,772
[SPEAKER_07]: The other position that we have are academic support leads.

377
01:23:47,032 --> 01:23:50,134
[SPEAKER_07]: These are new positions to Medford High School.

378
01:23:50,814 --> 01:24:01,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So with the shift in leadership, Principal Cabral created two dedicated positions this year to help alleviate daily absent coverages.

379
01:24:03,501 --> 01:24:05,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And their title is the academic support lead.

380
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:11,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the third layer is a student supervisory assistant or SSA.

381
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:21,091
[SPEAKER_07]: These were created during the pandemic to help alleviate some of the coverage needs around lunch supervision or just daily coverage needs.

382
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,973
[SPEAKER_07]: These positions are unique because they work no more than about 18 hours a week.

383
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:33,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, right now, we have an SSA position at the Missituck, the Brooks, and the Roberts.

384
01:24:34,682 --> 01:24:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important to note that some of our SSAs were hired as paraprofessionals in the past couple of years.

385
01:24:44,594 --> 01:25:00,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I also think before going on to the fourth section, it's very important to note that the structural nature of the secondary school level lends itself to covering teacher absences in a way that's just not possible at the elementary level.

386
01:25:01,165 --> 01:25:13,234
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, at both the middle school and the high school level, there are designated study halls or teachers that can be assigned based on their schedules or open blocks.

387
01:25:14,654 --> 01:25:16,875
[SPEAKER_07]: while at the elementary level that's not possible.

388
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:25,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And so principals are unfortunately forced to make difficult decisions to cover the class with in-school resources.

389
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:33,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And those in-school resources can range from the ISS or building sub, but it could also include specialist teachers.

390
01:25:34,289 --> 01:25:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: like Art, Music, PE, Computer, Library, Nexus, and it also can include reading and EL teachers, as well as school leaders themselves.

391
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:53,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And those coverages can range between blocks of time to the entire day worth of coverage.

392
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we may go to the next.

393
01:25:57,175 --> 01:25:57,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

394
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:03,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fourth section covers the budget impact of everything I just presented here.

395
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So on this next table,

396
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:08,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

397
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:25,688
[SPEAKER_07]: This next table details the teacher coverage and loss of prep as a result of, especially at the elementary level, but especially due to lack of substitutes and the need for teacher coverages.

398
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:32,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will see that last year, in total, we spent $448,960 just in teacher coverages and loss of prep.

399
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:39,996
[SPEAKER_07]: The anomaly, as noted in the comments section for March of 2023, includes a few things.

400
01:26:40,656 --> 01:26:40,756
[SPEAKER_07]: One,

401
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:58,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes, so when the contract was ratified, there was the retro pay of per hour rate for teachers increased.

402
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:12,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that resulted in about $34,730 that were paid to teachers on March 2nd per the contract to account for that retro need.

403
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:24,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, there were also a great deal of coverage needs at Medford High School and the Andrews Middle School, which resulted in the total cost there.

404
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:34,712
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see currently for this school year, all of the data from all the graphs compiled for this report go up into March 31st.

405
01:27:35,412 --> 01:27:40,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do not have clearly, but data for April, May or June.

406
01:27:40,793 --> 01:27:45,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So to date, our current total of teacher coverage and loss of prep is $34,408.89.

407
01:27:45,434 --> 01:27:45,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

408
01:27:53,072 --> 01:27:55,033
[SPEAKER_07]: breaks down the total impact.

409
01:27:55,133 --> 01:28:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see the graph, excuse me, the column in the middle has our anticipated budget, which was what we allocated in the operating budget to cover substitute needs as well as teacher loss of prep and teacher coverage.

410
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:15,528
[SPEAKER_07]: versus what we're actually spending.

411
01:28:15,548 --> 01:28:23,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to note here, as you noticed for last year's spend, which was fiscal year 2023, we ended that year with a total of $878,327.

412
01:28:23,192 --> 01:28:24,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That number includes

413
01:28:33,635 --> 01:28:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: the $448,000 and change from the previous slide because this spending includes all three.

414
01:28:43,763 --> 01:28:50,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes what we pay for substitutes, what we pay for teacher coverage, and what we pay for loss of prep.

415
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:53,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we were to subtract the $878,324,000,

416
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:03,543
[SPEAKER_07]: by the 448 and change, you'd get the total cost we spent on substitutes.

417
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:06,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the final section.

418
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:17,224
[SPEAKER_07]: is our recommendations and next steps to address the findings of this report and how to effectively address substitute supply and demand.

419
01:29:18,045 --> 01:29:20,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, final slide, Dr. Cushing.

420
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:29,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the things that we've been talking about internally are adjustments to the current substitute teacher compensation structure.

421
01:29:30,953 --> 01:29:35,201
[SPEAKER_07]: We're discussing it and we're vetting out the implementation for fiscal year 25.

422
01:29:36,624 --> 01:29:39,049
[SPEAKER_07]: This includes, but is not limited to.

423
01:29:40,317 --> 01:30:01,372
[SPEAKER_07]: increasing the pay scale for substitute teachers and for the instructional support staff position, considering the establishment of a tiered pay scale system similar to what we saw for Malden, which includes consideration of a substitute's experience, licensure, and level of education,

424
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:18,267
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as looking into the feasibility of using an educational staffing company to build a greater pool of substitutes and also to help arrange and organize daily coverage needs, which is being used in some districts.

425
01:30:18,688 --> 01:30:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So that vetting process of the educational staffing company has been ongoing all year, but these are some of the ways that we're looking to remediate and mitigate the current situation.

426
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:35,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this time, if you have any questions, please let me know.

427
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:42,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi.

428
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:44,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions from the committee?

429
01:30:47,697 --> 01:30:50,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley, then Member Graham.

430
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to make sure that you can hear me.

431
01:30:56,321 --> 01:30:56,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

432
01:30:58,169 --> 01:31:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so just a few questions.

433
01:31:02,535 --> 01:31:06,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

434
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:16,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have data on how often we're pulling reading specialists, EL teachers, specialists, you know, music, PE?

435
01:31:18,903 --> 01:31:20,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I can get that to you.

436
01:31:20,325 --> 01:31:24,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have it at my disposal right now, but I know most of the principals.

437
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:30,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the tricky part would maybe be data from last year, where there was a turnover at one building.

438
01:31:31,276 --> 01:31:37,422
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know principals have been keeping that data, so I can get that for you, definitely.

439
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:38,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

440
01:31:38,933 --> 01:31:39,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

441
01:31:39,414 --> 01:31:40,895
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could share that with us, that would be great.

442
01:31:42,276 --> 01:31:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my question, what is the difference between a teacher coverage and a loss of prep?

443
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:52,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when I was at the Brooks, a loss of prep was, okay, you know, Mr. Sacco's absent.

444
01:31:53,385 --> 01:31:55,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no one to cover loss of prep.

445
01:31:56,287 --> 01:31:56,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

446
01:31:57,668 --> 01:31:58,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So teacher coverage is that

447
01:32:01,032 --> 01:32:01,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

448
01:32:02,053 --> 01:32:02,473
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's okay.

449
01:32:02,873 --> 01:32:15,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Teacher coverage, you mostly see at the secondary level, but it's when teachers, you know, outside of contractual obligations are covering or they're picking up a coverage due to an absence or a long-term absence.

450
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:17,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have to pay for that coverage.

451
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

452
01:32:24,647 --> 01:32:29,530
[SPEAKER_07]: They're taking on the teaching duties or the coverage of the class for the absent teacher.

453
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:34,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then loss of prep and teacher coverage paid at different rates.

454
01:32:36,412 --> 01:32:40,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the previous contract, it was $30 an hour.

455
01:32:40,694 --> 01:32:43,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the new contract, it's now $40 an hour.

456
01:32:44,276 --> 01:32:59,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're speaking about what was owed to them retroactively, we had to go back to when the dates reflected in the contract and add $10 to all of the teachers who either provided coverage or lost their prep.

457
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:01,899
[SPEAKER_07]: for the year.

458
01:33:01,919 --> 01:33:05,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so teacher coverage and loss of prep is both $40 an hour now.

459
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:06,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

460
01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:10,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

461
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:15,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think that was all my questions.

462
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:15,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

463
01:33:15,782 --> 01:33:16,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

464
01:33:16,862 --> 01:33:18,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham and then member old party.

465
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:29,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, all of these, um, sort of recommendations and next step be reflected in the budget that we see at our meeting after April vacation.

466
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:31,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, or

467
01:33:31,656 --> 01:33:36,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these going to take more time to unfold beyond that meeting?

468
01:33:39,444 --> 01:33:45,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I think probably, honestly, I want to have that conversation with the superintendent and Jerry McHugh.

469
01:33:46,250 --> 01:34:08,378
[SPEAKER_07]: but I know I've been having ongoing, we have been engaging in ongoing conversations all year with Mr. McHugh around this and both Mr. McHugh and I have had meetings with the company to see what we could do, but I can get that definite answer from you once I speak to Mr. McHugh.

470
01:34:09,098 --> 01:34:14,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it would just be helpful when we meet next about the budget, either to say,

471
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:40,186
[SPEAKER_10]: that it is included in the it is contemplated in the numbers that we're going to look at that we're looking at at that time or it's not and if it is like what are we saying we're changing so just if we could clarify that when we whenever we talk about the budget whether this is being reflected in or not that's i think that's my major question yeah we do that point point of clarification is that

472
01:34:42,023 --> 01:34:54,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McHugh has already spoken about, and one of the slides clearly showed that we're under, the budget for this need, it does not reflect, they're not balanced.

473
01:34:54,849 --> 01:35:03,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only thing I wanna check with him is if it's part of the April 23rd meeting, or if it's part of the May 8th meeting.

474
01:35:04,053 --> 01:35:05,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'll clarify with him.

475
01:35:05,394 --> 01:35:08,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and then I think the other thing is if we are,

476
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:17,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the other point of this, um, report was to say, should we be adjusting our, our rate schedule at all?

477
01:35:18,018 --> 01:35:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes or no.

478
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:22,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think the other question for the budget reports is.

479
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:29,720
[SPEAKER_10]: What at what rate is he projecting when he is making his calculations?

480
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:36,681
[SPEAKER_10]: So is it at our current rate or is it at some other rate that we're going to go forward with or that you're recommending we go forward with?

481
01:35:39,904 --> 01:35:46,187
[SPEAKER_07]: we're, I mean, I don't want to quote an amount, but we're definitely recommending an increase in the rate.

482
01:35:46,948 --> 01:35:47,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

483
01:35:47,268 --> 01:35:47,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

484
01:35:47,428 --> 01:35:55,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just whenever we're talking about the budget, if we could just be clear about like what rate we are anchoring to from a sub pay perspective.

485
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:58,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So just so that we understand where we're at.

486
01:35:59,454 --> 01:35:59,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

487
01:36:00,495 --> 01:36:00,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

488
01:36:00,895 --> 01:36:01,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

489
01:36:02,696 --> 01:36:05,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, member of the party, the member.

490
01:36:06,098 --> 01:36:06,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Ryan felt.

491
01:36:08,587 --> 01:36:10,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you so much for this.

492
01:36:10,468 --> 01:36:13,610
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of questions on the way way end of the of the presentation.

493
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:29,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it comes to the feasibility of working with like ESS or like swing education, for example, is there a timeline that they would require us to, you know, put forth our want to work with them in partnership so that we have an idea about if we want to implement that, let's say, for the beginning of next year?

494
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a timeline on that?

495
01:36:30,461 --> 01:36:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't really started the conversation.

496
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,039
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have started that conversation.

497
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:36,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And to date, there is not a timeline.

498
01:36:37,621 --> 01:36:42,823
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that they're clear about is that they can't build a pool overnight.

499
01:36:43,163 --> 01:36:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they spoke a lot about the recruitment strategies that they would utilize to increase our existing substitute pool.

500
01:36:50,647 --> 01:37:01,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're just careful to say whenever they, let's say potentially we were to utilize them, whenever we engage in that partnership, it will take,

501
01:37:02,403 --> 01:37:07,987
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to their end, couple weeks, couple months to build an adequate sub pool for the district.

502
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:09,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

503
01:37:09,588 --> 01:37:17,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it comes to the cost, does that fluctuate depending on how much we're, you know, sourcing out for their, for their aid for us?

504
01:37:17,474 --> 01:37:23,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that just a flat kind of fee, um, because we're in partnership with them or was that again, part of the conversation with them in general?

505
01:37:24,759 --> 01:37:31,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no, some of that is part of the conversation, but I mean, they will use our existing rates that we have set.

506
01:37:33,024 --> 01:37:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they were clear that they'd like to see an increase in those rates, but they will use the current rates that are already set.

507
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:53,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they take on for a temporary time, kind of full ownership of the staff, which means they'll do like the training and the onboarding, they'll do the organizing of staff.

508
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:56,881
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll deal with that for the first couple months of employment.

509
01:37:57,362 --> 01:38:00,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there is, they take a percentage of

510
01:38:04,388 --> 01:38:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: the fee, the pay.

511
01:38:08,054 --> 01:38:08,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

512
01:38:09,336 --> 01:38:09,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

513
01:38:11,981 --> 01:38:12,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld?

514
01:38:13,578 --> 01:38:15,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, thank you, Dr. Galussi.

515
01:38:15,919 --> 01:38:29,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of clarification questions, which is to note, so the table of substitute coverage, this school year, these numbers are over eight months, whereas the previous year is over 10 months, right?

516
01:38:29,786 --> 01:38:30,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

517
01:38:30,726 --> 01:38:31,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, okay.

518
01:38:31,987 --> 01:38:33,708
[SPEAKER_11]: But the number is still higher.

519
01:38:33,728 --> 01:38:36,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Was school year 2022-23 particularly high in absence, or are we...

520
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:44,285
[SPEAKER_11]: or was this year particularly low?

521
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:48,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Without more context on either side, I can't quite tell.

522
01:38:49,689 --> 01:38:50,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will be honest.

523
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:54,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did not go and do a deep dive into pre-pandemic numbers.

524
01:38:55,753 --> 01:38:56,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could do that.

525
01:38:56,934 --> 01:39:10,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I do think that the absences and the need for absences has definitely been decreasing as we're kind of going

526
01:39:12,043 --> 01:39:16,387
[SPEAKER_07]: month by month, year by year out of the COVID pandemic.

527
01:39:16,647 --> 01:39:24,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, but also the need for leaves of absence fluctuates so much, which you can also see in that chart.

528
01:39:25,135 --> 01:39:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a definite factor in terms of some of them might've been entire years of a leave of absence, right?

529
01:39:33,383 --> 01:39:35,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and some of them may have been short-term.

530
01:39:36,817 --> 01:39:42,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get some more data for you if you would like a comparison to pre-pandemic.

531
01:39:43,805 --> 01:39:49,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how we can project ahead as to what the need is going to be and what's typical here.

532
01:39:49,091 --> 01:39:55,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Are things actively going down because the needs are changing?

533
01:39:57,096 --> 01:39:57,396
[SPEAKER_11]: or not?

534
01:39:57,656 --> 01:39:58,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there may be.

535
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:01,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think there may be a lot of reasons at play.

536
01:40:01,197 --> 01:40:06,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be curious to kind of watch the trajectory from year to year.

537
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:09,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But.

538
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:19,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, so and then one little question, do long term subs attend planning periods and team school grade level planning?

539
01:40:19,684 --> 01:40:22,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that part of the long term sub responsibility?

540
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:25,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, for during the day.

541
01:40:25,576 --> 01:40:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to get back to you.

542
01:40:28,518 --> 01:40:32,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some attend staff meetings and training sessions, while not all do.

543
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,181
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

544
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But common planning time during the day with teams, yes.

545
01:40:39,024 --> 01:40:39,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to know.

546
01:40:40,565 --> 01:40:48,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then I just wanted to confirm, I think you introduced some information that may have shifted my numbers, but it looks

547
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:59,762
[SPEAKER_11]: we're spending 50 to 60% of the spending on substitutes is in-house, but in-house folks are covering about 86% of the need here.

548
01:41:00,182 --> 01:41:06,504
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we are shifting away from in-house coverage, we're going to see that percentage change.

549
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:11,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I do want to say, especially noting that there are a lot of teachers here, thank you for this coverage.

550
01:41:11,126 --> 01:41:12,667
[SPEAKER_11]: It is much appreciated.

551
01:41:12,687 --> 01:41:12,667
100%.

552
01:41:12,707 --> 01:41:18,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's, especially at the elementary level,

553
01:41:21,317 --> 01:41:23,479
[SPEAKER_07]: At the elementary level, it's at the expense of.

554
01:41:24,499 --> 01:41:30,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we do have to look at the amount of money that we are spending on coverages and loss of PrEP.

555
01:41:33,845 --> 01:41:49,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be difficult at the beginning, but we're talking salaries or increases in that substitute pay, because especially at the elementary level, they get one PrEP a day and it's not guaranteed because

556
01:41:50,524 --> 01:42:02,393
[SPEAKER_07]: if the art teacher is out, if the music teacher is out, they lose their one and only planning period for the day, as well as, as I mentioned, support staff being pulled.

557
01:42:02,853 --> 01:42:10,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that means we're affecting students and their services, and that's not equitable, and that's not okay.

558
01:42:10,278 --> 01:42:14,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have to do something to increase that.

559
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:20,539
[SPEAKER_07]: because right now we also don't have an active sub-pool that meets the daily demand.

560
01:42:20,559 --> 01:42:22,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

561
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:30,864
[SPEAKER_11]: So I definitely want to second what Member Branley said about understanding where the, what coverage, where the services are being sacrificed in these situations.

562
01:42:33,573 --> 01:42:33,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

563
01:42:34,513 --> 01:42:40,114
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also wanted to ask, you mentioned a few of the things that the staffing company would do in terms of onboarding.

564
01:42:41,474 --> 01:42:43,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I always have this question when we bring in consultants.

565
01:42:43,795 --> 01:42:51,756
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the added value of paying a staffing company to do this work versus things that we've thought of in-house, such as just raising the rates of pay?

566
01:42:51,816 --> 01:42:53,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we bringing?

567
01:42:53,677 --> 01:42:58,378
[SPEAKER_11]: What else would the company add that would make that better?

568
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:00,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

569
01:43:01,457 --> 01:43:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we currently don't have a position that I would say, don't quote me on this title, but I would just say like attendance coordinator.

570
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:22,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just say we don't have someone right now that works on recruitment and that actually organizes daily coverage needs.

571
01:43:22,942 --> 01:43:30,724
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way it works right now is we have an online portal called Frontline, and teachers, when they need to be absent,

572
01:43:31,957 --> 01:43:36,600
[SPEAKER_07]: they go in digitally and they record their absence in that system.

573
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:54,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Our current pool of substitutes are also connected within this system and they can go in, they log in, they can see all of the coverages that are needed within the district and they select the ones that they want to take as work for the following day or that morning.

574
01:43:56,852 --> 01:44:00,655
[SPEAKER_07]: But there isn't someone that's maybe actively making phone calls.

575
01:44:01,724 --> 01:44:07,487
[SPEAKER_07]: and trying to connect substitutes to the coverages that are needed.

576
01:44:07,687 --> 01:44:09,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just relying on the online portal.

577
01:44:09,848 --> 01:44:14,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

578
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:15,251
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes sense, yes.

579
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:25,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to understand where that money is gonna go to hire someone outside versus to the people doing the substituting, doing the coverages.

580
01:44:31,988 --> 01:44:32,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

581
01:44:33,029 --> 01:44:34,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi.

582
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:35,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

583
01:44:35,171 --> 01:44:38,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further questions?

584
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:44,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you need a vote to go to Malden's rates or are you gonna come back to us at the next meeting once we have more of the budget figured out?

585
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:53,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll come back to you with what finance and the superintendent is recommending.

586
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:54,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

587
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:55,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

588
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:58,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, we have new business.

589
01:44:58,385 --> 01:45:06,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We have offered by member and Tapa recognition of Autism Acceptance Month, whereas Autism Acceptance Month is recognized in the month of April.

590
01:45:06,811 --> 01:45:26,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And whereas Autism Acceptance Day is recognized on the 2nd of April, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools and Medford School Committee recognize Autism Acceptance Month within the Medford Public School System, recognize for future usage Autism Acceptance Day as April 2nd on all official Medford Public School calendars distributed

591
01:45:26,564 --> 01:45:44,252
[SPEAKER_13]: to the public and report to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students impacted by autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and how we go about identifying students who may need these services that have yet to receive them.

592
01:45:46,093 --> 01:45:50,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Explanation, those within the advocates of the autism spectrum,

593
01:45:51,169 --> 01:45:56,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Community are looking to distance themselves from groups that treat autism as a disease and something that needs to be healed.

594
01:45:57,152 --> 01:46:16,941
[SPEAKER_13]: The focus is not on awareness of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, but more of a focus on acceptance of the members of our community that fall under the autism spectrum and making sure there are equitable systemic pathways for their success, being conscious of decisions that may impact members of the ASD community, both systematically and socially.

595
01:46:16,961 --> 01:46:19,802
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the first step in this process to better understand

596
01:46:20,302 --> 01:46:24,365
[SPEAKER_13]: and see how we as a city can better serve our community members impacted by ASD.

597
01:46:24,885 --> 01:46:29,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll turn it over to you Member Ntapa for a motion or anything else you'd like to add.

598
01:46:30,369 --> 01:46:33,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much Chair Lungo-Koehn.

599
01:46:36,392 --> 01:46:48,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I just wanted to put this motion forward to sort of recognize and also I guess more amend our current calendar so I know we have we take a vote in November to put forward days of observance.

600
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:49,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to clarify

601
01:46:50,185 --> 01:46:53,107
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a day off holiday I'm looking to put forward.

602
01:46:53,147 --> 01:46:55,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It is more of a day of observance, day of acknowledgement.

603
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:03,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently as it stands, the last calendar I had checked, it is referred to as Autism Awareness Day, Autism Awareness Month.

604
01:47:04,636 --> 01:47:12,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And this motion looks to amend that and to change that language, whether it has to get tabled till November or if we can do it right now, which would be preferable.

605
01:47:13,943 --> 01:47:18,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's where it's already labeled and where it needs to be changed.

606
01:47:20,663 --> 01:47:41,689
[SPEAKER_08]: The third part of the motion, the clarification about identifying students is how we're looking at how we are screening, screening techniques, as well as looking at ways that parents can come to us as a district to look at receiving services, however, they may need it.

607
01:47:42,592 --> 01:47:45,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I would like in writing and to sort of get a report on.

608
01:47:45,774 --> 01:48:06,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a personal, this comes from a, and the explanation kind of talks about it, of looking at how we make change and how we are impacted as a former student in the Medford Public Schools with an IEP who belongs in the neurodivergent community on the spectrum of the attention deficit disorder spectrum.

609
01:48:07,623 --> 01:48:08,924
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I witnessed.

610
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:19,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I witnessed students who had 504s and IEPs, their struggles, how some of them would lose them because they were doing better, which to me makes no sense.

611
01:48:20,322 --> 01:48:23,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you're doing better on a plan, you're doing better because of the plan.

612
01:48:24,022 --> 01:48:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps you.

613
01:48:26,163 --> 01:48:28,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm really looking to see what we are doing.

614
01:48:29,284 --> 01:48:32,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is sort of the 1st kind of steps and looking at how we as a community.

615
01:48:35,222 --> 01:48:37,783
[SPEAKER_08]: can become allies within the autistic community.

616
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:44,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make another point of, um, the use of disorder, um, uh, is not so popular.

617
01:48:44,906 --> 01:48:47,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And my apologies for using the official language.

618
01:48:47,867 --> 01:48:57,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but also, um, you know, this really, really comes from, um, my personal experience working with those, um, within the autistic community.

619
01:48:57,611 --> 01:49:03,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, as my buddy Dan puts it best, it's pretty easy for me to make you aware that I have autism and that usually proceeds to do it.

620
01:49:04,868 --> 01:49:07,430
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really hard for members of the community to accept me.

621
01:49:09,051 --> 01:49:12,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to mitigate that harm.

622
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking at a higher education level.

623
01:49:14,934 --> 01:49:20,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Mitigate the harmful effects that this has on our students before they even get there.

624
01:49:20,998 --> 01:49:32,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And as someone who's been looked at funny and scrutinized because of my diagnosis, this is my way of putting steps forward for better allyship.

625
01:49:32,994 --> 01:49:34,735
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also want to look at the success.

626
01:49:34,895 --> 01:49:39,577
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to look more at the success, not so much as a disease needs to be healed, as mentioned in the motion.

627
01:49:41,718 --> 01:49:47,481
[SPEAKER_08]: But I feel like we can't do that until we look at how we are helping and how we are aiding the community.

628
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:51,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is all I have on the motion.

629
01:49:52,483 --> 01:49:53,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Member Ntapa.

630
01:49:53,483 --> 01:49:56,005
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to assume you're moving approval.

631
01:49:56,105 --> 01:49:56,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

632
01:50:04,605 --> 01:50:05,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I can second.

633
01:50:05,826 --> 01:50:07,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I second by member Branley.

634
01:50:08,087 --> 01:50:08,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

635
01:50:09,428 --> 01:50:31,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I guess as I was just listening to the description, on bullet number three, I completely agree with autism acceptance month, but where it's saying how students are identified, like there is a process that has to be followed legally.

636
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not sure,

637
01:50:35,906 --> 01:50:50,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I need clarification or I'm not sure on the ask of saying do you want something that we legally have to do as a district to switch the way in

638
01:50:52,065 --> 01:51:04,212
[SPEAKER_01]: either changing the wording or I guess I'm just not clear about point number three, because there are things that we have to follow legally by DESE, when IEPs are being developed.

639
01:51:05,053 --> 01:51:10,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree students should not be treated as if they need to be healed.

640
01:51:10,936 --> 01:51:18,279
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wasn't sure about what was being approved when it says how we go about identifying students.

641
01:51:18,299 --> 01:51:20,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's medical documentation.

642
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:24,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical community sends recommendations.

643
01:51:24,522 --> 01:51:28,484
[SPEAKER_01]: There's official IEP testing that takes place.

644
01:51:29,345 --> 01:51:31,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to be clear on

645
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:48,853
[SPEAKER_01]: what the ask is because I don't want the committee to be saying yes, they approve it and putting the school in a position where we are not following the appropriate regulations that we should be following.

646
01:51:52,955 --> 01:51:54,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Understood, Dr. Vincent.

647
01:51:54,676 --> 01:52:02,781
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe some clarification for member and topper, or would you like to amend section three of your resolution?

648
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:07,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think, thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent for bringing to your concerns.

649
01:52:08,565 --> 01:52:13,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what I'm just looking to see is what are the procedures we have to follow?

650
01:52:15,409 --> 01:52:19,031
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really, I'm sorry if the phrasing is, this is my first motion.

651
01:52:19,912 --> 01:52:21,353
[SPEAKER_08]: My apologies if the phrasing is weird.

652
01:52:22,947 --> 01:52:25,669
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I'm looking to see what protocols are from DESE.

653
01:52:26,709 --> 01:52:34,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so you're looking for information rather than us providing services to people that need them, even if they haven't been identified.

654
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:35,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, I'm looking, yeah.

655
01:52:36,114 --> 01:52:45,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're looking to change that report to the school committee on steps being taken to provide supports for those impacted by autism spectrum disorder?

656
01:52:47,021 --> 01:52:47,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, yeah.

657
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:49,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, as an amendment?

658
01:52:49,742 --> 01:52:51,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be good as an amendment.

659
01:52:51,704 --> 01:53:03,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say a better method would be reports to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students on the autism spectrum, due to just recommendations from the community on language surrounding how we address it.

660
01:53:05,617 --> 01:53:09,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so then just strike the second half of that, number three.

661
01:53:10,121 --> 01:53:10,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

662
01:53:10,421 --> 01:53:11,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, yep.

663
01:53:11,582 --> 01:53:17,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And for approval by member Ntapa, as amended by member Ntapa, seconded by member Branley, roll call, please.

664
01:53:18,464 --> 01:53:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: have a motion to amend the calendar.

665
01:53:19,484 --> 01:53:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I may.

666
01:53:19,925 --> 01:53:22,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah Member Reinfeld had their hand up.

667
01:53:22,226 --> 01:53:22,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, okay.

668
01:53:23,146 --> 01:53:23,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld.

669
01:53:24,827 --> 01:53:26,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I just in regards to point number two.

670
01:53:26,667 --> 01:53:28,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Our policy.

671
01:53:28,328 --> 01:53:36,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I see I see a, uh, lists this as although as awareness day, so I think that's a pretty easy motion to amend that policy.

672
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:43,134
[SPEAKER_11]: The question of putting it on calendars is a little different because we have the public calendar that is the closures and then there was a

673
01:53:48,796 --> 01:53:52,420
[SPEAKER_11]: that we recognize Awareness Acceptance Advocacy Month.

674
01:53:52,520 --> 01:54:01,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm wondering if that is part of, in terms of distribution to the public, is part of the longer conversation about the calendar and how it's published.

675
01:54:02,608 --> 01:54:07,393
[SPEAKER_11]: But absolutely, I think we should amend the policy as it currently exists, that line there.

676
01:54:08,861 --> 01:54:24,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my question on number three, I wondered if it would make sense, although possibly not with the suggestion just approved, for the subcommittee to sit down with CPAC, the Medford Family Network's autism

677
01:54:25,459 --> 01:54:43,091
[SPEAKER_11]: spectrum parent support group and then the conversation around procedural safeguards and FERPA and all of those screening things and then prepare something that the full committee might be able to approve with a concrete step for the administration.

678
01:54:43,111 --> 01:54:51,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that information gathering might be well suited for subcommittee with members of the community.

679
01:54:55,330 --> 01:54:55,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor.

680
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:57,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

681
01:54:58,691 --> 01:55:08,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I add to that suggestion that this go to the Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee for that review?

682
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:15,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

683
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:17,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Topper, is that okay?

684
01:55:18,559 --> 01:55:19,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

685
01:55:20,099 --> 01:55:24,101
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be great to have that conversation with CPAC as well as bring that to the subcommittee.

686
01:55:25,702 --> 01:55:34,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And also to answer, sorry, to answer the question at hand of the school's calendars to reach the public.

687
01:55:34,866 --> 01:55:41,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it would amend it to where it is already written to where that to where days of observance are listed.

688
01:55:42,289 --> 01:55:48,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it has also been brought point of singling out 1 holiday is a concern, which I fully understand.

689
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:50,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So, wherever this would naturally be.

690
01:55:52,153 --> 01:55:55,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Written is where we would like to see it amended.

691
01:55:57,068 --> 01:56:01,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, all recommendations of amendment are taken into consideration for the motion.

692
01:56:05,094 --> 01:56:08,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, motion to move to committee as amended.

693
01:56:08,676 --> 01:56:09,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call, please.

694
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:13,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Moranly.

695
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

696
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:16,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

697
01:56:17,442 --> 01:56:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

698
01:56:19,183 --> 01:56:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ntapa.

699
01:56:20,984 --> 01:56:21,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

700
01:56:22,565 --> 01:56:23,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade.

701
01:56:23,646 --> 01:56:24,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

702
01:56:24,547 --> 01:56:25,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

703
01:56:26,048 --> 01:56:26,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

704
01:56:27,557 --> 01:56:28,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau.

705
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:36,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we lost Paul for a minute, so he should be back.

706
01:56:36,783 --> 01:56:37,803
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just mark him absent.

707
01:56:40,565 --> 01:56:41,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

708
01:56:42,526 --> 01:56:45,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, motion's approved.

709
01:56:45,508 --> 01:56:48,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Member, Vice Chair Graham is going to read the resolution.

710
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:48,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

711
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:49,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

712
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:54,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And Member Ruseau is online and just can't seem to respond.

713
01:56:56,175 --> 01:57:01,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing, if you could try to address that while we talk about the next resolution.

714
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:11,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so item number 2024-18 offered by me, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee will adopt the following revised subcommittee structure for this term.

715
01:57:13,407 --> 01:57:25,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is basically to recognize that we have a relatively new member of the committee, member Ntapa has taken his seat after the resignation of member McLaughlin.

716
01:57:26,896 --> 01:57:30,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had previously established subcommittees for the term.

717
01:57:30,559 --> 01:57:45,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I went through, I did trade some information with Member Ntapa and also went back to all of the information I had about the formation of the subcommittees at the beginning of the term.

718
01:57:45,549 --> 01:57:54,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm putting forward a recommendation on how the subcommittees will look going forward for the committee's consideration.

719
01:57:55,692 --> 01:58:04,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and just so you know, I didn't just simply assume that member and Tapa was, um, interested in the same things that member McLaughlin was, although there was like a shocking amount of overlap.

720
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:05,337
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was nice.

721
01:58:05,977 --> 01:58:07,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but there were other sort of.

722
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:19,844
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there are other sort of things that were happening, um, in terms of people's requests, um, the first time around that we were able to sort of shuffle around in this, um, uh, in this revised, um, subcommittee structure.

723
01:58:19,924 --> 01:58:20,104
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

724
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:22,455
[SPEAKER_10]: It is in your agenda.

725
01:58:22,835 --> 01:58:47,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It includes the behavioral health and special education subcommittee, buildings and grounds, curriculum, instruction, assessment, and accountability, diversity, equity, and inclusion, family engagement and communication, rules and policy, strategic and capital planning, superintendent evaluation, and last but not least, and we'll talk about this in just a little bit, the ad hoc committee handbook and evaluation process.

726
01:58:48,552 --> 01:58:49,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there,

727
01:58:49,761 --> 01:58:52,042
[SPEAKER_10]: are there any questions or any motions on the floor?

728
01:58:54,103 --> 01:58:54,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

729
01:58:56,184 --> 01:58:57,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion approved by Member Rousseau.

730
01:58:59,266 --> 01:58:59,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded.

731
01:58:59,606 --> 01:59:02,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Mayor Longo-Kern.

732
01:59:03,908 --> 01:59:05,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Branley, Member Branley?

733
01:59:06,149 --> 01:59:07,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just ask a question?

734
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:13,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be helpful if people, you know, the participants on the meeting know who's on what committee?

735
01:59:15,474 --> 01:59:16,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, I'm happy to read them.

736
01:59:18,531 --> 01:59:21,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So the behavioral health.

737
01:59:22,134 --> 01:59:22,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

738
01:59:23,015 --> 01:59:26,758
[SPEAKER_11]: You could potentially share the agenda on screen and not read it all.

739
01:59:27,858 --> 01:59:32,022
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a great idea, but one second.

740
01:59:33,683 --> 01:59:34,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, thank you.

741
01:59:35,644 --> 01:59:38,386
[SPEAKER_10]: While that happens, I will, um, let people know who the chairs are.

742
01:59:38,406 --> 01:59:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, behavioral health and special education chaired by member Rousseau buildings and grounds chaired by member Bramley curriculum, instruction, assessment, and accountability by member Reinfeld.

743
01:59:49,102 --> 01:59:53,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Diversity, equity, inclusion by member of a pot a family engagement and communication by myself.

744
01:59:53,743 --> 01:59:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Rules and policy by member.

745
01:59:55,123 --> 01:59:57,684
[SPEAKER_10]: So, strategic and capital planning by myself.

746
01:59:59,104 --> 02:00:04,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent evaluation by member of a pot a, and then the ad hoc committee handbook evaluation process by members.

747
02:00:06,166 --> 02:00:09,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to pull it up?

748
02:00:09,966 --> 02:00:10,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

749
02:00:10,707 --> 02:00:11,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

750
02:00:11,087 --> 02:00:12,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting it now.

751
02:00:15,217 --> 02:00:17,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so we did have a motion on the floor by members.

752
02:00:17,518 --> 02:00:21,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I believe a second by member Reinfeld.

753
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:22,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

754
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:23,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

755
02:00:25,682 --> 02:00:29,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll just make sure that everyone can see this before we call the role.

756
02:00:32,084 --> 02:00:32,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

757
02:00:41,869 --> 02:00:42,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

758
02:00:46,684 --> 02:00:47,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

759
02:00:47,725 --> 02:00:49,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

760
02:00:49,846 --> 02:00:51,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Lopate, can you call the roll, please?

761
02:00:55,889 --> 02:00:56,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Moranle.

762
02:00:57,790 --> 02:00:58,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

763
02:00:59,731 --> 02:01:00,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

764
02:01:00,931 --> 02:01:01,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

765
02:01:02,432 --> 02:01:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ntapa.

766
02:01:05,053 --> 02:01:05,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

767
02:01:06,354 --> 02:01:07,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Lopate, yes.

768
02:01:08,435 --> 02:01:09,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld.

769
02:01:09,576 --> 02:01:09,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

770
02:01:11,177 --> 02:01:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

771
02:01:12,697 --> 02:01:12,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

772
02:01:14,939 --> 02:01:15,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Langel-Kern.

773
02:01:16,351 --> 02:01:16,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

774
02:01:17,912 --> 02:01:20,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

775
02:01:21,234 --> 02:01:26,798
[SPEAKER_10]: These subcommittees will be updated on the Medford Public Schools website now that we have taken this vote.

776
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:30,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can look for that information there in the coming weeks.

777
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:40,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Once updated, all of our information is on the website anyway, but you'll be able to see the subcommittees there as well.

778
02:01:40,847 --> 02:01:45,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Item 2024-19, also offered by myself, which is a recommendation to appoint the School Building Committee

779
02:01:46,172 --> 02:01:51,556
[SPEAKER_10]: provide an update about the Medford High School Building Committee.

780
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:56,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dr. Cushing, I have some slides that I would love to be able to share.

781
02:01:56,160 --> 02:01:58,842
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can allow me to do that.

782
02:02:01,665 --> 02:02:02,585
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be good to go.

783
02:02:03,226 --> 02:02:03,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

784
02:02:05,768 --> 02:02:09,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I wanted to do tonight was two things.

785
02:02:09,751 --> 02:02:12,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know if you can see my screen.

786
02:02:13,614 --> 02:02:14,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you see that?

787
02:02:16,348 --> 02:02:19,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

788
02:02:19,210 --> 02:02:21,192
[SPEAKER_10]: What I did want to do tonight was a couple of things.

789
02:02:21,212 --> 02:02:42,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to provide the committee an update on where we are and also the community, because I know there's a lot of interest in this process to form a committee to lead forward on our bid for a re-envisioned Medford High School.

790
02:02:42,108 --> 02:02:45,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought I would provide a presentation.

791
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:49,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Given pieces of this presentation to various.

792
02:02:50,783 --> 02:02:55,066
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, internal groups, um, over the course of the last couple of weeks, um, when people have asked.

793
02:02:55,106 --> 02:03:00,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've just been trying to start to pull together something that, um, we can use as we're talking to people about what we're doing.

794
02:03:00,609 --> 02:03:00,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

795
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:05,673
[SPEAKER_10]: As you may recall, um, we are required to create a building committee.

796
02:03:06,033 --> 02:03:17,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and there's a particular set of folks who are required to be on the committee earlier that, um, earlier this year in February, we passed a resolution that appointed me the chair of the committee.

797
02:03:18,281 --> 02:03:22,323
[SPEAKER_10]: identify the people who would be on the committee and put out a call for application.

798
02:03:22,363 --> 02:03:24,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll get to that in good time.

799
02:03:26,406 --> 02:03:31,890
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other thing we did during that meeting was talk about what were our goals for the committee.

800
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:38,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's worth restating as soon as I can clear some alerts out of my way here.

801
02:03:38,534 --> 02:03:39,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

802
02:03:40,395 --> 02:03:43,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing

803
02:03:44,562 --> 02:04:02,428
[SPEAKER_10]: on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational, nine to 12 education, nine to 12 athletics, Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools Programming, Early Childhood Education, including but not limited to Medford Early Education Program, which is NEAP and Kids Corner, as well as our transition program.

804
02:04:03,388 --> 02:04:12,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Item number two was to consider whether placement of the Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford High Campus would provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students.

805
02:04:13,092 --> 02:04:14,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Item number three,

806
02:04:14,617 --> 02:04:24,146
[SPEAKER_10]: is to ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback at appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the school committee.

807
02:04:24,987 --> 02:04:31,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Number four, listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for students in Medford.

808
02:04:32,974 --> 02:04:38,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Item number five, create plans for a building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves

809
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:46,114
[SPEAKER_10]: any CHPS and LEED version five certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets.

810
02:04:47,275 --> 02:04:55,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the quote new building as quickly as is feasible.

811
02:04:57,102 --> 02:04:58,123
[SPEAKER_10]: So where are we?

812
02:04:59,644 --> 02:05:07,169
[SPEAKER_10]: The process of going through and building with MSBA is actually a five to seven year process.

813
02:05:08,378 --> 02:05:12,220
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a very defined set of steps that we have to strictly adhere to.

814
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,121
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the graphic you see on the right.

815
02:05:15,041 --> 02:05:23,546
[SPEAKER_10]: And at each step, you have to consider that there's a gate that gives us an invitation to the next step in the process.

816
02:05:24,386 --> 02:05:34,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to sort of go through whatever and meet the requirements that MSBA lays out for each phase in the process in order to be invited to the next phase.

817
02:05:35,703 --> 02:05:39,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so we are some way, some ways away from shovels in the ground.

818
02:05:39,165 --> 02:05:46,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but the one thing I wanted to make sure people are aware of is, um, we are, we are here where the star is.

819
02:05:47,289 --> 02:05:53,171
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, and that, that is to say that we are out, we are not even in the process just yet.

820
02:05:53,251 --> 02:05:56,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So our eligibility period starts on May 1st.

821
02:05:57,054 --> 02:05:59,995
[SPEAKER_10]: That is when our clock starts ticking for eligibility.

822
02:06:00,615 --> 02:06:03,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll talk a little bit about what happens in the eligibility phase in just a second.

823
02:06:03,795 --> 02:06:07,036
[SPEAKER_10]: But MSBA sort of staggers the start times.

824
02:06:07,116 --> 02:06:12,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that is important on their side in terms of getting brand new projects up and running.

825
02:06:12,937 --> 02:06:14,838
[SPEAKER_10]: That is very labor intensive.

826
02:06:15,238 --> 02:06:21,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some staggering that happens in terms of those invitations going out and when they actually begin.

827
02:06:21,819 --> 02:06:23,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So our start date is May 1st.

828
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are still ahead of that start date.

829
02:06:27,575 --> 02:06:34,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, eligibility period starting on May 1st, um, has to be conclude concluded within 270 days.

830
02:06:35,437 --> 02:06:45,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a whole series of things that are required, um, for us to deliver in order to be considered as like compliance with our eligibility period deliverables.

831
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:55,403
[SPEAKER_10]: This phase of the project is really the phase where the district has to describe what it does in the building and what it plans to do in a new building.

832
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where we talk about how big is our population?

833
02:06:59,372 --> 02:07:00,712
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the growth of the city?

834
02:07:01,213 --> 02:07:06,795
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where all of that sort of city-side, school-side planning happens.

835
02:07:07,696 --> 02:07:13,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And then from here, we start to engage with the construction professionals.

836
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:19,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we can bring on an owner's project manager, and then we can bring on the designers to do the feasibility study, and on and on and on.

837
02:07:20,302 --> 02:07:24,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But until we finish this eligibility phase, none of those things can begin.

838
02:07:26,483 --> 02:07:32,685
[SPEAKER_10]: What you may also remember is that back in February, we asked the administration to get started.

839
02:07:33,406 --> 02:07:42,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a tremendous amount of work that has to happen in the eligibility phase that uniquely the administration really has to do the work.

840
02:07:43,569 --> 02:07:54,573
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's things like counting math classrooms and describing any changes to the educational process that they're envisioning.

841
02:07:55,011 --> 02:07:58,312
[SPEAKER_10]: that would have an impact on space considerations, for example.

842
02:07:59,332 --> 02:08:03,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So this phase, we have asked the administration to get started and they have.

843
02:08:04,174 --> 02:08:07,315
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been working very diligently really since February.

844
02:08:08,616 --> 02:08:13,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I just want to give you a quick rundown of what's happening for each of these five deliverables in the eligibility phase.

845
02:08:13,317 --> 02:08:16,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So the initial compliance certification, it's basically a legal agreement.

846
02:08:17,819 --> 02:08:18,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Our attorney has reviewed it.

847
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:19,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I've reviewed it.

848
02:08:19,639 --> 02:08:20,360
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all reviewed it.

849
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:21,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We're ready to sign it.

850
02:08:22,155 --> 02:08:26,979
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as MSBA sends it to us, which will happen in a few weeks, we're ready to sign it.

851
02:08:27,019 --> 02:08:28,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have been since December.

852
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:31,082
[SPEAKER_10]: So check one of five off the list.

853
02:08:32,203 --> 02:08:35,025
[SPEAKER_10]: The second thing is to form the school building committee.

854
02:08:35,506 --> 02:08:37,127
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually will do this tonight.

855
02:08:37,227 --> 02:08:41,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So the school committee has to establish a committee that oversees the project.

856
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:49,416
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some requirements about who must be on the committee, but the vast majority of how we form that committee is entirely up to this group.

857
02:08:50,217 --> 02:08:51,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And much of this was laid out

858
02:08:52,456 --> 02:08:57,938
[SPEAKER_10]: um, resolution that put out the calls for applications, um, back in February.

859
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:01,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, item number three, their educational profile.

860
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:04,161
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three, there's two parts of this for us.

861
02:09:04,621 --> 02:09:05,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the first is.

862
02:09:06,402 --> 02:09:08,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The, the true educational profile.

863
02:09:08,183 --> 02:09:13,885
[SPEAKER_10]: So it talks about like, what do we do in our building today and how do we envision it will happen in the new building?

864
02:09:14,875 --> 02:09:22,957
[SPEAKER_10]: And for us, this includes much, much more than just what happens in the nine to 12 space, because there's so much more that happens in our building.

865
02:09:23,957 --> 02:09:43,302
[SPEAKER_10]: MSBA has asked us and has authorized us because our statement of interest outlined that this building is more than just a high school, that we consider and think about things like our pre-K programs, the Medford Family Network, and then, you know, again, possible integration of Curtis Tufts in some capacity.

866
02:09:44,208 --> 02:09:44,969
[SPEAKER_10]: on to the campus.

867
02:09:45,969 --> 02:09:47,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a quick status for you all.

868
02:09:48,170 --> 02:09:49,891
[SPEAKER_10]: The drafting of this is in progress.

869
02:09:50,612 --> 02:10:01,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Our current state questions, so all the questions about what happens today and how many classrooms exist and how many spaces, all of that is completed and it's in review by the administration.

870
02:10:01,918 --> 02:10:05,660
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be in good shape for the building committee when they are ready for it.

871
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,701
[SPEAKER_10]: The future state questions,

872
02:10:08,597 --> 02:10:10,498
[SPEAKER_10]: are also sort of in process.

873
02:10:10,959 --> 02:10:15,061
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of discussion happening there and that discussion is continuing.

874
02:10:16,022 --> 02:10:26,408
[SPEAKER_10]: We do anticipate that some of those discussions really are sort of beyond the purview of the building committee, but really more about the educational work happening in the building.

875
02:10:26,468 --> 02:10:34,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And so those things will come before the school committee in various forms for consideration in the coming weeks and months.

876
02:10:34,193 --> 02:10:37,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would anticipate some of those reports coming forward between now and the end of the school year.

877
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:44,242
[SPEAKER_10]: The other piece of the educational profile for us is our chapter 74 viability.

878
02:10:44,282 --> 02:10:46,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So that handles all of our vocational programs.

879
02:10:48,544 --> 02:11:01,470
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a separate set of deliverables required for each of our programs, which includes talking about our demand and our capacity and any plans we have for changes.

880
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:04,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So those changes could include things like

881
02:11:05,682 --> 02:11:14,745
[SPEAKER_10]: creating additional capacity for shops that are oversubscribed or where there's a huge wait list that we deal with on an annual basis.

882
02:11:15,345 --> 02:11:27,909
[SPEAKER_10]: It could also include our ability to say there's a shop and a vocational program that we don't have today because we lack the space to do so, but it fits in our strategic priorities.

883
02:11:28,329 --> 02:11:33,011
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the options there from a chapter 74 perspective to think about

884
02:11:33,769 --> 02:11:36,211
[SPEAKER_10]: growth of our growing vocational program.

885
02:11:37,112 --> 02:11:46,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is, I think, another place where you'll see some information come forward to you from the administration as they think about what those programs are.

886
02:11:46,879 --> 02:11:56,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And the MSVA has lots of rules and regulations around what they will consider to be a program that they will expand for.

887
02:11:56,266 --> 02:12:01,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, if we came forward and we said that we wanted to pursue

888
02:12:04,143 --> 02:12:10,306
[SPEAKER_10]: a new chapter 74 program, they would ask us to substantiate the demand here in Medford.

889
02:12:10,646 --> 02:12:15,727
[SPEAKER_10]: They would ask us to talk about where those programs are offered in our surrounding area.

890
02:12:16,128 --> 02:12:22,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And they would also ask us to describe to them how our expansion in that space

891
02:12:23,157 --> 02:12:28,022
[SPEAKER_10]: would fit with the regional blueprints for the labor market in the area.

892
02:12:28,123 --> 02:12:41,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not just like we want to do this, it's we want to do this, we have the demand for it, and the area that you live in actually also has demand for this kind of vocational program to be in place.

893
02:12:42,797 --> 02:12:48,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is like maybe a more concrete example of some of the things that the school committee might see coming forward.

894
02:12:48,523 --> 02:12:55,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So we talk a lot about and I'll just use electrical for a minute that that shop is at capacity.

895
02:12:55,610 --> 02:13:02,397
[SPEAKER_10]: So 1 question and consideration we have is does the does the demand and the capacity support.

896
02:13:02,762 --> 02:13:05,163
[SPEAKER_10]: an expansion of that program.

897
02:13:05,783 --> 02:13:16,788
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so, this committee will have to weigh in and say, yes, we agree that that is something we wanna pursue from an educational perspective, and then it can go into our eligibility phase deliverables.

898
02:13:17,368 --> 02:13:30,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Because obviously, even if we have the space, creating expanded opportunities in the vocational program does mean a commitment to supplies and teachers and all of the things that make a good, solid vocational program tick.

899
02:13:31,173 --> 02:13:31,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all coming,

900
02:13:33,058 --> 02:13:34,559
[SPEAKER_10]: all of that work has been happening.

901
02:13:34,819 --> 02:13:40,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the superintendent's team has been meeting very diligently to, um, put all that together.

902
02:13:40,102 --> 02:13:50,408
[SPEAKER_10]: The other piece that we'll have to do, um, from a, from an educational profile perspective, um, is work with the city to provide information about our population citywide.

903
02:13:50,769 --> 02:14:01,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and also provide, um, inputs around plan development, um, projected growth of school aged children, et cetera, because part of what MSBA will do is they will

904
02:14:02,410 --> 02:14:12,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they will, they will define what our target enrollment is, and that will guide all of the sort of sizing of the building when we get into that phase.

905
02:14:12,853 --> 02:14:17,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of this has to be provided by us in this eligibility phase so that they can do their work.

906
02:14:17,554 --> 02:14:23,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And then ultimately, um, they can report back to us that this is the size of the building that, um, from there.

907
02:14:25,676 --> 02:14:30,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And that can, um, drive forward, um, all the design and planning.

908
02:14:32,162 --> 02:14:39,425
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing that we have to provide in this phase is a series of documents that outline our current maintenance practices.

909
02:14:40,345 --> 02:14:44,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And that includes not just the high school, but our entire district.

910
02:14:44,787 --> 02:14:50,649
[SPEAKER_10]: And it asks questions like, do you have job descriptions for your custodians and maintenance staff?

911
02:14:51,089 --> 02:14:53,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you regularly recommission buildings?

912
02:14:54,760 --> 02:15:00,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, um, how, who, you know, what kind of contractors do you have on board?

913
02:15:00,362 --> 02:15:02,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, that helps support proactive maintenance.

914
02:15:02,623 --> 02:15:07,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a whole slew of questions here, um, that we have to answer as well.

915
02:15:07,744 --> 02:15:14,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we are well underway drafting, um, this, these answers, um, in addition, um, in working with.

916
02:15:15,027 --> 02:15:18,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the superintendent and Dr. Cushing and, um, John McLaughlin.

917
02:15:18,732 --> 02:15:20,193
[SPEAKER_10]: who is our head of buildings and grounds.

918
02:15:20,233 --> 02:15:24,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're working diligently to be ready to provide all this data.

919
02:15:24,614 --> 02:15:35,078
[SPEAKER_10]: And much of this is rounding up data that exists sort of across the system and really being able to put it in one place and create a cohesive narrative.

920
02:15:35,118 --> 02:15:39,139
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's tons and tons of work going on across all of those deliverables.

921
02:15:39,919 --> 02:15:47,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the fifth and final step of eligibility, we're not ready for yet, but our mayor and our city council will have to

922
02:15:48,871 --> 02:15:53,732
[SPEAKER_10]: help identify how we will pay for the feasibility study as a city.

923
02:15:54,672 --> 02:16:02,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way that the process works from a feasibility study perspective is the city does agree to fund the feasibility study.

924
02:16:03,114 --> 02:16:14,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the point at which we progress through all the various phases of the project, there's a reimbursement that comes back to the city, presuming that we go successfully through all of the MSBA stuff.

925
02:16:15,337 --> 02:16:18,458
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not ready for funding the feasibility study just yet,

926
02:16:19,071 --> 02:16:27,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but that is sort of the, sort of the off ramp from the eligibility phase and into the phase where we start hiring the project team, which really means bringing on the owner's project manager.

927
02:16:27,833 --> 02:16:34,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And then ultimately bringing on our designers that will do the feasibility study.

928
02:16:35,615 --> 02:16:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: As you may remember, we approved that there would be 15 voting members.

929
02:16:40,896 --> 02:16:45,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Of the committee and a series of non voting members as well.

930
02:16:46,784 --> 02:16:52,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, we also put out a call, uh, for additional steps for additional support.

931
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:57,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and we put out a call for applications, um, to appoint nine additional members.

932
02:16:58,153 --> 02:17:13,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Which includes one school committee member, one city counselor, and seven open positions, um, for, uh, members of the committee who are residents, um, which include, which may include, um, teachers and staff are meant for public schools who are welcome to apply.

933
02:17:14,068 --> 02:17:23,495
[SPEAKER_10]: as well as specifically members of the community with architecture, engineering, and construction experience, or experience with large program management and communication.

934
02:17:25,256 --> 02:17:32,501
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a really active community who was really, really excited about this prospect.

935
02:17:32,881 --> 02:17:37,364
[SPEAKER_10]: We got 104 applications for nine member slots.

936
02:17:38,365 --> 02:17:43,028
[SPEAKER_10]: The 104 applications included two school committee members, two city counselors,

937
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:48,263
[SPEAKER_10]: eight MHS staff members, and then 92 other members of the community.

938
02:17:48,283 --> 02:17:56,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Our candidates are both diverse and qualified.

939
02:17:56,928 --> 02:18:04,933
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have had lots of many, many, many hours of reading to understand who the folks were that were applying.

940
02:18:04,953 --> 02:18:12,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Our demographics from an applicant perspective, 82% of those who applied were current or future parents of MHS students.

941
02:18:13,643 --> 02:18:14,984
[SPEAKER_10]: 16% were people of color.

942
02:18:15,504 --> 02:18:21,606
[SPEAKER_10]: There were nine members of the disability community and there were nine members of the LGBTQIA community.

943
02:18:22,227 --> 02:18:31,791
[SPEAKER_10]: From a relevant experience perspective, 62% of the applicants had architecture, design, engineering, or other construction experience, which is a huge number.

944
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:36,773
[SPEAKER_10]: 66% had large program communications experience.

945
02:18:36,873 --> 02:18:42,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there were many applicants who were members of a whole variety of boards and commissions across the city.

946
02:18:42,833 --> 02:18:43,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was our applicant pool.

947
02:18:45,354 --> 02:19:00,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, um, as we, um, thought about, as you may remember, um, the superintendent, the mayor and I, um, got together and we have, we've spent many hours, um, combing through 104 applications to really try to create a committee that.

948
02:19:01,558 --> 02:19:09,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, is representative of Medford, um, and, um, uh, sort of meets the needs of what we outlined in terms of the charge.

949
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:09,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

950
02:19:10,615 --> 02:19:37,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Our recommendation tonight, and I'll come back to this slide in just a second, but our recommendation tonight is that we agree to, we vote to appoint member Olapade as our school committee member, Emily Lazzaro as our city council member, community members, including Libby Brown, Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, who is also a staff member at MHS, Brian Hilliard, Tracy Keene, Nicole Morell, and Luke Prisner.

951
02:19:38,553 --> 02:19:50,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm also going to request that you all vote on appointing an additional non-voting member of the committee to appoint member Rousseau as a non-voting member of the school building committee.

952
02:19:52,885 --> 02:19:55,887
[SPEAKER_10]: The committee is subject to approval by MSBA.

953
02:19:56,528 --> 02:20:02,813
[SPEAKER_10]: So there may be changes that have to come once the MSBA gets our submission for the committee.

954
02:20:03,734 --> 02:20:05,295
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be some changes there.

955
02:20:06,111 --> 02:20:20,342
[SPEAKER_10]: that they might require, but my conversations with them so far have outlined that we have a lot of broad latitude and that everything that we're putting forward is consistent with what they're looking for.

956
02:20:20,362 --> 02:20:30,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Our school building committee selection that we've put forward, we think represents Medford's incredible diversity.

957
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:32,131
[SPEAKER_10]: So 89% of our

958
02:20:35,899 --> 02:20:46,826
[SPEAKER_10]: of our recommended appointees are current or future members of MHS students.

959
02:20:46,847 --> 02:20:49,989
[SPEAKER_10]: 55% identify as female with 45% identifying as male.

960
02:20:50,009 --> 02:20:52,150
[SPEAKER_10]: 33% are people of color.

961
02:20:52,170 --> 02:20:59,355
[SPEAKER_10]: 9% are members of the disability community and 22% are members of the LGBTQIA plus community.

962
02:20:59,375 --> 02:21:04,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna leave this up for a moment.

963
02:21:05,677 --> 02:21:09,920
[SPEAKER_10]: but I believe that my recommendation would be that we take two votes tonight.

964
02:21:10,221 --> 02:21:18,107
[SPEAKER_10]: One to appoint the voting members as described here, and then a second to appoint an additional non-voting member and member or so.

965
02:21:19,588 --> 02:21:21,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will stop there, but I'll leave this slide up.

966
02:21:21,970 --> 02:21:25,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So Mayor, did you want to take over or do you want me to continue?

967
02:21:28,483 --> 02:21:32,124
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know there's some questions from the committee and the public.

968
02:21:32,604 --> 02:21:44,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And all I can add, thank you for doing the slideshow, is that the amount of expertise and interest in this process is pretty exciting.

969
02:21:44,087 --> 02:21:50,488
[SPEAKER_13]: And we hope to, one way or another, use or utilize the skills of all

970
02:21:51,252 --> 02:22:13,038
[SPEAKER_13]: hundred and four people that want to be involved in this process because we have not only this committee that we need to move forward, but we also have a campaign throughout our community and education that needs to take place to get, you know, our hope is to get everybody on board to want to build a new flagship school for our students and staff that very much deserve it.

971
02:22:14,078 --> 02:22:15,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

972
02:22:15,879 --> 02:22:19,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Also spent several hours reviewing this.

973
02:22:21,098 --> 02:22:38,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just wanted to echo what member Graham and the mayor just said that the 104 applications they were absolutely, you know, outstanding the amount of architects and engineers and people who had like

974
02:22:39,384 --> 02:23:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: um authentic experience that could be you know the pool was so strong we could have had like five running committees i mean i know that's not what the ask is but i want the community to know that um it was not an easy decision um but from msba experience to architectural experience to communications experience um

975
02:23:03,388 --> 02:23:07,251
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a wonderfully strong pool of candidates.

976
02:23:07,371 --> 02:23:27,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we're gonna look for other opportunities to, even if you're not part of this particular grouping, to continue to tap into the expertise, knowledge, feedback, and willingness of all of the community members who really wanted to be part of this process.

977
02:23:28,325 --> 02:23:32,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to echo that it was not an easy process,

978
02:23:34,328 --> 02:23:46,172
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a rewarding process and I was just very impressed by the quality, how strong the entire pool was, very, very strong pool.

979
02:23:46,272 --> 02:23:48,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to everyone who did apply.

980
02:23:48,152 --> 02:23:54,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think your point, I just wanted to help people understand sort of what comes next.

981
02:23:56,015 --> 02:24:04,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So currently we will publish the profiles of all the folks who are appointed to the committee on the school building committee website, which is in construction right now.

982
02:24:04,938 --> 02:24:08,379
[SPEAKER_10]: And the committee will meet for the first time before May 1st.

983
02:24:09,599 --> 02:24:15,000
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to be, the entire committee has to be trained because they will all be subject to the open meeting law.

984
02:24:15,161 --> 02:24:18,762
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our meetings will be conducted in public as are all of our school committee meeting.

985
02:24:20,062 --> 02:24:23,563
[SPEAKER_10]: The very first things that the committee is going to need to do is establish

986
02:24:24,569 --> 02:24:37,492
[SPEAKER_10]: operating ground rules for the school committee, the school building committee, and specifically to develop the communications and public engagement strategies that will help inform the enrollment profile and the operating structures in general.

987
02:24:37,552 --> 02:24:45,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So part of the first jobs of the committee is really to say, how will we engage the community before we even get there?

988
02:24:45,773 --> 02:24:50,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I do plan to send a note, everybody who applied and encourage them to let us know

989
02:24:51,773 --> 02:25:08,229
[SPEAKER_10]: what their particular interests are so that as we are scheduling meetings that might be topically relevant to certain folks that we can reach out to them proactively and invite them to join us at the meetings because we do want to hear from qualified people in the community whether they're on the committee or not.

990
02:25:08,349 --> 02:25:14,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of that is to come in terms of what we plan to do and then we will also report to the school committee in May.

991
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:21,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, about what those communication strategies are, but part of that communication and outreach strategy is.

992
02:25:21,942 --> 02:25:26,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, not just to say, like, how will we operate and how will we engage the community?

993
02:25:26,583 --> 02:25:33,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but they'll specific will specifically take an action item to talk about proper engagement of all of our boards and commissions across the city.

994
02:25:34,005 --> 02:25:42,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and how best to work with, um, various, um, you know, sort of special interest groups across the city.

995
02:25:43,243 --> 02:25:52,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and make sure they are brought into meetings where the, where topically it makes sense for them to be involved, um, because all of that public input and engagement is really important.

996
02:25:54,607 --> 02:25:57,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, member Branley, did you have a question?

997
02:25:57,868 --> 02:25:58,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

998
02:25:58,048 --> 02:26:00,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley and then Anthony.

999
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I am wondering how much the feasibility study is.

1000
02:26:07,732 --> 02:26:08,772
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great question.

1001
02:26:08,792 --> 02:26:10,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they.

1002
02:26:10,779 --> 02:26:16,181
[SPEAKER_10]: they vary widely depending on how big of a building and how many students and all of that.

1003
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:22,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I have been told to think in the range of two to two and a half million dollars.

1004
02:26:22,744 --> 02:26:29,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but that is all work that we still have to do, um, to get to the point of, um, having good numbers in that space.

1005
02:26:31,327 --> 02:26:34,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So the feasibility study alone is two to two and a half million dollars.

1006
02:26:34,609 --> 02:26:34,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1007
02:26:35,309 --> 02:26:35,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1008
02:26:37,593 --> 02:26:39,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you said reimbursement would be 100%.

1009
02:26:39,414 --> 02:26:44,096
[SPEAKER_04]: That's if we get- Reimbursement will definitely not be 100%.

1010
02:26:45,977 --> 02:26:52,500
[SPEAKER_10]: So at some point further in the process, MSBA will establish what our reimbursement rates are.

1011
02:26:52,520 --> 02:27:03,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we successfully move through all the phases of the project, they will reimburse the feasibility study at that reimbursement rate.

1012
02:27:03,926 --> 02:27:05,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they say your reimbursement rate is 50%,

1013
02:27:07,011 --> 02:27:14,275
[SPEAKER_10]: then we can expect them to reimburse us at the, you know, as sort of successful conclusion for the feasibility study at that 50% rate.

1014
02:27:15,035 --> 02:27:20,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so it will be commensurate with the reimbursement rate that is established by the board.

1015
02:27:21,918 --> 02:27:22,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1016
02:27:22,178 --> 02:27:24,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are going to be asking the city council for this money.

1017
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does that money come from?

1018
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that is all work for the mayor and the council to do and good time.

1019
02:27:31,123 --> 02:27:31,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1020
02:27:32,810 --> 02:27:34,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then just one other question.

1021
02:27:35,271 --> 02:27:38,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-voting member addition is member Rousseau.

1022
02:27:39,313 --> 02:27:40,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was that decided?

1023
02:27:42,435 --> 02:27:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So my recommendation was for a number of reasons.

1024
02:27:47,437 --> 02:27:51,139
[SPEAKER_10]: One is that there were two members of the school committee who applied.

1025
02:27:51,679 --> 02:27:53,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Only one can be a voting member.

1026
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:59,543
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel like as I looked across the committee, there's a handful of things that I think are really important.

1027
02:28:01,164 --> 02:28:03,486
[SPEAKER_10]: member, so is the most senior member of this committee.

1028
02:28:03,526 --> 02:28:05,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has more history than any of us.

1029
02:28:06,048 --> 02:28:13,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but he also has, um, a deep understanding of, uh, running and being part of a committee that is compliant with open meeting law.

1030
02:28:14,755 --> 02:28:26,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I think that's really important, um, as well as, um, really thinking about trying to make, uh, the ability of this committee, um, to sort of be part of the process as broad as possible.

1031
02:28:26,524 --> 02:28:27,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my recommendation.

1032
02:28:27,685 --> 02:28:29,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1033
02:28:29,347 --> 02:28:29,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1034
02:28:31,941 --> 02:28:32,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ntapa.

1035
02:28:36,484 --> 02:28:39,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the thought was there and then it quickly left.

1036
02:28:39,425 --> 02:28:42,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I yield my time to Mr. Guillen if possible.

1037
02:28:43,848 --> 02:28:45,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll re-raise when I think of it.

1038
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:48,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Reinfeld.

1039
02:28:50,379 --> 02:29:03,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so in the initial approval to set up this committee, we had identified various subcommittees, such as communication and community engagement, sustainability, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, finance, and then others as needed.

1040
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:06,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this composition

1041
02:29:07,051 --> 02:29:10,972
[SPEAKER_11]: have the ability to form those subcommittees along with the non-voting members.

1042
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:12,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I see you nodding.

1043
02:29:12,352 --> 02:29:24,394
[SPEAKER_11]: The other question is, looking at the broad range of expertise that we got, this committee was also designed to, I've been pushing very hard for advisory committees throughout the process.

1044
02:29:24,414 --> 02:29:33,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there particular advisory committees that you anticipate needing based on applications who were unable to be seated as voting members or general expertise that we need?

1045
02:29:34,816 --> 02:29:35,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a great question.

1046
02:29:37,275 --> 02:29:57,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there will be a number of advisory committees and part of the committee, the school building committee forming and establishing its communication strategies will also include sort of that rounded take instead of just like our take on what those advisory committees could and should be.

1047
02:29:58,624 --> 02:30:04,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to bring all of these members together to have that dialogue so that we're hearing from all of them

1048
02:30:06,197 --> 02:30:12,600
[SPEAKER_10]: what they're seeing that they need and recommend, because these are all folks that are incredibly qualified.

1049
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:15,381
[SPEAKER_10]: There are folks on the committee who are very familiar with MSBA.

1050
02:30:16,742 --> 02:30:18,863
[SPEAKER_10]: They're architects on MSBA projects.

1051
02:30:19,724 --> 02:30:22,785
[SPEAKER_10]: They're involved in sustainability and K-12 education.

1052
02:30:22,865 --> 02:30:25,907
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very, very amazing and impressive group.

1053
02:30:26,567 --> 02:30:30,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think as the committee begins to meet, it will do a couple of things.

1054
02:30:30,970 --> 02:30:33,111
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll identify those advisory committees.

1055
02:30:33,872 --> 02:30:40,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, it will also, um, identify, um, whether we collectively believe that we need a vice chair of the committee.

1056
02:30:40,976 --> 02:30:45,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's really a question that's best answered once we know what all the other structures are.

1057
02:30:46,359 --> 02:30:55,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of that will sort of be decided by this committee, um, as they get together and get to know each other and we get to know each other's strengths and how we're going to organize.

1058
02:30:56,145 --> 02:30:56,385
That's it.

1059
02:30:58,319 --> 02:30:58,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1060
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:07,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to receiving the initial report so we can confirm that those things are moving and are as inclusive as we can.

1061
02:31:07,482 --> 02:31:08,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.

1062
02:31:09,402 --> 02:31:11,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I will now defer to Mr. Guillen.

1063
02:31:12,403 --> 02:31:13,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

1064
02:31:14,084 --> 02:31:16,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Anthony Guillen, just to address for the record.

1065
02:31:17,545 --> 02:31:17,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1066
02:31:18,625 --> 02:31:23,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony Guillen, 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Lemonster, president of the Medford Teachers Association.

1067
02:31:25,259 --> 02:31:25,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two points.

1068
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:30,663
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I want to say that I applaud the appointment of Maria Dorsey to this committee.

1069
02:31:31,023 --> 02:31:32,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria gives a lot to our school.

1070
02:31:32,484 --> 02:31:35,145
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great member and an excellent coworker.

1071
02:31:36,406 --> 02:31:49,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also encourage, if more community members are open, to have more teachers on this committee as just sort of the day-to-day operation questions can probably be best answered by those

1072
02:31:50,244 --> 02:32:03,167
[SPEAKER_00]: If that isn't possible, then on these advisory committees and these reach outs for specific specialties, I would reach out to the teachers that work at Medford High School, just again, for the day-to-day operational questions.

1073
02:32:04,627 --> 02:32:14,629
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, I would push this committee to include people who would understand the needs of the vocational programs, the amount of space and equipment

1074
02:32:15,322 --> 02:32:26,870
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially the specificities of something such as the robotics program in which temperatures need to be kept at specific levels and equipment can be affected by the environment.

1075
02:32:27,751 --> 02:32:38,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd push that early and often, if not a permanent member of the community voting, then a advisory committee be set up for vocational needs specifically.

1076
02:32:38,918 --> 02:32:39,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1077
02:32:39,759 --> 02:32:40,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1078
02:32:40,099 --> 02:32:41,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Guillen.

1079
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally agree.

1080
02:32:43,542 --> 02:32:52,707
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that has to happen, you know, as we get all of this, I'll say paperwork in place, right?

1081
02:32:52,787 --> 02:32:57,169
[SPEAKER_10]: The MSBA will tell us how much space is allowable for various things.

1082
02:32:57,189 --> 02:33:08,916
[SPEAKER_10]: They have lots of rules and, you know, and to be perfectly honest, their rules around the vocational programming are improving, but they have always disadvantaged vocational programs.

1083
02:33:08,976 --> 02:33:11,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know that, and people are very aware of that.

1084
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:32,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when we talk about bringing on experts to lead the feasibility study, one of the things that happens in that feasibility study space is lots of staff-oriented vision sessions that get to the heart of all of the things that you're talking about.

1085
02:33:32,844 --> 02:33:41,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So I anticipate a much broader inclusion of folks who work in Medford High School in that phase, because those are the folks

1086
02:33:41,906 --> 02:33:46,848
[SPEAKER_10]: who will be describing sort of what the options are and what the possibilities might become.

1087
02:33:46,908 --> 02:34:03,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we get there, there will be educator-specific vision sessions that our architects and our owners, project manager, et cetera, will hold on our behalf, specifically to make sure that we are hearing from all of you.

1088
02:34:03,275 --> 02:34:08,618
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think at any time, I've told Principal Cabral, I'm happy to come in and chat.

1089
02:34:10,379 --> 02:34:14,940
[SPEAKER_10]: with her staff anytime that you all would like to hear from me.

1090
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:23,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And you all can feel free to reach out to me at any time if you have questions or you'd like to see, you know, you have an idea or a thought.

1091
02:34:24,262 --> 02:34:28,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last thing I'll say is that our meetings will be open to the public just like these meetings are.

1092
02:34:28,303 --> 02:34:32,744
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would love to have you all join us at those meetings as well.

1093
02:34:34,138 --> 02:34:34,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Graham.

1094
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:37,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Guillen.

1095
02:34:37,181 --> 02:34:40,144
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, from the chair, and then I'll go to Member Ntapa.

1096
02:34:41,005 --> 02:34:54,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to point out that this was a long week of not only reading 208 pages of applications, but also working as a group of three trying to discuss the pros and cons of different makeups of this committee and

1097
02:34:56,866 --> 02:35:05,293
[SPEAKER_13]: For me, I just want to let everybody know, I just feel like it's a little bit overloaded with politicians, especially where Jenny and I are already members.

1098
02:35:06,074 --> 02:35:12,459
[SPEAKER_13]: So for me to agree to a non-voting member, which I know is going to be a separate vote, I mean, I'd have to...

1099
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:22,682
[SPEAKER_13]: suggest that we put two to four others on as non-voting alternates so that we can just balance this committee out a little bit more.

1100
02:35:22,863 --> 02:35:24,343
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my concern over the week.

1101
02:35:25,203 --> 02:35:35,026
[SPEAKER_13]: There are 94 resident applicants, all highly qualified, and I had a struggle with that balance.

1102
02:35:35,946 --> 02:35:39,969
[SPEAKER_13]: and there was some give and take, and it was agree to disagree type situations.

1103
02:35:40,089 --> 02:35:43,752
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to make that clear from my perspective.

1104
02:35:43,812 --> 02:35:49,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure that this committee can move forward without any issues.

1105
02:35:50,096 --> 02:36:01,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only way I could see voting for one non-voting member is if we have a committee of, you know, a group of two, a group of three or five, which would serve as non-voting alternates.

1106
02:36:02,946 --> 02:36:03,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ntapa?

1107
02:36:06,206 --> 02:36:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Madam Mayor.

1108
02:36:07,746 --> 02:36:23,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just like to, I've realized the point was more on the lines of the question of Member Branley, but I would like to echo the point made by MTA President Guillen, as well as Chair Lungo-Koehn.

1109
02:36:24,410 --> 02:36:34,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It does feel a little politician heavy, and I would love to see if we do have a non-voting member addition, because again, the guidelines said one, minus, you know, the,

1110
02:36:35,956 --> 02:36:40,539
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the 2 being, you know, member Graham and member.

1111
02:36:40,639 --> 02:36:43,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is no, this is with all due respect.

1112
02:36:44,281 --> 02:36:45,242
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a shot.

1113
02:36:45,642 --> 02:36:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make that very clear member.

1114
02:36:47,363 --> 02:36:53,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a very, very intelligent person, especially when it comes to open meeting law.

1115
02:36:53,347 --> 02:36:55,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I have I use it as a resource for many questions.

1116
02:36:56,069 --> 02:37:04,314
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of me wanting to have more of our community members who maybe don't have that say that maybe this board would have.

1117
02:37:05,177 --> 02:37:14,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And including, especially our teachers, whether that be paraprofessionals, whether that be the people who walk those buildings daily.

1118
02:37:15,782 --> 02:37:20,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they will tell you the ins and outs that evolve every single day.

1119
02:37:21,745 --> 02:37:30,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I would say that, you know, obviously it's 2 different motions, but I would echo the concerns of chair and would probably want to put to get more 4 to 5.

1120
02:37:31,786 --> 02:37:42,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the legality of having teachers that don't live in our district, because from my understanding, we have quite a few teachers who don't live within the Medford Public Schools who may be eligible to want to do this.

1121
02:37:42,631 --> 02:37:44,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the legality of that.

1122
02:37:44,252 --> 02:37:45,493
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my own ignorance.

1123
02:37:46,873 --> 02:37:53,276
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can open up it to having more than one school member, even as a non-voting member, I don't see why we couldn't do that.

1124
02:37:57,318 --> 02:38:01,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's all the collective thought I have right now.

1125
02:38:02,216 --> 02:38:03,936
[SPEAKER_08]: before I just start talking nonsense.

1126
02:38:04,357 --> 02:38:05,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you, member Ntapa.

1127
02:38:06,577 --> 02:38:07,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Bramley?

1128
02:38:09,598 --> 02:38:13,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be more than happy to offer anything that anybody needs.

1129
02:38:13,099 --> 02:38:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: If I needed to be another non-voting member, I'd be more than happy to volunteer for that, just to throw that out there.

1130
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:24,382
[SPEAKER_04]: If we wanna take the non-voting member addition off altogether, I'm comfortable with that too.

1131
02:38:25,462 --> 02:38:27,863
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to offer that I'd be more than happy to do that also.

1132
02:38:31,803 --> 02:38:32,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Branley.

1133
02:38:34,425 --> 02:38:37,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I motion to approve the community members?

1134
02:38:38,367 --> 02:38:42,110
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like we feel comfortable moving forward with that vote now.

1135
02:38:43,451 --> 02:38:44,011
[SPEAKER_13]: The first vote.

1136
02:38:44,592 --> 02:38:51,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval of the committee members by Member Reinfeld, seconded by... I'll second.

1137
02:38:52,357 --> 02:38:53,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Branley.

1138
02:38:54,258 --> 02:38:55,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote.

1139
02:38:59,142 --> 02:38:59,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Branley.

1140
02:39:00,863 --> 02:39:01,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1141
02:39:02,415 --> 02:39:03,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

1142
02:39:03,815 --> 02:39:04,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1143
02:39:05,376 --> 02:39:06,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Atapa?

1144
02:39:06,716 --> 02:39:07,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1145
02:39:08,017 --> 02:39:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapode?

1146
02:39:08,837 --> 02:39:09,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1147
02:39:09,457 --> 02:39:10,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld?

1148
02:39:10,117 --> 02:39:10,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1149
02:39:12,198 --> 02:39:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

1150
02:39:13,678 --> 02:39:13,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1151
02:39:15,139 --> 02:39:15,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Longo Kern?

1152
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:16,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1153
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:18,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1154
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:26,742
[SPEAKER_13]: The community members is one through seven are approved and thank them in advance for their many hours of service ahead.

1155
02:39:28,348 --> 02:39:37,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I'd like to also make the motion that Member Olapade and Emily Lazzaro are appointed as voting members pursuant to our original motion.

1156
02:39:38,737 --> 02:39:39,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1157
02:39:40,358 --> 02:39:47,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham, motion for approval of our voting members for school committee and city council, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1158
02:39:47,485 --> 02:39:48,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote.

1159
02:39:51,188 --> 02:39:51,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Bradley.

1160
02:39:53,089 --> 02:39:53,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1161
02:39:54,771 --> 02:39:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1162
02:39:55,912 --> 02:39:56,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1163
02:39:57,264 --> 02:39:58,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ntapa?

1164
02:39:58,745 --> 02:39:59,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1165
02:40:00,005 --> 02:40:00,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Olapade?

1166
02:40:00,785 --> 02:40:01,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1167
02:40:01,486 --> 02:40:02,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld?

1168
02:40:02,626 --> 02:40:02,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1169
02:40:03,747 --> 02:40:04,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

1170
02:40:05,187 --> 02:40:05,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1171
02:40:06,348 --> 02:40:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Longo Kern?

1172
02:40:08,028 --> 02:40:08,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1173
02:40:08,589 --> 02:40:10,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1174
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:15,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Olapade and Member Lazzaro have been approved to be on the committee.

1175
02:40:15,431 --> 02:40:16,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your service.

1176
02:40:19,033 --> 02:40:24,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd also like to make a motion that Member Ruseau is added as a non-voting member of the committee.

1177
02:40:26,263 --> 02:40:42,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I just like to make an amendment, or if one of my colleagues can, that we add at least two more non-voting alternates in case we need them, and we can hopefully tap into two other community members that are willing and able to serve on this committee.

1178
02:40:45,117 --> 02:40:46,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to accept that amendment, Mayor.

1179
02:40:46,538 --> 02:40:50,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, motion for approval by Member Graham as amended.

1180
02:40:50,861 --> 02:40:51,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Question about that.

1181
02:40:52,502 --> 02:40:53,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1182
02:40:54,520 --> 02:40:58,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, are we talking about people who have actually applied, or we're just gonna randomly pick people that you want, Mayor?

1183
02:41:00,222 --> 02:41:02,262
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not who I want, Member Ruseau.

1184
02:41:02,362 --> 02:41:03,523
[SPEAKER_13]: It's people that applied.

1185
02:41:03,563 --> 02:41:14,526
[SPEAKER_13]: We had 92 community members, and including teachers, additional, I don't know how we wanna create the makeup, but I think we should add two more people that applied from the community.

1186
02:41:15,486 --> 02:41:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I just wanna clarify, you keep using the word alternate, though.

1187
02:41:17,927 --> 02:41:22,129
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not alternates, so I don't know what you think the non-voting members are.

1188
02:41:22,149 --> 02:41:23,429
[SPEAKER_02]: They must come to every meeting

1189
02:41:25,336 --> 02:41:26,597
[SPEAKER_02]: They are required for a quorum.

1190
02:41:27,297 --> 02:41:29,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm not sure about that, but they must come to every meeting.

1191
02:41:30,658 --> 02:41:31,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1192
02:41:31,419 --> 02:41:32,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are not alternates.

1193
02:41:37,181 --> 02:41:44,805
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get to vote if voting members stop showing up or if we have to find a new voting member, they don't get the seats.

1194
02:41:46,889 --> 02:41:53,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you said, I don't know what I think they are and what the motion was, that it would be alternates.

1195
02:41:54,053 --> 02:41:56,614
[SPEAKER_13]: So two additional non-voting alternates.

1196
02:41:58,715 --> 02:42:04,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Or from like alternating for the non-voting member Rousseau, or?

1197
02:42:04,058 --> 02:42:11,782
[SPEAKER_13]: We can change the amendment and just add two alternates from the community, non-politicians, or we could.

1198
02:42:11,802 --> 02:42:13,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what an alternate means, Mayor.

1199
02:42:13,523 --> 02:42:14,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of clarification.

1200
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:17,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification, member Intoppa.

1201
02:42:18,281 --> 02:42:28,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the point is, is that member Graham in presenting was saying about how MSBA may have a cap of a certain amount of the working groups.

1202
02:42:28,267 --> 02:42:35,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea was, is that we approve three, and if we need to cut down to one non-voting member, then we look at the pool of who we want to put forward.

1203
02:42:35,591 --> 02:42:38,093
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea is to have three, and if we can have two, then we have two.

1204
02:42:38,193 --> 02:42:39,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we have three, then we can have three.

1205
02:42:42,176 --> 02:42:45,358
[SPEAKER_10]: MSBA is not going to weigh in on the size of our committee.

1206
02:42:45,818 --> 02:42:48,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Our committee is also already very large.

1207
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:56,044
[SPEAKER_10]: With that said, I think if we want to add two additional non-voting members, I think that's totally fine.

1208
02:42:56,064 --> 02:43:03,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not call them alternates though, because that has a whole different connotation and we really haven't even talked about what that might mean.

1209
02:43:03,229 --> 02:43:07,872
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to amend the motion to say that we're going to

1210
02:43:08,510 --> 02:43:16,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Ad member Rousseau is a non-voting member and that there will be two additional non-voting members brought forward to this committee for approval at the next meeting.

1211
02:43:18,156 --> 02:43:18,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd second that.

1212
02:43:19,397 --> 02:43:27,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Could I add on to that in the statement that they should be priority sent to faculty members of the building that is being built?

1213
02:43:29,723 --> 02:43:34,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it should probably be from that pool.

1214
02:43:34,861 --> 02:43:35,841
[SPEAKER_13]: A non-politician.

1215
02:43:35,861 --> 02:43:38,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right, from that pool, yes, from the applicant pool.

1216
02:43:38,202 --> 02:43:39,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Non-politicians from that pool, yep.

1217
02:43:40,343 --> 02:43:41,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1218
02:43:42,403 --> 02:43:47,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so the amendment to have them as non-voting members.

1219
02:43:47,505 --> 02:43:48,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Find a personal privilege.

1220
02:43:49,326 --> 02:43:50,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Find a personal privilege.

1221
02:43:51,286 --> 02:43:56,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, I find it offensive that as a politician, you're using the politician in the four-letter word, sensitive.

1222
02:43:56,988 --> 02:43:57,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really obnoxious.

1223
02:43:58,188 --> 02:43:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna be very open with that.

1224
02:44:00,629 --> 02:44:06,311
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a politician there, you're talking about politicians in the negative sense that the public frequently does.

1225
02:44:06,731 --> 02:44:10,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not helpful when politicians ourselves talk about each other in that sense.

1226
02:44:10,912 --> 02:44:16,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you're not concerned about the number of politicians, you're concerned about politicians in the negative sense of the word.

1227
02:44:17,014 --> 02:44:21,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just need to get that out there, because your tone is extremely offensive.

1228
02:44:21,695 --> 02:44:23,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, your tone's offensive, member Ruseau.

1229
02:44:23,996 --> 02:44:25,016
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine, thank you.

1230
02:44:25,076 --> 02:44:26,477
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking, you're condescending.

1231
02:44:26,797 --> 02:44:28,577
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not gonna tolerate it either.

1232
02:44:29,738 --> 02:44:30,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I think,

1233
02:44:31,033 --> 02:44:43,415
[SPEAKER_13]: any, if you look at the list is member Graham, myself, two voting members from current, I mean, past politician, another one, I mean, there's, we had nine.

1234
02:44:43,495 --> 02:44:45,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, that's what the MSBA requires.

1235
02:44:48,956 --> 02:44:55,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm asking to make the board larger so that we can have more community members, because I don't think this is great optics.

1236
02:44:57,618 --> 02:44:58,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we move the question?

1237
02:44:59,335 --> 02:45:04,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval as amended by Member Graham, seconded by?

1238
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:07,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1239
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:09,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I thought Member Ruseau had done that.

1240
02:45:10,382 --> 02:45:11,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

1241
02:45:14,865 --> 02:45:15,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Branley.

1242
02:45:16,286 --> 02:45:19,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we just be clear that we're adding the two additional members, correct, from the pool?

1243
02:45:20,169 --> 02:45:20,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1244
02:45:21,269 --> 02:45:24,912
[SPEAKER_11]: To be represented and voted on at the next meeting as to who they are.

1245
02:45:25,932 --> 02:45:26,313

02:45:45,887 --> 02:45:46,167

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion as amended is approved.

1261
02:45:52,130 --> 02:45:58,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, can I just say congratulations and thank you in advance for your service to the people that we've just appointed?

1262
02:45:58,846 --> 02:46:03,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and to let everybody know that I will be in touch, um, after tonight.

1263
02:46:04,753 --> 02:46:04,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1264
02:46:04,993 --> 02:46:05,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1265
02:46:05,794 --> 02:46:06,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, everybody.

1266
02:46:08,637 --> 02:46:12,741
[SPEAKER_13]: We have reports requested revised school handbooks as requested.

1267
02:46:12,801 --> 02:46:17,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Handbooks for all schools are respectfully submitted for review review by the ad hoc committee.

1268
02:46:17,847 --> 02:46:20,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Brooks Elementary School, Miss Attack Elementary.

1269
02:46:21,363 --> 02:46:30,145
[SPEAKER_13]: McGlynn Elementary, Roberts Elementary, Andrews Middle School, Working Draft, McGlynn Middle School, Medford High School, Vocational Technical, Curtis Tufts.

1270
02:46:32,445 --> 02:46:33,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Final draft to be submitted on May 6, 2024.

1271
02:46:34,366 --> 02:46:37,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval?

1272
02:46:37,426 --> 02:46:38,886
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a question about this.

1273
02:46:39,867 --> 02:46:43,847
[SPEAKER_11]: The ad hoc committee, when created, was about developing the process for review.

1274
02:46:43,927 --> 02:46:46,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I was told it wasn't about doing the actual review.

1275
02:46:50,277 --> 02:46:52,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I just got a zoom error message.

1276
02:46:52,657 --> 02:46:53,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to confirm that.

1277
02:46:54,018 --> 02:46:56,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this ad hoc committee doing the review as well?

1278
02:46:56,358 --> 02:46:59,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I am concerned about my time.

1279
02:46:59,719 --> 02:47:01,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that is my bias on this.

1280
02:47:01,319 --> 02:47:09,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that depends on, at least for me, that depends on what you all come up with in terms of, like, what you think the process should be.

1281
02:47:10,741 --> 02:47:13,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you recommend that, that's great.

1282
02:47:13,321 --> 02:47:14,301
[SPEAKER_10]: And if not, I think.

1283
02:47:14,721 --> 02:47:17,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be happy to hear whatever that recommendation is.

1284
02:47:18,607 --> 02:47:23,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to report that we because this committee changed, we do not have the final process in place.

1285
02:47:24,612 --> 02:47:24,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1286
02:47:26,293 --> 02:47:26,794
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record.

1287
02:47:29,616 --> 02:47:30,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Friendly.

1288
02:47:33,199 --> 02:47:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a quick question.

1289
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:37,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have a different handbook for every school?

1290
02:47:38,163 --> 02:47:41,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we not have a handbook for elementary one for middle and one for high school?

1291
02:47:46,078 --> 02:47:47,699
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may.

1292
02:47:48,039 --> 02:47:51,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Each school is required to have a handbook.

1293
02:47:51,661 --> 02:48:00,946
[SPEAKER_01]: The essence, the content of the handbooks are nearly identical, but it is a process that they go through with their individual school site councils.

1294
02:48:02,287 --> 02:48:10,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are, the majority of the content is identical, same set of rules, and the councils have the opportunity to weigh in.

1295
02:48:12,082 --> 02:48:23,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be very slight minor differences, but I would have to say like 90, more than 90% of the content should pretty much be identical.

1296
02:48:23,946 --> 02:48:30,149
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a requirement for each school to have their own handbook.

1297
02:48:31,192 --> 02:48:31,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay.

1298
02:48:32,592 --> 02:48:34,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured that that was a case that we all needed.

1299
02:48:34,973 --> 02:48:36,313
[SPEAKER_04]: They all needed to have their own handbook.

1300
02:48:36,393 --> 02:48:47,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I just figured one could say the Brooks with the principals and, you know, whatever staff that needs to be on there, but all the meat is the same because to me, if I'm a student at the Brooks and I go over to the McGlynn, the rule should be the same.

1301
02:48:48,875 --> 02:48:57,297
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm at the high school and I walk over to the Volk or I'm at the, at the Curtis, those rules should be the same, same at the McGlynn and the Andrews.

1302
02:48:57,967 --> 02:49:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just, I just want to make sure that, like you said, 90 something percent or whatever, it is the same.

1303
02:49:03,913 --> 02:49:07,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there are some, excuse me.

1304
02:49:08,338 --> 02:49:09,939
[SPEAKER_01]: They are essentially 90% the same, but

1305
02:49:11,912 --> 02:49:13,374
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few caveats.

1306
02:49:13,394 --> 02:49:18,180
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the in the high school one, there will be a slightly different.

1307
02:49:18,661 --> 02:49:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: The Curtis Tufts will follow what the high school does, but due to the nature of program requirements or needs, there are

1308
02:49:28,894 --> 02:49:31,335
[SPEAKER_01]: there could be some slight modifications.

1309
02:49:31,876 --> 02:49:42,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll all be in one handbook where you can look at it, and you'll be, once it's finalized by that May 6th meeting, you'll be able to see where the slight changes are.

1310
02:49:43,542 --> 02:49:46,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, all of the schools are doing the same.

1311
02:49:47,484 --> 02:49:55,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I just, when I got the binder, I'm like, I can't go for four elementary schools and see if page one was the same as page one.

1312
02:49:56,616 --> 02:49:57,036
[SPEAKER_04]: the way wrong.

1313
02:49:57,056 --> 02:49:58,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure that was clarified.

1314
02:49:58,458 --> 02:49:58,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1315
02:49:59,459 --> 02:49:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

1316
02:50:00,460 --> 02:50:01,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Follow up on that.

1317
02:50:01,481 --> 02:50:03,703
[SPEAKER_11]: You said every school is required by whom?

1318
02:50:03,764 --> 02:50:05,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a school committee rule?

1319
02:50:05,225 --> 02:50:06,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a state rule?

1320
02:50:06,446 --> 02:50:07,527
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?

1321
02:50:07,648 --> 02:50:12,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that every school does with their site council, they will work on their school handbooks.

1322
02:50:12,312 --> 02:50:17,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with their improvement plans, they are involved with their school site councils.

1323
02:50:17,838 --> 02:50:18,199
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just

1324
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:36,527
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, I mean, for as long as I've been in education, every school has always had a handbook, which clearly talked about what are the rules so that the families, parents, caregivers know, oh, if you do X, Y, and Z, you're violating the code of conduct.

1325
02:50:37,307 --> 02:50:41,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all of the, you know, we spent a lot of time, this committee,

1326
02:50:42,529 --> 02:50:46,032
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about expectations, whether it's around bullying and other things.

1327
02:50:46,152 --> 02:50:53,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's following the laws, but also just having it in one place so you could have an artifact to refer to.

1328
02:50:53,118 --> 02:50:58,982
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's- I guess I'm looking at it from this side for the first time.

1329
02:50:59,062 --> 02:51:00,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was curious.

1330
02:51:00,784 --> 02:51:01,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1331
02:51:05,828 --> 02:51:06,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1332
02:51:06,288 --> 02:51:07,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rousseau.

1333
02:51:08,210 --> 02:51:08,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1334
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:12,153
[SPEAKER_02]: These are required by law to be approved each year by the school committee.

1335
02:51:16,698 --> 02:51:17,738
[SPEAKER_13]: there a motion for approval?

1336
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:21,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I will put forward the motion.

1337
02:51:22,921 --> 02:51:29,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ntapa is seconded by... Are we just motioning to receive them and place them on file?

1338
02:51:29,364 --> 02:51:31,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we're not approving the handbooks right now, right?

1339
02:51:33,265 --> 02:51:36,967
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because it says the final draft to be submitted on May 6th, 2024.

1340
02:51:37,027 --> 02:51:43,190
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, you were approving that the final draft will be submitted on May 6th, 2024.

1341
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:44,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it, thank you.
