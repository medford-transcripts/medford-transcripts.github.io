    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=11.535s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=17.761s">Okay,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=18.962s">We</a>  have the seventh regular meeting of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=24.788s">Taking</a>  it back, John, I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=26.309s">Member</a>  Dapper, I'm like, what is that background? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=28.171s">Where</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=30.393s">Looks</a>  like a movie set. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=32.614s">Seventh</a>  regular meeting of the Medford School Committee, April 8th, 2024, executive session at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=37.476s">and</a>  our regular meeting at or about 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=41.357s">This</a>  meeting is being held remotely via Zoom and it's remote only and can be viewed live on the Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media or your local cable channel, Comcast channel 98 or 22 and Verizon channel 43, 45 or 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=58.971s">participants</a>  can log in or call in by using the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=63.715s">The</a>  meeting ID is 960-8498-5140. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=64.796s">Member</a>  Ruseau, if you could call the roll, please.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=281.666s">Breakout</a>  rooms are open.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=1838.277s">Member</a>  Graham, you have been re-invited to the breakout room. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3427.315s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3431.536s">It</a>  is 7 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3432.617s">We're</a>  going on to our regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3436.218s">Does</a>  anybody have any business under good of the order? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3438.359s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, I'm going to move on to the consent agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3448.042s">We</a>  have bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes from March 18, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3453.496s">student</a>  advisory council minutes, March 20th, 2024, strategic and capital planning subcommittee minutes from March 26th, 2024, and committee of the whole meeting minutes from April 3rd, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3466.187s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3467.788s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3473.012s">Motion</a>  to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by, actually, sorry, before I call second, member Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3479.178s">I</a>  have a question about how things get recorded if someone abstains a vote, because we have it listed as 7-0, but it was 6-0 and one abstention on last week's meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3494.841s">Then</a>  you can just motion to amend the minutes and maybe shoot an email over to, is it Lisa who drafted Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3506.043s">Malone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3509.056s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3511.797s">Okay,</a>  so for motion for approval by member Ruseau, as amended by member Reinfeld, is there a second as amended? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3517.838s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3521.218s">Second</a>  as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3522.479s">Roll</a>  call, please, member Olapade.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3525.799s">Member</a>  Bradley.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3539.178s">Member</a>  Intoppa, you're muted.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3540.459s">Of</a>  course I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3545.001s">I'm</a>  also just noticing another error in the minutes, so I'm gonna abstain from this one, which might be the same thing that, I'm sorry, clarification, Member Reinfeld, are you mentioning the vote on the stabilization fund?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3561.15s">Yes,</a>  I am.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3562.27s">Okay,</a>  so yeah, so as amended, then yes, I vote to approve, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3572.517s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3574.258s">Uh,</a>  the Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3575.779s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3577.26s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3578.461s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3579.422s">70</a>  affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3580.443s">Zero</a>  in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3581.184s">Motion</a>  to approve the consent agenda as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3584.507s">There</a>  are no reports of subcommittee, so I'll pass it off to Dr. Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent of schools, for updates and comments.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3595.095s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3597.06s">April</a>  is Autism Acceptance Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3600.823s">Many</a>  of you remember this observance previously being called Autism Awareness Month, but thanks to the wonderful advocacy of individuals with autism and their supporters around the world, we're making an intentional positive shift to emphasizing acceptance of all neurodiverse people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3621.236s">Their</a>  perspectives and experiences enrich and improve our community every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3628.14s">April</a>  is also Arab American Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3631.782s">Throughout</a>  American history, Arab Americans have made so many contributions to our country and our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3639.184s">And</a>  today, approximately 3.7 million Arab Americans call the United States their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3647.551s">Finally,</a>  April is an opportunity to mark OT month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3652.756s">In</a>  Medford Public Schools, we are lucky to have skilled and compassionate occupational therapy practitioners in every school and serving students at every grade and age level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3668.479s">OT</a>  makes a big difference for our kids, starting with therapeutic early intervention services and extending all the way to post-graduation transition services for students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3684.777s">Another</a>  reminder that this Wednesday, April 10th, schools are closed in observance of Eid al-Fitr. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3692.102s">And</a>  next week, believe it or not, is April vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3698.926s">All</a>  schools are closed the week of April 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3702.068s">We</a>  wish everyone a safe and fun break and look forward to returning to the classroom on April 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3711.303s">April</a>  22nd is also the date when many members of our Jewish community will begin to observe Passover. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3721.367s">Some</a>  students and staff may take time away from school for religious observances, particularly on the first two days of Passover, when the Seder meal is typically celebrated with loved ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3736.542s">I</a>  now have an update regarding our Performing Arts Recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3742.67s">Last</a>  weekend was exciting for many of Medford's Performing Arts students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3749.466s">On</a>  Saturday, the Medford High School Orchestra won a gold medal and the Middle School String Ensemble won a silver medal at the prestigious MICCA, Massachusetts Instrumental and Chorus Conductors Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3771.209s">Concert</a>  Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3772.81s">Congratulations</a>  to the students, their families, and our own conductor-director, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3779.595s">Sophia</a>  Chang, on these recognitions and accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3784.979s">Meanwhile,</a>  the Medford Mustang Winter Color Guard became the 2024 <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3792.051s">scholastic</a>  regional champions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3794.633s">Medford</a>  not only placed first in the division, but also received the highest scholastic score of the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3803.739s">We</a>  are very proud of our Mustang guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3807.245s">and</a>  their accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3808.886s">Captains</a>  Maria Zasra, Mandy Chow, and Cindy Hamill led the team through this challenging and rewarding season. <a

href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3870.418s">Please</a>  take a moment to complete it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3873.119s">It</a>  will help us identify routes and other resources to encourage and enable more Medford students to walk, bike, and roll to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3884.705s">The</a>  survey asks about a student's mode of transportation to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3890.21s">It</a>  takes less than five minutes to complete and is available in 10 languages. <a

meeting, we have another busy agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3929.236s">First,</a>  we'll present several generous donations offered by our community for the direct support of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3936.69s">We'll</a>  discuss each of these donations in more detail, but I wanted to begin by saying a warm thank you to the Medford Educational Foundation, the Medford Kiwanis Club, and the Medford Rotary Club for their reliable and impactful partnership and support of public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3957.043s">After</a>  that, Dr. Suzanne Colussi will present a report on substitute teacher pay and staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3964.809s">Especially</a>  since the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate and reliable substitute staffing has been a prominent challenge for all public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3975.758s">Medford</a>  is no exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3977.54s">So</a>  we look forward to this informative and important presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3982.421s">You</a>  may have also noticed that I called our assistant superintendent, Galusi, doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3988.984s">Yes,</a>  indeed, I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3991.025s">As</a>  you may have read in my Friday memo last week, Dr. Galusi defended, successfully defended her doctoral thesis without any revisions, which is a phenomenal feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4005.612s">last</a>  month at Boston College, the Lynch School of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4010.613s">So</a>  congratulations, Dr. Galussi, and her original research for her doctorate in educational leadership focused on transformational and culturally responsive leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4023.917s">We</a>  are so proud of you, Dr. Galussi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4027.478s">In</a>  your packets, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4029.872s">You'll</a>  also find a draft report on the district wide suspension and discipline report that was requested by the committee earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4038.558s">The</a>  final report will be presented to the committee on April 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4043.021s">So</a>  I do look forward to you communicating directly with me to send questions, additional pieces of data that you may be looking for so that I can add that to the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4055.29s">District</a>  staff are also working with the school building leaders and staff to develop this report while providing the appropriate and useful context for all of the data that it represents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4068.498s">In</a>  particular, we are working hard to ensure that the report does not inadvertently convey any identifying details about individual students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4080.105s">Again,</a>  we invite and welcome your feedback and input <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4084.386s">for</a>  the final product to be delivered to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4088.647s">Finally,</a>  in your packets, you also received school handbooks for all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4097.29s">And</a>  the high school version of the handbook that you received will be completely finalized in time for the high school presentation that will be taking place on May 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4110.675s">The</a>  high school handbook will include our Medford High School, which includes the vocational school, and also inclusive of the Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4120.945s">So</a>  all three schools will be represented in that one handbook for your review. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4126.61s">So</a>  these important guiding documents are developed by school principals, assistant principals, school site councils, input from staff, and again, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on the handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4141.773s">Thank</a>  you, and I look forward to this evening's meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4147.255s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4150.996s">We</a>  have, like you said, three recommendations to approve donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4155.043s">The</a>  first up is $3,180.11 from the Medford Educational Foundation.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4163.157s">Yes,</a>  so the Medford Educational Foundation earlier this year, they already donated $13,000 to Medford Public Schools, which was a very generous donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4173.968s">They</a>  received an additional $8,949 in requests from teachers and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4183.297s">They</a>  were able to fund $3,180. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4185.359s">And</a>  of that money, one of the things they were able to help purchase from one of our music teachers, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4195.209s">Sarah</a>  Grant, she requested four keyboards to be added to the Curtis Tufts programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4201.395s">And</a>  so we're very happy and very grateful to the Medford Educational Foundation for their generous contribution to that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4211.7s">And</a>  again, we also want to thank Needham Bank and their branch manager, Jean K. Lau, for their continued generous donations to the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4222.745s">through</a>  Medford Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4225.526s">They</a>  recently donated $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4227.087s">So</a>  I just want to ask the committee to approve this generous donation in the amount of $3,180.11 to be added to the Medford Public Schools coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4235.91s">Motion</a>  to approve with thanks.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4498.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4500.528s">Yes,</a>  yes, that's a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4502.99s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4503.39s">Do</a>  you need a roll call? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4504.291s">Are</a>  we good? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4505.071s">You</a>  got that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4506.112s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4506.652s">I</a>  don't think we need a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4508.813s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4509.794s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4510.674s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4512.616s">Next</a>  up is substitute pay report, Dr. Susan Glusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4517.051s">Assistant</a>  Superintendent of Academics and Instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4519.895s">I'll</a>  turn it over to you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4523.259s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4524.781s">Dr.</a>  Cushing's going to present the small slide deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4531.772s">So</a>  while he's searching for it, I'm just gonna kind of start. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4534.694s">So</a>  good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4539.017s">Thank</a>  you so much, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4541.159s">Tonight,</a>  I'm presenting the requested substitute teachers supply and demand report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4546.923s">As</a>  background information, the school committee stated the following rationale for requesting this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4553.807s">First,</a>  substitute teachers play a critical role in maintaining educational continuity and quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4559.251s">when</a>  regular teachers are absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4561.212s">Meanwhile,</a>  Medford appears to struggle to obtain enough substitutes to cover the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4566.016s">Second,</a>  concerns have been raised for a long while regarding the adequacy of compensation for substitute teachers and the potential effect of compensation on the quality and availability of substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4578.024s">And</a>  third, understanding patterns and reasons for teacher absenteeism is crucial for addressing any underlying issues and ensuring the effective allocation of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4588.191s">So</a>  as such, the slides presentation for this report will cover the sections listed within the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4594.353s">The</a>  first section as listed here covers substitute teacher compensation and district comparisons of substitute pay rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4603.855s">You</a>  can advance the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4605.016s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4607.236s">So</a>  the table presented here displays the details of the current substitute compensation for Metro Public Schools, which you will see has the blue highlight going right through. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4619.008s">And</a>  then you're going to see the comparison of surrounding districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4623.392s">You</a>  will notice a variance in daily rates ranging from the high end of $150 per day to Medford Public Schools at $90 per day with Woburn Public Schools, oh, thank you, at 110. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4633.54s">Dr.</a>  Cushing's trying out his pointer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4645.774s">You'll</a>  also notice that some districts have set a different long-term daily sub rate, and some districts have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4656.001s">At</a>  the current time, Medford does have two separate scales for substitutes that are working in long-term coverage needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4665.568s">If</a>  they're licensed, it's $125. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4666.649s">Otherwise,</a>  it's about $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4671.912s">Currently</a>  Medford, as you'll notice, Malden has a tiered approach, which reflects the substitute's education, experience, and licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4684.096s">Currently</a>  Medford does not have a tiered approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4690.538s">Moving.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4693.359s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4695.04s">So</a>  the second section covers substitute need and availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4701.289s">and</a>  you can go to the, so the chart that is displayed on here correlates the total number of teacher absences to the total number filled by a substitute for school year 23, excuse me, 22-23, which is highlighted in the gray bars, and then currently for school year 23-24. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4724.615s">It's</a>  important to note a few things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4727.096s">First,</a>  absences reflect a variety of reasons, ranging from sick days, personal days, jury duty, bereavement, religious observances, professional development or conference needs, and then various forms of a leave of absence, which could be family medical leave act, maternity, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4752.921s">workman's</a>  compensation, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4755.203s">So</a>  that is the third column, which for each school year is just a data point to acknowledge that there are leaves of absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4767.031s">And</a>  each leave of absence ranges drastically in the amount of days that a teacher may be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4776.497s">So</a>  that data point is going to fluctuate drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4783.086s">You</a>  will also notice that the amount of, this data is just for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4789.269s">So</a>  it does not include any other staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4791.991s">And</a>  the number of total teachers is listed underneath the school name. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4798.595s">There</a>  are two asterisks at the bottom of this chart that I think are important to note. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4802.897s">And</a>  one is that there are 17 teachers who have like a district wide status. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4807.84s">And</a>  so they're not reflected in this chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4810.521s">and</a>  that the total number of teachers active also fluctuates due to various needs for leave of absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4819.425s">Currently,</a>  there are 495 employed teachers, but 489 are currently active as of right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4828.87s">In</a>  looking at, you can see that there are trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4832.691s">The</a>  total absences by building for last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4839.875s">For</a>  the most part, absences have drastically fell for this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4845.458s">In</a>  some schools, maybe not all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4847.839s">So</a>  hopefully we're seeing that kind of, as we move closer away from the pandemic will start to see these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4857.563s">improve</a>  a bit, but last year if we averaged out the daily need for a sub, it was 55 subs district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4866.931s">That</a>  includes all reasons for absences. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4871.234s">And</a>  then this year our average daily need for substitutes is about 32 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4881.162s">I'm</a>  sure there'll be questions, but I don't know if you want me to pause or continue going. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4886.357s">All</a>  right, I'm gonna continue going. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4887.558s">So</a>  the third section in this report covers the substitute pool and the current coverage structure for Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4897.967s">So</a>  our active pool of substitutes for school year 22-23 consisted of 38 substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4903.672s">Three</a>  of those were assigned as long-term subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4912.495s">While</a>  this year, our current active pool is 46 substitutes, and six of those have been assigned as long-term substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4922.904s">So</a>  we have been increasing the pool of substitutes from year to year, but it still cannot meet the current demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4933.332s">Most</a>  of our substitute pool comprises of college students, current Medford Public Schools, caregivers, and retired professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4943.118s">The</a>  availability of substitutes, because of that compromise of pool, does fluctuate throughout the school year, especially around college students and their availability in the months of January, May, and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4961.075s">It</a>  is important to note at the end of each school year, substitutes are classified as inactive until they complete the yearly CORI, which is like the background check, and then they're activated again within our system and able to continue working. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4975.967s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, if you mind going to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4979.069s">This</a>  is just a current structure of some internal coverage that we try to employ within the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4987.953s">So</a>  first, there are instructional support staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4991.695s">Honestly,</a>  aka, these are the building substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4995.738s">And</a>  so we have <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4998.544s">through</a>  ESSER, but we have one budgeted position at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5002.368s">However,</a>  not each school has been able to fill the need of one dedicated position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5008.314s">Currently,</a>  the Curtis Tufts, the McGlynn Elementary School, the Brooks, and the Andrews has a dedicated, what we call ISS, or building sub. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5017.663s">The</a>  Roberts, the Missituk, and the McGlynn Middle have not been able to fill this position to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5023.53s">The</a>  other position that we have are academic support leads. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5027.032s">These</a>  are new positions to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5030.814s">So</a>  with the shift in leadership, Principal Cabral created two dedicated positions this year to help alleviate daily absent coverages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5043.501s">And</a>  their title is the academic support lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5046.405s">And</a>  then the third layer is a student supervisory assistant or SSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5052.427s">These</a>  were created during the pandemic to help alleviate some of the coverage needs around lunch supervision or just daily coverage needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5062.491s">These</a>  positions are unique because they work no more than about 18 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5068.097s">Currently,</a>  right now, we have an SSA position at the Missituk, the Brooks, and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5074.682s">It</a>  is important to note that some of our SSAs were hired as paraprofessionals in the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5084.594s">I</a>  also think before going on to the fourth section, it's very important to note that the structural nature of the secondary school level lends itself to covering teacher absences in a way that's just not possible at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5101.165s">For</a>  example, at both the middle school and the high school level, there are designated study halls or teachers that can be assigned based on their schedules or open blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5114.654s">while</a>  at the elementary level that's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5117.075s">And</a>  so principals are unfortunately forced to make difficult decisions to cover the class with in-school resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5125.859s">And</a>  those in-school resources can range from the ISS or building sub, but it could also include specialist teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5134.289s">like</a>  Art, Music, PE, Computer, Library, Nexus, and it also can include reading and EL teachers, as well as school leaders themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5147.794s">And</a>  those coverages can range between blocks of time to the entire day worth of coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5155.151s">Okay,</a>  we may go to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5157.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5157.997s">So</a>  the fourth section covers the budget impact of everything I just presented here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5163.367s">So</a>  on this next table, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5167.88s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5168.66s">This</a>  next table details the teacher coverage and loss of prep as a result of, especially at the elementary level, but especially due to lack of substitutes and the need for teacher coverages. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5186.408s">So</a>  you will see that last year, in total, we spent $448,960 just in teacher coverages and loss of prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5192.512s">The</a>  anomaly, as noted in the comments section for March of 2023, includes a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5200.656s">One,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5209.497s">It</a>  includes, so when the contract was ratified, there was the retro pay of per hour rate for teachers increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5219.7s">And</a>  so that resulted in about $34,730 that were paid to teachers on March 2nd per the contract to account for that retro need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5233.83s">Last</a>  year, there were also a great deal of coverage needs at Medford High School and the Andrews Middle School, which resulted in the total cost there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5245.39s">You</a>  can see currently for this school year, all of the data from all the graphs compiled for this report go up into March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5255.412s">So</a>  we do not have clearly, but data for April, May or June. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5260.793s">So</a>  to date, our current total of teacher coverage and loss of prep is $34,408.89. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5265.434s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5273.072s">breaks</a>  down the total impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5275.133s">So</a>  you can see the graph, excuse me, the column in the middle has our anticipated budget, which was what we allocated in the operating budget to cover substitute needs as well as teacher loss of prep and teacher coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5293.166s">versus</a>  what we're actually spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5295.548s">I</a>  think it's important to note here, as you noticed for last year's spend, which was fiscal year 2023, we ended that year with a total of $878,327. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5303.192s">That</a>  number includes <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5313.635s">the</a>  $448,000 and change from the previous slide because this spending includes all three. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5323.763s">It</a>  includes what we pay for substitutes, what we pay for teacher coverage, and what we pay for loss of prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5331.369s">So</a>  if we were to subtract the $878,324,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5338.28s">by</a>  the 448 and change, you'd get the total cost we spent on substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5345.704s">And</a>  then the final section. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5348.614s">is</a>  our recommendations and next steps to address the findings of this report and how to effectively address substitute supply and demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5358.045s">And</a>  so, final slide, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5361.289s">Some</a>  of the things that we've been talking about internally are adjustments to the current substitute teacher compensation structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5370.953s">We're</a>  discussing it and we're vetting out the implementation for fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5376.624s">This</a>  includes, but is not limited to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5380.317s">increasing</a>  the pay scale for substitute teachers and for the instructional support staff position, considering the establishment of a tiered pay scale system similar to what we saw for Malden, which includes consideration of a substitute's experience, licensure, and level of education, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5402.421s">as</a>  well as looking into the feasibility of using an educational staffing company to build a greater pool of substitutes and also to help arrange and organize daily coverage needs, which is being used in some districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5418.688s">So</a>  that vetting process of the educational staffing company has been ongoing all year, but these are some of the ways that we're looking to remediate and mitigate the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5433.752s">And</a>  at this time, if you have any questions, please let me know.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5441.395s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Galusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5443.536s">Any</a>  questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5447.697s">Member</a>  Branley, then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5453.72s">Just</a>  want to make sure that you can hear me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5456.321s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5458.169s">Okay,</a>  so just a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5462.535s">Let's</a>  see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5466.74s">Do</a>  we have data on how often we're pulling reading specialists, EL teachers, specialists, you know, music, PE?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5478.903s">Yes,</a>  and I can get that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5480.325s">I</a>  don't have it at my disposal right now, but I know most of the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5485.75s">I</a>  think the tricky part would maybe be data from last year, where there was a turnover at one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5491.276s">But</a>  I know principals have been keeping that data, so I can get that for you, definitely.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5498.493s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5498.933s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5499.414s">If</a>  you could share that with us, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5502.276s">And</a>  then my question, what is the difference between a teacher coverage and a loss of prep? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5507.68s">I</a>  know when I was at the Brooks, a loss of prep was, okay, you know, Mr. Sacco's absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5513.385s">There's</a>  no one to cover loss of prep.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5516.287s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5517.668s">So</a>  teacher coverage is that</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5521.032s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5522.053s">No,</a>  it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5522.873s">Teacher</a>  coverage, you mostly see at the secondary level, but it's when teachers, you know, outside of contractual obligations are covering or they're picking up a coverage due to an absence or a long-term absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5535.661s">And</a>  so we have to pay for that coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5540.284s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5544.647s">They're</a>  taking on the teaching duties or the coverage of the class for the absent teacher.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5551.67s">Okay,</a>  and then loss of prep and teacher coverage paid at different rates.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5556.412s">So</a>  in the previous contract, it was $30 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5560.694s">And</a>  in the new contract, it's now $40 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5564.276s">So</a>  if you're speaking about what was owed to them retroactively, we had to go back to when the dates reflected in the contract and add $10 to all of the teachers who either provided coverage or lost their prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5581.479s">for</a>  the year.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5581.919s">Okay,</a>  so teacher coverage and loss of prep is both $40 an hour now.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5585.94s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5590.341s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5591.561s">Um,</a>  I think that was all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5595.082s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5595.782s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5596.862s">Member</a>  Graham and then member old party.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5600.523s">Um,</a>  well, all of these, um, sort of recommendations and next step be reflected in the budget that we see at our meeting after April vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5610.625s">Um,</a>  or <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5611.656s">Are</a>  these going to take more time to unfold beyond that meeting?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5619.444s">I</a>  think probably, honestly, I want to have that conversation with the superintendent and Gerry McCue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5626.25s">but</a>  I know I've been having ongoing, we have been engaging in ongoing conversations all year with Mr. McHugh around this and both Mr. McHugh and I have had meetings with the company to see what we could do, but I can get that definite answer from you once I speak to Mr. McHugh.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5649.098s">Yeah,</a>  I think it would just be helpful when we meet next about the budget, either to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5655.549s">that</a>  it is included in the it is contemplated in the numbers that we're going to look at that we're looking at at that time or it's not and if it is like what are we saying we're changing so just if we could clarify that when we whenever we talk about the budget whether this is being reflected in or not that's i think that's my major question yeah we do that point point of clarification is that</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5682.023s">Mr.</a>  McHugh has already spoken about, and one of the slides clearly showed that we're under, the budget for this need, it does not reflect, they're not balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5694.849s">So</a>  the only thing I wanna check with him is if it's part of the April 23rd meeting, or if it's part of the May 8th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5704.053s">That's</a>  what I'll clarify with him.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5705.394s">Okay,</a>  and then I think the other thing is if we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5709.056s">I</a>  mean, I think the other point of this, um, report was to say, should we be adjusting our, our rate schedule at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5718.018s">Um,</a>  yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5719.798s">And</a>  so I think the other question for the budget reports is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5724.199s">What</a>  at what rate is he projecting when he is making his calculations? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5729.92s">So</a>  is it at our current rate or is it at some other rate that we're going to go forward with or that you're recommending we go forward with?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5739.904s">we're,</a>  I mean, I don't want to quote an amount, but we're definitely recommending an increase in the rate.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5746.948s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5747.268s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5747.428s">I</a>  think it's just whenever we're talking about the budget, if we could just be clear about like what rate we are anchoring to from a sub pay perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5756.293s">So</a>  just so that we understand where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5759.454s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5760.495s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5760.895s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5762.696s">Um,</a>  member of the party, the member. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5766.098s">Ryan</a>  felt.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5768.587s">Yeah,</a>  thank you so much for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5770.468s">A</a>  couple of questions on the way way end of the of the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5773.97s">So</a>  when it comes to the feasibility of working with like ESS or like swing education, for example, is there a timeline that they would require us to, you know, put forth our want to work with them in partnership so that we have an idea about if we want to implement that, let's say, for the beginning of next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5789.48s">Is</a>  there a timeline on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5790.461s">We</a>  haven't really started the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5792.458s">No,</a>  we have started that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5794.079s">And</a>  to date, there is not a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5797.621s">The</a>  only thing that they're clear about is that they can't build a pool overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5803.163s">And</a>  so they spoke a lot about the recruitment strategies that they would utilize to increase our existing substitute pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5810.647s">And</a>  so they're just careful to say whenever they, let's say potentially we were to utilize them, whenever we engage in that partnership, it will take, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5822.403s">you</a>  know, to their end, couple weeks, couple months to build an adequate sub pool for the district.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5828.007s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5829.588s">And</a>  then when it comes to the cost, does that fluctuate depending on how much we're, you know, sourcing out for their, for their aid for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5837.474s">Or</a>  is that just a flat kind of fee, um, because we're in partnership with them or was that again, part of the conversation with them in general?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5844.759s">Um,</a>  no, some of that is part of the conversation, but I mean, they will use our existing rates that we have set. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5853.024s">I</a>  mean, they were clear that they'd like to see an increase in those rates, but they will use the current rates that are already set. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5860.569s">And</a>  then they take on for a temporary time, kind of full ownership of the staff, which means they'll do like the training and the onboarding, they'll do the organizing of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5874.199s">They'll</a>  deal with that for the first couple months of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5877.362s">And</a>  so there is, they take a percentage of <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5884.388s">the</a>  fee, the pay.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5888.054s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5889.336s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5891.981s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5893.578s">Yep,</a>  thank you, Dr. Galussi. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5895.919s">I</a>  have a couple of clarification questions, which is to note, so the table of substitute coverage, this school year, these numbers are over eight months, whereas the previous year is over 10 months, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5909.786s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5910.726s">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5911.987s">But</a>  the number is still higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5913.728s">Was</a>  school year 2022-23 particularly high in absence, or are we... <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5922.283s">or</a>  was this year particularly low? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5924.885s">Without</a>  more context on either side, I can't quite tell.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5929.689s">So</a>  I will be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5930.57s">I</a>  mean, I did not go and do a deep dive into pre-pandemic numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5935.753s">So</a>  I could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5936.934s">I</a>  mean, I do think that the absences and the need for absences has definitely been decreasing as we're kind of going <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5952.043s">month</a>  by month, year by year out of the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5956.647s">So</a>  I think, but also the need for leaves of absence fluctuates so much, which you can also see in that chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5965.135s">And</a>  that's a definite factor in terms of some of them might've been entire years of a leave of absence, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5973.383s">So,</a>  and some of them may have been short-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5976.817s">I</a>  can get some more data for you if you would like a comparison to pre-pandemic.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5983.805s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just trying to figure out how we can project ahead as to what the need is going to be and what's typical here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5989.091s">Are</a>  things actively going down because the needs are changing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5997.096s">or</a>  not?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5997.656s">I</a>  think there may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5998.937s">Yeah,</a>  I think there may be a lot of reasons at play. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6001.197s">I</a>  would be curious to kind of watch the trajectory from year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6009.22s">But.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6011.161s">Great,</a>  so and then one little question, do long term subs attend planning periods and team school grade level planning? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6019.684s">Is</a>  that part of the long term sub responsibility?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6023.995s">Yes,</a>  for during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6025.576s">I</a>  would have to get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6028.518s">I</a>  think some attend staff meetings and training sessions, while not all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6032.54s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6034.762s">But</a>  common planning time during the day with teams, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6039.024s">Good</a>  to know.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6040.565s">Yeah,</a>  and then I just wanted to confirm, I think you introduced some information that may have shifted my numbers, but it looks <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6050.279s">we're</a>  spending 50 to 60% of the spending on substitutes is in-house, but in-house folks are covering about 86% of the need here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6060.182s">So</a>  if we are shifting away from in-house coverage, we're going to see that percentage change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6066.525s">Although</a>  I do want to say, especially noting that there are a lot of teachers here, thank you for this coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6071.126s">It</a>  is much appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6072.707s">And</a>  I think that's, especially at the elementary level, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6081.317s">At</a>  the elementary level, it's at the expense of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6084.499s">So</a>  I think we do have to look at the amount of money that we are spending on coverages and loss of PrEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6093.845s">It</a>  may be difficult at the beginning, but we're talking salaries or increases in that substitute pay, because especially at the elementary level, they get one PrEP a day and it's not guaranteed because <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6110.524s">if</a>  the art teacher is out, if the music teacher is out, they lose their one and only planning period for the day, as well as, as I mentioned, support staff being pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6122.853s">And</a>  then that means we're affecting students and their services, and that's not equitable, and that's not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6130.278s">So</a>  we do have to do something to increase that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6136.417s">because</a>  right now we also don't have an active sub-pool that meets the daily demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6140.559s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6142.34s">So</a>  I definitely want to second what Member Branley said about understanding where the, what coverage, where the services are being sacrificed in these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6153.573s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6154.513s">And</a>  then I also wanted to ask, you mentioned a few of the things that the staffing company would do in terms of onboarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6161.474s">I</a>  always have this question when we bring in consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6163.795s">What</a>  is the added value of paying a staffing company to do this work versus things that we've thought of in-house, such as just raising the rates of pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6171.816s">Why</a>  are we bringing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6173.677s">What</a>  else would the company add that would make that better?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6179.958s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6181.457s">Right</a>  now, we currently don't have a position that I would say, don't quote me on this title, but I would just say like attendance coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6193.2s">Let's</a>  just say we don't have someone right now that works on recruitment and that actually organizes daily coverage needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6202.942s">So</a>  the way it works right now is we have an online portal called Frontline, and teachers, when they need to be absent, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6211.957s">they</a>  go in digitally and they record their absence in that system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6217.56s">Our</a>  current pool of substitutes are also connected within this system and they can go in, they log in, they can see all of the coverages that are needed within the district and they select the ones that they want to take as work for the following day or that morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6236.852s">But</a>  there isn't someone that's maybe actively making phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6241.724s">and</a>  trying to connect substitutes to the coverages that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6247.687s">We're</a>  just relying on the online portal.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6249.848s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6254.29s">That</a>  makes sense, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6255.291s">I'm</a>  just trying to understand where that money is gonna go to hire someone outside versus to the people doing the substituting, doing the coverages.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6271.988s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6273.029s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Galusi.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6274.81s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6275.171s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6278.314s">Do</a>  you need a vote to go to Malden's rates or are you gonna come back to us at the next meeting once we have more of the budget figured out?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6285.72s">I</a>  think we'll come back to you with what finance and the superintendent is recommending.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6293.166s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6295.489s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6296.624s">Next</a>  up, we have new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6298.385s">We</a>  have offered by member and Tapa recognition of Autism Acceptance Month, whereas Autism Acceptance Month is recognized in the month of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6306.811s">And</a>  whereas Autism Acceptance Day is recognized on the 2nd of April, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools and Medford School Committee recognize Autism Acceptance Month within the Medford Public School System, recognize for future usage Autism Acceptance Day as April 2nd on all official Medford Public School calendars distributed <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6326.564s">to</a>  the public and report to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students impacted by autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and how we go about identifying students who may need these services that have yet to receive them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6346.093s">Explanation,</a>  those within the advocates of the autism spectrum, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6351.169s">Community</a>  are looking to distance themselves from groups that treat autism as a disease and something that needs to be healed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6357.152s">The</a>  focus is not on awareness of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, but more of a focus on acceptance of the members of our community that fall under the autism spectrum and making sure there are equitable systemic pathways for their success, being conscious of decisions that may impact members of the ASD community, both systematically and socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6376.961s">This</a>  is the first step in this process to better understand <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6380.302s">and</a>  see how we as a city can better serve our community members impacted by ASD. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6384.885s">I'll</a>  turn it over to you Member Intoppa for a motion or anything else you'd like to add.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6390.369s">Thank</a>  you very much Chair Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6396.392s">Yeah</a>  I just wanted to put this motion forward to sort of recognize and also I guess more amend our current calendar so I know we have we take a vote in November to put forward days of observance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6408.58s">I</a>  also want to clarify <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6410.185s">This</a>  is not a day off holiday I'm looking to put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6413.147s">It</a>  is more of a day of observance, day of acknowledgement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6416.71s">Currently</a>  as it stands, the last calendar I had checked, it is referred to as Autism Awareness Day, Autism Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6424.636s">And</a>  this motion looks to amend that and to change that language, whether it has to get tabled till November or if we can do it right now, which would be preferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6433.943s">So</a>  it's where it's already labeled and where it needs to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6440.663s">The</a>  third part of the motion, the clarification about identifying students is how we're looking at how we are screening, screening techniques, as well as looking at ways that parents can come to us as a district to look at receiving services, however, they may need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6462.592s">This</a>  is something that I would like in writing and to sort of get a report on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6465.774s">I</a>  have a personal, this comes from a, and the explanation kind of talks about it, of looking at how we make change and how we are impacted as a former student in the Medford Public Schools with an IEP who belongs in the neurodivergent community on the spectrum of the attention deficit disorder spectrum. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6487.623s">This</a>  is something that I witnessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6490.359s">I</a>  witnessed students who had 504s and IEPs, their struggles, how some of them would lose them because they were doing better, which to me makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6500.322s">Because</a>  if you're doing better on a plan, you're doing better because of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6504.022s">It</a>  helps you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6506.163s">So,</a>  I'm really looking to see what we are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6509.284s">And</a>  this is sort of the 1st kind of steps and looking at how we as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6515.222s">can</a>  become allies within the autistic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6517.803s">I'd</a>  like to make another point of, um, the use of disorder, um, uh, is not so popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6524.906s">And</a>  my apologies for using the official language. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6527.867s">Um,</a>  but also, um, you know, this really, really comes from, um, my personal experience working with those, um, within the autistic community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6537.611s">Um,</a>  as my buddy Dan puts it best, it's pretty easy for me to make you aware that I have autism and that usually proceeds to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6544.868s">But</a>  it's really hard for members of the community to accept me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6549.051s">And</a>  I would like to mitigate that harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6552.833s">We're</a>  talking at a higher education level. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6554.934s">Mitigate</a>  the harmful effects that this has on our students before they even get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6560.998s">And</a>  as someone who's been looked at funny and scrutinized because of my diagnosis, this is my way of putting steps forward for better allyship. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6572.994s">But</a>  we also want to look at the success. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6574.895s">We</a>  want to look more at the success, not so much as a disease needs to be healed, as mentioned in the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6581.718s">But</a>  I feel like we can't do that until we look at how we are helping and how we are aiding the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6587.861s">So</a>  that is all I have on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6592.483s">Thank</a>  you, Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6593.483s">So</a>  I'm going to assume you're moving approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6596.105s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6604.605s">I</a>  can second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6605.826s">I</a>  second by member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6608.087s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vincent?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6609.428s">Yes,</a>  I guess as I was just listening to the description, on bullet number three, I completely agree with autism acceptance month, but where it's saying how students are identified, like there is a process that has to be followed legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6631.36s">And</a>  so I'm not sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6635.906s">I</a>  guess I need clarification or I'm not sure on the ask of saying do you want something that we legally have to do as a district to switch the way in <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6652.065s">either</a>  changing the wording or I guess I'm just not clear about point number three, because there are things that we have to follow legally by DESE, when IEPs are being developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6665.053s">And</a>  I agree students should not be treated as if they need to be healed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6670.936s">But</a>  I just wasn't sure about what was being approved when it says how we go about identifying students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6678.299s">Because</a>  there's medical documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6680.861s">The</a>  medical community sends recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6684.522s">There's</a>  official IEP testing that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6689.345s">And</a>  I just want to be clear on <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6693.461s">what</a>  the ask is because I don't want the committee to be saying yes, they approve it and putting the school in a position where we are not following the appropriate regulations that we should be following.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6712.955s">Understood,</a>  Dr. Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6714.676s">So</a>  maybe some clarification for member and topper, or would you like to amend section three of your resolution?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6722.801s">Yeah,</a>  I think, thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent for bringing to your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6728.565s">I</a>  think that's what I'm just looking to see is what are the procedures we have to follow? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6735.409s">That's</a>  really, I'm sorry if the phrasing is, this is my first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6739.912s">My</a>  apologies if the phrasing is weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6742.947s">But</a>  yeah, I'm looking to see what protocols are from DESE.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6746.709s">Okay,</a>  so you're looking for information rather than us providing services to people that need them, even if they haven't been identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6754.373s">Right,</a>  I'm looking, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6756.114s">So</a>  you're looking to change that report to the school committee on steps being taken to provide supports for those impacted by autism spectrum disorder? <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6767.021s">Correct,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6768.041s">Good,</a>  as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6769.742s">Yeah,</a>  that would be good as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6771.704s">I</a>  would say a better method would be reports to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students on the autism spectrum, due to just recommendations from the community on language surrounding how we address it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6785.617s">Okay,</a>  so then just strike the second half of that, number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6790.121s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6790.421s">Correct,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6791.582s">And</a>  for approval by member Intoppa, as amended by member Intoppa, seconded by member Branley, roll call, please.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6798.464s">have</a>  a motion to amend the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.484s">I</a>  may. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.925s">Yeah</a>  Member Reinfeld had their hand up.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6802.226s">Oh</a>  yeah, okay.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6803.146s">Member</a>  Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6804.827s">I</a>  just in regards to point number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6806.667s">Our</a>  policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6808.328s">I</a>  see I see a, uh, lists this as although as awareness day, so I think that's a pretty easy motion to amend that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6816.831s">The</a>  question of putting it on calendars is a little different because we have the public calendar that is the closures and then there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6828.796s">that</a>  we recognize Awareness Acceptance Advocacy Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6832.52s">And</a>  so I'm wondering if that is part of, in terms of distribution to the public, is part of the longer conversation about the calendar and how it's published. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6842.608s">But</a>  absolutely, I think we should amend the policy as it currently exists, that line there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6848.861s">And</a>  then my question on number three, I wondered if it would make sense, although possibly not with the suggestion just approved, for the subcommittee to sit down with CPAC, the Medford Family Network's autism <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6865.459s">spectrum</a>  parent support group and then the conversation around procedural safeguards and FERPA and all of those screening things and then prepare something that the full committee might be able to approve with a concrete step for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6883.111s">I</a>  wonder if that information gathering might be well suited for subcommittee with members of the community.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6895.33s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6896.53s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6898.691s">Can</a>  I add to that suggestion that this go to the Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee for that review?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6915.178s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6916.238s">Member</a>  Topper, is that okay?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6918.559s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6920.099s">That</a>  would be great to have that conversation with CPAC as well as bring that to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6925.702s">And</a>  also to answer, sorry, to answer the question at hand of the school's calendars to reach the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6934.866s">Yes,</a>  it would amend it to where it is already written to where that to where days of observance are listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6942.289s">Because</a>  it has also been brought point of singling out 1 holiday is a concern, which I fully understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6948.391s">So,</a>  wherever this would naturally be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6952.153s">Written</a>  is where we would like to see it amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6957.068s">So</a>  yes, all recommendations of amendment are taken into consideration for the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6965.094s">Okay,</a>  motion to move to committee as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6968.676s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>
