Please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:43,735
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,057
The chair recognizes Councilor Carviello for a motion to suspend the rules.

21
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:51,837
All those in favor?

22
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:53,218
All those opposed?

23
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:54,578
Motion granted.

24
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:58,279
Suspension of the rules to take one paper out of order, that being

25
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:03,126
Request for expenditure from the law department claims over $1,000.

26
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:20,449
Communications from the mayor, 15-681, dated September 24th, 2015, to President DelaRusso, members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, claimant's name, Adrian Napel, and John Grebe.

27
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,869
Date of settlement, September 24th, 2015.

28
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:23,369
Amount requested, $24,000.

29
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,685
claimant's attorney, Adam Sherwin Esquire.

30
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:56,571
Description of alleged claim, the city of Medford, the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust, and Adrian Appel, John Grebe, the caretakers of the Brooks Estate, desire us to settle the various issues relating to the caretakers' residency at Brooks Estate that include, but are not limited to, the caretakers having become parents of a newborn baby girl during 2014, and the presence of lead in a historical structure such as the Brooks Estate,

31
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,929
that contains various levels of lead.

32
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,630
A copy of the lease and settlement agreements is attached to this request.

33
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,771
Breakdown on the request totals out to $24,000.

34
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:13,534
And present here with us this evening is the city solicitor to speak to us on this matter.

35
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:14,754
Mr. Solicitor.

36
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,256
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

37
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,356
My name is Mark Rumley.

38
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,337
I'm the city solicitor.

39
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,998
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

40
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:33,044
This matter has been talked about with the Council a few times over the past, I'd say, 8 to 10 weeks.

41
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:38,369
It would have come before you tonight with an adjusted signed agreement.

42
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:49,618
There had been some changes because of the time that's passed since this was first submitted to the Council, and I wanted to avoid giving you the amended or adjusted agreement

43
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:53,739
so that you just would be receiving it tonight and not have had the opportunity to read it.

44
00:02:54,619 --> 00:03:04,602
Um, and so, uh, with the agreement of the, uh, of Mr. Sherwin, we'd asked the council if you would be so gracious as to, uh, table this.

45
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,202
So I have it come up again next week.

46
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:16,244
And I can assure you that in your packets on Friday, if not before electronically, a copy of the, uh, agreement with the changes will be before you.

47
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,305
What I wanted to avoid is the,

48
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,905
is the reasonable complaint that you just got that paper tonight and you hadn't had an opportunity to review it.

49
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:35,051
The changes are drastically different from the original, but nonetheless, as a matter of courtesy, we'd ask for this matter to come up next week.

50
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,935
So on the motion of Council on the night to table the matter?

51
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,357
Mr. President, I'll put it before you.

52
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:55,236
Mr. Rumley, if we â€” can we ask a question through you that you can relay to maybe Embelt or whoever you've been dealing with to put this settlement together?

53
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:55,576
Mr. Rumley.

54
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,718
I would have no difficulty with you asking a question.

55
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:58,578
Not at all.

56
00:03:58,598 --> 00:03:58,918
The President.

57
00:03:59,259 --> 00:03:59,579
Okay.

58
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,441
My question would be the fact that there were caretakers in there since 2007.

59
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:13,607
And at the time, I believe they said it was a necessity to keep vandalism down and also to maintain the

60
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:15,709
integrity of the building.

61
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,751
They were responsible for certain functions.

62
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:34,300
And my question is, what will be from here on in, after this, if and when this agreement is approved, what will be the management and what will be the protocol for the upkeep of that particular building?

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,822
Will there be a need for caretakers again?

64
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:42,506
I think that's a reasonable and prudent question, and we'd certainly be able to provide you with a response.

65
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:42,966
Thank you.

66
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:50,433
So on the motion to table by Councilor Knight, which is undebatable, roll call has been requested on that motion.

67
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,214
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

68
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:00,415
Councilor Luccio?

69
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:03,216
Councilor Cabriello?

70
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,156
That was a yes.

71
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:08,117
Councilor Knight?

72
00:05:08,477 --> 00:05:08,617
Yes.

73
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:09,977
Vice President Malauulu?

74
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:18,668
Yes, with a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

75
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,570
The motion to table passes.

76
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,011
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,192
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

78
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:28,677
On the motion of Councilor Caviello to revert back to the regular order of business.

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,202
Yeah, and what number is that here?

80
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:59,825
Oh, yeah, 15-420, Mr. President.

81
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:08,973
On the motion of Councilor Caviello to take 15-420 off the table.

82
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,595
All those in favor?

83
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:11,716
Those opposed?

84
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,237
Motion is before us.

85
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:18,042
15-420, Keena Togo, Asha Patel, Spring Street, Super-Ed.

86
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,109
88 Spring Street in Medford.

87
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:26,973
Counselor, as chairman of the licensing subcommittee, could you bring us, refresh our memories on this?

88
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:32,077
Yes, Mr. President, this motion had been denied because it had to go back to the Lottery Commission.

89
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:44,605
It has since been approved by the Lottery Commission, and it's been approved in a public hearing by the Board of Appeals.

90
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:48,447
So at this point, Mr. President, the papers are in order.

91
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,551
And a motion for approval.

92
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,912
Could you, can we have a read?

93
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:57,312
Is there synopsis of the decision?

94
00:06:57,332 --> 00:07:00,613
Do you want me to read it?

95
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,794
Please.

96
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:16,397
The board visited the premises of 88 Spring Street and observed a spacious area adjacent to the primary retail portion of the store where petitioner purposes to install the keynote monitor and seating.

97
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,538
The board found the area to be clean and convenient,

98
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:22,409
without apparent interruption of the routine traffic at the retail side of the store.

99
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:36,317
Petitioner Asha Ben-Patel and her husband had operated Spring Street Super Red at 88 Spring Street for a number of years prior to the husband's premature death in 2014 at the age of 49.

100
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:46,183
Petitioner continues to operate the popular convenience store, including at Commonwealth of Massachusetts Lottery Station and at Takeaway Commonwealth Massachusetts Kino Station.

101
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:51,206
while not directly related to the criteria required for the granting of a variance.

102
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:59,071
DeVore was nevertheless impressed with the petitioner's reputation and worth, as well as her child's academic performance at UMass.

103
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:02,172
Very good.

104
00:08:02,553 --> 00:08:05,814
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

105
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:06,895
Councilor Penta?

106
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:08,316
Quick question.

107
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,057
Is this just because the husband died and it's a change in name?

108
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:11,818
Is this what we're doing?

109
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,359
No, they had asked for the license.

110
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:23,068
And it had expired, so they needed to go to the Board of Appeals to change the zoning for a variance.

111
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,569
And the variance had been granted.

112
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,570
And the license was granted by the Commonwealth of Mass also.

113
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,570
Is the petitioner present?

114
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,311
No.

115
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,212
This was delivered to me.

116
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,132
Well, I don't understand.

117
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:38,852
Why did it have to go to the Board of Appeals?

118
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:40,853
Not conforming use.

119
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,945
Mr. Clerk, if you could refresh our memories.

120
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,246
The clerk's going to speak now.

121
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,407
I'll go back to the paper.

122
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:50,029
This took place in, it was a non-conforming, if I recall, Mr. Clerk.

123
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,811
April 22nd, around there.

124
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,812
It was a non-conforming use.

125
00:08:57,173 --> 00:09:00,095
And they had Kino to go.

126
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:03,417
And their application was Kino with a monitor.

127
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:10,881
And that would have needed a variance to conduct that.

128
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:16,259
So we, so the council at that night couldn't grant a no objection.

129
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,003
They sent them back to go get a variance from the board of appeals, which they did.

130
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:23,425
The board of appeals granted the variance.

131
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:31,993
Mr. President, can we get a copy of that law, that requirement that says that they had to go to the board of appeals?

132
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:33,655
I don't remember ever seeing that.

133
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,616
I think we sent it to the table based on that.

134
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,237
No, I know, but I'd like to see that.

135
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,738
So for the future, we know.

136
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,880
The councilor just received that decision.

137
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,702
So the clerk will send that out to us.

138
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:49,684
But if that's a Zoning Board decision?

139
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,765
Board of Appeals made a decision on June 30th.

140
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,246
When was the public hearing on that?

141
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:54,706
June 30th.

142
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:55,807
Of this past year?

143
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:56,087
Yes.

144
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:56,768
For this?

145
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:57,428
Yes.

146
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,228
To the change, Kano to go, not this.

147
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:05,534
That was done by the state, but as I say, the permit was refused on April 29th.

148
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,779
They applied for a variance and they went before the Mass State Lottery Commission.

149
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,064
And they were approved then also.

150
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,888
So the Mass State Lottery Commission approved it?

151
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:18,228
Yes.

152
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:24,749
and then it had to come back to the city, and then it had to go to the Board of Appeals, because apparently that's not in our zoning ordinance, is that correct?

153
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,431
Is that in our zoning ordinance now and been advertised?

154
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:31,414
Is that now in our zoning ordinance that's been advertised?

155
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,756
I don't remember seeing that come before the council for an advertisement.

156
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:35,837
They came before the council.

157
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:40,020
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

158
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:46,245
Just to clarify for Councilor Pinto, they came before us on April 28th, and we tabled the matter pending

159
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,478
the Board of Appeals as well as Mass State Lottery.

160
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,279
It's actually unfinished business still.

161
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,720
I understand that.

162
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,241
I want to make sure that I understand that.

163
00:10:54,341 --> 00:11:00,324
Rick, are you saying that subsequent to us tabling this, they had to take that back to the Mass State Lottery?

164
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:00,484
Yes.

165
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:01,645
And they approved it?

166
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:02,045
Yes.

167
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:06,527
And then it came back here to the Board of Appeals in June, you said?

168
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:08,888
They had a hearing on June 30th.

169
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:09,268
Okay.

170
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:10,729
Can we get copies of that, please?

171
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:11,910
Yes, it's in our packet.

172
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:14,050

The clerk will send us copies in our next packet.

174
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,034
So, Councilor Knight wishes to speak.

175
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,416
Mr. President, I just ask that I be recorded in opposition to the measure.

176
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,418
I don't feel as though we need keynote followers in our convenience stores.

177
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:29,258
Very good.

178
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:35,922
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello for approval, which would be non-opposition.

179
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:37,983
All those in favor?

180
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:38,443
Aye.

00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:39,064

182
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:40,963
Opposed?

183
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:41,804
Councilor Knight.

184
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,465
Motion carries.

185
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:48,109
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello to revert back to the regular order of business.

186
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:48,970
All those in favor?

187
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,270
Aye.

188
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,371
All those opposed?

189
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,232
Motion granted.

190
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:58,418
Hearings 15-629 City of Medford notice of public hearing.

191
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:09,047
A public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium City Hall, 86 George P. Assett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts on Tuesday evening, September 29th,

00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:30,680

193
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,421
On said site being located in the C1, that's commercial one, zoning district.

194
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,311
The amendation is for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 11 p.m.

200
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:23,013
When we have a portion of our meeting that's a public hearing, what we do is we first invite those who are in favor to just come up and state they are in favor of this measure.

201
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,355
And then you may be seated.

202
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:38,460
Once all those who are in favor and acknowledge they are in favor of this are finished, we close that portion of the meeting, then invite all those up to state whether they are in opposition to that.

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:54,504
Once people have just made the simple statement that they're in opposition, we close that portion of the public hearing, and then we go into the discussion phase to hear the merits presented by both parties, whether those are in favor and those are opposed.

204
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:01,491
And then the council has the opportunity to speak, perhaps ask questions, and then render its decision.

205
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:17,775
So now that the public hearing is open, the chair invites those who are in favor to come forward to the podium and to identify yourself by your name and address and state that you are in favor.

206
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:20,577
Good evening, everyone.

I've been a Medford resident for 35 years, and I'm here to voice my OK for the proposal.

210
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:42,442
My wife and I have known the proprietors going back through Panda Palace to their next iteration to what is now Shanghai Moon.

211
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:43,402
So you're in favor.

212
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:43,902
Sorry?

Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

246
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:03,427
To be clear, this is on extending the hours at each place.

247
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,249
I am in favor, but I

248
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:15,102
I would request that you listen to the neighbors that might live there and maybe do like... Thank you.

249
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:18,244
As stated at the beginning of this portion, we explained that that would happen.

250
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:18,885
Oh.

251
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:19,826
Thank you, John.

00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:24,951
George Theriot, business owner, 440 Salem Street, Medford.

253
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:26,632
I'm heartily in favor.

254
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,378

255
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:32,778
Thank you.

256
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:38,002

263
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:07,636
And I'm here to support the people, spend a lot of money up there.

264
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:09,977
They put a lot of hours up there.

265
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:12,459
They try to make very honest living.

266
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,842
The building is getting to be very, very expensive up there.

267
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:22,826
I pay $14,500 a year and it's going up all the time.

268
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:23,947
Thank you very much.

269
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:24,527
Thank you.

270
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:26,388
Anybody else in favor?

271
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,530
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that

272
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,882

00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:44,984
Are you here in opposition?

277
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:45,965
We're in opposition.

278
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,205
Sorry, I'll get right away.

279
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,045

Welcome.

286
00:17:58,738 --> 00:18:01,479
Hi, Marion DePaulo, 50 Lambert Street, Medford.

287
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,259
I'm opposed.

288
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,220
Thank you.

289
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,781
Good evening.

290
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,502
Steven DePaulo, 50 Lambert Street.

291
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:08,282
I'm opposed.

292
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,824
My name is Ray Ganey.

293
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:19,987
I live at 48 Lambert Street, and I'm opposed to this.

294
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,708
Joe Bianco, Lambert Street.

295
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:22,488
I'm against it.

296
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:32,121
Lucrecia Velez, 45 Lambert Street, president for 33 years and I'm in opposition.

297
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:39,584
Nestor Velez, 45 Lambert Street, I oppose it.

298
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,225
Ashley Sanchez, 45 Lambert Street, in opposition.

299
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:43,685
Thank you very much.

300
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:48,207
So now that, is anybody else in opposition wishes to be recognized?

301
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,745
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

302
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:55,865
So now we open this up to discussion.

303
00:18:56,245 --> 00:19:06,388
So if the petitioner wants to present themselves at the podium and explain their operation to us and what they wish to do, you're welcome to do that now.

304
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:14,549
Yep.

305
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:16,350
Are you the petitioner?

306
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,130
No, I'm not a petitioner.

307
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,330
No?

308
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,811
It's always good to hear from the petitioner first.

309
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:25,251
Welcome.

310
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:27,212
Please state your name and address for the record.

311
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:28,753
My name is Leo.

312
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,234
This is my partner, Sean.

313
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,595
We're both on the Shanghai moon.

314
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:35,657
He was previously on my parents.

315
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:49,104
We come here to apply for the extended hours because we spend a lot of money investing in this property, and we want to make a living.

316
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:59,690
Because I've been working in Bedford for a few years, since my parents and I moved out of the city.

317
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:16,265
And I think the reason we want to expand our business is also we want people to come to Bedford, to come here, to come to my restaurant, to enjoy the time.

318
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,592
Hi, my name is Sean.

319
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:31,082
My English is not very well, and everything Leo already said, so I just want to say one thing.

320
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:35,607
I'm an immigrant, and Memphis, let me tell you, is like my hometown.

321
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,670
And I'm not the only one to make business.

322
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:44,194
I want to be a very nice neighbor in the neighborhood.

323
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:56,983
And I think now is the time to return to the other people, support me, and return the community, and return to the neighborhood.

324
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:57,303
Yeah.

325
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,905
Thank you both very, very much.

326
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,406
Mr. President?

327
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,767
Could Councilor Camuso?

328
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:10,106
Thank you Mr. President and I'd just like to go on record in supporting this this evening.

329
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:14,170
This is a long time business in our community.

330
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:18,395
A lot of Medford people support the business and

331
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,198
They have been good neighbors.

332
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:23,760
I haven't received complaints regarding them over the years as a city councilor.

333
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:32,844
And where it's going from one generation to the next, I think that they'll still continue the way the parents left off.

334
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:45,109
And if I know Mr. Wu, he will be having his thumb on the business as well, making sure you boys are keeping it as clean and as good a neighborhood establishment as he always has.

335
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:47,670
So I will support this this evening.

336
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,541
Does anybody else want to speak on this matter before the council?

337
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,761
Either in favor or in opposition.

338
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,822
Please come on up and state your name and address again for the record.

339
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:03,723
Hello again.

340
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,623
Maritza Carmely, 19 Pitcher Avenue in Medford.

341
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:13,145
And I just wanted to say a few things about what I've observed about this restaurant since my husband and I started going there a few years ago.

342
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:19,981
What I can say for sure is talk about the character of the family that owns the restaurant.

343
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,603
They're incredible people.

344
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:24,085
They've put a lot of work into the renovations.

345
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:39,118
It's my understanding from talking to them that by not being able to stay late, like other restaurants in Medford are permitted to do, and I understand it's a variance issue, but other restaurants are permitted to do it, and by not being able to do so, they're losing incredible revenue.

346
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,340
I think I'd heard somewhere up to $10,000 a month

347
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:44,396
in lost revenue.

348
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm not sure where that number comes from, but obviously the owners do.

349
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:52,465
And that's an important number, I think, in terms of whether this place can succeed.

350
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:56,890
I can speak to the character of the staff that works there.

351
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:01,535
I can speak to the character of the clientele that goes there.

352
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:09,325
Since it's been renovated, it was a terrific place as Panda Palace, but now that it's been renovated, it has more of an upscale feel.

353
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:20,189
I don't know if people here have been there, but it has a much more of an upscale feel, and so I think that's going to attract the kind of community that we Medford residents want to have there.

354
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:26,991
As you know, Wellington is just down the street with Yokey and all the other fancy places down there, and I believe that

355
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:37,928
Asia, I'm sorry, that Shanghai Moon can compete with those restaurants just down the street, and so I think they need to be given the chance.

356
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:42,072
And so I want to suggest that that's an important thing.

357
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:51,101
And as a Medford resident and as a sports fan, we don't have sports places to go to, and that's another important reason why I think they should be allowed to succeed.

358
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:58,029
But all in all, it really goes to the character of the people there and knowing that they will keep it as a clean and upscale establishment.

359
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:58,750
Thank you.

360
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,391
Thank you.

361
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,177
If I may again, I'm sorry.

362
00:24:05,217 --> 00:24:06,038
I'm fighting a cold.

363
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,139
I'd like to go home to bed.

364
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,923
But I'd like to make a point that we know these people.

365
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:12,005
We find them to be upstanding.

366
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:16,657
honest, good people with a very good business acumen for their young ages.

367
00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:24,241
I own a business myself, and the margin between success and outright failure is razor thin.

368
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:37,448
To deny these people, as this young woman said, a chance to make extra money and cover costs in those beginning years and getting established could mean the difference between them making it and plunging the place into poverty.

369
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,309
I've seen it too many times.

370
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:40,969
I've been in this town 35 years.

371
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:41,950
We've come a long way.

372
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,371
But I think we've also collectively made some bad decisions.

373
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,992
And I think this would be a good decision.

374
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,134
I don't think you'll ever have any bad feedback about these people.

375
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:53,455
So, I am hold hardly for it.

376
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:54,815
Thank you for listening.

377
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:55,836
Thank you very much.

378
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:00,918
Your name and address again for the record.

379
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:07,141
George Farrott, building owner, business owner, 440 Salem Street, Medford.

380
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,282
Member of the Chamber of Commerce, Board of Directors,

381
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:18,888
speaking here as part of all those roles, because independent business people need all the help they can get.

382
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:31,710
If we want to be fan-friendly, so to speak, we need to give an equal playing field to the people who want to work hard, as these people have been and will continue to do.

383
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:40,252
The atmosphere that they have created with the money that they have spent, I think will bring in the

384
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,952
crowd that will respect the property around them.

385
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:46,654
I don't think there's ever been any issue.

386
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,655
You'd have to speak to the police department about that.

387
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:54,979
Prior, as all licenses, once issued, if there's a problem, you pull it.

388
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,622
Let's give them an equal shot at what everyone else in the city has.

389
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:02,064
I think Mei Ling's has got 3 AM.

390
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:04,645
Lantana's, I think, has one.

391
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,869
Carroll's, I mean, none of them are handcuffed with 11 PM.

392
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:17,514
And I think they deserve every chance for it, because that's what we should do in America, give people a chance to make a living.

393
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:18,335
Thank you.

394
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:19,356
Thank you, James.

395
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,006
Anybody else want to speak on this matter?

396
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:53,267
I live pretty much directly across from this restaurant, and I just have to say that I was very happy when they opened up because it's a nice, clean place.

397
00:26:53,667 --> 00:27:06,776
It's beautiful inside, and it provides a great atmosphere to just have a nice meal and be able to have somewhere to actually hang out at night that's a decent place in our neighborhood.

398
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:15,594
And as far as being noise complaints or anything like that, I don't have any noise complaints against them.

399
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:29,781
I feel it's been, I can't hear anything from them like as far as since their business started because somebody keeps putting letters on our doors of our apartment building trying to like sabotage their business saying that we should go complain about the noise.

400
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,970
But the thing is, there is no noise.

401
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:37,352
The college kids across the street throw louder parties than what I ever hear from this restaurant.

402
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:48,596
So I really hope that we can give their business a chance to thrive, because they really do provide something nice for the community to enjoy.

403
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,516
So I think we should support that.

404
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:51,297
Thank you.

405
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:51,757
Thank you.

406
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:54,838
Anybody else wish to speak?

407
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:03,063
Good evening.

408
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,784
Marion DePaola, 50 Lambert Street.

409
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,104
My husband, Stephen.

410
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,465
Stephen DePaola, 50 Lambert Street.

411
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:13,306
Welcome.

412
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,846
We are both opposed to this.

413
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:20,768
Both of us, my husband's lived here for his entire life on Lambert Street.

414
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:23,948
Since I got married, I've been here since 1997.

415
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:24,769
1977, I'm sorry.

416
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,349
It's 38 years.

417
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:26,729
I've been here 65.

418
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm so sorry.

419
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,702
OK.

420
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,906
Earlier, I just passed out a copy of the abuttus list.

421
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:54,512
The reason I did that, living right across the street from the property, I didn't receive an abuttus list.

422
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,373
So I got concerned, and I went down and obtained a copy.

423
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:01,256
You'll notice there's like 18 mail outs on that.

424
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,639
I just hand wrote to make it a little easier to follow along.

425
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:14,672
Out of the 18, 12 were sent to the commercial properties and six to the residential people.

426
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:21,454
That's two-thirds to the commercial and one-third to the residential.

427
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:26,535
I thought that was just a little lopsided and was a little concerned with that.

428
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,676
I just want to make that clear.

429
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:35,258
Also, too, the people on Spring Street Extension, not one,

430
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:39,833
homeowner received a direct abuttus notice.

431
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:44,895
That particular property, the door entrance, has been relocated.

432
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:52,118
It empties out right onto Lambert Street and right at the corner of Spring Street Extension.

433
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:57,140
I felt as though at least one abuttus should have been notified of that.

434
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,861
That's just my feeling.

435
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,303
They went all the way across to the MBTA, and the city parking lot

436
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,374
gardener got his notice.

437
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:11,477
So City Hall sent out a certified letter back to City Hall.

438
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:14,999
I think a resident should have received something like that.

439
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,963
Maybe just consider that something in the future if something comes before you, and it's residents.

440
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:22,524
And I want to make this clear.

441
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:25,946
This isn't residents against the business people.

442
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:31,390
I have supported the Salem Street business people for 38 years, and I will continue to do so.

443
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,473
I've gone into Panda Palace.

444
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:43,878
Danny's Place, I'm going back to the 70s, Danny's Place, Panda Palace was there for 25 years, wonderful people.

445
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:52,780
They came in and they also wanted the extended hours and the residents back then were highly opposed to it for the same reason as we are tonight.

446
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,061
We are so close and every square in the city is unique.

447
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:06,122
We are so close to these businesses and we have to come up with a way to coexist.

448
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:10,129
None of us here as resident side want to put anybody out of business.

449
00:31:10,209 --> 00:31:11,710
It's not good for the city.

450
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,971
We want good business.

451
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:15,351
We want strong business.

452
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:17,132
We don't want anything boarded up in our city.

453
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:27,377
The prior owners of Panda Palace, I got very friendly with them over the close to 25 years.

454
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:34,920
And they were very successful, opened up a second restaurant down in Weymouth, put three kids through college,

455
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:43,558
sold their businesses, went off to Florida, and I believe that they're opening up Dunkin' Donuts down in Orlando in the nice climate.

456
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:48,701
So they did that all within 10 p.m.

457
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:50,302
and 11 p.m.

458
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:50,762
10 p.m.

459
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:53,083
weeknights, 11 p.m.

460
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:54,744
on the weekends.

461
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,306
If a business is run well, it can be done.

462
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:00,908
That's my feeling.

463
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,190
People close their doors.

464
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,631
in that area, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and it kind of staggers out.

465
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:16,752
We feel, in the neighborhood, and being there so long, the quietness, it starts to die down around 11.

466
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:29,234
The thought of anything being past 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, is just, you're cutting that time, that downtime that you have till 5 o'clock the next morning, you've got to get up again.

467
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:32,695
Now, it doesn't mean it's going to be a ballroom brawl, OK?

468
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:34,735
It doesn't have to be police worthy.

469
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,438
It could be simple things.

470
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,501
You have your windows open in the spring, summer, and fall.

471
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,424
Loud voices, happy people out there.

472
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,745
It doesn't have to be bad people.

473
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:53,770
It could be happy people waking us up, car doors slamming, the car alarms going off.

474
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,573
Try to go back to sleep if that happens at 1 o'clock in the morning, and you have to get up at 5.

475
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:02,276
Everything's open seven days a week now also.

476
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:04,392
People work on the weekends.

477
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:05,773
My husband works in a hospital.

478
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:06,593
They never close.

479
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,934
So 5 o'clock comes around real soon.

480
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:17,156
And again, no one here wants to put anyone out of business.

481
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,056
I wish them good luck.

482
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:24,038
However, we have a big investment in the city also.

483
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:29,399
We have owned homes here, my neighbors here, for 50 years, 40 years, 30 years.

484
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,651
My husband's family was here back from the 40s on that street.

485
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:41,453
So we have an investment in the city as well as the business people.

486
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:50,917
I touched upon the history of the building and the longevity.

487
00:33:50,977 --> 00:33:52,518
And it's a good rental property.

488
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:57,600
And that parking lot is a very vital part of the Haines Square area.

489
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:01,862
The reason

490
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:08,766
Okay.

491
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:35,017
Um, back when the grand opening was in, uh, July the 29th, I believe, um, I went over and I noticed that on the door they had extended hours posted now only because I was part of the process back when Panda Palace opened up and those owners went through the process in the right way.

492
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:39,166
They filled out their applications, and they came before the council.

493
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:40,467
The same process.

494
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:53,895
When I didn't get a notice, and I knew it was going to be a sports bar, since May, because I was in there picking up a luncheon special before Asian Palace closed, I was told, oh, we're going to close next week.

495
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,037
And I said, oh, what are you going to do?

496
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,918
He said, oh, we're going to open a sports bar.

497
00:34:58,938 --> 00:34:59,918
I said, really?

498
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:01,219
You're going to get rid of that buffet?

499
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,199
Are you kidding me?

500
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,581
He said it didn't make any money.

501
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,142
OK, and that's his choice.

502
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,626
This is a whole new concept.

503
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:14,330
The restaurants and sports bars are two different models.

504
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,612
And they look quite different, in my opinion.

505
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:34,183
I think the reason why this got off on the wrong foot, first of all, is because we felt as though the neighbors' feet were stepped on by doing something like that, posting hours that they hadn't gotten approval for.

506
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,145
So that's a negative point.

507
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:39,393
OK?

508
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:40,753
Doesn't mean it can't be erased.

509
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,133
OK?

510
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:44,254
But it just started off wrong.

511
00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:50,856
Then within three or four days later, I get advertising the Wicked Local.

512
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:53,416
And I passed out a copy of those to people.

513
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:54,017
OK?

514
00:35:54,557 --> 00:35:56,037
And it's right on the top there.

515
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,798
Sports Bar Karaoke DJ.

516
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,139
So they all had the idea of the sports bar.

517
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:04,619
And they're going to have all these functions and everything.

518
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,080
But again, no approval.

519
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,539
They didn't come up and say, oh, can I do this?

520
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:11,519
At least find out.

521
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,900
Because a lot of thought was put into that advertising.

522
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:14,920
A lot.

523
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:16,861
And a lot of money was put into it.

524
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,122
And I appreciate the money they put in there.

525
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,607
Now, the thing next.

526
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:45,507
When I called a couple of counselors here, and my concern was just a couple of weeks ago when we had the Pats opening.

527
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:53,431
The closing time, of course, is 11 o'clock until you people decide to approve or disapprove of this.

528
00:36:56,392 --> 00:36:57,693
My husband walked across the street.

529
00:36:57,713 --> 00:36:58,393
You can continue.

530
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:04,156
Walked across the Dairy Mart, and there was a lot of clients still in the bar at 11.30 for that night.

531
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:08,674
That's a concern, okay?

532
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:12,696
And the, I'm sorry?

533
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:16,758
No, not that, no.

534
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:22,001
So when I went to turn out the light on the porch, I said, who are all these people?

535
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:27,444
He was just coming back through the door and he said, oh, they're still in the sports bar.

536
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:29,705
And I said, well, it's after 11, how can they do that?

537
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:33,167
Well, they did it, okay?

538
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:33,587
And that's,

539
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,542
Again, another little salt in the wound.

540
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:38,063
They should know this.

541
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:45,324
As business people going through all of this, they've had the Asia Palace prior to that, and I enjoy their food.

542
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:46,565
I do.

543
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:50,225
But again, they're businessmen.

544
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:51,966
They have to know these things.

545
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,906
There was a lot of thought put into this place.

546
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:56,787
They have to know these things.

547
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:07,305
I did call a couple of the counsels and pose the question when it comes to closing.

548
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,907
What actually is the procedure?

549
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,588
I want to know what's right and what's wrong.

550
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,110
Well, what ended up happening was I did call the law department.

551
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:23,873
I spoke to the lovely lady, and we ended up laughing at the end of this conversation.

552
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:31,877
But in any case, my question to her was, first off,

553
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:39,839
someone is to be closed at 11 o'clock, exactly what should be the procedure?

554
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:46,540
Well, she continued to tell me that the liquor side of it, there's a state liquor license until 1 a.m.

555
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:54,022
I said, I understand that, but they have to go before the council to get approval for that extended hour.

556
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:02,864
What, in fact, we go back and forth in this since we started laughing.

557
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:07,646
What I really wanted to find out, what was the procedure?

558
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:09,347
Do you say last call?

559
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,368
Is the doors locked?

560
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:12,928
Is nothing else served?

561
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:16,610
How soon a time after the closing hour do they have to get out?

562
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,911
I wanted to know the exact thing.

563
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:23,853
So what it came down to, it's 11 o'clock closing, it's done on the liquor end.

564
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,995
She did say on the food end,

565
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:29,545
The city clerk would be able to answer that.

566
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:33,288
And rather than bother you in your office, I figured I'd toss the ball to you.

567
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:46,659
As far as serving food, if an establishment closes at 11 o'clock, should they?

568
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,164
How it works out in the extended hours, I think, is that you can no longer operate.

569
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,566
You operate like a retailer.

570
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:03,454
you know, up until 11 o'clock, so you really can't sell anything after 11 o'clock.

571
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:06,696
You know, that's how we end up.

572
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:11,299
So as far as staying, that's a whole different ballgame, you know.

573
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,340
But you can't, you know.

574
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,424
The way I understood it from the law office is that it should be done and over with, 11 o'clock.

575
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:21,605
Taking your business, yeah.

576
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,807
And the customer should be on the other side of the door.

577
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:24,687
OK.

578
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:29,337
So at least we got that question answered.

579
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:37,703
Um, point of clarification.

580
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:39,244
If I understand the liquor law, correct.

581
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:46,830
If your last calls at 11 o'clock, they cannot stay there no longer than 15 minutes after the last call.

582
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,911
And then the drinks have to be returned.

583
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:50,032
They cannot drink anymore.

584
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:56,417
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you have a one o'clock food license for extended hours, you can stay there providing your reading, but not drinking.

585
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,410
That's the difference.

586
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:06,813
The liquor license prohibits you for whatever that time period is, 15 minutes after, if the license is 11 o'clock, 11.15, that's it.

587
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:08,033
That's the max you can stay there.

588
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:11,455
Thank you for that point of information, Councilor Penta.

589
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:13,755
Councilor Camuso, point of information.

590
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:18,817
I appreciate Councilor Penta's concerns, but the liquor license is actually till 1 a.m.

591
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:23,638
The establishment closes at 11, but that particular liquor license is till 1 a.m.

592
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,671
Point of information.

593
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:28,331
Counselor.

594
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:29,893
I was just explaining the liquor law.

595
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,174
That's all I was explaining.

596
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:34,476
That has a license that ends at 11 o'clock period.

597
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,658
It wasn't the way it came out.

598
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:37,119
That's right.

599
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:37,459
Thank you.

600
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,100
Make sure we know what we're talking about.

601
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:45,165
So my understanding this correctly, I'm going to go with this one more time.

602
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:54,533
If, if the closing hours are 11 o'clock, so typically they could stay till 1115 for the liquor, but for the food, no.

603
00:41:56,499 --> 00:41:59,381
as long as it's still water.

604
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:01,743
Yeah, you can't serve or buy anything anymore.

605
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:03,864
I mean, that license is stopped.

606
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:06,066
But you don't have to be out.

607
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:07,887
You don't have to be out.

608
00:42:07,907 --> 00:42:12,330
No, that's totally different from the common victor's license.

609
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,351
What happens afterwards?

610
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:18,815
It's inordinate, whatever it falls into.

611
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:22,557
But as far as a common victor's license,

612
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,191
So am I hearing that if it closes at 11, typically someone could be in there till 11.30?

613
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:29,451
Is that what I'm hearing?

614
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:31,232
Yes?

615
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:33,212
Point of information to present.

616
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:36,393
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

617
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:48,356
You know, first of all, we're talking about an extended hour ordinance that was created 30 years ago and hasn't been amended for 30 years.

618
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,396
And I agree with you.

619
00:42:50,516 --> 00:42:53,217
I think there's a lot of ambiguities around

620
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:57,225
The fact that what happens, just say your hours are until 11 o'clock.

621
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:03,467
Can someone come in at 10.55 and order a meal and sit there until 2 in the morning?

622
00:43:03,868 --> 00:43:06,389
I don't think our ordinance currently addresses that right now.

623
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,691
Now, it may address it around liquor, as Councilor Panta mentioned, but I don't think it currently addresses it.

624
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:15,513
And one thing I'm hoping that comes out of tonight is our subcommittee.

625
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,814
We have a number of subcommittees that handle all different issues.

626
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:23,136
Our licensing subcommittee, which Councilor Caviello is the chair of, we send a paper to them.

627
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,964
So they can meet and discuss how we can craft an ordinance that addresses some of these concerns, because they're valid concerns.

628
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:32,086
And I think they need to be addressed.

629
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:34,907
So I agree with that, Mr. President.

630
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:38,270
And I'll make that part of whatever report that's recommended.

631
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,710
Thank you, Counselor.

632
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:41,352
Ma'am, if you would continue.

633
00:43:41,572 --> 00:43:41,752
Yes.

634
00:43:42,232 --> 00:43:52,179
Again, that was my concern, because if any type of late hours were granted, that's an open-ended, we may be into the 1.30 hour.

635
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:54,304
Which makes it even worse.

636
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:56,284
That cuts my sleep in half again.

637
00:43:57,185 --> 00:43:58,526
And everybody else in the neighborhood.

638
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,607
We are so close to that property.

639
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:03,468
That's the main concern.

640
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:14,473
Also too, if you read the police logs, which I'm sure you do, we have a lot of problems down in our area, a lot.

641
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:17,595
Daytime, nighttime with the drugs and so forth.

642
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:21,219
These late hours are just gonna be a magnet.

643
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:22,720
It's gonna be a magnet.

644
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:30,406
I mean, just for people to, something's open, they blend in with people, it's just gonna be a magnet.

645
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,668
That's a big concern to the neighbors.

646
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:46,580
We see it, we hear it, we watch it on a daily basis, and to think that something else could possibly be open at that wee hour of the morning while we're in bed,

647
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:50,275
And this could just be multiplying in front of us.

648
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:54,097
So that's a big concern to me.

649
00:44:55,137 --> 00:45:03,621
And this kind of open-ended thing of I'm going to order some food here, and I'm going to stay down until 1.30, it's like, where does it end?

650
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:06,022
That's a big concern.

651
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:14,446
Basically, I can probably speak for the rest of my friends and neighbors here.

652
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:16,547
We're here to preserve our neighborhood.

653
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:19,266
We've been there a long time.

654
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:25,988
We want to preserve as much of the quiet time that we all deserve after working hard all day.

655
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,669
And that's not a lot to ask.

656
00:45:29,689 --> 00:45:31,190
It really isn't.

657
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,891
You know, we've been in the neighborhood a long time.

658
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:41,733
We've contributed to the city, supported the city for many, many years, generations.

659
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:47,095
I understand there's a generational thing here also with the owners.

660
00:45:48,216 --> 00:46:01,806
And, again, I feel as though if a business opened 12 hours a day, seven days a week, can't make it, you've got to figure out what you're doing wrong.

661
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,127
That's a lot of hours.

662
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:08,170
Now you want to add extra hours in and put an eighth day into the week.

663
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:11,973
Well, why don't we make it nine and ten, and we'll just stay open all night?

664
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:13,654
I mean, where does it end?

665
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:18,007
So again, we're here to preserve our neighborhood.

666
00:46:18,387 --> 00:46:20,787
We want to keep our neighborhoods as safe as it can be.

667
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:28,629
Things are bad, and I feel getting worse on a daily basis.

668
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:33,290
So again, that magnet after hours really concerns me.

669
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,411
And after 11 o'clock, not a lot of good happens out there on the street.

670
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:40,371
Not a lot of good happens.

671
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:50,530
I hope we can, you know, come to some good conclusion here tonight, and thank you for listening to us.

672
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:59,017
And if anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

673
00:46:59,077 --> 00:46:59,337
Okay.

674
00:46:59,357 --> 00:46:59,637
Thank you.

675
00:46:59,657 --> 00:46:59,877
Thank you.

676
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:00,238
Thank you.

677
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:00,958
Thank you.

678
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,740
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

679
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:04,901
Thank you, Mr. President.

680
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:09,185
You know, I've been in this gentleman's establishment.

681
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:11,987
They've made a major investment in our community here.

682
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,232
And I think they deserve the opportunity.

683
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:19,034
I think they were a little confused in the beginning when they opened.

684
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:23,676
And I think they've tried to rectify whatever they did wrong.

685
00:47:24,497 --> 00:47:26,918
But they've made an investment in our community.

686
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:27,858
They've bettered the building.

687
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:32,421
They're facing competition from the other restaurants.

688
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,042
They operate the same hours in other cities.

689
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,582
You know, we sit here, you know, people sit here every week and say, you know, nothing ever comes to Medford, nothing comes to Medford.

690
00:47:40,882 --> 00:47:50,467
Well, here, these gentlemen come to Medford, they make an investment in the community, and here we are saying, no, you can't do what the other restaurants do.

691
00:47:51,067 --> 00:48:04,513
I mean, all they're asking for is what to do with other people that, you know, I would, you know, if we could do this with some kind of a review after 60 days, 90 days, if there was a problem, come back.

692
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:09,368
But as I said, they do deserve the same opportunity that every other business in the city has.

693
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:16,870
And I say, if this is what we want, if we want businesses to come here, then we have to make it a level playing field for everybody.

694
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:22,291
We can't pick and choose who we want to give special hours to and not give special hours to.

695
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,052
Thank you, Councilor.

696
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,052
Councilor Camuso.

697
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,032
I'll yield to the gentleman.

698
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,253
I appreciate it.

699
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:33,694
Joe Bianco, Property Order 41 Lamb Street, which currently my mother lives in the building.

700
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:43,039
I have some major concerns for the change in the hours due to the negative impact that this will have on the resident area.

701
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:49,403
I noticed you have a big crowd over here in support, but if you heard, most of these people don't live in the area.

702
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:50,544
They're good friends.

703
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:55,407
I appreciate they stick up for the owners, but they don't abut the areas.

704
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:59,670
They don't even live close to the areas, so they don't have to deal with the consequences.

705
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,691
If you check out that area, Haines Square,

706
00:49:03,493 --> 00:49:07,216
Property values in that area haven't gone up like the rest of Meffitt.

707
00:49:07,256 --> 00:49:12,480
They're 8% to 15% lower than everywhere else in Meffitt.

708
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,703
And one of the reasons is we have a problem in that area with crime.

709
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,525
We have a big drug problem over there.

710
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:23,389
It is Seeland Street, Felsway, Spring Street.

711
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:30,435
There's ongoing drug investigations going on right now that I know of that I can discuss later.

712
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:35,047
with you guys in private, if you want, that I know about.

713
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:37,569
So this is a big uptake.

714
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:40,231
I don't know if you guys were aware of the truck problems in that area.

715
00:49:41,152 --> 00:49:43,153
Now, my mother lives right behind the building.

716
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:49,779
And during the daytime in that area, we have a lunchtime crew that comes in there, contractors and everything.

717
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:51,540
They park their trucks in there and they drink.

718
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:54,483
They're in there drinking.

719
00:49:56,004 --> 00:50:00,608
And if you check with the police reports, you know what I mean?

720
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:07,917
A lot of offices are Dunkin' Donuts in there, but no one notices unless you're a resident.

721
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:12,260
You can look out the window, you can see the guys sittin' in there drinkin' a six-pack at lunchtime.

722
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,684
So that's, if you guys are familiar with that parking lot.

723
00:50:18,844 --> 00:50:22,767
I didn't hear, where are they going to drink in the parking lot?

724
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,068
Are you familiar with that parking lot?

725
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:25,309
There's two sections of the parking lot.

726
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,450
There's a main parking lot and there's an offset.

727
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,210
Yeah, it's there today.

728
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,592
There's an offset right behind Dunkin' Donuts.

729
00:50:31,634 --> 00:50:31,954
Okay?

730
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:36,555
And there's a little corner over there and a lot of contractors go in there and they're drinking all day long.

731
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:38,736
At lunchtime.

732
00:50:38,756 --> 00:50:39,216
At lunchtime.

733
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:39,876
In the parking lot.

734
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:40,896
In the parking lot.

735
00:50:41,176 --> 00:50:41,256
Yeah.

736
00:50:41,276 --> 00:50:42,116
Okay.

737
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:42,697
In their vehicles.

738
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:43,577
In their vehicles.

739
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:49,138
And I don't want to say this, but there's also a few city trucks in there once in a while, but.

740
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:51,459
You know what I mean?

741
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:57,700
That could be something that you guys might want to check into, because you can see it plainly from the residents.

742
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:02,990
I'm over there, when I look out my mother's window, you can see him at lunchtime.

743
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:05,912
But that's beside the issue.

744
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:08,335
That's just to let you know what that area is like.

745
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:10,597
It's congested, you know.

746
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:18,964
But as far as the impact as changing the hours, there is a problem as it exists right now.

747
00:51:19,324 --> 00:51:25,270
My mother's called me and she says she looks out the window, there's people urinating in the corner of the building.

748
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:34,007
You know, they're coming out, you know, I don't know, I can't prove they're coming out of that restaurant, but I assume at those hours right now, that later on, that that's what they're doing.

749
00:51:34,547 --> 00:51:36,748
They're arguing in the parking lot after hours.

750
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,690
And you can hear them, somebody's arguing, somebody's fighting about something.

751
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:48,373
Cruisers will come by once in a while, you know, it's not like, you know, I've seen them being arrested, but the cruisers come by and they leave.

752
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:52,095
I guess they were able to resolve the situation.

753
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:56,537
There's noise, because when they're getting out of the,

754
00:51:57,535 --> 00:52:02,577
The establishment at this time, they're sitting in the parking lot, talking for a little while, and they're pretty loud at night.

755
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:08,579
It echoes, because you've got a building that's like a stage over there, that everything echoes off those walls.

756
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:14,202
And if you're a resident, you've got your windows open at some time, you can hear them yelling, and swearing, and screaming.

757
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:18,924
My mother's just, you can overhear all that.

758
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:26,807
And the other effect is, if later it is open at night, after they've been drinking at the bar, they're going to all drive home.

759
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:31,368
You know, it's another liability for the city.

760
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:39,330
I mean, you know, most of these people are going to be coming from across the Fells Way there, you know, coming out of Malden.

761
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,910
They're not going to be coming from West Meffitt.

762
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,391
They're going to be coming out of Malden, you know what I mean?

763
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:46,251
Spring Street.

764
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:48,371
They're going to be driving down those ways.

765
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:54,032
There's a lot of, you know, traffic that's going to be impacted.

766
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:56,873
And S5 is,

767
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:11,027
My concern is right now that I'm really a little bit upset about how I was told by another neighbor, and I was shown these flyers about them passing them out about their hours already, which it hasn't been approved.

768
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:17,309
Now, it's either the fix is in, or these guys have it in their head.

769
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,989
Who would do that?

770
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,270
That costs money to do that.

771
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,171
I don't understand why they would go out and do that.

772
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:24,412
It doesn't make any sense to me as a business owner

773
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:28,856
Did you just publicize that you're going to be open until 1 o'clock like it's a done deal?

774
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:30,058
How did that happen?

775
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:31,700
Why did it happen?

776
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,661
I don't know.

777
00:53:32,781 --> 00:53:34,743
Maybe that should be investigated and find out what's going on.

778
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:37,607
Have you seen the flyers?

779
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:41,111
Can anybody tell me why those flyers are sent out?

780
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:44,495
We're having a meeting right now to talk about it.

781
00:53:49,285 --> 00:54:02,571
It's my understanding, speaking with the business owner, that when he received the liquor license from the state of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth, which was a liquor license that would end at 1 o'clock in the morning, he was under the impression that that would be what dictates his hours of operation, not the local control.

782
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:06,973
So it's my understanding that it was more or less just an error in application than it was anything else.

783
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:09,215
It wasn't any intentional violation.

784
00:54:09,255 --> 00:54:12,216
It wasn't any type of attempt to skirt the local requirements.

785
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:15,550
But you know you're coming in front of the board to discuss this, and then you do that.

786
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,771
Well, he came before the board.

787
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,312
He did receive a common victuals license.

788
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,073
And that was before the board this evening for a license for extended hours.

789
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,795
The common victuals license would expire at 11 o'clock in the evening.

790
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:28,398
The gentleman had a license from the city of Medford that would allow him to be open till 11 o'clock in the evening.

791
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:32,381
He also had a license from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that would allow him to be open till 1 o'clock in the morning.

792
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:37,464
I think there was some disconnect there in understanding what it is that his actual hours of operation were going to be.

793
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:40,586
But in my discussions with Mr. Wu,

794
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,338
My understanding is that it's been nothing more than a misapplication and a misunderstanding.

795
00:54:44,378 --> 00:54:49,938
Well, I'll have to accept that, but I mean, it's kind of weird, you know.

796
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,919
But I want you guys to just, you know, I know you guys have been in Meffitt for a long time.

797
00:54:53,959 --> 00:55:00,700
I want you to just think about the impact of the residents, not just like everybody that comes from maybe other part of Meffitt.

798
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,121
I mean, it's not a restaurant anymore.

799
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:02,981
It's a sports bar.

800
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:05,881
I hang out a lot of sports bars, you know what I mean?

801
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:08,262
You guys go there, you know what happens.

802
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:10,722
You go to a football game, gets a little rowdy.

803
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:15,888
Sometimes it ends up outside, and there's a lot of drinking.

804
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:16,688
It's a sports bar.

805
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:21,149
And if you want to test everybody coming out of there, I bet 50% of them are over the limit.

806
00:55:21,189 --> 00:55:24,650
And they're going to be driving through the streets of Memphis at 1 o'clock in the morning.

807
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,331
Or from what I understand, it could be 1.30 now.

808
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,173
I need you guys to all consider that.

809
00:55:34,494 --> 00:55:38,855
And if you can't, I wish you'd just table this until we can get more input.

810
00:55:42,237 --> 00:55:48,022
Lieutenant there and find out what actually is going on with the crime rate in that area, the drug problem and all that, so you guys get a better handle on it.

811
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:53,607
I think you should be aware of that before we... You know, it's one o'clock in the morning.

812
00:55:53,647 --> 00:55:56,630
What kind of people are going to be going out to go have another beer?

813
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:02,255
It's the people that have probably just got stoned somewhere now and they're going to go out to eat.

814
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:02,636
You know?

815
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:04,738
Think about it.

816
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:13,715
I love this city and I don't want that area to depreciate any further than it already has.

817
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:27,521
So I want you guys to check with the lieutenant and find out what the stats are for that area, for drugs, crime, and you'll notice that there's an uptick in there higher than other places in Memphis.

818
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:29,161
And I think this would only add to it.

819
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:31,462
So I appreciate your consideration on that.

820
00:56:32,603 --> 00:56:33,403
Thank you, Mr. Bianco.

821
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,910
Hi, Lucrecia Velez, 45 Lumber Street.

822
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,712
And I've been there 33 years.

823
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:51,757
And basically, we are right next to the parking lot.

824
00:56:52,458 --> 00:57:00,564
And the late hours will impact our way of living.

825
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:03,546
The noise level, the neighborhood also.

826
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:07,209
I agree with what Joe has said.

827
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:08,670
It has changed a lot.

828
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,603
I'm concerned that the late hours will make it worse.

829
00:57:13,884 --> 00:57:21,830
Hopefully you will consider all the facts and make the appropriate decision on that.

830
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,671
I appreciate it.

831
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:23,911
Please.

832
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:25,332
Thank you, Mrs. Falas.

833
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:30,036
Counselor Camuso, the chair recognizes you.

834
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,297
Thank you, Mr. President.

835
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:37,141
And I already said a little bit earlier regarding my support, but I'd just like to back up my support.

836
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:42,956
I'm looking at this as somewhat of an economic development of the community as well.

837
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:52,022
Just last week, there was some discussion regarding a sign and certain members of the council wanted to shut a sign off at the new Marriott that's coming to our community at certain times.

838
00:57:52,562 --> 00:57:53,362
That was thrown out there.

839
00:57:54,023 --> 00:58:01,848
And at that point, I was a little concerned because I think we have to be, show that we're with the times, so to say.

840
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:05,570
I look back, I have another paper on later on this evening.

841
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:20,331
to discuss another piece of economic development in our community that was not supported by the Medford City Council, other than myself and I believe Councilor Knight at the time, and that was the bank across from the Medford Fire Station for a drive-thru.

842
00:58:20,551 --> 00:58:23,973
And there was an arrangement, an agreement with all the neighbors in the area on Thomas

843
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,661
And that did not have the votes, and now we're sitting here with an empty building for over a year.

844
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:34,785
So, I do have concerns of moving the city forward in the economic development piece.

845
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,567
But, you know, as we look around the community, we have some great restaurants now.

846
00:58:38,627 --> 00:58:50,175
We have Carroll's, who's not so much in a residential neighbourhood, but we have Razzo's and Bocelli's that are right in the heart of neighbourhoods very similar to Lambert Street area and Spring Street Extension.

847
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:53,257
For some time, my wife and I owned a corner

848
00:58:53,854 --> 00:58:58,355
Irving Street in West Medford, which directly abuts West Medford Square.

849
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:09,438
And although we didn't have the late hours, we also knew when we moved in there, there was a potential for the Bistro 5 to petition for later hours and things of that nature.

850
00:59:09,898 --> 00:59:15,099
And, you know, I just look at this as an economic development piece for the community.

851
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,620
You know, last week, too, there was some talk about parking, and certain people are for and against the parking.

852
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:47,195
and I got the numbers from last week, the meals tax has actually been up by a good amount when I compared January 1st of 2014 to 8-31-2014, and then I ran the numbers for the same time period of 2015, throw in the worst winter we've had in probably the last 35 years in the city of Medford, and to have the meals tax up during that same period of time,

853
00:59:47,859 --> 00:59:55,362
and say that the businesses are suffering and lacking and are really getting hit because of the parking.

854
00:59:55,742 --> 01:00:00,224
It just didn't make sense and I wanted to take it to the next level and actually get data to back that up.

855
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:14,770
And when I did that I was quite surprised because if you look back at the winter that we had, it was one of the worst winters in the history of the city of Medford.

856
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:30,139
As far as this particular establishment, like I said, I can go along with the review, but I think we have to give them an opportunity to operate with the later hours if something happens.

857
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:32,800
I understand the gentleman that came up and talked about crime and the drugs.

858
01:00:33,401 --> 01:00:37,123
I'm not sure where he went, but that's all over this community right now.

859
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:44,047
We just hired the other day, the city of Medford hired the first time outreach coordinator to deal with the opiate problem that we're dealing with here in the city of Medford.

860
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:46,811
She was just hired within the last two days.

861
01:00:47,431 --> 01:00:51,572
And so I think the city is doing our best to address that.

862
01:00:52,733 --> 01:01:07,218
I think part of the problem you have in some of these areas at night is because at a certain time it's shut down and it tends to attract people that may want to do not so good things, whether it's in a parking lot in a vehicle or somewhere else.

863
01:01:07,678 --> 01:01:14,801
And this will actually act as a deterrent from things of that nature with having a little bit more viability

864
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:15,921
going on at night.

865
01:01:15,961 --> 01:01:18,503
I certainly understand the concerns of the residents.

866
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:21,725
I certainly understand it, but I firmly believe it.

867
01:01:22,005 --> 01:01:26,649
And you look at Mr. Karofalos, a gentleman that came here, it's the American dream.

868
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:30,332
He's worked hard his whole life, his whole life, and he owns that building.

869
01:01:30,912 --> 01:01:38,098
He owns that building, he's a Medford resident, and he understands, he would be the last person that wants the neighbors that he's been next to

870
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:43,110
for all these years to have these problems.

871
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:50,333
But I just feel confident through the proper restrictions, as Councillor Caviello mentioned.

872
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,495
And as far as the other things that the other gentleman mentioned, these are serious police matters.

873
01:01:55,975 --> 01:02:01,277
And if you see people drinking in the parking lot in vehicles, it's a serious issue.

874
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:06,780
But it's not something that's going to get any better or worse because of the permit that's before us this evening.

875
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:14,673
So for those reasons, I just think that we should give them a shake and an opportunity.

876
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:24,964
And quite honestly, as I said last week, I just think Medford's getting the, and it's partly because of City Hall and this city council on occasion.

877
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:36,912
People don't want to come to Medford as much as they want to go to other communities that are willing to listen, and to open the door, open the avenue, and be for new things, or move the city forward.

878
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:41,213
You know, we're at a very, very critical juncture in this community over the next 12 months.

879
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:48,574
We have Mr. Wynn, who's breaking ground on a casino right over the line in Everett.

880
01:02:49,454 --> 01:02:54,315
And the entrance and exit to that casino is going to be on the Charlestown side.

881
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:59,564
So there was a lot of misinformation at first that it was going to be at the circle over on this side.

882
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:00,765
And that's not the case.

883
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:06,088
The case is it's going to be on the Charlestown side with a ramp coming from the highways and all that.

884
01:03:07,028 --> 01:03:14,432
If indeed the building permits are issued, which it appears it is, the last hurdle was taken up by Everett.

885
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:20,355
But as I talk about the critical juncture, you know, I want to see people that have capital that want to

886
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:23,353
bring something vibrant to our community.

887
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:33,735
I want to see them come here, because they know they have a city hall that wants to move Medford forward, whether it be in the corner office, whether it be department heads under the mayor's lead, whether it be the city council.

888
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:37,716
I think we want to send the message that we want people to come here.

889
01:03:37,756 --> 01:03:42,257
We have many lots on Mystic Ave that are going up for sale every few years.

890
01:03:42,577 --> 01:03:43,677
And you know what?

891
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:45,978
I want to see more Marriotts come to the community.

892
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:57,562
As I said last week, when we start talking about the Marriott shutting their sign off at a certain time because the roast beef place next door has to do it, it's night and day as far as I'm concerned.

893
01:03:59,024 --> 01:03:59,705
It's night and day.

894
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:08,575
So if we could send that vision, and I think this a lot starts in the economic development office, but as I said, we're at a very critical juncture.

895
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:15,988
I think we're going to have opportunity because of that casino that we have never had in the last 50 years in the city of Medford.

896
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:17,869
We're going to have people that want to come here.

897
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:23,413
We're going to have people that go on the internet and see a room at the casino for $500 a night.

898
01:04:23,713 --> 01:04:27,095
OK, let me stay at the Marriott or the Sheraton on Mr. Gavin Medford.

899
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:29,637
And I'd rather see them here in our community, Mr. President.

900
01:04:29,944 --> 01:04:33,007
than over in Chelsea or in Somerville or other areas.

901
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:36,531
You know, we've got to have vision like Mayor Curtatone, a vision of Assembly Row.

902
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:43,918
You know, you go down there, whoever thought that legal seafood would be opened up on the Mystic River a quarter of a mile from the city of Medford?

903
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:47,522
Never in a million years I thought that was going to happen.

904
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:51,125
But I certainly hear the neighbors loud and clear.

905
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:52,327
If you have specific police

906
01:04:53,420 --> 01:05:07,145
Police issues, if you could please either talk to one of the councillors after the meeting, or we'll get you in touch with the chief of police, because those issues aren't going away, whether you have them or every business in the community closed at 10 o'clock or 9 o'clock.

907
01:05:07,726 --> 01:05:09,346
Those issues are there.

908
01:05:12,828 --> 01:05:15,649
No, no, and I understand that, but we have to take the issue.

909
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:18,210
We can't make the permit become

910
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:22,780
The permit's separate and distinct from the issues you're dealing with.

911
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:27,564
And I just think that we have to police that area a little bit more.

912
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:30,247
And I just think that we should give them a shake.

913
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:32,789
I know the councilor mentioned, what did you mention for a review, 60?

914
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,190
60 days.

915
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:34,951
A 60-day review.

916
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,592
And at that point, we can look at it.

917
01:05:36,893 --> 01:05:44,579
And if it's creating a major havoc, believe me, the chief of police will be the first one that will be down here petitioning the council to get rid of the license if it's going to create a problem.

918
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,902
On my end, I'll just finish with saying this has come up before with RAZOs.

919
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:53,243
I remember the liquor hearing for RAZOs.

920
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,224
I remember other hearings for businesses of similar nature.

921
01:05:56,784 --> 01:06:04,328
And there hasn't been one of them that have been back before us to have the license pulled or anything as a result of the extended hours.

922
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:12,131
So with that being said, I just wanted to give a little bit more background on why I continue to support this.

923
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:16,193
And I would hope the council has the vision to at least give them the opportunity

924
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:26,864
with the full expectation that they stay to the high standards as their father and mother have done over the past 25, 30 years, as Mrs. DePaola indicated.

925
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:28,565
Thank you, Counselor.

926
01:06:29,205 --> 01:06:29,785
Welcome, sir.

927
01:06:29,825 --> 01:06:31,626
Please state your name and address again for the record.

928
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:33,127
Yes, I'm Ray Ganey.

929
01:06:33,347 --> 01:06:36,389
I've lived in the same house on Lambert Street for 57 years.

930
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:40,992
So it's nice to get new people, but it's good to listen to the people who've been here for a long time, too.

931
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,781
And my main concern with all this, I'm not against a restaurant in our community.

932
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:49,423
And every restaurant you've said, I've been to them all.

933
01:06:51,024 --> 01:06:52,185
They're listed as restaurants.

934
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:54,226
This is listed as a sports bar.

935
01:06:54,766 --> 01:06:58,348
And I've had a lot of dealings with the city of Boston with sports bars and things.

936
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:01,090
I ran a feast in the North End for 18 years.

937
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:08,475
Trust me, when it comes to promotion, liquor companies go after sports bars.

938
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:09,856
They go after feasts.

939
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:11,097
And we're a religious festival.

940
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:13,263
And there's a lot of money out there.

941
01:07:13,303 --> 01:07:31,015
And my concern as a resident, you know, I don't know what the plans are for the sports car, but I want to know what is this council going to do if they start having contests sponsored by Captain Morgan Rum, Budweiser.

942
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:34,767
Heineken, they all believe me.

943
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:43,231
Any big sports event, the Super Bowl, you know, March Madness, there's so much money out there for liquor.

944
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:47,473
You go into Memorial Square, the sports bar's there.

945
01:07:48,393 --> 01:07:53,215
And you'll see the difference between a restaurant and a sports bar.

946
01:07:53,756 --> 01:07:59,598
You know, it's fine to say, oh, people can stay in the restaurant because they're eating until 1 o'clock in the morning.

947
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:01,699
They're not there to eat.

948
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:07,065
they're there to drink, whereas the people in the community are there to live.

949
01:08:08,686 --> 01:08:30,537
And I want you to take that into consideration, because it really got me aggravated knowing that I've lived in the same house on Lambert Street within a two-second walk from that area, and I was enlisted as an abutter, whereas a parking lot owned by the city of Medford gets a notice from the city of Medford.

950
01:08:31,452 --> 01:08:36,636
I don't see anyone from the parking lot here talking up or down on this.

951
01:08:36,716 --> 01:08:37,356
It's ridiculous.

952
01:08:37,436 --> 01:08:41,699
It's a little common sense, and that's what gets voters frustrated.

953
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,780
You know, it's all well and good.

954
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,743
I've heard a lot of people come up here and say, and these are honorable gentlemen.

955
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:48,584
They're businessmen.

956
01:08:48,684 --> 01:08:49,444
I've been in business.

957
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:53,127
I know what it takes to be successful in business.

958
01:08:54,773 --> 01:09:03,921
It's very tough, however, when we, as residents who live within a stone's throw of this place, weren't notified.

959
01:09:04,802 --> 01:09:08,885
And businesses were, that closed their doors at 6 o'clock.

960
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:12,509
I mean, Martin Hardware, they're closed at 6 o'clock.

961
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:17,473
But they're totally in favor of them being open till 1 o'clock in the morning.

962
01:09:18,013 --> 01:09:19,154
They're next door neighbors.

963
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:22,277
But the judge goes home and sleeps.

964
01:09:24,129 --> 01:09:25,369
We're right there.

965
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:34,932
The parking lot behind the sports bar, behind that whole square is a mess.

966
01:09:36,012 --> 01:09:36,972
And it's owned by the city.

967
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:47,715
And quite frankly, the entrance going into that parking lot, for residents who actually walk the sidewalks, try walking there.

968
01:09:49,617 --> 01:10:03,141
I invite you all to go down there and look at that parking lot, the entrance into the parking lot, and 90% of the people who go to the sports bar will park in that parking lot.

969
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,002
The cement is all over the place.

970
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:08,322
It's all broken up.

971
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:18,685
Now, granted, there's trucks delivering there all the time and stuff, but I don't think it's been paved in over 40 years, you know, probably since Mueller's was a restaurant there.

972
01:10:19,968 --> 01:10:21,169
if anyone remembers that.

973
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:22,911
Mueller's restaurant.

974
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:23,992
They were there for years.

975
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:36,643
Now, you couple that with people coming out of the restaurant, out of the sports bar, having a few drinks, walking on that.

976
01:10:39,546 --> 01:10:43,049
I mean, I use a cane, and it's dangerous to walk.

977
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:47,348
When it's slippery or something else, forget it.

978
01:10:47,388 --> 01:10:48,409
You just walk on the street.

979
01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:49,410
You don't walk over there.

980
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:50,911
But you got to get into the parking lot.

981
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,854
If they walk over that, you're going to have some split heads there.

982
01:10:54,994 --> 01:10:55,675
I guarantee it.

983
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:57,556
Because it's a mess.

984
01:10:58,617 --> 01:10:59,618
And nobody's addressing that.

985
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:05,442
I don't know if it's the abutters of the building itself that should pay for it, the new business, the city.

986
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:07,404
The city owns the parking lot.

987
01:11:08,504 --> 01:11:10,106
But my point is this.

988
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:16,196
You're saying give them a chance with a 60-day review or something.

989
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:24,160
As a resident, I think you should review it first.

990
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,421
Don't give them extra hours first to do it.

991
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:32,603
I don't think they're going to go broke in another month to discuss this by you guys.

992
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,395
Get the rules.

993
01:11:34,656 --> 01:11:42,759
I mean, Marion was up here asking questions, and Councilor Pence asked a question, and nobody had any answers up here.

994
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:44,319
You know?

995
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:48,101
The state liquor license says till 1 o'clock.

996
01:11:48,701 --> 01:11:50,242
The city ordinance says till 11.

997
01:11:52,502 --> 01:11:54,443
If you're in the city, you've got to go by the rules of the city.

998
01:11:55,764 --> 01:11:55,984
You know?

999
01:11:57,307 --> 01:12:04,509
It's frustrating as residents, and I guarantee you, there'd be a lot more residents here if we were notified.

1000
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:15,932
With the exception of a few of us who actually see each other on a daily basis, we were able to find out about this.

1001
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:21,393
I think Mr. Bianco made a perfect case when he says,

1002
01:12:21,944 --> 01:12:23,624
It gave us a feeling that there was a fix-in.

1003
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:30,786
Like, you know, we've lived here all our lives, and we don't get a notification that there's a hearing on this.

1004
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:38,808
And yet, businesses that are closed at 6 o'clock get notifications of this.

1005
01:12:39,008 --> 01:12:40,668
I mean, that was a... What information, Mr. President?

1006
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:51,851
Pursuant to the established standard, the city is required to notify abutters who lay within 300 feet of the establishment.

1007
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:58,693
one football field of the establishment in the radius, as to whether or not there's a public hearing that's going on.

1008
01:12:58,733 --> 01:13:11,955
So granted that two-thirds of the people that were notified are businesses or business entities, it appears to me based upon the map in Councilor Caviello's packet that there's quite a large radius of individuals that were notified.

1009
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:18,997
They definitely covered all the grounds of the residences as well as the businesses that reside within the 300-foot radius, Mr. President.

1010
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:25,811
So I can certainly understand that, you know what I mean, you have some frustration about something that's going on in your neighborhood.

1011
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:31,875
But in terms of notification requirements, the notification requirements were met.

1012
01:13:32,355 --> 01:13:36,058
It's a 300-foot radius from the property that's petitioning.

1013
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,559
That's a football field.

1014
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:40,721
People who live within a football field receive notification of the meeting.

1015
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:43,783
I can throw a football from my house and hit the restaurant, believe me.

1016
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:44,924
The Steelers might need you.

1017
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:51,526
But nonetheless, I'm telling you, 300 feet, my house is within that area.

1018
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:52,267
And we weren't notified.

1019
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:53,127
That's the standard.

1020
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:55,709
And that's what's shown in the.

1021
01:13:55,969 --> 01:14:04,634
Point of information, Mr. President.

1022
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:07,696
Councilor Knight, you finished with your point of information?

1023
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:08,016
Yes, absolutely.

1024
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:09,677
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1025
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:12,599
Well, the clerk is responsible for notification, correct?

1026
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,360
Do you have a listing of who was notified?

1027
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:20,433
I think Marion sent out copies.

1028
01:14:20,493 --> 01:14:23,214
Right, but I thought you were saying this didn't look correct.

1029
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:24,234
I thought you said something.

1030
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:32,837
What I was saying, when Marion put the list, I didn't know what these written notations were.

1031
01:14:34,597 --> 01:14:36,838
So according to your list, there were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1032
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:38,838
There was 18 homes that were notified.

1033
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:45,891
18 abutters.

1034
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:46,632
Abutters?

1035
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:49,312
Abutters within the 300-foot radius.

1036
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:49,853
Right.

1037
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:56,755
And those abutters that were directly across the street from the address.

1038
01:14:58,055 --> 01:14:59,716
That's how it is, yeah.

1039
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:01,596
And this gentleman's directly across the street.

1040
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:02,957
You're not listed on this?

1041
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:04,577
Are you listed on this list?

1042
01:15:04,597 --> 01:15:04,697
No.

1043
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:05,117
No.

1044
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:07,338
And Marion's house is closest to it than mine.

1045
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:09,459
Counsel, you've made your point of information.

1046
01:15:09,619 --> 01:15:10,159
Am I correct?

1047
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,300
I think what happens, if the gentleman's correct,

1048
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:23,134
There's a butter, technically there's a butter in between them, which is the city-owned property and whatever the other parking lot out there.

1049
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:25,595
So it's not a butters to a butters.

1050
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:30,957
See, the gentleman would be a butter to a butter, actually.

1051
01:15:30,997 --> 01:15:36,179
See, that's what the state law could be, 300 feet in a radius, right?

1052
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:38,940
And those across, directly across the street.

1053
01:15:41,032 --> 01:15:44,214
These people really have, they're a butter to a butter, actually.

1054
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:45,875
That's what's happening.

1055
01:15:45,895 --> 01:15:50,118
So you're saying they're the butter to the city parking lot.

1056
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:51,278
Which is not really.

1057
01:15:51,318 --> 01:16:05,367
If I'm looking at this right, because this is the certified list from the assessors and the engineer, the map of that diagram, I could probably envision where they live, that they're the butter to the butter.

1058
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,929
I'm directly across the street.

1059
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:09,690
Right.

1060
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,348
If I'm looking at it, I did not get notification.

1061
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:24,350
And the other two situations that the neighborhood has been involved in past years, I was notified on both of those occasions.

1062
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:28,611
I mean, you could have been, like I said, it's a 300 feet, this is a certified list.

1063
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:30,811
So I don't know.

1064
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:32,072
I don't make the list.

1065
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:38,373
I think what the feelings of the residents are, if you look at that as a whole, and I'm sure,

1066
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:44,777
It's probably within the letter of the law, but there's a little bit of common sense when these things are being drawn up.

1067
01:16:46,377 --> 01:16:54,339
And it was told to me that the petitioner pays for the certified list to be sent out.

1068
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:59,881
So I said, and so do I by paying my taxes to a salary.

1069
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:02,261
What does that have to do with anything?

1070
01:17:03,822 --> 01:17:04,882
That's what I was told.

1071
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:06,943
I'm sorry?

1072
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:16,305
I said, when I was up to get a copy of the abuttus list when I did not receive one, I was quite surprised.

1073
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:24,649
And then after reviewing it, we were going over it, and I said, oh, it's commercial, commercial, commercial, commercial, commercial.

1074
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:30,753
And it came to 12 to 6, two-thirds to commercial, one-third to residential.

1075
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:37,277
And it was told to me then that these lists

1076
01:17:38,203 --> 01:17:43,247
are paid by the petitioner, the owner, certified male.

1077
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:45,168
I said, that's fine.

1078
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:51,092
But we also pay taxes as residents for salaries for the city workers.

1079
01:17:51,853 --> 01:17:57,177
I mean, it's just a, I don't understand what the rationale by saying that to me was, but.

1080
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:00,139
That's fine.

1081
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:02,480
I think that things should be a little bit more balanced.

1082
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:13,024
I mean, to go directly across the street to the MBTA station, they got one, to the liquor store on, I think it's 260 on Spring Street.

1083
01:18:13,044 --> 01:18:13,945
The flower shop.

1084
01:18:14,145 --> 01:18:15,085
The flower shop.

1085
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:16,445
Those three consecutive ones.

1086
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:26,509
It was Dino's, Dempsey's, the florist shop right at that corner, shot across to the MBTA, over to the liquor store, and then from 442 Salem Street,

1087
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:33,612
the property was discussing, all the way straight up to the Dunkin' Donuts.

1088
01:18:34,332 --> 01:18:39,594
So that really covered an entire area of commercial.

1089
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,975
See, it seems like the 300-foot radius was done in one direction.

1090
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:48,277
It wasn't done, you know, in a 180-degree direction.

1091
01:18:48,297 --> 01:18:49,297
Exactly.

1092
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:50,137
OK.

1093
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:57,860
And of those six residents that were notified,

1094
01:18:58,328 --> 01:19:00,550
The house directly next to me is a condo.

1095
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,592
So three were sent to one address.

1096
01:19:04,032 --> 01:19:10,317
So typically, four homes were touched for this subject tonight, four homes.

1097
01:19:11,278 --> 01:19:13,240
I know that they're individually owned.

1098
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,421
I understand that.

1099
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:19,545
But I'm sure the people within the house would say, did you get this?

1100
01:19:19,585 --> 01:19:20,345
Or what's this about?

1101
01:19:20,365 --> 01:19:20,806
Or whatever.

1102
01:19:20,826 --> 01:19:22,447
There'd be some kind of contact.

1103
01:19:24,108 --> 01:19:27,151
So typically, four homes got notified.

1104
01:19:28,378 --> 01:19:29,259
out of the 18.

1105
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:34,442
Just want to bring that for future things in the city, because it's going to be a lot going on in the city.

1106
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:41,726
It's going to be a lot of changes, hopefully a lot of good ones, so that when you see these abutted lists, you know, is this balanced here?

1107
01:19:45,269 --> 01:19:45,729
We all set?

1108
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,569
So that's it.

1109
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:47,810
Thank you.

1110
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:50,972
The gentleman has the floor.

1111
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:53,434
Oh, you can respond first.

1112
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:54,514
I'm not going away.

1113
01:19:55,155 --> 01:19:57,156
I think the woman brings up a very valid point.

1114
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,981
The 300 rule is a state law.

1115
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,564
That's the minimum requirement that we have to follow as a city.

1116
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:09,888
The state doesn't say you can't notify 400 feet, 500 feet, 1,000 feet.

1117
01:20:10,328 --> 01:20:11,469
They leave that up to the city.

1118
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:13,570
We can't do less than 300 feet.

1119
01:20:14,171 --> 01:20:23,857
So, we've discussed this in the past, and I'm not sure where it landed, Mr. President, but I think it's a worthwhile discussion to have when it comes to notification of about as

1120
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,042
Transparency, to me, is the utmost importance.

1121
01:20:27,682 --> 01:20:38,850
And I don't think either side, whether you're in favor or against or whatever you might be, I think everyone wants a level playing field and to make sure everyone's notified, including business owners and abutters and anyone else.

1122
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:43,974
And I think that's another issue, Mr. President, as a council we have to review.

1123
01:20:44,754 --> 01:20:50,018
And there's a lot of discussion about being business friendly and so forth in this community, and I would

1124
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:55,879
say as one member of the council, uh, extended hours are something that we offer.

1125
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:59,621
Um, and in my opinion, it's a case by case.

1126
01:21:00,641 --> 01:21:04,983
Uh, if we go based on what some comments were made tonight, well, these other restaurants have it.

1127
01:21:05,003 --> 01:21:05,943
We've got to give it to him too.

1128
01:21:06,602 --> 01:21:08,463
then why are we voting for any of these?

1129
01:21:09,203 --> 01:21:13,485
We've already extended hours to 12, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning.

1130
01:21:14,206 --> 01:21:15,346
Then why do we have to vote?

1131
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:17,367
It has to be 3 o'clock in the morning.

1132
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:20,268
It has to be done on a case-by-case situation.

1133
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:28,752
And there are extenuating circumstances, in my opinion, that at least will weigh on me when I make a decision.

1134
01:21:30,013 --> 01:21:31,634
And some of it has to do with neighborhoods.

1135
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:32,954
Some of it has to do with traffic.

1136
01:21:33,315 --> 01:21:34,195
There's a lot of issues.

1137
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:41,626
But getting back to the business-friendly, Mr. President, you know, extended hours are not with businesses coming to Memphis.

1138
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,147
We can get extended hours coming to Memphis.

1139
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:48,150
They come in because they want to see our roads and sidewalks repaired, Mr. President.

1140
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:53,914
They want to make sure the lighting in the business districts is proper, which we've been fighting about for years.

1141
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:58,477
They want to make sure there's foot traffic in the community after 6 o'clock.

1142
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:00,515
The city doesn't roll up the sidewalks.

1143
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:07,102
They want to make sure the licensing process at City Hall is not like pulling teeth, which happens in this community.

1144
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:11,186
So, you know, I don't buy the fact that we're not being business friendly.

1145
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:15,070
I think that that is set by the administration, to be quite honest with you.

1146
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:15,711
It's been here 28 years.

1147
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:23,516
And if you look at our business districts, Haines Square is no different than West Meffitt, no different than Meffitt Square, Salt Meffitt, Mr. President.

1148
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:24,877
It's no different.

1149
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:27,138
Our business districts are going down.

1150
01:22:27,598 --> 01:22:31,721
There's many open storefronts in this community, and businesses are struggling.

1151
01:22:31,741 --> 01:22:32,402
I agree with that.

1152
01:22:33,022 --> 01:22:34,963
But I don't think it's because of extended hours.

1153
01:22:35,344 --> 01:22:49,393
I think it's the message that this city has been sending out over the years, Mr. President, because it seems to be working in Somerville, it seems to be working in Stoneham, in Wakefield, and a lot of surrounding communities, Woburn Center, that have thriving business districts.

1154
01:22:49,893 --> 01:23:00,901
And we seem, for whatever reason, we're right off of 93, we're five minutes from Boston, we have a river that runs through the heart of our community, and we seem to be lagging behind when it comes to economic growth.

1155
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:05,371
I wouldn't be too quick to just say extended hours is the solve-all.

1156
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:09,533
Yeah, we want business to be able to compete in this community, absolutely.

1157
01:23:09,953 --> 01:23:17,356
But, you know, we also have to be mindful that, you know, this community, we're land poor.

1158
01:23:17,897 --> 01:23:21,258
And, you know, this is a commercial zone business district, absolutely.

1159
01:23:21,738 --> 01:23:26,080
It happens to abut homes that have been there 70, 80, 90, 100 years.

1160
01:23:26,521 --> 01:23:29,342
So I think we have to be mindful, in my opinion,

1161
01:23:29,786 --> 01:23:37,812
I'd like to see, and we've had this done in the past, is maybe if we can get the parties together tonight to agree upon something.

1162
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:41,595
Because I don't know if you've met with the owners or some of the abutters have met with the owners.

1163
01:23:42,035 --> 01:23:44,077
And we've done this in the past, and we've been successful.

1164
01:23:44,137 --> 01:23:47,839
Councils that have been on for a number of years, we were able to get both parties together.

1165
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:51,222
They step outside for a few minutes and say, what do you think about doing this or that?

1166
01:23:51,262 --> 01:23:52,423
How can we come to an agreement?

1167
01:23:52,883 --> 01:23:54,264
And maybe you will, maybe you won't.

1168
01:23:54,304 --> 01:23:54,684
Who knows?

1169
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:58,047
But I think it's worth trying, Mr. President, at this time.

1170
01:23:58,895 --> 01:24:00,796
Because I can see both sides.

1171
01:24:01,296 --> 01:24:04,958
And I know it's my job to make a decision, but I can see both sides of this issue.

1172
01:24:05,558 --> 01:24:06,219
I really can.

1173
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:07,819
And I want to make it work.

1174
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:12,722
I want to make it work for the abutters, and I want to make it work for the business.

1175
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:26,708
So, I would ask at this time, Mr. President, when people are done speaking, if both parties wouldn't mind stepping outside and speaking about the issues, and then coming back before the council and see if they can come to somewhat of a compromise.

1176
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:40,851
I'm in favor of that, but there are things that are still concerning me, and basically because of the name Sports Bar, because I know what it attracts.

1177
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:48,153
And I alluded to, you know, contests and things like that, especially among sporting events and stuff.

1178
01:24:49,314 --> 01:24:54,055
And dealing with liquor companies and beer companies, I know how much they promote things.

1179
01:24:56,576 --> 01:24:58,457
That's a real concern for the neighborhood.

1180
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:00,833
if that starts happening.

1181
01:25:01,214 --> 01:25:07,195
I'm not saying they're doing that, and I know they're not doing that right now, as far as I know, they're not doing that.

1182
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:10,856
But how does the city address it?

1183
01:25:11,097 --> 01:25:12,417
That was my question to you guys.

1184
01:25:12,997 --> 01:25:14,598
Do you have any idea?

1185
01:25:14,618 --> 01:25:18,119
I've dealt with the Boston City Council on this.

1186
01:25:18,199 --> 01:25:20,479
I haven't dealt with the Memphis City Council.

1187
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,761
I know there's a lot of promotional money out there.

1188
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:29,102
Of course, it deals with their products.

1189
01:25:29,803 --> 01:25:33,545
And the one area that they really can spend is in liquor.

1190
01:25:34,485 --> 01:25:39,267
And it's, you know, you can see it in Malden.

1191
01:25:39,387 --> 01:25:43,708
You can see it in Malden Square, some of the pubs and sports bars in Malden Square.

1192
01:25:43,728 --> 01:25:52,912
You know, they have a boxing event, and, you know, it's, you know, pay-per-view sponsored by theâ€” Point of information, Councillor Longo-Kurt.

1193
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:53,881
Thank you.

1194
01:25:54,342 --> 01:25:55,023
Sorry to interrupt.

1195
01:25:55,363 --> 01:26:02,873
I just know that we are a lot different than Boston with regards to regulations, and our liquor laws are much stricter than theirs.

1196
01:26:02,953 --> 01:26:08,600
I don't think some of the things that happen in Boston could ever happen in Medford, as the laws are written right now.

1197
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,941
Could I recite them to you?

1198
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:10,001
No.

1199
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:14,479
As a resident, that's my concern, because I'm familiar with Boston.

1200
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:25,521
But as a 57-year resident of Medford, I'm also familiar with the fact that we haven't had any sports bars in Medford that I know of.

1201
01:26:26,161 --> 01:26:28,101
And now I have one right in my own neighborhood.

1202
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:30,582
And that's my concern.

1203
01:26:31,022 --> 01:26:36,743
Are they bringing in that same marketing as sports bars from all over the rest of the state?

1204
01:26:38,175 --> 01:26:38,795
do your homework.

1205
01:26:39,196 --> 01:26:45,680
There's a lot of them out there, and there's a lot that goes on in them.

1206
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:55,166
I'd even like to see the police chief up here to answer some questions on it, because it can really snowball.

1207
01:26:55,846 --> 01:26:58,248
Believe me, I really don't know these gentlemen.

1208
01:26:58,268 --> 01:26:59,589
They seem like very good gentlemen.

1209
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:06,113
I'm not saying that they're of the same mentality as some of these other companies,

1210
01:27:08,986 --> 01:27:16,848
You know, it's a neighborhood that I've lived in all my life, and I don't want to see certain things happen to it that I've seen happen in other areas.

1211
01:27:19,169 --> 01:27:19,629
Thank you.

1212
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,591
Point of information, Counselor Camuso.

1213
01:27:25,831 --> 01:27:33,454
I just wanted to let the gentleman know the chief of police and all the other department heads have signed off, and that's where they normally say they would concern.

1214
01:27:33,474 --> 01:27:34,234
Signed off on what?

1215
01:27:34,674 --> 01:27:36,254
I'm going to give you the whole packet in two seconds.

1216
01:27:36,815 --> 01:27:36,935
OK.

1217
01:27:36,955 --> 01:27:37,735
You can take a look at it.

1218
01:27:39,262 --> 01:27:41,503
Sir, have you completed your presentation?

1219
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:42,863
Thank you very much.

1220
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:46,784
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight, who has been waiting patiently.

1221
01:27:47,124 --> 01:27:50,725
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Longo, for your patience as well.

1222
01:27:51,685 --> 01:28:00,968
I think it's important to point out that the issue before this council is the approval of extended hours for an entity that has an approved common victualized license.

1223
01:28:02,088 --> 01:28:06,589
The issue of entertainment, the issue of licensing and liquor establishment and all that falls under the

1224
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:09,384
purview of our licensing commission.

1225
01:28:09,724 --> 01:28:13,527
So some of these questions that are being asked this evening would be appropriate for the licensing commission.

1226
01:28:13,887 --> 01:28:17,209
And I think that they're certainly worthy of an answer, sir.

1227
01:28:17,489 --> 01:28:18,590
There's no question about that.

1228
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:31,297
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper this evening to request that the Liquor Commission on members thereof meet with us and the committee of the whole to address some of these questions that are being raised this evening for future edification.

1229
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:33,565
As an amendment to this paper, please.

1230
01:28:34,326 --> 01:28:35,086
Side paper.

1231
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:36,126
Side paper.

1232
01:28:36,366 --> 01:28:37,347
Or separate paper.

1233
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:38,087
B paper.

1234
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:44,048
We'll put that down as a B paper, Mr. Clerk.

1235
01:28:44,128 --> 01:28:45,409
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1236
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:48,530
Madam Vice President, patiently waiting.

1237
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:48,850
Thank you.

1238
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,490
Thank you, President de la Rousseau.

1239
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:55,612
I just want to go off of what Councilor Mark said, because I, too, am in the same boat.

1240
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:59,212
You know, I try to put yourself in the shoes of an abutter

1241
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:11,371
what's going to be a sports bar slash upscale restaurant is, sorry, I didn't know you were waiting to talk, upscale restaurant from what I saw today when I went to go visit the establishment.

1242
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:12,952
I mean, it's beautiful inside.

1243
01:29:13,092 --> 01:29:28,063
And the bar is located, which I was told to decide that is, you know, the sushi bar is closest to the restaurant, closest to the neighborhood where the sports bar, bar area is closer to, you know, Mr. Throt's,

1244
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:31,290
business.

1245
01:29:33,372 --> 01:29:43,760
The main concern, after listening to everybody speak tonight, I think the main issue is with regards to noise and primarily when the establishment closes.

1246
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:54,569
So what I would ask, you know, if we are going to table this to allow the residents and the business owners to speak together, I think that's the main issue that needs to be resolved.

1247
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:56,230
You know, what is the business going to do?

1248
01:29:56,659 --> 01:30:02,383
This does let out, you know, somewhat on Salem Street, but very close to a residential neighborhood.

1249
01:30:02,483 --> 01:30:17,713
So, you know, what can be done, what compromise can be made to make sure that when the business does close, whether that's 11, 12, or 1, how can we make sure that the peace and enjoyment and the quiet enjoyment of the residents is left intact?

1250
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:20,335
I agree with what the gentleman said.

1251
01:30:20,355 --> 01:30:24,798
This council, I believe it's been a few years, but we did meet with the chief of police.

1252
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:31,903
I specifically askedâ€”we know about the problems in the area, and we were reassured that detectives are on it.

1253
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:32,904
We were reassured.

1254
01:30:32,964 --> 01:30:39,206
Now, I think that's a stretch with regards to an upscale establishment.

1255
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:46,469
I think that needs to be put second with regards to this license and with regards to noise.

1256
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:49,930
I called in a drug deal today that happened on Richard and Doonan.

1257
01:30:50,938 --> 01:30:55,399
My kids and I watched a drug bust in front of my home back in 2014.

1258
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,400
It's everywhere.

1259
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,460
It's everywhere.

1260
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:03,562
And I can't base my decision on this one license because of what is going on in the area.

1261
01:31:03,682 --> 01:31:04,643
That needs to be fixed.

1262
01:31:04,703 --> 01:31:08,844
And I think, if I could amend this, that we meet with the chief of police and do get updated.

1263
01:31:08,864 --> 01:31:11,785
I mean, we were reassured that they're doing the best they can.

1264
01:31:11,845 --> 01:31:15,266
We know there's problems in the old Johnny's, when it was Johnny's parking lot.

1265
01:31:15,626 --> 01:31:16,306
I don't know.

1266
01:31:16,366 --> 01:31:18,087
We haven't got an update since it was

1267
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:21,195
changed over to stop and shop, and I think that is time.

1268
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:27,942
But I think that the noise factor needs to be addressed, and I'm a business owner myself.

1269
01:31:28,102 --> 01:31:41,896
I know the profit that's going to come from those hours, but it has to be, it has to, there needs to be an agreement between the neighbors and the restaurant on what can be done to alleviate that.

1270
01:31:42,398 --> 01:31:43,299
And I agree.

1271
01:31:43,939 --> 01:31:48,922
I think there should be not only a 60-day review, but then a six-month review and a 12-month review.

1272
01:31:49,623 --> 01:31:57,328
And my last point, I guess, or question to the, especially the three vocal neighbors is, this license was given, you know, this establishment opened in July.

1273
01:31:57,348 --> 01:32:03,432
Have there been any concerns the 10, 11 o'clock hour for the last two months?

1274
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:05,153
And have the police been called?

1275
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:07,174
Or has there been any, you know, rowdiness?

1276
01:32:07,254 --> 01:32:10,937
Because if there isn't, then maybe we can give them a chance and see.

1277
01:32:11,745 --> 01:32:20,708
whether that's less of an hour than they want or there are some other compromises, you know, I would just, that would be my question to the neighbors as well.

1278
01:32:20,808 --> 01:32:25,329
What has transpired in the last two months at that 11 o'clock hour?

1279
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:32,852
I know that, you know, there's been a couple of times they've been in there till 1130, people have been in there till 1130, but what has the noise factor been like?

1280
01:32:32,872 --> 01:32:37,473
Because that is my, would be my main concern as a resident with regards to this license.

1281
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:44,289
And that's my main concern as, you know, as a councillor who's trying to do the right thing for all parties, but obviously going to disappoint some people tonight.

1282
01:32:44,609 --> 01:32:47,170
Councillor, you suggested amendment.

1283
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:53,373
We don't even have a motion on the floor yet, but what would your amendment be if we ever do get a motion on the floor?

1284
01:32:53,573 --> 01:32:55,274
I think I'll hold my amendments.

1285
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:03,115
Right now, if the neighbors and the business owners would like to speak, like Councilor Marks suggested, I'll hold my amendments.

1286
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,576
But I just wanted to voice my opinion.

1287
01:33:04,596 --> 01:33:08,559
I didn't hear any particular things that needed to be discussed, just general concerns.

1288
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:13,023
But we'll allow them, if there's a motion before us, to discuss it at the time.

1289
01:33:13,063 --> 01:33:15,284
The chair now recognizes Councilor Knight.

1290
01:33:16,846 --> 01:33:19,808
One amendment would be to meet with the chief of police.

1291
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:21,389
This is a side paper.

1292
01:33:21,489 --> 01:33:25,292
To meet with the chief of police in a committee of the whole within the next, you know,

1293
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:41,957
three to four or five meetings beforehand so that we can discuss that area and the problems that we discussed probably two years ago now, and what's transpiring, what is the department doing, and what has been done to alleviate some of the problems.

1294
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,690
Thank you, Madam Vice President, Councilor Knight.

1295
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:53,595
Thank you very much, and I think it's very important to point out that vibrant downtowns do help revitalize neighborhoods, and they do help improve property value.

1296
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:57,437
Bustling downtowns actually provide stability in our communities.

1297
01:33:58,137 --> 01:34:05,261
And a reoccurring theme across Medford during this election season in particular has been the revitalization of our downtown squares.

1298
01:34:06,235 --> 01:34:09,716
And I think that right now, you know, I couldn't agree with Councilor Marks more.

1299
01:34:09,736 --> 01:34:10,896
There's a need for some balance.

1300
01:34:10,996 --> 01:34:16,817
We need to figure out how we're going to balance the revitalization of our downtown districts with the needs of the residents in our community.

1301
01:34:17,177 --> 01:34:27,840
And I'd wholeheartedly support his suggestion to maybe table the item for a little while to later on in the meeting, let the party sit down maybe in the council room and see if they can negotiate a compromise.

1302
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,500
Mr. President,

1303
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:34,995
You know, in situations like this, there are winners or losers if people don't come to the table to sit down and negotiate and meet in the middle ground.

1304
01:34:35,055 --> 01:34:37,297
And, you know, I'd hate to see the business suffer.

1305
01:34:37,337 --> 01:34:38,578
I'd hate to see the residents suffer.

1306
01:34:38,618 --> 01:34:41,620
So I think that, you know, that's a prudent course of action to take.

1307
01:34:42,101 --> 01:34:52,549
And I'd move that the matter be tabled and that the parties have the opportunity to meet in Council Room 207 to discuss the future of Shanghai Moon and maybe negotiate a compromise.

1308
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:55,632
On the motion of Council 9th, that this matter be tabled.

1309
01:34:56,028 --> 01:35:01,752
so that the parties may negotiate and meet outside chambers.

1310
01:35:02,312 --> 01:35:04,113
On that motion, Councilor Camuso.

1311
01:35:05,894 --> 01:35:08,456
Can we just let the gentleman speak first?

1312
01:35:08,496 --> 01:35:09,997
He's been waiting patiently at the microphone.

1313
01:35:10,017 --> 01:35:11,258
He's a very patient man.

1314
01:35:11,678 --> 01:35:12,819
Benvenuto, signore.

1315
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,182
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1316
01:35:17,742 --> 01:35:20,124
Once again, Dominic Camara, 219 Lawrence Road.

1317
01:35:21,004 --> 01:35:25,347
As some of you know, especially a couple of my former students in Medford High School,

1318
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:33,469
a long-time resident of this city, and as a teacher, as a resident, obviously, I love the city of Medford.

1319
01:35:33,509 --> 01:35:35,690
I grew up in Cambridge, but I loved Medford since 1969.

1320
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:42,493
And I, within a few years, I got to go into business in the city of Medford, because I loved Medford.

1321
01:35:42,893 --> 01:35:50,576
Now, just to put this whole conversation into perspective, in 1980, 85, 86, I was able to open up a business.

1322
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:51,736
What business was that?

1323
01:35:51,756 --> 01:35:53,057
It was a restaurant in Medford Square.

1324
01:35:54,144 --> 01:35:56,266
And there hadn't been anything in Memphis Square for years.

1325
01:35:56,426 --> 01:36:03,370
And in order to open up a restaurant in Memphis Square in those days, in 1985, you had to have a seating capacity of 250 seats.

1326
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,271
250 seats.

1327
01:36:04,331 --> 01:36:11,056
Well, I borrowed and begged along with a partner of mine, and we put together this wonderful restaurant, which was called the High Street Grill.

1328
01:36:11,296 --> 01:36:12,376
It became very successful.

1329
01:36:13,317 --> 01:36:18,942
There's only two of us in the city of Medford, the Happy Attic and us at the High Street Grill that had this restaurant.

1330
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:23,166
And I'm telling you, I'm still in awe from that restaurant to this day.

1331
01:36:24,407 --> 01:36:28,151
The problem was in those days that it was a hardcore belief that if you

1332
01:36:28,411 --> 01:36:33,292
If you had less than 250 capacity, the city of Medford would become a barroom town.

1333
01:36:33,692 --> 01:36:37,813
All these fears, fear mongering was rabid in the city of Medford.

1334
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:44,895
Well, here we are 35 years later, and you can have a liquor license for 50 people, and I don't see a barroom atmosphere in the city of Medford.

1335
01:36:45,355 --> 01:36:50,837
So change, all I know is that change is always fraught with fear, distrust, and

1336
01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:54,399
I don't know what else to call it.

1337
01:36:55,219 --> 01:36:55,820
But here we are.

1338
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:01,566
The city of Medford is alive and well with wonderful businesses, restaurants, and I don't see a bar room anywhere.

1339
01:37:01,586 --> 01:37:04,088
I don't see people brawling outside of anywhere.

1340
01:37:04,489 --> 01:37:08,253
And when it comes to the extension of these so-called, you know, from 12 to 1 o'clock,

1341
01:37:08,753 --> 01:37:17,782
I mean, does anybody remember how wonderful it was to be coming back to Medford if you went to Boston at a theater night and you came back and you could have breakfast at Carol's Restaurant at three o'clock in the morning?

1342
01:37:18,202 --> 01:37:22,767
And you parked and you slammed, you know, you made some noise, I guess, but my God, it was wonderful.

1343
01:37:23,347 --> 01:37:25,669
And the general said, who the heck would want to do this?

1344
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:28,953
The previous general said, at one o'clock in the morning, what kind of person would do that?

1345
01:37:29,053 --> 01:37:29,273
Me.

1346
01:37:29,773 --> 01:37:31,255
This kind of person would want to do that.

1347
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:33,557
I'm a respectable individual in the city of Medford.

1348
01:37:34,363 --> 01:37:47,030
I have good character, so if I want to go someplace and if I'm coming back to Medford at one o'clock in the morning, that makes me a bad person because, oh my, who the heck would want to have a glass of wine and something to eat at one o'clock in the morning?

1349
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:52,383
by bringing perspective to this conversation, the fear can disappear.

1350
01:37:53,003 --> 01:37:55,124
And I do understand neighborhoods and everything else.

1351
01:37:55,185 --> 01:37:57,946
I live two doors down from the hospital.

1352
01:37:58,366 --> 01:37:59,847
And there was fear mongering going on.

1353
01:37:59,867 --> 01:38:07,291
And I think Councilor Pence was at the meeting at Tufts when somebody, some people from across the way would say, oh my God, if they go partner with, uh,

1354
01:38:08,412 --> 01:38:10,713
partners, healthcare, so on and so forth.

1355
01:38:10,933 --> 01:38:12,234
The ambulance are going to be woken up.

1356
01:38:12,354 --> 01:38:15,436
I've never heard an ambulance, and let me tell you, I live two doors down.

1357
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:21,439
So there's always fear in this thing, but when you put it in context, I think it's fine.

1358
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:28,163
I don't think you're going to see much of a difference whether you open from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock on any given established in the city of Metric.

1359
01:38:28,523 --> 01:38:32,225
And if it helps the city community, I mean the commercial community, all the better.

1360
01:38:32,612 --> 01:38:35,934
I mean, the commercial sector, I'm also a board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce.

1361
01:38:36,175 --> 01:38:37,636
They're one of my tenants, for God's sakes.

1362
01:38:38,116 --> 01:38:40,118
And I believe in the commercial sector of Medford.

1363
01:38:40,618 --> 01:38:41,739
It's a wonderful sector.

1364
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:44,140
And they support the city of Medford tax-wise.

1365
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:56,049
And so I think the more we encourage business, the more we encourage the landlords, the more we encourage the commercial real estate to survive in the city of Medford, the lower the residential taxes can be artificially lowered.

1366
01:38:56,349 --> 01:39:01,273
So I think this is a win-win for everybody when you encourage the commercial sector.

1367
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:03,102
And with that, I'd like to close.

1368
01:39:03,122 --> 01:39:03,722
Thank you so much.

1369
01:39:03,843 --> 01:39:05,663
And I will testify to your character, sir.

1370
01:39:05,763 --> 01:39:06,443
Thank you.

1371
01:39:08,024 --> 01:39:10,804
Councilor Camusop, on the motion for table.

1372
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:19,906
On the motion for tabling, at this point, I'm just going to take a little different stance, because I think we're charged with the responsibility to either vote this yea or nay.

1373
01:39:20,547 --> 01:39:22,967
Obviously, it's a very, very nice neighborhood.

1374
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,128
Lambert Street has hundreds of people living on it.

1375
01:39:26,148 --> 01:39:28,168
We have several residents here.

1376
01:39:28,568 --> 01:39:30,489
But I think in the best interest of

1377
01:39:31,742 --> 01:39:37,284
the whole city in that particular area, I'm ready to take a vote on it and with the reviews.

1378
01:39:37,624 --> 01:39:47,288
So as far as tabling it, I just don't see anything coming out of it this evening, to be honest, because I don't think anything's going to be said that's going to say people, OK, do you have a few points?

1379
01:39:47,528 --> 01:39:47,888
All right.

1380
01:39:48,008 --> 01:39:50,189
But I'm going to vote no on the tabling.

1381
01:39:50,369 --> 01:39:52,810
I'm going to vote no on the tabling for that matter.

1382
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,911
I think we're charged to take a vote.

1383
01:39:56,757 --> 01:40:01,479
move it forward, because there are a lot of people that live in that immediate area that aren't here for them or against them, so.

1384
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:02,720
Thank you.

1385
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:03,801
Thank you.

1386
01:40:04,241 --> 01:40:09,083
Councilor, do you need to speak?

1387
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:09,343
Hi, Don.

1388
01:40:09,604 --> 01:40:11,545
Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1389
01:40:11,665 --> 01:40:13,446
Jimmy Ganey, 48 Lambert Street.

1390
01:40:13,546 --> 01:40:20,569
I've been living on Lambert Street all my life, 58 years, and I'd like to address a couple of things.

1391
01:40:20,909 --> 01:40:24,191
I was one of those guys eating at Carol's Diner late at night

1392
01:40:24,713 --> 01:40:28,694
during the disco days, the difference was we were eating breakfast, we weren't drinking.

1393
01:40:30,235 --> 01:40:30,675
Big point.

1394
01:40:32,395 --> 01:40:35,016
Also, you had mentioned Boston City Council.

1395
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:42,378
They do things differently than Medford City Council, true, but I work in the north end of Boston, all right?

1396
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:46,059
I'm sure many of you here have dined in the north end of Boston.

1397
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:54,382
You go in probably about 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, have your dinner, maybe stroll the north end a little bit, and then leave and go back to your nice, quiet suburbs

1398
01:40:55,783 --> 01:41:09,550
The thing that goes on later on in the North End is that all those, when those restaurants close and those drinking establishments are open till one in the morning, you have no idea how loud it is and how rowdy it is.

1399
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:20,956
Public urination, fighting, and I don't, I hate to say this, but I don't have much faith in the younger generation and even less when they're drunk, all right?

1400
01:41:21,016 --> 01:41:25,498
I've seen it with my own eyes because I work there and I get out of work at one o'clock in the morning

1401
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:33,375
And I walk to my car, and I'm glad when I go home to my nice, quiet Medford in Lambert Street, right over there, I say, thank God I live over here.

1402
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:34,516
My mother's from the North End.

1403
01:41:34,636 --> 01:41:36,357
It's not the same place it was years ago.

1404
01:41:36,938 --> 01:41:48,388
I have so many friends there that are dying to get out, lifelong residents of the North End, because these yuppies that go into these establishments, they have no respect for anybody, anyone sleeping,

1405
01:41:48,948 --> 01:41:53,371
and they don't care about a damn thing, and they care even less when they're intoxicated.

1406
01:41:53,391 --> 01:41:55,813
So I just want to enlighten you to that fact.

1407
01:41:56,093 --> 01:42:00,016
I'm very happy when I leave work and I come home to a nice, quiet Lambert Street.

1408
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:01,957
Thank you.

1409
01:42:03,698 --> 01:42:04,579
Thank you, Mr. Gaines.

1410
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:11,303
Anthony Veras, 144 Fells Ave.

1411
01:42:12,144 --> 01:42:17,688
Just to get back to what the gentleman just said, are we really going to compare meth

1412
01:42:18,538 --> 01:42:21,440
We're really going to compare Meffitt to the North End?

1413
01:42:21,721 --> 01:42:25,143
There's 30 restaurants in a row with thousands and thousands of people.

1414
01:42:25,163 --> 01:42:27,926
We're talking about a small establishment in Meffitt.

1415
01:42:28,106 --> 01:42:29,247
Are we really going to compare the two?

1416
01:42:29,287 --> 01:42:37,774
I'd just like to say that there may be less people, but it means that there might be just less drunks, that's all.

1417
01:42:38,294 --> 01:42:39,195
They're intoxicated.

1418
01:42:39,215 --> 01:42:41,376
They're out of control.

1419
01:42:41,497 --> 01:42:43,158
Chair recognizes Councilor Pinto.

1420
01:42:47,434 --> 01:42:52,198
I would assume that the reason why we're here tonight is for the extended hours.

1421
01:42:52,258 --> 01:42:55,800
And unfortunately, these extended hours have led into a neighborhood concern.

1422
01:42:56,701 --> 01:43:02,325
So I guess my first question would be to the two gentlemen who own the property.

1423
01:43:02,365 --> 01:43:03,326
Can you come up here, please?

1424
01:43:03,406 --> 01:43:04,366
I'd like to ask you a question.

1425
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:12,472
And I didn't get your names from the beginning, so I know you're...

1426
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:18,039
These are not the property owners.

1427
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:19,019
These are the business owners.

1428
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:20,280
The property owners are in there.

1429
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:21,040
Well, business owners.

1430
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,580
Oh, you just said property, so I just wanted to make sure we're getting apples to apples.

1431
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,141
Did you folks have an attorney representing you?

1432
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:28,461
Oh, no.

1433
01:43:28,681 --> 01:43:29,501
You have no attorney?

1434
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:30,281
No.

1435
01:43:30,301 --> 01:43:30,501
Okay.

1436
01:43:31,442 --> 01:43:35,182
I think that's one of the problems that they're having here right now because of the neighborhood.

1437
01:43:35,622 --> 01:43:44,824
There have been situations in the past where if you had the right attorney, or if you had an attorney, let's put it that way, that recognized that this might consider to be a problem within the neighborhood.

1438
01:43:45,262 --> 01:43:58,372
or could present a problem with the neighborhood, they would notify, they would be talking with you, and they would have neighborhood meetings before, or maybe even subsequent to a meeting such as this, where you would be able to sit down with the neighborhood to find out really what's going on.

1439
01:43:58,953 --> 01:44:04,057
And we had a situation like that most recently on Riverside Avenue on a building establishment of three businesses.

1440
01:44:04,357 --> 01:44:07,420
And I think that's maybe one of the real big drawbacks that are happening here right now.

1441
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,122
As far as the business itself going forward,

1442
01:44:12,585 --> 01:44:16,726
You advertise for sports bar, karaoke, and a weekend DJ.

1443
01:44:16,886 --> 01:44:18,067
That's noise.

1444
01:44:19,227 --> 01:44:24,628
And the neighborhood is not used to maybe that type of noise, because they've never had it or seen it before.

1445
01:44:25,489 --> 01:44:29,110
But unfortunately, you advertise something that you probably shouldn't have advertised.

1446
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:32,090
And that was a no-no, in plain English.

1447
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:35,711
So I think we know that as far as mistake, and you're not going to go forward with that.

1448
01:44:36,031 --> 01:44:38,332
I like the idea of the folks sitting down together.

1449
01:44:38,975 --> 01:44:58,028
And it might work itself out even better that whatever the compromise might be that you folks can come to, that you realize that if the business is going to expand, and it's going to expand the working base here in this community, unfortunately, if it abuts a neighborhood, something's got to give one way or the other.

1450
01:44:58,068 --> 01:45:03,712
Now, the gentleman who came here before and said, you could go to Carol's Diner at 1 o'clock in the morning and get something to eat, yeah.

1451
01:45:04,053 --> 01:45:05,434
But you were opposite a police station.

1452
01:45:05,474 --> 01:45:07,455
If anything took place, a police station was right there.

1453
01:45:08,064 --> 01:45:09,645
You're not next to a police station.

1454
01:45:09,705 --> 01:45:15,168
Unfortunately, you've heard all the comments relative to what's going on in the neighborhood, whether it's drugs, crime, or whatever it might be.

1455
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:18,090
Not emanating from your place, but that's what's in the neighborhood.

1456
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:21,552
And so I think what you've done is you've highlighted a pretty good issue right now.

1457
01:45:21,592 --> 01:45:25,235
And the issue is that the entire neighborhood now comes under the microscope.

1458
01:45:25,895 --> 01:45:29,837
And it's unfortunate that it's your business, but maybe it's the best thing that now could happen.

1459
01:45:30,598 --> 01:45:34,760
So I wish you good luck, because you've spent a lot of time, effort, and energy.

1460
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:37,202
But the neighborhood has a stake in this, too.

1461
01:45:37,626 --> 01:45:40,248
the immediate butters, because this is going to be all new to them.

1462
01:45:40,849 --> 01:45:46,373
So, I support the idea that you all sit down, try to come to some compromise to understand exactly what's going on.

1463
01:45:46,393 --> 01:45:50,717
When you say, weekend DJ, I mean, is that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday?

1464
01:45:50,737 --> 01:45:52,418
You're going to have a DJ there playing music?

1465
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:53,459
People are going to be dancing?

1466
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:54,120
I don't know.

1467
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,961
That belongs before the liquor commission.

1468
01:45:56,221 --> 01:45:58,543
But these are the questions that nobody seems to understand.

1469
01:45:58,963 --> 01:46:03,747
Karaoke, you're going to have that on three nights a week where people are going to go up there and sing, have a good time, and laugh?

1470
01:46:03,988 --> 01:46:04,408
That's great.

1471
01:46:04,879 --> 01:46:09,463
You have a noise factor, and that's something I think you're probably going to have to explain when you go before the liquor bar.

1472
01:46:09,903 --> 01:46:13,186
As far as the sports bar goes, I mean, you can go to any restaurant, I think, in the city.

1473
01:46:13,206 --> 01:46:15,267
They all have televisions in there right now.

1474
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:22,833
So, and the other gentleman who says you have these liquor people come in there and they give you â€” yeah, they're going to do that no matter what the bar is.

1475
01:46:23,414 --> 01:46:26,857
So, I'm more concerned about having you come to a happy medium.

1476
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:29,859
I like the idea that you've spent a lot of money and you've invested it.

1477
01:46:29,919 --> 01:46:33,602
So, that means you believe in the city, you believe in the neighborhood, and you believe in your business.

1478
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:35,991
and it's nice to hear people come here to support you.

1479
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:40,173
And I didn't hear anyone from the neighborhood oppose you because of your business.

1480
01:46:40,433 --> 01:46:43,194
They're just concerned about how is this going to affect them.

1481
01:46:43,634 --> 01:46:55,179
So I agree with Councilor Marks and Councilor Longo-Curran and Councilor Caviello, not only having maybe a review, but maybe to just go down and sit down and let them have a better understanding of really what this is.

1482
01:46:55,459 --> 01:46:58,941
It's unfortunate that this 300 radius didn't do this.

1483
01:46:59,201 --> 01:46:59,561
I don't know.

1484
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:00,942
Did it do the circumference or not?

1485
01:47:00,982 --> 01:47:02,022
Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.

1486
01:47:02,062 --> 01:47:02,402
I don't know.

1487
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:11,463
If everybody's on the same page, I don't think the council will have an objection, but I just think it's good that they understand this, as it relates to that, okay?

1488
01:47:11,743 --> 01:47:13,024
So, thank you.

1489
01:47:13,184 --> 01:47:13,404
Thank you.

1490
01:47:13,764 --> 01:47:26,689
So on the motion of council tonight, to table the matter, so that the parties can be open to discussion, Mr. Clerk, a roll call has been requested by Councilor Musil, and we'll take a roll call.

1491
01:47:26,709 --> 01:47:27,910
Just one quick, oh, I'm sorry.

1492
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:29,651
Can I ask one quick question?

1493
01:47:30,051 --> 01:47:32,752
When I spoke to the law department this past week,

1494
01:47:33,527 --> 01:47:37,648
They have already been granted the entertainment license.

1495
01:47:37,748 --> 01:47:38,788
I don't know if any of you knew that.

1496
01:47:38,988 --> 01:47:39,869
That's what I was told.

1497
01:47:41,309 --> 01:47:44,670
Again, and that's a point as far as the noise.

1498
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:46,950
Entertainment for what, though?

1499
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:48,731
Entertainment for karaoke.

1500
01:47:49,971 --> 01:47:51,451
Weekend DJ, karaoke?

1501
01:47:51,491 --> 01:47:53,592
Karaoke, DJ, right.

1502
01:47:54,590 --> 01:48:00,792
My concern, and I'd like to ask the, maybe I can just ask the owners now if that's part of it.

1503
01:48:01,813 --> 01:48:09,455
No, actually, I'd like to have this in front of you people, if you don't mind, with the entertainment license.

1504
01:48:10,015 --> 01:48:13,777
Right now, the back doors are open.

1505
01:48:14,097 --> 01:48:16,038
They have two back doors.

1506
01:48:16,638 --> 01:48:20,879
From the time people come in in the morning, which is probably quarter past 11, I don't know.

1507
01:48:21,099 --> 01:48:21,980
I don't know the exact time.

1508
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:32,383
I'm sorry, from the time that they come in in the morning, those two back doors are wide open and they don't close until like now their closing time is like quarter of 11.

1509
01:48:32,523 --> 01:48:33,564
Those doors are closed.

1510
01:48:34,104 --> 01:48:34,364
Okay.

1511
01:48:34,964 --> 01:48:37,885
Was any soundproofing put into this building?

1512
01:48:40,526 --> 01:48:41,747
And will the doors be closed?

1513
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:51,073
Motion of Council of Nine to table.

1514
01:48:51,093 --> 01:48:52,835
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1515
01:48:52,935 --> 01:48:55,438
Councilor Musil?

1516
01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:55,538
Yes.

1517
01:48:55,558 --> 01:48:57,760
Councilor Cavanaugh?

1518
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,100
No.

1519
01:48:58,741 --> 01:48:59,702
Councilor McPherson?

1520
01:49:00,523 --> 01:49:00,663
Yes.

1521
01:49:00,703 --> 01:49:01,704
Councilor Martins?

1522
01:49:01,804 --> 01:49:02,825
Yes.

1523
01:49:02,945 --> 01:49:04,787
Councilor Pecan?

1524
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:05,128
Yes.

1525
01:49:09,017 --> 01:49:11,518
the motion is stable.

1526
01:49:12,018 --> 01:49:17,260
When you've had your chance to talk, someone has to come in and inform the city messenger.

1527
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:26,202
Mr. Larry Lepore will then inform the chair to reconvene the meeting on this matter.

1528
01:49:26,282 --> 01:49:30,143
And we can go to room 207 down the left of the corridor.

1529
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:51,024
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1530
01:49:51,044 --> 01:49:57,905
15-674 offered by Councillor Knight has been withdrawn.

1531
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:59,285
15-675 offered by Councillor Knight.

1532
01:50:00,205 --> 01:50:11,827
Be it resolved that the Office of Community Development and the City Assessor examine the feasibility of business tax abatement for the purpose of attracting new businesses to empty storefronts.

1533
01:50:12,407 --> 01:50:13,107
Councillor Knight.

1534
01:50:13,768 --> 01:50:15,188
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1535
01:50:17,125 --> 01:50:29,214
several months, we've all heard the concerns of many residents in our community, many of those involved in the Metro Community Coalition and other community groups that have expressed concern about empty storefronts in our business districts.

1536
01:50:29,395 --> 01:50:34,038
And I think tonight and the issue about Shanghai Moon was a perfect segue into that.

1537
01:50:35,179 --> 01:50:36,220
I've been doing a little research.

1538
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,602
I've been looking at some programs that they have in other communities in other states.

1539
01:50:40,283 --> 01:50:46,828
And I think that it's a good idea for us to think about ways to attract new businesses to empty storefronts and to keep them there.

1540
01:50:47,465 --> 01:50:52,228
And we have a great plan for Medford Square, a plan that has been sitting on the shelf for a bit of time.

1541
01:50:52,789 --> 01:50:57,952
And it talks about the type of businesses that we need to create in order to have a vibrant downtown business district, Mr. President.

1542
01:50:58,466 --> 01:51:16,074
And I'd like the Office of Community Development and the city assessor to examine the feasibility of a business tax abatement or some sort of measure that would provide some relief to new businesses starting out in the community so that they can be successful and that they can shape our squares and our business district into what we envision them to be.

1543
01:51:16,114 --> 01:51:17,875
Folks, could you take your conversation out?

1544
01:51:19,976 --> 01:51:21,156
Please continue, Councilor.

1545
01:51:21,176 --> 01:51:24,137
Well, that pretty much scared me half to death, Council President.

1546
01:51:27,574 --> 01:51:51,824
With that being said, I think it would be a great idea for our city assessor and our office of community development to sit down and determine if there's a way that we can develop a tax abatement program or process to attract new businesses, to fill our empty storefronts, and to really help us shape and define our squares into more vibrant, more consumer, more pedestrian-friendly downtowns, Mr. President.

1547
01:51:51,844 --> 01:51:55,506
So I'd ask that my council colleagues support this measure and join me in voting in the affirmative.

1548
01:51:56,777 --> 01:51:57,617
Thank you, counselor.

1549
01:51:57,917 --> 01:51:59,117
Sir, you want to speak on this matter?

1550
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:01,518
Please state your name and address for the record, senator.

1551
01:52:02,998 --> 01:52:03,898
Thank you, president.

1552
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:06,159
I mean, de la russo, excuse me.

1553
01:52:06,999 --> 01:52:09,860
Robert of 71 Evans street.

1554
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:17,561
In relation to this excellent agenda item being offered, I had something on the table, 15361.

1555
01:52:22,908 --> 01:52:28,872
Remove that not for the purposes of discussion because it's the exact point the Council at night is bringing up.

1556
01:52:29,352 --> 01:52:34,315
If you could remove that from the table too, discard it so that it's off of your paperwork.

1557
01:52:34,635 --> 01:52:36,876
But I rise in favor of this.

1558
01:52:36,956 --> 01:52:49,604
If we look at the city of New York, Mayor de Blasio, I think his name is, he did a tax incentive program like this, and it's bringing in a lot of business.

1559
01:52:50,195 --> 01:53:12,889
And in relation to everything that's been discussed tonight, in another project that I'm working on, I've taken pictures from the corner of Salem Street and the Felsway, all the way up here to Forest Street and through the square, and I got some, like, 20 pictures of storefronts that are gone.

1560
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:18,753
And without mentioning any names, I know that this is an issue for one of the mayoral

1561
01:53:19,654 --> 01:53:39,682
who wants to implement this kind of tax incentive, to bring businesses into our starving business districts, and I would hope that this measure is voted in the affirmative tonight to make Medford business friendly, and we make our city attractive for businesses and families.

1562
01:53:39,762 --> 01:53:40,622
Thank you, Mr. President.

1563
01:53:41,242 --> 01:53:42,923
Thank you for your kind input, senator.

1564
01:53:43,503 --> 01:53:46,044
Chair recognizes counsel Tanta.

1565
01:53:46,064 --> 01:53:47,445
Mr. President, I would like to

1566
01:53:48,796 --> 01:54:01,947
amendment attached to my amendment that I offered some months ago when I brought forward the idea of not only offering a tax abatement, but for the incentive to bring new business folks in here, hiring Medford people and giving tax breaks.

1567
01:54:01,987 --> 01:54:12,555
I think I gave you folks all an example of what took place in a particular city down in Florida, where they took a particular area in a downtown area and they took a street, business by business by business.

1568
01:54:12,996 --> 01:54:15,798
And what they did is they went there and they made an offering as it relates to

1569
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:22,260
What the city would like to see down here, you tell us what you would do as a business owner.

1570
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,101
Because of that, you would get a tax break, number one.

1571
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:27,342
You would hire local people, number two.

1572
01:54:27,522 --> 01:54:33,524
And you would get a long-term lease with the landowner on that so the abatements wouldn't keep on going.

1573
01:54:34,084 --> 01:54:36,645
Resulting from that, it just continued to take off.

1574
01:54:36,665 --> 01:54:37,885
It took a long period of time.

1575
01:54:38,385 --> 01:54:43,587
The city of Lowell just got through doing something like that, and I think they just completed their seventh year of a program like that.

1576
01:54:44,358 --> 01:54:48,782
as it relates to taking downtown business districts as it relates to that.

1577
01:54:49,302 --> 01:54:57,209
Earlier this evening, we heard about the fact that we don't have method people want to come here because we're not a business friendly community or whatever it might be.

1578
01:54:57,749 --> 01:55:02,173
The unfortunate part is we only have one, one and a half people working in our office of community development.

1579
01:55:02,954 --> 01:55:05,836
I'm offering an office of business and cultural affairs.

1580
01:55:06,448 --> 01:55:31,742
which will bring about an outreach for business, it'll bring out the history, it'll bring about an inclusionary of all the items within neighborhoods that are necessary to make business and development grow here within our city of Memphis, because each and every business district is different, and each and every business district abuts different residential neighborhoods or other types of businesses, and they too need to be addressed separately and independently.

1581
01:55:32,468 --> 01:55:41,233
So, uh, the offering here by counselor night, um, I don't know if it's because you were reading my mind or you read my mind before I, uh, you're reading my resolutions.

1582
01:55:41,813 --> 01:55:45,775
Uh, I appreciate the fact that you're looking at this, but, um, I can assure you of this.

1583
01:55:45,975 --> 01:55:51,138
Once I'm January comes, this will be one of the priority things that I will do as mayor of this community.

1584
01:55:51,649 --> 01:55:52,109
I will take this.

1585
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:54,150
Oh, I'm not campaigning.

1586
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:54,710
I am sorry.

1587
01:55:55,431 --> 01:55:56,091
Mr. President.

1588
01:55:56,251 --> 01:56:02,834
Um, I certainly appreciate where the gentleman's coming from and, um, I look forward to fortunate enough to be reelected to work with whoever's in the corner office.

1589
01:56:02,854 --> 01:56:03,635
So thank you very much.

1590
01:56:03,695 --> 01:56:04,675
Counselor for that.

1591
01:56:05,896 --> 01:56:06,236
Thank you.

1592
01:56:06,836 --> 01:56:07,116
Thank you.

1593
01:56:07,276 --> 01:56:08,257
Was there a motion in there?

1594
01:56:08,297 --> 01:56:08,977
Counselor Penta?

1595
01:56:09,458 --> 01:56:15,640
Yeah, I would like to attach that to my resolution that I had tried to attach your resolution to counsel nights.

1596
01:56:15,741 --> 01:56:18,582
I would like to resolution before us.

1597
01:56:19,313 --> 01:56:20,994
is offered by counselor night, right?

1598
01:56:21,835 --> 01:56:26,778
But so I, yeah, I passed.

1599
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:27,379
Yes.

1600
01:56:28,199 --> 01:56:28,400
Yes.

1601
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,361
It's in the same position that judges.

1602
01:56:31,822 --> 01:56:36,826
Oh, I think it was like maybe in February, March of this year, we're going to ask for an update on counselor Penta's resolution as well.

1603
01:56:36,846 --> 01:56:37,966
I just look it up in the minutes.

1604
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:44,451
So I have no problem with the night's motion for an update on counselor Penta's related motion.

1605
01:56:44,891 --> 01:56:48,534
Mr. Clark has a B paper as a B paper.

1606
01:56:51,501 --> 01:56:52,982
And, sir, you wish to address us?

1607
01:56:53,043 --> 01:56:54,584
Please state your name and address for the record.

1608
01:56:54,624 --> 01:56:55,764
Good evening, Mr. President.

1609
01:56:56,325 --> 01:56:56,765
Good evening.

1610
01:56:56,785 --> 01:56:58,126
My name is John Starello.

1611
01:56:58,186 --> 01:57:01,468
I reside at 20 Metcalfe Street in Medford.

1612
01:57:02,269 --> 01:57:14,157
And about this offering here by Councilor Knight, it was only last December that he voted and the Hopes Council voted for a dual tax rate.

1613
01:57:14,918 --> 01:57:17,119
In that tax rate, they voted a

1614
01:57:19,013 --> 01:57:26,177
$12 tax rate for residents, and double that, a $24 tax rate for commercials.

1615
01:57:27,478 --> 01:57:31,160
Now, come along with reducing that.

1616
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,001
It should have been done at that time.

1617
01:57:33,521 --> 01:57:35,842
I suggested at the time we have a single tax rate.

1618
01:57:36,263 --> 01:57:37,443
It was the proper thing to do.

1619
01:57:38,003 --> 01:57:40,285
The commercials would have been paying the same as the residents.

1620
01:57:41,825 --> 01:57:43,066
Point of information, Councillor Knight.

1621
01:57:43,186 --> 01:57:46,428
This resolution is the furthest thing from a single tax rate.

1622
01:57:47,773 --> 01:57:48,954
That could be possible.

1623
01:57:48,994 --> 01:57:52,215
That's not what I envisioned at all and that's not what I'm seeking to do.

1624
01:57:52,396 --> 01:57:56,018
I'm perfectly comfortable with the bifurcated tax rate that we have in place right now.

1625
01:57:56,398 --> 01:58:01,120
My concern is that we have empty storefronts and we need to do more to attract businesses to keep them there.

1626
01:58:01,501 --> 01:58:09,765
And we need to do more to attract businesses that are conducive to the long-term sustainability and viability of our squares.

1627
01:58:10,345 --> 01:58:12,447
And that's why I put this measure forward, Mr. President.

1628
01:58:13,477 --> 01:58:19,761
plans in place for the redevelopment of Medford Square, the plan to redevelop Medford Square, and it tells us what kind of shops we need to have down there, and we don't have them.

1629
01:58:20,501 --> 01:58:32,208
So the intention and the theory behind this was to attract those businesses that are part of the study that we paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for that provide us with the framework to revitalize and rejuvenate the area.

1630
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:36,891
Thank you for that point of information, and thank you for your use of the word bifurcation.

1631
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:37,592
Mr. President.

1632
01:58:37,612 --> 01:58:37,872
Doctor.

1633
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:47,064
Mr. President, if you want to charge the commercials less, you should do that at that time.

1634
01:58:47,545 --> 01:58:51,348
It doesn't make sense to first charge them double and then give them an abatement.

1635
01:58:52,169 --> 01:58:53,089
How does that make sense?

1636
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:54,471
You can do it all at one time.

1637
01:58:55,251 --> 01:59:00,335
And about bringing up the single tax rate, single tax rate is something that should be considered.

1638
01:59:01,236 --> 01:59:02,897
That is not fair to the residents.

1639
01:59:03,338 --> 01:59:06,040
You're charging the residents that double rate.

1640
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,641
The residents are paying that $24, by the way.

1641
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:14,555
When that $24 is added on, well, you have to know how these taxes are applied.

1642
01:59:15,576 --> 01:59:18,198
And... Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1643
01:59:18,499 --> 01:59:27,267
I believe when we discussed the single-payer tax rate, the residential obligation would have increased tremendously to the residential homeowner, Mr. President, to the point of like...

1644
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:33,102
maybe close to $9 per thousand evaluation, if I believe I remember correctly.

1645
01:59:33,302 --> 01:59:36,643
So we went through the numbers and it didn't seem to be something that was viable.

1646
01:59:36,683 --> 01:59:38,844
And this council voted it down seven zero, Mr. President.

1647
01:59:39,184 --> 01:59:43,425
So with that being said, I think, um, you know, I rest my case and I'll let the gentlemen move on.

1648
01:59:43,986 --> 01:59:44,646
Thank you.

1649
01:59:44,686 --> 01:59:46,547
That would not have permitted reelection.

1650
01:59:46,767 --> 01:59:47,547
That was the problem.

1651
01:59:48,547 --> 01:59:50,488
Let's face the problem as it really exists.

1652
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,763
The concern there was whether or not you'd be reelected if that tax rate was a single tax rate.

1653
01:59:55,783 --> 02:00:01,686
No, the concern was that people on a fixed income that are living at home and having struggling to pay their already high tax bill aren't going to be able to do it.

1654
02:00:01,706 --> 02:00:02,447
That was my concern.

1655
02:00:02,773 --> 02:00:06,574
That's why I've always supported adopting the lowest residential factor, and I'll continue to do so.

1656
02:00:07,074 --> 02:00:11,016
Then why do you have the residents pay it when it's added on as new growth?

1657
02:00:11,176 --> 02:00:12,776
That's what happens to that tax rate.

1658
02:00:12,816 --> 02:00:14,837
That $24 is added on as new growth.

1659
02:00:15,097 --> 02:00:16,177
And who pays the new growth?

1660
02:00:16,317 --> 02:00:16,857
The residents.

1661
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:19,878
So what you're doing is you're making the residents pay the $24.

1662
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:23,279
Mr. President, if I may, we've already had this debate and discussion.

1663
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:24,220
We voted on the matter.

1664
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:25,960
We voted on it to a conclusion.

1665
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:26,440
I'm sorry.

1666
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:29,021
And not debate with individual counselors.

1667
02:00:29,461 --> 02:00:30,382
That's our procedure.

1668
02:00:30,482 --> 02:00:30,822
Yes.

1669
02:00:32,423 --> 02:00:35,466
This is all through the chair, with all due respect.

1670
02:00:35,486 --> 02:00:36,086
We're grateful.

1671
02:00:37,968 --> 02:00:40,770
There has to be some understanding as to what happens to taxes.

1672
02:00:41,911 --> 02:00:46,335
I mean, taxes go on to the tax levy limit.

1673
02:00:47,242 --> 02:00:53,966
And what happens is that $24 rate is shifted to the tax levy limit, and the residents end up paying it.

1674
02:00:54,326 --> 02:00:57,668
The very thing that the council wants to avoid is what he's doing.

1675
02:00:58,489 --> 02:00:59,469
But he doesn't realize that.

1676
02:00:59,489 --> 02:01:14,178
I think what the council is trying to do, if I can help you, is apply a measure that's been successful tremendously in many urban areas to attract business and thus create

1677
02:01:15,158 --> 02:01:21,882
an atmosphere of urban renewal and success in neighborhoods that are both commercial and residential.

1678
02:01:22,342 --> 02:01:24,323
And that's exactly what a single tax rate would do.

1679
02:01:24,343 --> 02:01:26,664
It would be the same for everybody.

1680
02:01:26,684 --> 02:01:28,225
It would be a level playing field.

1681
02:01:28,905 --> 02:01:32,227
Mr. President, we've debated this issue to its conclusion previously.

1682
02:01:32,287 --> 02:01:33,368
We voted against the measure.

1683
02:01:33,388 --> 02:01:34,768
We voted it down 7 to 0.

1684
02:01:35,409 --> 02:01:35,769
Thank you.

1685
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:40,131
It was concluded badly, with all due respect.

1686
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:41,952
Thank you very much, Doctor.

1687
02:01:42,588 --> 02:01:45,049
And Councilor Camuso wishes to be recognized.

1688
02:01:45,549 --> 02:01:46,549
Thank you, Mr. President.

1689
02:01:46,629 --> 02:01:47,889
And I agree.

1690
02:01:47,909 --> 02:01:50,970
I think this is a great, great resolution.

1691
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:53,071
And I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

1692
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:56,251
City of Medford, 1-1-2015 to 8-31-2015.

1693
02:01:56,331 --> 02:02:00,532
Meals tax, $349,605.74 in meals tax for people participating in eating in our establishments in this community.

1694
02:02:12,912 --> 02:02:27,281
If they get an abatement for a new business, in that case, a restaurant to come in, you give them something, an incentive to start up costs, basically, like other communities do, this goes hand in hand.

1695
02:02:28,042 --> 02:02:34,446
Like you said, urban renewal, development, it's what cities and towns are doing to get creative.

1696
02:02:35,947 --> 02:02:37,728
Look at Somerville, many, many, many years ago, 1980s.

1697
02:02:37,748 --> 02:02:37,768
1980s.

1698
02:02:41,957 --> 02:02:50,300
It was all these little establishments, and people got incentives to clean up and make it vibrant.

1699
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:56,721
Now you look at it, and it's a mecca of walking to all the different squares.

1700
02:02:56,801 --> 02:03:05,664
It's just, at the end of the day, Mr. President, if we give an incentive, just in this particular instance, say if it's a restaurant, you're going to make it up in the meals tax.

1701
02:03:08,033 --> 02:03:10,814
So I understand what John's trying to say.

1702
02:03:11,334 --> 02:03:13,735
But at the end of the day, this is what's going to bring quality business here.

1703
02:03:13,955 --> 02:03:15,095
It's going to put people to work.

1704
02:03:15,836 --> 02:03:18,056
It's going to continue to grow the tax base.

1705
02:03:18,357 --> 02:03:22,978
And it's going to get a storefront that is currently maybe vacant, something in there.

1706
02:03:23,218 --> 02:03:24,519
And that's the intent of it, correct?

1707
02:03:24,779 --> 02:03:25,739
Correct.

1708
02:03:25,759 --> 02:03:26,999
And I support this wholeheartedly.

1709
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:28,680
I think that this is a heaven vision.

1710
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,781
I'm thinking outside the box, to be quite frank.

1711
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:32,841
So I do support Councilor Knight on this.

1712
02:03:33,462 --> 02:03:34,582
Thank you very much, Councilor.

1713
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:35,590
Good evening, sir.

1714
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:37,191
Please state your name and address for the record.

1715
02:03:37,311 --> 02:03:38,372
Good evening, Council President.

1716
02:03:38,412 --> 02:03:39,593
My name is Joseph Villione.

1717
02:03:39,693 --> 02:03:42,075
I live at 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1718
02:03:43,435 --> 02:03:53,202
And about a year or two years ago, I took pictures up and down Salem Street, and I have logged the empty storefronts, not only on Salem Street, but all across Medford.

1719
02:03:54,402 --> 02:04:01,347
Respectfully, through the Chair, Councilor Camuso had this as a campaign promise four years ago, I believe, and inside Medford, it's still there.

1720
02:04:02,307 --> 02:04:06,630
Now he's leaving, and he gets the great idea that, wow, Councilor Knight is right.

1721
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:11,613
Well, when I'm 99 years old and I'm praying a lot, they're going to say, Joe, why are you praying so much?

1722
02:04:11,633 --> 02:04:13,053
I'm going to say I'm cramming for finals.

1723
02:04:13,454 --> 02:04:19,037
That, I respectfully say to the chair, is what the council is doing now at election time, cramming for finals.

1724
02:04:19,137 --> 02:04:21,559
And come January, we're not going to see any of it.

1725
02:04:21,579 --> 02:04:23,660
We're going to hear congratulations.

1726
02:04:24,784 --> 02:04:29,305
All point of information, but same old malarkey, unless we get some new faces on this council.

1727
02:04:29,325 --> 02:04:32,665
Mr. President, I failed to see what the commentary has to do with the substance of the resolution.

1728
02:04:33,125 --> 02:04:33,666
It isn't.

1729
02:04:34,126 --> 02:04:38,606
On the motion of council, a night for approval as amended.

1730
02:04:38,626 --> 02:04:40,707
May I?

1731
02:04:40,767 --> 02:04:41,767
Please state your name and address.

1732
02:04:41,907 --> 02:04:44,747
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1733
02:04:46,068 --> 02:04:54,169
It concerns me that this discussion here about giving the businesses a discount on their real estate

1734
02:04:55,511 --> 02:05:03,014
although I'm not anti-business, and this city should be more pro-business, in my opinion, within reason, of course.

1735
02:05:05,075 --> 02:05:17,140
If anything, I would consider what I've been pushing for for many years, and that would be to have the owner-occupying real estate tax exemption under the state law instead.

1736
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:22,022
That being said again,

1737
02:05:23,047 --> 02:05:27,031
and I will pursue it in the next few weeks further.

1738
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:34,879
That part of Haines Square seems to have problems for many, many years and decades.

1739
02:05:34,899 --> 02:05:37,662
A lot of turnover, fires, et cetera.

1740
02:05:39,604 --> 02:05:45,891
Just my limited education thought, why not just eminent domain that whole block?

1741
02:05:46,888 --> 02:05:54,931
and give them fair market value, and put up a mixed-use type of property, a la Station and Landon, so to speak.

1742
02:05:56,211 --> 02:06:05,375
To me, that would make good business sense and help us, the homeowner, real estate owner, occupy, hopefully.

1743
02:06:06,515 --> 02:06:07,356
Thank you for listening.

1744
02:06:07,896 --> 02:06:08,476
Thank you, Andrew.

1745
02:06:09,476 --> 02:06:13,798
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, as amended by Councilor Penta, yes?

1746
02:06:15,795 --> 02:06:17,076
Councilor, your light's not lit.

1747
02:06:18,717 --> 02:06:20,019
It might be a malfunction.

1748
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:23,221
Thank you, Mr. President.

1749
02:06:23,622 --> 02:06:25,403
The chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1750
02:06:25,983 --> 02:06:26,584
Councilor Marks.

1751
02:06:26,984 --> 02:06:28,085
Thank you, Mr. President.

1752
02:06:28,105 --> 02:06:32,829
You know, I think the suggestion is a worthy suggestion.

1753
02:06:33,310 --> 02:06:44,499
I mean, you only need to look in the community and see a long established business, Hoff's Bakery, that actually moved hundreds of jobs that were in the Wellington area for many, many years.

1754
02:06:45,235 --> 02:06:52,519
a Method business owner that got a better tax incentive over in Malden and decided to move his whole business to Malden.

1755
02:06:53,079 --> 02:07:00,922
So, you know, it's great that we're sitting back talking about issues like this, but really one needs to just look at the Office of Community Development.

1756
02:07:01,863 --> 02:07:07,105
We have one director and one part-time person in the Office of Community Development.

1757
02:07:08,346 --> 02:07:12,888
I mean, I think that speaks volumes to the reason why we're not offering these type of incentives.

1758
02:07:13,204 --> 02:07:15,505
We're not attracting new business into this community.

1759
02:07:15,825 --> 02:07:17,605
It's quite clear why, Mr. President.

1760
02:07:18,025 --> 02:07:26,448
All you need to look at is a sister city next to us, the city of Somerville, that has over 13 people in their Office of Community Development.

1761
02:07:27,368 --> 02:07:42,292
I had an opportunity to talk to the owner of Mystic Roasters, and she said that businesses and communities from surrounding communities have approached her on many occasions saying, we'd love to have the Mystic Roasters in our community.

1762
02:07:42,924 --> 02:07:44,745
What can we do to get you into our community?

1763
02:07:45,966 --> 02:07:47,667
Do you think that's happening in the city of Meffitt?

1764
02:07:48,187 --> 02:07:51,669
Do you think we're going out to surrounding communities saying, we'd love to see you?

1765
02:07:52,149 --> 02:07:52,990
And maybe they are.

1766
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:57,533
Maybe the mayor went in and we could thank him for the pawn shop that we have at Meffitt Square.

1767
02:07:58,193 --> 02:08:03,876
So maybe the mayor is doing that type of footwork, or the illegal massage parlor that we have.

1768
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:09,119
Maybe the mayor is attracting business in his own way.

1769
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:12,021
So I'm not quite sure, Mr. President.

1770
02:08:12,368 --> 02:08:17,129
But it's clear to me that this city's broken, and it's been broken for many, many, many years.

1771
02:08:17,789 --> 02:08:27,752
And if you want to look at the reason why, it's clear to me this administration hasn't been operating on all its pistons for a number of years.

1772
02:08:27,832 --> 02:08:32,913
And I'm hoping to see change come to fruition shortly, Mr. President.

1773
02:08:32,953 --> 02:08:38,134
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval as amended, Councilor Camuso.

1774
02:08:38,174 --> 02:08:40,995
And I'm glad Councilor Marks brought up Huff's Bakery.

1775
02:08:41,609 --> 02:08:48,031
Because interesting enough, Hoffs Bakery was before this Medford City Council for the TIF, which was a tax incentive.

1776
02:08:49,692 --> 02:09:02,056
And it was not unanimous vote of this city council to give them, some people had the vision to see that they were gonna put, like Councilor Mock said, X amount of people to work, gonna clean up a development behind 9th Street.

1777
02:09:02,656 --> 02:09:05,317
That was a program that became before the city council, and

1778
02:09:06,465 --> 02:09:12,367
It's just another fact that this city council, and we're all entitled to our votes, there's no question.

1779
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:16,769
But check the record on it, it was not a unanimous vote of this city council.

1780
02:09:17,049 --> 02:09:25,152
And now, unfortunately, because Malden is offering them a tax incentive similar to what Councilor Knight is looking to do here, they are moving.

1781
02:09:25,913 --> 02:09:30,234
But the TIF on the Hoffs Bakery was before this city council a few years back.

1782
02:09:30,774 --> 02:09:32,275
But thank you for bringing that up, Councilor Moxley.

1783
02:09:32,747 --> 02:09:33,007
Thank you.

1784
02:09:33,027 --> 02:09:35,549
And on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight as amended.

1785
02:09:35,589 --> 02:09:36,409
All those in favor?

1786
02:09:36,429 --> 02:09:36,850
Aye.

1787
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:37,730
All those opposed?

1788
02:09:38,471 --> 02:09:43,054
Motion carries.

1789
02:09:43,074 --> 02:09:56,182
15-676 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved the Office of Energy and Environment in conjunction with the School Department and Board of Health examine the feasibility of installing solar energy panels on MHS Medford High School.

1790
02:09:56,782 --> 02:09:57,383
Councilor Knight.

1791
02:09:57,863 --> 02:09:59,264
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1792
02:09:59,764 --> 02:10:00,865
Several weeks ago I was up

1793
02:10:01,802 --> 02:10:22,118
the field of dreams and I was sitting there with coach Perry watching the girls soccer team play Malden and it was about oh 150 degrees up there and as we were sitting on the field of dreams we could look out right across the top of Medford High School and what I saw was a gigantic flat roof and a lot of sun beating down on it and I thought that this might be a great opportunity for us to

1794
02:10:23,043 --> 02:10:26,866
solar or, I mean, harvest some of our solar energy, Mr. President.

1795
02:10:26,986 --> 02:10:43,136
We have our Harvest the Energy Festival coming up in just a few short weeks, and I thought it was fitting to put this resolution forward because I feel as though, you know, provided that it meets the health and safety standards, it might be a way for us to generate some revenue that's reoccurring and non-tax-based.

1796
02:10:43,296 --> 02:10:48,540
So, I might ask that my council colleagues support this endeavor, and I would hope that they would join me in voting in the affirmative.

1797
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:51,782
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1798
02:10:53,808 --> 02:10:54,428
Councilor Marks.

1799
02:10:55,289 --> 02:10:56,929
I think it's a worthy resolution.

1800
02:10:57,310 --> 02:11:02,952
For many years there, I don't know if they still exist or not, there were solar panels on the high school roof for many, many years.

1801
02:11:03,533 --> 02:11:15,118
And as we all know, that high school roof has been notorious for leaks since it was built and still plagues the Meffitt High School with leaks throughout the department.

1802
02:11:15,158 --> 02:11:23,362
But I don't see a problem looking into the feasibility, but I think we have to be mindful of the fact that that roof has been a concern for many, many years.

1803
02:11:23,995 --> 02:11:27,298
It's a flat roof and has had many, many issues.

1804
02:11:27,778 --> 02:11:37,307
And also, if we can ask about what the success was of the solar panels that were on that roof and if they are still there, because this was going back some years ago.

1805
02:11:38,508 --> 02:11:40,089
But I think it's a worthy resolution.

1806
02:11:41,070 --> 02:11:45,734
Point of clarification, Mr. President, would the council like to amend it for hydropower as well?

1807
02:11:50,533 --> 02:11:51,733
And move for approval, Mr. President.

1808
02:11:51,853 --> 02:11:53,253
On a motion of approval, as amended.

1809
02:11:53,274 --> 02:11:54,014
All those in favor?

1810
02:11:54,714 --> 02:11:55,334
All those opposed?

1811
02:11:55,854 --> 02:11:56,474
Motion carries.

1812
02:11:56,514 --> 02:12:00,415
On the motion of Council night for suspension of the rules, to take a common vigilance license.

1813
02:12:00,455 --> 02:12:01,215
All those in favor?

1814
02:12:01,235 --> 02:12:02,055
All those opposed?

1815
02:12:02,315 --> 02:12:04,836
Motion carries, 15-682.

1816
02:12:05,216 --> 02:12:15,597
Petition for common vigilance license by Richard M. Blau, Esquire, for TFS Newco, LLC, doing business as Tedeschi Food Shop, number 37372133 Main Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1817
02:12:20,974 --> 02:12:34,358
02155 on file, business certificate 190, building department, fire department, police traffic impact, health department, treasurer, letter of compliance, state tax ID, workman's compensation application.

1818
02:12:34,718 --> 02:12:36,639
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1819
02:12:36,659 --> 02:12:38,139
Thank you, Mr. President.

1820
02:12:38,779 --> 02:12:41,120
I have reviewed the papers and I found them to be in order.

1821
02:12:43,401 --> 02:12:45,801
Could you explain to the people what your business hours are going to be?

1822
02:12:46,142 --> 02:12:47,682
Please state your name and address for the record.

1823
02:12:49,735 --> 02:12:51,677
The business hours are the same as they are now.

1824
02:12:51,737 --> 02:12:52,417
They're 24 hours.

1825
02:12:52,437 --> 02:12:52,898
24 hours.

1826
02:12:52,958 --> 02:12:54,639
And do you want to continue that way?

1827
02:12:55,139 --> 02:12:55,640
Yes, sir.

1828
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:55,940
Thank you.

1829
02:12:57,021 --> 02:12:58,602
Do they have to reapply for them?

1830
02:12:58,922 --> 02:13:00,383
Mr. President, I find the papers.

1831
02:13:00,403 --> 02:13:02,885
I find the papers in order.

1832
02:13:02,905 --> 02:13:04,506
Motion approved by Councilor Caviello.

1833
02:13:04,526 --> 02:13:05,207
All those in favor?

1834
02:13:06,067 --> 02:13:06,708
Councilor Knight.

1835
02:13:07,388 --> 02:13:15,434
In reviewing the packet, I did see and hear some sort of release or power of attorney notice that discussed

1836
02:13:16,985 --> 02:13:30,692
TFS NUCCO LLC's power of attorney for licensure and permit purposes, and it speaks to having Gray and Robinson PA to serve as a nationwide regulatory council for alcoholic beverage licensure and permitting purposes.

1837
02:13:31,133 --> 02:13:32,313
The two are separate and distinct.

1838
02:13:32,333 --> 02:13:34,995
You're not before us this evening seeking an alcoholic beverage license.

1839
02:13:35,075 --> 02:13:35,935
Is that correct?

1840
02:13:36,315 --> 02:13:36,495
No.

1841
02:13:36,736 --> 02:13:37,276
Okay, great.

1842
02:13:37,396 --> 02:13:39,537
Mr. President, if I rest my case, I move for approval.

1843
02:13:40,077 --> 02:13:41,678
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1844
02:13:42,679 --> 02:13:43,159
Carried.

1845
02:13:43,799 --> 02:13:46,681
On the motion of counsel and I, to revert back to the order of

1846
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:56,571
Regular order of business, all those in favor, all those opposed, motion carries.

1847
02:13:56,591 --> 02:13:56,571
15.

1848
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:58,091
677, offered by Councilor Carviello.

1849
02:13:58,551 --> 02:14:08,374
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Robert Emmett Skerry on his retirement from the State Auditor's Office after 33 years of service.

1850
02:14:08,474 --> 02:14:09,394
Councilor Carviello.

1851
02:14:09,634 --> 02:14:10,714
Thank you, Mr. President.

1852
02:14:10,814 --> 02:14:12,554
I want to congratulate my friend, Mr. Skerry.

1853
02:14:12,574 --> 02:14:14,015
He's a member of the school committee.

1854
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:23,284
He's finally decided to retire after 33 years being one of the state's top fraud investigators for the auditor's office.

1855
02:14:23,684 --> 02:14:29,107
And I want to congratulate him on his retirement, and now he'll work harder for the school committee.

1856
02:14:30,428 --> 02:14:31,189
A great American.

1857
02:14:31,829 --> 02:14:33,370
On the motion of councillor Caviello.

1858
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:35,391
Yes, councillor Marx.

1859
02:14:38,533 --> 02:14:39,373
Thank you, Mr. President.

1860
02:14:40,394 --> 02:14:44,896
I, too, want to thank my colleague councillor Caviello for putting this on, and I want to wish Mr.

1861
02:14:46,719 --> 02:15:00,322
I wish him well on his retirement, and I'm sure his many, many years on the school committee will also keep him busy and keep him active in his retired years as a state official.

1862
02:15:00,382 --> 02:15:01,643
So I wish him well, Mr. President.

1863
02:15:03,363 --> 02:15:06,584
I just want to wish Robert Emmons Carey Jr.

1864
02:15:06,624 --> 02:15:12,025
Good luck in his retirement and give him more time to be around the schools and helping out our children.

1865
02:15:16,012 --> 02:15:17,573
It was opposed, motion carries.

1866
02:15:17,593 --> 02:15:20,474
15678 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1867
02:15:20,974 --> 02:15:29,957
Be it resolved, the Medford City Council requests that the mayor name the circle at La Conte Rink after Tony Bova.

1868
02:15:30,718 --> 02:15:41,302
Tony has dedicated almost 40 years of volunteer service to the youth hockey community of Medford and still continues working with the children to this day.

1869
02:15:41,542 --> 02:15:43,442
Councilor Caraviello.

1870
02:15:43,663 --> 02:15:44,503
Thank you, Mr. President.

1871
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:49,402
Often we kind of wait until it's too late until we make a dedication to somebody.

1872
02:15:49,442 --> 02:15:58,147
But this is a man who's been dedicating himself to the youth hockey community of the city for 40 plus years.

1873
02:15:58,167 --> 02:15:59,087
He's still doing it.

1874
02:16:00,788 --> 02:16:04,130
He's the first person you meet when you come into Memphis hockey.

1875
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:06,631
He's kept the program up and down over the years.

1876
02:16:07,392 --> 02:16:08,953
He's the last guy you see going out.

1877
02:16:09,353 --> 02:16:12,314
You see him out there tirelessly working for this program.

1878
02:16:14,287 --> 02:16:19,611
I think if I had my way, I'd name the building after him, but unfortunately, it's after Captain Leconte.

1879
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:20,692
We can't do that.

1880
02:16:20,712 --> 02:16:31,879
And I would like to see the mayor do this maybe before he leaves office, and before the winter, so that everyone will have a chance to see it.

1881
02:16:31,939 --> 02:16:36,202
I mean, we've had multiple people go to the National Hockey League, college players.

1882
02:16:36,683 --> 02:16:42,907
They've all started with Tony Bova at four years old, and he's the guy that everybody remembers when you first walk in the door.

1883
02:16:43,207 --> 02:16:43,908
Again, he's a good man.

1884
02:16:44,644 --> 02:16:49,028
And I think we have a couple of people here that want to speak in his favor in getting this done also.

1885
02:16:49,468 --> 02:16:49,908
Very good.

1886
02:16:50,509 --> 02:16:52,931
Come on up and please state your name and address for the record.

1887
02:16:53,471 --> 02:16:54,332
Thank you, Mr. President.

1888
02:16:54,352 --> 02:16:56,934
I'm Patrick McCabe, 38 Ashcroft Road, Medford.

1889
02:16:57,494 --> 02:16:59,556
I'm also the president of Medford Rec Hockey.

1890
02:17:01,408 --> 02:17:03,050
Tony's been with the program.

1891
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:03,750
It's very fitting.

1892
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:07,294
This is our 40th anniversary this year for Medford Rec Hockey.

1893
02:17:07,895 --> 02:17:14,021
And at our board meeting the other night, Tony was talking about how he coached Councilor Penta's travel hockey team.

1894
02:17:14,681 --> 02:17:18,465
So it's been there quite some time.

1895
02:17:19,967 --> 02:17:22,970
Tony, the thing that I appreciate most about Tony is that

1896
02:17:24,062 --> 02:17:29,223
Despite the fact that he's been there for 40 years, he's still very, very patient, and he's still open to change.

1897
02:17:29,844 --> 02:17:33,645
Within the last three years, Medford Hockey, we've grown from eight travel teams to 13.

1898
02:17:34,165 --> 02:17:42,047
And that's all through a lot of new ideas that Tony, we brought forward to Tony, his new parents in the program.

1899
02:17:42,747 --> 02:17:49,989
And Tony explained to us the pitfalls, and he was quick to change when he thought change was necessary.

1900
02:17:50,049 --> 02:17:51,850
So he's a very, very impressive man.

1901
02:17:54,117 --> 02:18:05,320
The other thing that's very impressive about Tony is that for 40 years he's been explaining the same thing to dozens of parents with the patience of a saint.

1902
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:10,801
Hockey and youth sports, I know some folks here are very involved in youth sports, it's very challenging.

1903
02:18:12,621 --> 02:18:15,182
Tony's been a pillar of the community in doing that.

1904
02:18:16,125 --> 02:18:22,827
We'd appreciate it, speaking for the Board of Medford Rec Hockey, and we'd appreciate positive action on this motion.

1905
02:18:22,967 --> 02:18:23,287
Thank you.

1906
02:18:23,587 --> 02:18:23,848
Awesome.

1907
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:24,448
Thank you.

1908
02:18:27,289 --> 02:18:27,689
Deputy?

1909
02:18:30,530 --> 02:18:31,550
Bob Jones, 5 St.

1910
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:32,911
Mary's Street, Medford Mass.

1911
02:18:32,931 --> 02:18:34,771
I'm also the treasurer of Medford Rec Hockey.

1912
02:18:35,551 --> 02:18:36,912
I rise in support of this motion.

1913
02:18:37,852 --> 02:18:42,033
As Pat just mentioned, Tony is a staple of the rink.

1914
02:18:42,334 --> 02:18:43,474
He's always there when you need him.

1915
02:18:44,512 --> 02:18:48,233
He serves us with some great institutional memory, institutional knowledge.

1916
02:18:48,253 --> 02:19:00,495
He remembers how everybody did it and did it well, didn't do it so well, and why and when it happened and what we need to do to push things into the future.

1917
02:19:01,295 --> 02:19:03,595
It's very fitting and well-deserved.

1918
02:19:03,615 --> 02:19:04,515
Thank you.

1919
02:19:04,855 --> 02:19:05,115
Thank you.

1920
02:19:05,176 --> 02:19:13,917
Mr. President, I was there when Tony Bova, when I was president, we started the girls' figure skating program, which only Woburn had at that time.

1921
02:19:14,462 --> 02:19:15,623
And now they have girls hockey.

1922
02:19:15,683 --> 02:19:21,869
I mean, the program has been a staple of the state as one of the better programs around.

1923
02:19:22,990 --> 02:19:24,452
Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1924
02:19:31,493 --> 02:19:46,285
I like the idea of having that, and maybe we should call him Mr. Sports, because he's always a great, patient guy, and I've known him for longer than him.

1925
02:19:46,625 --> 02:19:53,050
And basically, we all want to be in the same country.

1926
02:20:04,781 --> 02:20:06,082
Watch out, your mic's not working.

1927
02:20:06,503 --> 02:20:08,165
I don't know.

1928
02:20:08,365 --> 02:20:09,126
Press your button again.

1929
02:20:09,146 --> 02:20:09,767
Plug your thing.

1930
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:30,540
There we are.

1931
02:20:31,281 --> 02:20:32,381
The messenger saved us.

1932
02:20:33,121 --> 02:20:34,022
Let's try this again.

1933
02:20:34,502 --> 02:20:34,822
Okay.

1934
02:20:35,402 --> 02:20:38,043
What I'd like to say that Tony Bova deserves the award.

1935
02:20:38,303 --> 02:20:44,545
Uh, we also know besides him being involved in hockey, he was actively involved, um, in men's softball.

1936
02:20:44,886 --> 02:20:51,708
He was actively involved in keeping people, um, competitive in sports, no matter what the age group was or is.

1937
02:20:52,328 --> 02:20:54,309
And, um, and that's a true staple to him.

1938
02:20:55,143 --> 02:21:00,306
But having you folks come up here and through Councilor Caviello wanting to give him this award, I think it's great.

1939
02:21:00,786 --> 02:21:07,949
I like to call him Mr. Sports because he is actively involved in so many things within this community that involves parents as well as kids.

1940
02:21:08,629 --> 02:21:09,350
It's deserving.

1941
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:15,613
He's a very humble guy and I hope he's, I know he's going to be appreciative of this when he comes up here.

1942
02:21:16,733 --> 02:21:20,655
The one thing that Councilor Caviello indicated that you would hope he would get the award

1943
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:23,474
before this mayor leaves office.

1944
02:21:23,895 --> 02:21:25,756
There's a host of other issues.

1945
02:21:26,096 --> 02:21:28,778
There's other people, Councilor Caviello.

1946
02:21:29,238 --> 02:21:29,899
There are other.

1947
02:21:32,480 --> 02:21:34,762
I understand that, but you said you hoped he would come up here.

1948
02:21:35,182 --> 02:21:40,306
There are other resolutions that have been passed for people to get awards that are in queue, so to speak.

1949
02:21:40,766 --> 02:21:45,689
So I would hope maybe this is the genesis to push all the other folks who are waiting.

1950
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:51,113
And so with that being said, I thank you for being here and being supportive of it.

1951
02:21:51,463 --> 02:21:51,803
Thank you.

1952
02:21:52,484 --> 02:21:53,304
Thank you, Councillor.

1953
02:21:53,484 --> 02:21:54,365
Councillor Camuso.

1954
02:21:55,125 --> 02:21:56,126
Thank you, Mr. President.

1955
02:21:57,147 --> 02:21:59,528
Tony Bova, just don't even know where to start.

1956
02:21:59,548 --> 02:22:04,812
I echo the sentiments of Councillor Penter and Councillor Caravaglio.

1957
02:22:05,252 --> 02:22:05,992
Just a great guy.

1958
02:22:06,973 --> 02:22:11,016
And it's kind of ironic, too, because we saw him at the community day a few weeks ago.

1959
02:22:11,056 --> 02:22:12,937
He had the table for Medford Youth.

1960
02:22:13,557 --> 02:22:19,301
And when I was shooting the breeze with him, I says, hey, you look the exact same as you did as when I was a mite.

1961
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,061
He hasn't changed a wink.

1962
02:22:21,081 --> 02:22:23,905
He's one of those guys that just looks the exact same.

1963
02:22:25,146 --> 02:22:26,428
Lost a little hair, right, counselor?

1964
02:22:26,768 --> 02:22:28,650
But Tony's just a great guy.

1965
02:22:28,750 --> 02:22:31,193
You know, I played for him when I was a mite.

1966
02:22:31,313 --> 02:22:33,356
And I went right through, played at Medford High School.

1967
02:22:33,796 --> 02:22:37,761
And he was always a big part of the high school team and high school athletics.

1968
02:22:37,801 --> 02:22:40,324
And it didn't stop with hockey, as the counselor noted.

1969
02:22:40,866 --> 02:22:41,927
started the figure skating.

1970
02:22:41,947 --> 02:22:50,453
It was under his leadership that girls hockey was started at the youth level, and then Councilor Lungo took over and got it initiated at the high school level.

1971
02:22:51,574 --> 02:22:53,776
But just a great guy, and I do support this.

1972
02:22:54,276 --> 02:23:07,627
And also to piggyback on what Councilor Penta said, there are other people that this council has looked to honor over some time, and maybe now the mayor can take some of those under advisement, and if he sees

1973
02:23:09,314 --> 02:23:16,798
true that they're deserving, as this council has, to move forward with some of them.

1974
02:23:16,878 --> 02:23:18,239
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1975
02:23:18,859 --> 02:23:25,403
I, too, have had the pleasure of knowing Tony Bova, but my relationship with him is a little different.

1976
02:23:25,423 --> 02:23:27,364
We work together because I can't skate.

1977
02:23:27,384 --> 02:23:31,386
I'm one of the only guys in Medford, I think, that can't ice skate.

1978
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:35,311
Mr. Bova and I worked together down the hockey rink.

1979
02:23:35,831 --> 02:23:38,792
I was operating the Zamboni and working as a custodian down there.

1980
02:23:38,832 --> 02:23:41,273
And Mr. Bova was doing what he does with youth hockey.

1981
02:23:41,874 --> 02:23:51,357
And through that relationship, I've always admired the fact that Mr. Bova is a very soft-spoken man whose actions speak louder than his words.

1982
02:23:51,397 --> 02:23:57,780
He's the first one to step up to the plate, volunteer to take the charge, and be there to help.

1983
02:23:58,467 --> 02:24:04,970
And when he's there to help, he's sometimes more than willing to help with the youngest of children, which is sometimes the most difficult to deal with, Mr. President.

1984
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:08,292
And we've all been down there on picture night, right, Pat?

1985
02:24:09,052 --> 02:24:14,734
And picture night gets a little crazy, and Tony handles it with the patience of a saint, as has been said before.

1986
02:24:14,794 --> 02:24:21,778
So with that being said, Tony, congratulations for your 40 years of service, and thank you very much for being a part of Medford Youth Hockey and Medford Youth Sports.

1987
02:24:23,438 --> 02:24:24,379
Really appreciate your service.

1988
02:24:27,813 --> 02:24:28,734
Thank you, Mr. President.

1989
02:24:28,954 --> 02:24:32,496
And it's been said before, but what a true gentleman.

1990
02:24:33,537 --> 02:24:37,319
He was always very consistent, still is very consistent.

1991
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:45,665
And to think, someone that dedicated 40 years of their life, never, ever, ever looked for praise, never looked for any type of recognition.

1992
02:24:46,445 --> 02:24:48,947
He used to have his own sports show on local access.

1993
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:52,671
And think about the thousands of children he touched their lives.

1994
02:24:53,291 --> 02:24:54,571
Thousands of Meffitt children.

1995
02:24:54,892 --> 02:25:00,993
And he kept Meffitt-Reck alive when years that really there was no one else to do so.

1996
02:25:01,653 --> 02:25:04,654
And he's been a staple for that in our community for many years.

1997
02:25:05,274 --> 02:25:06,795
And I just want to wish him well.

1998
02:25:06,815 --> 02:25:07,855
This is a great tribute.

1999
02:25:08,295 --> 02:25:13,977
I thank Councilor Caviello and the other gentleman that came up to present this.

2000
02:25:14,697 --> 02:25:17,418
And I think it speaks volumes on his character.

2001
02:25:19,095 --> 02:25:25,578
really the need to recognize people that go over and above in the community, Mr. President, and not look for any recognition.

2002
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:30,420
Thank you, Mr. President.

2003
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:36,923
You know, it was some years ago when, you know, Councilor Camuso and Councilor Knight were young kids.

2004
02:25:38,463 --> 02:25:40,264
That building was going to close by the state.

2005
02:25:41,085 --> 02:25:46,007
And we had begged the mayor at that time to come in and take the building over, and the mayor didn't want to do it.

2006
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,101
The state was going to shut down.

2007
02:25:48,121 --> 02:26:02,975
It was Tony Bova, myself, and some other parents that went up to the statehouse with kids and got them, then Charlie Shannon, Senator Shannon, to find the funding to keep the building on and do the roof over when they were going to shut the place down because the roof was going to fall down.

2008
02:26:03,575 --> 02:26:09,721
So again, without Tony, there probably wouldn't even be a rink there today.

2009
02:26:11,237 --> 02:26:12,498
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2010
02:26:12,698 --> 02:26:14,819
It's on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

2011
02:26:14,859 --> 02:26:15,699
All those in favor?

2012
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:17,120
All those opposed?

2013
02:26:17,720 --> 02:26:18,960
Congratulations, Tony.

2014
02:26:19,401 --> 02:26:27,684
Thank you guys for coming down and supporting.

2015
02:26:27,704 --> 02:26:30,165
15672, offered by Vice President Lungo Kern.

2016
02:26:30,566 --> 02:26:32,306
And I'm going to read this in its entirety.

2017
02:26:32,486 --> 02:26:35,288

2018

All those opposed?

2049
02:30:25,546 --> 02:30:26,646
The motion kept.

2050
02:30:27,426 --> 02:30:28,647
Did you have something on the motion?

2051
02:30:29,187 --> 02:30:30,507
It was just approved, Councilor.

2052
02:30:33,404 --> 02:30:34,024
Go ahead, sir.

2053
02:30:34,224 --> 02:30:35,405
The citizen wants to speak first.

2054
02:30:36,346 --> 02:30:37,206
Did you want to speak on this, sir?

2055
02:30:39,548 --> 02:30:39,908
Thank you.

2056
02:30:39,968 --> 02:30:41,589
Please state your name and address for the record.

2057
02:30:41,769 --> 02:30:44,251
It's Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford.

2058
02:30:45,491 --> 02:30:52,335
I'd like to, through the chair, ask City Clerk Finn two questions regarding the election.

2059
02:30:53,216 --> 02:30:56,558
And before I do that, I would just like to ask him,

2060
02:30:57,005 --> 02:31:06,669
Through the chair, have any of the councilors seen the new lighting on the parkway from the bridge where Luminaire is to the police, state police headquarters?

2061
02:31:06,689 --> 02:31:08,710
They put in the LED lamps up there.

2062
02:31:09,490 --> 02:31:10,911
It's a magnificent lighting.

2063
02:31:11,231 --> 02:31:12,151
Is this on this matter?

2064
02:31:12,572 --> 02:31:14,012
No, I just wanted to ask that question.

2065
02:31:14,452 --> 02:31:17,174
So let me ask this question, Mr. Finn, through the chair.

2066
02:31:20,055 --> 02:31:20,615
Can I do this?

2067
02:31:20,635 --> 02:31:20,755
Please.

2068
02:31:25,824 --> 02:31:38,791
Back in the 2010 election, Mr. Finn, you offered to the candidates the opportunity to come in and look at the voting machines that we're going to be using in the election for voting.

2069
02:31:38,831 --> 02:31:51,278
Last year, I don't believe that happened, and I wanted to know if it's going to be an issue this year that you may put that demonstration on explaining how the voting machines work and so on and so forth.

2070
02:31:51,858 --> 02:31:52,959
So that's one question.

2071
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:14,794
What I wanted to know is at the end of the election, at the end of the day, when the polls close, what is the procedure for people to get the vote, the count of the vote in each precinct when the polls close before the ballots come up to city hall?

2072
02:32:15,794 --> 02:32:18,657
And the last question, if you could be so kind to answer is,

2073
02:32:20,837 --> 02:32:26,719
What is the procedure, and how do you count for all the absentee ballot votes?

2074
02:32:27,499 --> 02:32:33,901
And how do they come in when they come in from nursing homes, acute care facilities, and assisted care housing?

2075
02:32:34,641 --> 02:32:35,681
That's all I have to ask.

2076
02:32:36,081 --> 02:32:37,142
So I'll just sit down.

2077
02:32:38,082 --> 02:32:46,144
So if I get this right, the first one is the notification on the testing of the machines.

2078
02:32:50,823 --> 02:33:02,713
What we're obligated to do is we send out a schedule to the parties that this is going to be taking place.

2079
02:33:03,654 --> 02:33:10,940
The parties, if they have candidates, the state committee person or the local committee, they notify their individual.

2080
02:33:12,641 --> 02:33:16,665
Yeah, that's my obligation to be how it happens.

2081
02:33:16,705 --> 02:33:19,487
He's talking about the 2010, and that's exactly how.

2082
02:33:20,606 --> 02:33:22,187
that happened because it was a party thing.

2083
02:33:22,967 --> 02:33:26,268
But that still holds true in the local election.

2084
02:33:26,328 --> 02:33:27,908
But they are, we do have a schedule.

2085
02:33:28,969 --> 02:33:36,851
Anybody's, it'll be the last week in October, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 11 to 1.

2086
02:33:37,031 --> 02:33:41,592
And we'll take a certain amount of machines per day.

2087
02:33:44,463 --> 02:33:45,464
point of information?

2088
02:33:46,344 --> 02:33:48,966
I know this year the big race is the mayor's race.

2089
02:33:49,586 --> 02:34:00,232
So chairman Donato will be notified to come down on behalf of the democratic candidate, which is, well, I don't want to get into politics, but there's a democrat and a republican running.

2090
02:34:00,532 --> 02:34:06,636
So the republican individual who's here this evening, Mr. Capucci, will come down on behalf of the republican candidate for mayor?

2091
02:34:07,236 --> 02:34:07,836
Is that how this works?

2092
02:34:07,856 --> 02:34:10,258
They can notify those people to come down.

2093
02:34:11,659 --> 02:34:12,139
Yes, yes, yes.

2094
02:34:12,259 --> 02:34:13,320
And then what about...

2095
02:34:14,577 --> 02:34:15,937
I know what you're saying.

2096
02:34:15,977 --> 02:34:20,179
I'm fulfilling the obligation of the testing procedure.

2097
02:34:20,959 --> 02:34:21,819
So I'm doing that.

2098
02:34:22,839 --> 02:34:36,843
So it is open, but the local chair of the parties, and we do notify not only Democrat, Republican, I think the United Independence Party and things like that, they all get a letter.

2099
02:34:36,863 --> 02:34:38,064
They all get a letter.

2100
02:34:38,764 --> 02:34:42,705
And it's up to them if they want to come down on your behalf or

2101
02:34:43,694 --> 02:34:45,055
to notify you if you want to come down.

2102
02:34:45,696 --> 02:34:45,876
No.

2103
02:34:47,337 --> 02:34:49,398
Point of information, Counsel Penta.

2104
02:34:50,138 --> 02:34:51,759
This is a nonpartisan election.

2105
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:56,983
Where in the law does it say that in a municipal nonpartisan election?

2106
02:34:58,184 --> 02:35:00,865
Are all 16 of these machines going to be tested, Eddie?

2107
02:35:01,946 --> 02:35:05,788
I'm obligated by the state to test the machines.

2108
02:35:05,989 --> 02:35:06,149
All 16?

2109
02:35:07,009 --> 02:35:08,450
All 16 machines, OK?

2110
02:35:09,531 --> 02:35:12,773
And I'm obligated to notify the local

2111
02:35:13,971 --> 02:35:15,332
parties, which I do.

2112
02:35:15,892 --> 02:35:19,254
Mr. Green, he's the local chairman.

2113
02:35:21,115 --> 02:35:22,435
Donato, whoever.

2114
02:35:22,735 --> 02:35:28,959
That obligation hasn't changed in 18, 20, whatever it is, 30 years we've been doing it.

2115
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:33,541
I've had people come down on their own.

2116
02:35:34,801 --> 02:35:41,085
It is posted on the bulletin board, the letter that I sent out to the different parties.

2117
02:35:41,725 --> 02:35:43,766
So if you want to come down, you can follow procedure.

2118
02:35:44,326 --> 02:35:46,008
Well, can you notify the candidates as well?

2119
02:35:47,209 --> 02:35:49,871
I'm publicly asking you, can you notify the candidates as well?

2120
02:35:51,173 --> 02:35:51,533
Will you?

2121
02:35:52,113 --> 02:35:53,194
Will I notify them?

2122
02:35:53,315 --> 02:35:53,815
Yeah.

2123
02:35:53,875 --> 02:35:58,880
Well, hopefully, if you're affiliated with a big party, that they're doing it for you.

2124
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:04,585
But certainly, if you want, we can send it out there.

2125
02:36:05,673 --> 02:36:07,074
Point of information, councillor night.

2126
02:36:07,534 --> 02:36:14,657
When the city clerk sends out this notice to the parties, the political parties, acknowledging that the machines have been tested, he does so in writing.

2127
02:36:15,297 --> 02:36:17,258
There's a certain correspondence of something that goes out?

2128
02:36:17,959 --> 02:36:18,059
Yeah.

2129
02:36:18,079 --> 02:36:18,799
Is it done in writing?

2130
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:22,120
Can we have that included in our packet when it goes out, Mr. President?

2131
02:36:23,441 --> 02:36:23,801
Thank you.

2132
02:36:24,341 --> 02:36:25,822
The next part of the questions was?

2133
02:36:27,103 --> 02:36:28,223
It should be all candidates.

2134
02:36:29,064 --> 02:36:29,264
Yeah.

2135
02:36:29,584 --> 02:36:31,965
It should be all 16, all 15, whatever it is.

2136
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:38,293
Fulfilling the requirements of the testing.

2137
02:36:43,497 --> 02:36:45,138
The conveyance of election results.

2138
02:36:45,619 --> 02:36:45,899
OK.

2139
02:36:49,982 --> 02:36:57,889
They should be posted right outside the results on every precinct.

2140
02:37:02,078 --> 02:37:11,241
My hope is, myself as an individual, can I go in there when the polls close and get a count on the candidates who received X amount of votes in that precinct?

2141
02:37:11,921 --> 02:37:13,102
Yeah, you should.

2142
02:37:13,222 --> 02:37:14,162
Yeah.

2143
02:37:14,202 --> 02:37:15,022
As soon as they count them.

2144
02:37:15,442 --> 02:37:17,683
So we can enter the poll.

2145
02:37:17,703 --> 02:37:29,827
What they're going to do is run the electronic version, and they post two tapes on the wall, and many people come in and write it down and judge what they wanted down here.

2146
02:37:31,610 --> 02:37:36,094
And the third part was the capacity balance for institutions.

2147
02:37:36,434 --> 02:37:45,341
Those are all logged and transported to each individual ward and precinct to be tallied there.

2148
02:37:46,482 --> 02:37:53,628
So is there a method for the people to, let's say there's 147 people in a particular place.

2149
02:37:54,909 --> 02:37:59,093
Do they mail them in or do we send a representative from City Hall to collect them?

2150
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:00,760
Do you know what I'm saying?

2151
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:04,202
Because of the situations that exist up in these places.

2152
02:38:04,682 --> 02:38:15,407
They're mostly mailed in, or they do come at the clerk's office at certain hours to do in-person absentee ballots.

2153
02:38:15,587 --> 02:38:16,307
I wanted to make sure that.

2154
02:38:16,327 --> 02:38:18,128
But they're not tallied at that time.

2155
02:38:18,148 --> 02:38:19,289
No, I understand.

2156
02:38:19,309 --> 02:38:22,250
Then they get tallied at the polling location.

2157
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:22,870
All right, great.

2158
02:38:23,031 --> 02:38:23,671
Thank you very much.

2159
02:38:29,427 --> 02:38:36,531
When you say they're notâ€”when are those ballots actually opened and tallied, the absentee ballots?

2160
02:38:38,272 --> 02:38:39,152
During the course of the day.

2161
02:38:40,453 --> 02:38:42,374
So you don't wait until the end of the day and open them up?

2162
02:38:44,855 --> 02:38:44,975
No.

2163
02:38:44,995 --> 02:38:52,219
So if you have 10 or 15 ballots come in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, somebody opens them up and puts them in the machine, how are you going to know which ones are absentee?

2164
02:38:53,059 --> 02:38:53,359
Pardon me?

2165
02:38:53,679 --> 02:38:56,561
How do you know which ones are absentee if you're putting them in the count?

2166
02:38:57,950 --> 02:39:00,711
We have an absentee log sheet, just like we have the check-in.

2167
02:39:01,492 --> 02:39:08,095
When you go in and check in to vote, right, and you request a ballot, they're going to ask for your name, right?

2168
02:39:08,456 --> 02:39:11,717
That same procedure we have for absentee ballots.

2169
02:39:12,278 --> 02:39:15,319
So we're checking their names out so we know who the absentee ballot is.

2170
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:16,740
No, no, no.

2171
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:17,881
Go back to the second question.

2172
02:39:17,901 --> 02:39:26,805
If the sheet comes off with a number, candidate A gets 100, candidate B gets 90, are you saying that the absentee ballots are included in that 190?

2173
02:39:28,148 --> 02:39:30,410
total.

2174
02:39:31,231 --> 02:39:41,419
But I thought they had until five o'clock of the day of the election to get the ballots in the absentee ballot to be effective.

2175
02:39:41,819 --> 02:39:45,242
I got to get the ballots in up until eight o'clock that night.

2176
02:39:46,303 --> 02:39:46,463
Right.

2177
02:39:46,583 --> 02:39:51,948
So if the mail is delivered at eight o'clock at night or seven or six o'clock, I could probably get a, uh,

2178
02:39:53,174 --> 02:39:57,496
I don't know, a UPS maybe that comes in at 7 to City Hall.

2179
02:39:57,937 --> 02:40:01,659
I got to wrap that up and get it out to a board.

2180
02:40:01,679 --> 02:40:09,703
So are you saying that once you post that thing on there, that paper posting out there at 805, that has all the absentee ballots to be counted?

2181
02:40:10,323 --> 02:40:11,444
Is that what you're saying?

2182
02:40:11,524 --> 02:40:13,445
Unless it's an unusual circumstance.

2183
02:40:14,605 --> 02:40:17,507
And then the board would have to look at it and see if that would count.

2184
02:40:19,212 --> 02:40:20,512
So let me get this straight.

2185
02:40:20,693 --> 02:40:29,736
All absentee ballots are to be included in the 16 ballot boxes at 8.05 or whatever that time is when that white strip comes out and the totals are in.

2186
02:40:31,116 --> 02:40:34,877
I mean, we get the majority of them all during the day anyways.

2187
02:40:35,197 --> 02:40:37,738
We only get a very few after 5 o'clock.

2188
02:40:37,758 --> 02:40:45,581
We actually run to the post office physically and go up there to make sure that we've got them all in there.

2189
02:40:46,241 --> 02:40:48,682
So then just explain, for the sake of clarification,

2190
02:40:49,044 --> 02:40:54,467
In this most recent primary, there was a couple of, what do you call the ballots that had to be reviewed?

2191
02:40:55,227 --> 02:40:55,567
Provisional?

2192
02:40:55,587 --> 02:40:56,468
Provisional, yeah.

2193
02:40:56,648 --> 02:40:57,208
Explain that.

2194
02:40:57,268 --> 02:40:58,469
That's entirely different.

2195
02:40:58,889 --> 02:41:04,471
That does not get counted at the poll on location provisionals.

2196
02:41:05,652 --> 02:41:08,934
So what constitutes a provisional ballot?

2197
02:41:10,975 --> 02:41:15,797
Well, if you're not on the regular active list,

2198
02:41:17,346 --> 02:41:19,707
You're not even on the inactive list.

2199
02:41:21,649 --> 02:41:31,577
But you're pretty adamant that you registered to vote here, but we don't have a log for you.

2200
02:41:33,138 --> 02:41:38,322
We'll give you the option to do a provisional ballot.

2201
02:41:39,063 --> 02:41:45,408
What happens on the provisional ballot is the next two days, the board will have to do

2202
02:41:46,361 --> 02:41:53,785
research the circumstances, right, and see if they can find a particular link that that would actually count.

2203
02:41:54,605 --> 02:42:05,511
Now, most of the time, if they say they're registered, okay, we end up finding out they're really registered someplace else, and that provision will probably get rejected.

2204
02:42:05,951 --> 02:42:15,536
But a lot of times, you might have a circumstance that might have it at the RMV, registered motor vehicles, right?

2205
02:42:16,606 --> 02:42:20,509
And it's something that maybe they didn't relate to us.

2206
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:25,192
Because if you go and renew your license and all that kind of stuff, they ask you if you want to register to vote.

2207
02:42:25,932 --> 02:42:27,093
Maybe something happened there.

2208
02:42:27,613 --> 02:42:29,294
And we obtained that document.

2209
02:42:30,435 --> 02:42:34,478
And we look at the back, and if it's a checkmark, that they registered.

2210
02:42:34,938 --> 02:42:39,801
But the IRV didn't send it to us to log in.

2211
02:42:41,042 --> 02:42:43,744
Obviously, we created a link that they were really registered.

2212
02:42:45,991 --> 02:43:05,319
So it's dependent on the circumstances, but it's, but it's, but if you don't show up on active or inactive, right, but you're adamant that you think you're, you know, you're a voter, you know, we'll give you opportunity to, uh, to do, uh, uh, a provision, but you get, you got to supply identification and all that, you know, the backup.

2213
02:43:05,980 --> 02:43:09,201
For someone to come and register to vote, you do not have to show identification.

2214
02:43:09,261 --> 02:43:10,041
Is that true or false?

2215
02:43:10,241 --> 02:43:10,642
Pardon me?

2216
02:43:11,582 --> 02:43:13,763
If a brand new person was to walk into the city hall,

2217
02:43:14,237 --> 02:43:15,778
to go downstairs to register and vote.

2218
02:43:15,878 --> 02:43:18,119
Do they have to show an ID or not?

2219
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:27,664
Yeah, but they also have to put a few digits on the back that associates them with their, I think their social security.

2220
02:43:27,684 --> 02:43:29,565
But what if they don't have one?

2221
02:43:30,785 --> 02:43:32,186
Well, if they don't have a social security card.

2222
02:43:32,346 --> 02:43:32,906
You can't vote?

2223
02:43:32,926 --> 02:43:34,027
They must know their social security card.

2224
02:43:34,047 --> 02:43:34,567
You can't vote?

2225
02:43:35,287 --> 02:43:37,048
Well, you've got to be a citizen to vote.

2226
02:43:40,130 --> 02:43:42,091
So you're saying that every person that registers to vote.

2227
02:43:43,127 --> 02:43:44,308
has to have a Social Security number.

2228
02:43:45,068 --> 02:43:46,429
Yeah, last four digits, Jim.

2229
02:43:46,729 --> 02:43:46,989
Pardon me?

2230
02:43:47,209 --> 02:43:49,030
We put the last four digits in there.

2231
02:43:49,050 --> 02:43:50,471
So they have to show you that card?

2232
02:43:51,411 --> 02:43:52,912
Not the card, just the identification.

2233
02:43:52,992 --> 02:43:56,153
So anybody could just 1, 2, 3, 4, and you've got to write it down?

2234
02:43:56,334 --> 02:43:56,474
Yeah.

2235
02:43:56,634 --> 02:44:02,737
And then once we enter into the system, that link will go into the state, you know, for verification.

2236
02:44:02,877 --> 02:44:07,299
So that's the only way to verify if somebody is a legitimate, if somebody can vote?

2237
02:44:09,353 --> 02:44:13,617
I said, that's the only way somebody can verify if they're eligible to vote.

2238
02:44:14,037 --> 02:44:15,658
No picture ID, no nothing.

2239
02:44:15,698 --> 02:44:21,043
Just walk in there and give them four numbers that supposedly are your last four numbers on Social Security.

2240
02:44:21,283 --> 02:44:22,644
Yeah.

2241
02:44:23,705 --> 02:44:29,810
A lot of times, Bob, is that when they come in to register to vote, they've also been from another community.

2242
02:44:29,831 --> 02:44:30,731
Pretty.

2243
02:44:30,751 --> 02:44:32,693
Can you tell them to be quiet, please?

2244
02:44:33,674 --> 02:44:34,835
They've been to another community.

2245
02:44:36,627 --> 02:45:04,514
We can also create the link if they were a voter another community, you know So what you're gonna do is you'll notify the council and everyone that the date that you can have these machines tested The dates you can have these machines tested you will notify us as a council Yeah, okay

2246
02:45:04,889 --> 02:45:06,770
And all 16 will be tested, correct?

2247
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:09,652
Oh, in separate days, yeah.

2248
02:45:10,512 --> 02:45:11,953
In three days' time, yeah.

2249
02:45:12,574 --> 02:45:13,915
You don't do them all in the same day?

2250
02:45:14,395 --> 02:45:15,255
No, I wish I could.

2251
02:45:15,315 --> 02:45:17,497
I'm not that fit.

2252
02:45:19,658 --> 02:45:24,061
I mean, it takes a little bit of work.

2253
02:45:24,121 --> 02:45:25,842
I'm a one-man band that does it.

2254
02:45:27,223 --> 02:45:30,385
Do you have any backup machines, just in case one of them doesn't work?

2255
02:45:31,365 --> 02:45:32,066
Backup machines?

2256
02:45:32,566 --> 02:45:33,967
Well, that's part of the testing process.

2257
02:45:34,896 --> 02:45:36,757
So if one of the machines doesn't test out, what do you do?

2258
02:45:37,898 --> 02:45:40,640
I'll contact the vendor, and he'll come down and fix it.

2259
02:45:41,881 --> 02:45:42,601
That was the question.

2260
02:45:42,621 --> 02:45:43,762
Do you have a backup system?

2261
02:45:45,063 --> 02:45:45,564
Yeah, I don't.

2262
02:45:45,584 --> 02:45:49,927
I mean, we never bought backup machines.

2263
02:45:50,347 --> 02:45:53,269
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

2264
02:45:53,729 --> 02:46:01,815
I understand that we're asking questions here, but we haven't had these problems.

2265
02:46:02,567 --> 02:46:07,930
There's never been a question of ethical standards during an election that I've heard of.

2266
02:46:07,950 --> 02:46:15,235
I just, I don't know, I'm getting a bad taste, almost like it's conspiracy theory here.

2267
02:46:15,255 --> 02:46:22,079
I understand that we have to obviously make sure that the ethical standards are upheld.

2268
02:46:23,678 --> 02:46:27,262
I don't know of any particular situation that's leading up to these questions.

2269
02:46:28,343 --> 02:46:37,172
If so, this should be brought not only to our clerk, but to the Secretary of State's office, who oversees the elections in Massachusetts.

2270
02:46:37,972 --> 02:46:42,357
So that's just myâ€” Thanks for that point of information, Counsel Penter.

2271
02:46:42,417 --> 02:46:43,918
Are youâ€” And last but notâ€”oh, sorry.

2272
02:46:43,998 --> 02:46:44,319
I'm sorry.

2273
02:46:44,519 --> 02:46:45,420
Go ahead.

2274
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:47,071
Are you finished, Counselor Penta?

2275
02:46:47,091 --> 02:46:47,831
No, he wants the floor.

2276
02:46:47,851 --> 02:46:48,251
Give it to him.

2277
02:46:48,572 --> 02:46:49,652
No, no.

2278
02:46:49,712 --> 02:46:51,253
He made a point of information, which is now concluded.

2279
02:46:51,273 --> 02:46:52,174
I'll wait my turn.

2280
02:46:52,714 --> 02:46:55,055
You have the floor.

2281
02:46:55,496 --> 02:46:57,417
Counselor Penta is through.

2282
02:46:57,877 --> 02:46:58,798
Counselor Camuso.

2283
02:46:58,958 --> 02:47:00,579
Chair recognizes Counselor Camuso.

2284
02:47:00,819 --> 02:47:01,559
Thank you.

2285
02:47:01,859 --> 02:47:04,281
Counselor Penta just said that all the counselors should be notified.

2286
02:47:04,701 --> 02:47:10,785
I think you have to take it one step further, because that would be someone that's not a current counselor may look at that and say, well, why can the counselors be notified?

2287
02:47:10,805 --> 02:47:11,845
I would like to make a blanket.

2288
02:47:12,386 --> 02:47:13,246
Everybody's notified.

2289
02:47:13,286 --> 02:47:14,627
Anyone that's going to appear on the ballot,

2290
02:47:15,767 --> 02:47:17,668
But no, you just said that the council is getting notified.

2291
02:47:17,688 --> 02:47:20,649
And I think you just didn't add to it.

2292
02:47:21,009 --> 02:47:33,032
But with that being said, I think that everybody that's appearing on the ballot in November, and I'm not one of them this year, with that being said, I think everyone should be notified.

2293
02:47:33,072 --> 02:47:33,392
That's all.

2294
02:47:35,153 --> 02:47:41,075
On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo Kern for the call to election, all those in favor?

2295
02:47:42,155 --> 02:47:42,715
All those opposed?

2296
02:47:44,316 --> 02:47:45,276
Congratulations.

2297
02:47:46,258 --> 02:47:52,180
The chair is waiting for a motion to take item number 15629 off the table.

2298
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:59,502
On the motion of Councilor Caviello that the matter 15629 come back before us.

2299
02:47:59,582 --> 02:48:00,522
All those in favor?

2300
02:48:00,622 --> 02:48:01,362
Mr. President?

2301
02:48:01,422 --> 02:48:02,242
All those opposed?

2302
02:48:02,662 --> 02:48:06,123
Would the aggrieved parties please approach the podium?

2303
02:48:09,684 --> 02:48:11,965
Mr. President?

2304
02:48:13,382 --> 02:48:15,283
Chair recognizes Councillor Camuso.

2305
02:48:17,063 --> 02:48:17,703
We're going to.

2306
02:48:19,404 --> 02:48:32,667
So as people are coming back in, I think an arrangement was made for a 90 day at midnight and then the 91st day it would be the one o'clock if there's no problems.

2307
02:48:33,207 --> 02:48:38,712
I'd like to hear it from one of each party very clearly.

2308
02:48:39,232 --> 02:48:56,087
We won't have anybody talking over anybody, but we'll allow this agreement to be reported to us so that the clerk can record the terms down in an adequate manner so that we have clarity on all of this.

2309
02:48:56,567 --> 02:49:00,691
And the council's most appreciative to all of you for your hard work on this matter.

2310
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,461
So if you would, please.

2311
02:49:03,481 --> 02:49:06,203
OK.

2312
02:49:07,444 --> 02:49:22,034
We met with the owners, and we came up with a solution that currently, for the next 90 days, the sports bar will be open

2313
02:49:24,670 --> 02:49:26,151
until midnight each day.

2314
02:49:27,251 --> 02:49:31,392
They will be having karaoke, and that will be closing at 11 o'clock.

2315
02:49:32,973 --> 02:49:37,034
But the restaurant itself, the bar, everything will close down at midnight.

2316
02:49:38,115 --> 02:49:46,438
After a 90-day, and this is pretty much like a probationary period, after the 90 days, the motion you have in front of you

2317
02:49:48,662 --> 02:49:50,827
increase the hours to 1 p.m.

2318
02:49:51,068 --> 02:49:55,036
on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday would go into effect.

2319
02:49:59,091 --> 02:50:04,657
With that, we request a one year probation period of those three days.

2320
02:50:04,677 --> 02:50:09,082
If there's any problems, a year later we'll come back and review it again.

2321
02:50:09,122 --> 02:50:12,466
But I don't foresee any problems.

2322
02:50:13,827 --> 02:50:16,410
I think we're looking forward to having them as good neighbors.

2323
02:50:17,191 --> 02:50:18,573
And I think they feel the same way.

2324
02:50:18,593 --> 02:50:20,234
I wish them a lot of luck.

2325
02:50:21,890 --> 02:50:25,233
But for the next 90 days, they'll be open till midnight.

2326
02:50:25,953 --> 02:50:30,137
And then after that, they're 1 PM closing on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

2327
02:50:31,298 --> 02:50:33,899
So is there a review in any of this?

2328
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:37,262
You want an annual review after one year?

2329
02:50:37,322 --> 02:50:39,344
After one year, we'd like to review it.

2330
02:50:39,384 --> 02:50:40,585
That's reasonable.

2331
02:50:41,725 --> 02:50:44,407
And have us notified this time instead of the parking lot.

2332
02:50:44,948 --> 02:50:50,212
In a circumference of a circle, not a one section of a-

2333
02:50:50,951 --> 02:50:55,976
I'm sure an engineer figured it out, and whatever it is, it isn't satisfactory.

2334
02:50:55,996 --> 02:50:58,698
And we know that, and we got that message loud and clear.

2335
02:50:59,179 --> 02:51:04,764
But if the store owners are agreeable to those terms, very good.

2336
02:51:05,665 --> 02:51:07,667
Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo Kern.

2337
02:51:08,347 --> 02:51:08,708
Thank you.

2338
02:51:08,868 --> 02:51:16,255
Just with regards to the doors in the back, will those be closed during the karaoke and late night hours for the noise level?

2339
02:51:17,405 --> 02:51:22,448
And they did inform us they do have soundproofing in there, too, in the room that the karaoke is in.

2340
02:51:22,588 --> 02:51:23,069
Oh, wonderful.

2341
02:51:23,309 --> 02:51:24,410
That shouldn't be a problem.

2342
02:51:24,710 --> 02:51:29,973
The doors are primarily open because of the heat from the summer from the actual kitchen area.

2343
02:51:30,854 --> 02:51:33,816
But now that the weather's changing, I don't think they'll be opening the doors so often.

2344
02:51:34,757 --> 02:51:42,642
One thing that we did discuss, and it's really a city matter as much as a concern for us, the parking lot itself,

2345
02:51:44,117 --> 02:51:54,420
There's one light there in that entire parking lot, and it shines in one direction, which is fine when it's working, but it shuts off a lot of the time, and it's pitch black in there.

2346
02:51:54,980 --> 02:52:01,341
And that's just a haven, because we were even discussing with them, they're going to have customers coming in using that parking lot.

2347
02:52:05,422 --> 02:52:21,048
You know, if I was a thief, you know, who's been breaking into the houses in my neighborhood, and that's been a recurring thing, knowing that a restaurant now is established there, and they have people coming from all over, and the cars are parked at 12 or 1 in the morning.

2348
02:52:22,498 --> 02:52:27,819
and the parking lot has terrible lighting, you know, you're opening up another can of worms.

2349
02:52:28,440 --> 02:52:37,362
So we don't want their customers coming out complaining that, you know, I've been robbed and now you have the blue lights from the police cars answering their calls at 1.30, 2 o'clock in the morning.

2350
02:52:37,862 --> 02:52:38,862
You know what I mean?

2351
02:52:38,902 --> 02:52:40,283
So I really think...

2352
02:52:41,543 --> 02:52:55,067
Councilor Camuso is going to go down and look at the parking lot tomorrow, the area that I told you guys about, but that entire parking lot really should be under review by the city because there's a lot of potential problems there.

2353
02:52:55,287 --> 02:52:56,448
It's a mess back there.

2354
02:52:56,728 --> 02:52:57,908
It is.

2355
02:52:58,008 --> 02:53:01,049
And it hasn't been swept by the city in two years.

2356
02:53:01,069 --> 02:53:02,590
I can pretty much.

2357
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,841
It hasn't been.

2358
02:53:05,201 --> 02:53:09,704
For the last six years, I've been calling and being put on the list.

2359
02:53:10,084 --> 02:53:12,646
So, I mean, that's just an ongoing thing.

2360
02:53:12,666 --> 02:53:12,946
Thank you.

2361
02:53:13,106 --> 02:53:14,727
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

2362
02:53:14,847 --> 02:53:16,268
Thank you, Mr. President.

2363
02:53:16,288 --> 02:53:22,072
And first off, I want to commend Councilor Mox because I really didn't see Kula Hedge prevailing tonight.

2364
02:53:22,132 --> 02:53:24,113
So, nice job, Councilor Mox.

2365
02:53:25,374 --> 02:53:29,416
So, a motion for approval for the first 90 days

2366
02:53:31,530 --> 02:53:40,596
open till midnight, the 91st day to the 365th day, 1 a.m., with a restriction of 11 p.m.

2367
02:53:40,656 --> 02:53:50,763
karaoke stops, and that we ask the city to upgrade the lights in the parking lot, and when I say the city, that's the mayor, because he has the purse strings.

2368
02:53:50,783 --> 02:53:52,284
That's gonna be a separate issue.

2369
02:53:52,484 --> 02:53:53,225
We'll bring it up right after.

2370
02:53:53,245 --> 02:53:54,126
We'll do that as a separate paper.

2371
02:53:54,326 --> 02:53:57,428
Do it as a separate paper, so motion for approval with the conditions.

2372
02:53:59,205 --> 02:54:00,946
In the probation, the one year.

2373
02:54:01,026 --> 02:54:01,687
One year review.

2374
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:02,067
I'm sorry.

2375
02:54:03,388 --> 02:54:03,568
Yep.

2376
02:54:04,089 --> 02:54:04,329
Yes.

2377
02:54:05,149 --> 02:54:06,250
One year.

2378
02:54:07,031 --> 02:54:07,731
With the butters.

2379
02:54:08,172 --> 02:54:10,473
Actual butters, not computerized butters.

2380
02:54:11,134 --> 02:54:11,794
Not the parking lot?

2381
02:54:13,566 --> 02:54:17,589
They also informed us when they have last call in the restaurant itself.

2382
02:54:18,329 --> 02:54:22,692
And it's usually, you sit a half hour before you close it.

2383
02:54:22,832 --> 02:54:24,273
And there's no problem there.

2384
02:54:24,413 --> 02:54:35,220
As long as the last drinks are served a half hour before they close, we're not getting people in there 10 minutes before they close and ordering a couple of drinks at a time.

2385
02:54:35,881 --> 02:54:36,761
That won't be the case.

2386
02:54:37,121 --> 02:54:40,043
You don't want to let people in that late, because they were there for obvious reasons.

2387
02:54:40,083 --> 02:54:40,284
Exactly.

2388
02:54:40,304 --> 02:54:41,304
We're only there for that reason.

2389
02:54:41,644 --> 02:54:42,465
All the bars are there.

2390
02:54:43,273 --> 02:54:49,080
The bars in Malden and everywhere else, they shut the doors at a time before that, so they're not just getting the refresh.

2391
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:55,187
I don't think, if they're going out, we're hoping they're going out, but they probably won't even need a bouncer.

2392
02:54:55,207 --> 02:54:59,112
But let's hope there's no bouncers.

2393
02:54:59,292 --> 02:54:59,973
No, exactly.

2394
02:55:00,013 --> 02:55:00,573
Good.

2395
02:55:00,713 --> 02:55:02,235
If there's bouncers, the year review.

2396
02:55:03,477 --> 02:55:03,597
Yeah.

2397
02:55:04,748 --> 02:55:07,509
If there's bounces, there may be a review before that year is up.

2398
02:55:07,950 --> 02:55:08,410
Exactly.

2399
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:22,217
I mean, well, somebody said in the meeting that, you know, as the abutters, we're tying our hands because we're letting them have the one year, and we have no leverage.

2400
02:55:22,257 --> 02:55:23,237
I said, we do have leverage.

2401
02:55:23,297 --> 02:55:23,957
It's called the law.

2402
02:55:25,218 --> 02:55:32,582
And trust me, if every neighbor starts calling up the police, you know, at 1 o'clock, 1.30 in the morning to come to Lambert Street,

2403
02:55:33,598 --> 02:55:35,018
you'll be hearing it in no time at all.

2404
02:55:35,559 --> 02:55:42,000
So I'm, you know, they can be blamed for certain things that they're in control of and we understand that.

2405
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:46,922
The area itself needs a lot of help and we're not looking to make problems.

2406
02:55:47,722 --> 02:55:51,543
We're looking to better the neighborhood and we're all in agreement with that.

2407
02:55:51,583 --> 02:56:02,806
So we wish them luck and we're not here to, you know, hamper their prospects, but we just want to keep our neighborhood safe and

2408
02:56:03,868 --> 02:56:07,911
And next year, they'll cater the fishermen's feast fire in the North End.

2409
02:56:07,951 --> 02:56:08,731
I'm sorry, Councilor.

2410
02:56:08,751 --> 02:56:09,652
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2411
02:56:10,432 --> 02:56:11,993
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Marks.

2412
02:56:12,653 --> 02:56:13,434
Thank you, Mr. President.

2413
02:56:13,554 --> 02:56:15,075
On the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso.

2414
02:56:15,095 --> 02:56:17,856
Councilor Camuso just offered, I believe, an A paper.

2415
02:56:17,876 --> 02:56:21,979
It has nothing to do with the conditions, but for the lighting in the lot.

2416
02:56:22,499 --> 02:56:24,880
We'll do that as a separate paper.

2417
02:56:24,981 --> 02:56:32,385
I'd also like to add the sidewalk on Lambert, right in front of the entrance to the parking lot going down the street.

2418
02:56:33,421 --> 02:56:41,187
And we also were talking about crafting or looking at the existing ordinance that deals with extended hours, Mr. President.

2419
02:56:41,508 --> 02:56:56,379
And if I can make that a C paper, so a B and C paper that discusses the subcommittee on licensing me to discuss any ambiguities that may be in the process of the hours of operation.

2420
02:56:56,799 --> 02:56:59,301
And what do you do if they're extended and so forth?

2421
02:56:59,381 --> 02:57:01,503
And when do people actually have to vacate?

2422
02:57:02,355 --> 02:57:05,677
And that's something we do as a council, as the legislative body.

2423
02:57:06,117 --> 02:57:06,417
Right.

2424
02:57:31,554 --> 02:57:37,617
Just that we also meet with the chief of police to discuss, you know, crime in general, but get an update with regards to the.

2425
02:57:37,818 --> 02:57:39,619
We vote on those papers.

2426
02:57:39,899 --> 02:57:40,279
Okay.

2427
02:57:40,339 --> 02:57:40,499
Yes.

2428
02:58:01,170 --> 02:58:01,490
Yes.

2429
02:58:03,151 --> 02:58:03,371
Yes.

2430
02:58:04,512 --> 02:58:14,959
On the big paper, which we'll combine them all together, we're going to have a meeting of the license, refer the matter to the

2431
02:58:28,593 --> 02:58:50,877
a subcommittee on licensings for review of ordinances and processes, for lighting in the parking lot, for fixing of the Lambert Street sidewalk, and for a meeting with the police chief to discuss crime in that neighborhood in particular.

2432
02:58:51,727 --> 02:58:52,728
Councilor Camuso?

2433
02:58:53,248 --> 02:58:58,012
On this particular matter, if we could send the road renovations to the DPW Fort Worth?

2434
02:58:58,493 --> 02:58:58,633
Yes.

2435
02:58:58,653 --> 02:59:03,097
Because over the next 30 to 45 days, there is major renovations going on in this city.

2436
02:59:03,157 --> 02:59:10,523
And just on that as well, ask that people be patient, because they're grinding down a significant amount of roads that they didn't plan on doing.

2437
02:59:11,043 --> 02:59:14,846
So if we could ask for people's patience, because there's going to be a lot of roadwork going on.

2438
02:59:15,247 --> 02:59:17,048
On that motion, all those in favor?

2439
02:59:17,929 --> 02:59:18,690
All those opposed?

2440
02:59:21,174 --> 02:59:22,475
The second paper carries.

2441
02:59:23,055 --> 02:59:30,120
Now, on the motion of Vice President Logan Curran to revert back to the regular order of business.

2442
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:30,880
All those in favor?

2443
02:59:30,900 --> 02:59:31,621
All those opposed?

2444
02:59:32,281 --> 02:59:35,263
Motion carries, 15-679.

2445
02:59:36,043 --> 02:59:45,709
Petition by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, Massachusetts, to address the Council about public safety buildings.

2446
02:59:46,150 --> 02:59:46,350
Ms.

2447
02:59:46,390 --> 02:59:47,430
Martin, welcome.

2448
02:59:48,131 --> 02:59:48,371
Thank you.

2449
02:59:48,391 --> 02:59:49,892
Please state your name and address for the record.

2450
02:59:50,655 --> 02:59:51,916
Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

2451
02:59:52,476 --> 02:59:54,257
And I just witnessed government that works.

2452
02:59:54,757 --> 02:59:55,638
That was awesome.

2453
02:59:56,358 --> 02:59:57,058
That was awesome.

2454
02:59:57,098 --> 02:59:58,239
Good for you guys.

2455
02:59:58,779 --> 03:00:00,060
Okay.

2456
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:03,381
It's repetition, but repetition is the mother of retention.

2457
03:00:04,142 --> 03:00:11,025
It is not the role of the police department to make the case of a new 911 center and police fire station for us.

2458
03:00:11,625 --> 03:00:17,588
It is our responsibility to evaluate the need and meet it for the well-being of the whole city.

2459
03:00:18,181 --> 03:00:21,483
A police station is not exciting people, but necessary.

2460
03:00:22,103 --> 03:00:28,266
I commend Mr. Carviello for taking the unpopular view of a Prop 2.5 override for this purpose.

2461
03:00:28,847 --> 03:00:31,108
At least he understands the gravity of this issue.

2462
03:00:32,349 --> 03:00:40,313
Police personnel wear a uniform, and that separates them psychologically from the general population, and so we view them as different from ourselves.

2463
03:00:41,894 --> 03:00:48,017
They are human, and we often lose that humanity when we see them on the street.

2464
03:00:48,570 --> 03:00:54,312
Most citizens don't interact with police officers regularly, and as a result, don't really understand them.

2465
03:00:55,253 --> 03:01:03,636
We see them most often as only male and strong, and I say that in quotes, and in not need of support.

2466
03:01:04,256 --> 03:01:12,099
Also, keep in mind that police personnel cannot go out on strike, unlike the DPW and Teachers Union.

2467
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:15,061
And remember, buildings can't vote either.

2468
03:01:16,401 --> 03:01:17,422
So who has the vote?

2469
03:01:17,822 --> 03:01:18,122
We do.

2470
03:01:19,147 --> 03:01:26,991
The rules of engagement have changed drastically in the last 15 years since 9-11, and police officers are having a hard time enough keeping up.

2471
03:01:29,053 --> 03:01:33,235
Not to have a decent building to work in only compounds the problem.

2472
03:01:34,015 --> 03:01:39,599
Citizens who enter the building deserve a comfortable setting to inquire, report crimes, et cetera.

2473
03:01:40,219 --> 03:01:42,880
Citizens should not experience attitude from officers.

2474
03:01:43,481 --> 03:01:47,063
However, we must also ask ourselves, how do we treat them?

2475
03:01:48,912 --> 03:01:55,216
We send them the signal that they are our servants only, and that we hold no responsibility to them.

2476
03:01:56,837 --> 03:02:02,961
Detainees deserve the benefit of the doubt until proven guilty, and therefore deserve fair and adequate treatment.

2477
03:02:04,122 --> 03:02:11,166
And in strong hierarchies where people have power and stress, it rolls downhill, if you follow my meaning.

2478
03:02:12,707 --> 03:02:14,488
And it shouldn't land on the incarcerated.

2479
03:02:15,649 --> 03:02:16,970
In the past, this mayor

2480
03:02:17,467 --> 03:02:23,430
has gotten the city all its goodies by his political connections with the state and federal politicians and agencies.

2481
03:02:23,731 --> 03:02:24,631
Those days are over.

2482
03:02:25,131 --> 03:02:32,616
And money is going to be harder to get, given our $19 trillion debt crisis and a half trillion dollar annual deficit.

2483
03:02:33,797 --> 03:02:40,941
Even if I were wrong and the money were to be there in, say, three years, that is still three years too late.

2484
03:02:42,101 --> 03:02:42,602
I'm not done yet.

2485
03:02:46,133 --> 03:02:52,097
All capital improvement projects should be put on hold until this passes the contracting stage.

2486
03:02:53,198 --> 03:02:53,438
Why?

2487
03:02:53,658 --> 03:02:56,200
Because without social order, you have nothing.

2488
03:02:57,021 --> 03:03:01,444
We as a society must agree on certain collective laws or chaos ensues.

2489
03:03:02,244 --> 03:03:06,307
Can you imagine the streets if we didn't address speeding or public drunkenness?

2490
03:03:06,968 --> 03:03:09,529
Or how about a fight between two neighbors?

2491
03:03:10,690 --> 03:03:14,713
If you want to handicap our police and fire department, be my guest.

2492
03:03:15,244 --> 03:03:22,409
But don't cry to me when the police officer's morale is at an all-time low, and they start snapping on their spouses and or citizens in the street.

2493
03:03:23,169 --> 03:03:32,175
Don't complain to me when the technology to handle a medical or fire emergency, which could have been updated and wasn't, led to an otherwise preventable death.

2494
03:03:33,376 --> 03:03:43,663
We can't be everything to the police and fire department, but there are certainly are things we must and can do, and building out a new facility is one of them.

2495
03:03:44,674 --> 03:03:56,336
We have the absolute right to and should question an individual officer's conduct and or group of officers conduct who protect the institution at all costs by covering up wrongdoing.

2496
03:03:56,976 --> 03:04:06,718
However, when we do not alleviate their stresses to the most absolute possibility that within our power, we too commit that offense to the public.

2497
03:04:08,218 --> 03:04:12,959
We as a city need to work with our police force, or it doesn't matter how many,

2498
03:04:13,955 --> 03:04:17,016
there are or what kind of building we put them in.

2499
03:04:17,657 --> 03:04:24,380
Our police officers also require extensive training for the new era that they find themselves in, living in and working in.

2500
03:04:25,180 --> 03:04:33,824
This city needs a whole new safety plan, one that includes shelter-in-place and lockdowns for environmental or violent-related emergencies.

2501
03:04:34,244 --> 03:04:35,245
We need a citywide

2502
03:04:36,402 --> 03:04:38,663
plan for traffic, including bike traffic.

2503
03:04:39,083 --> 03:04:43,084
We need community input to make this city work within safe boundaries.

2504
03:04:44,084 --> 03:04:46,104
Someone needs to speak for the voiceless.

2505
03:04:46,585 --> 03:04:53,186
And while they have a union, they do not have a voice in this city comparable to that of, say, the school system.

2506
03:04:53,706 --> 03:05:02,508
The school system has young middle-class advocates, a whole committee dedicated to its growth, and the sight of those little helpless children.

2507
03:05:03,629 --> 03:05:04,549
It's a no-brainer.

2508
03:05:04,895 --> 03:05:06,897
who the politician is going to cater to.

2509
03:05:07,998 --> 03:05:17,685
Their job description keeps expanding, and that is the police officer's job description, especially as stresses from the national end up coming down to the local levels.

2510
03:05:18,746 --> 03:05:21,388
If you like your social order, thank a cop.

2511
03:05:22,830 --> 03:05:25,872
If you don't like Medford police officers, look in the mirror.

2512
03:05:27,493 --> 03:05:30,516
If you don't do anything, you have no right to complain.

2513
03:05:31,437 --> 03:05:31,697
Thank you.

2514
03:05:36,589 --> 03:05:37,589
Mr. Councilor Camuso.

2515
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:39,450
Thank you, Ms.

2516
03:05:39,490 --> 03:05:39,770
Martin.

2517
03:05:41,051 --> 03:05:42,171
Receive in place on file.

2518
03:05:42,772 --> 03:05:45,333
Motion of Councilor Camuso to receive in place on file.

2519
03:05:45,393 --> 03:05:46,073
All those in favor?

2520
03:05:46,613 --> 03:05:47,254
All those opposed?

2521
03:05:47,954 --> 03:05:51,375
Motion of Councilor Camuso to take papers in the hand of the clerk.

2522
03:05:51,435 --> 03:05:52,116
All those in favor?

2523
03:05:52,176 --> 03:05:52,876
All those opposed?

2524
03:05:53,996 --> 03:05:55,277
Papers in the clerk.

2525
03:05:55,557 --> 03:05:58,478
Did I miss anything on the agenda?

2526
03:05:58,618 --> 03:05:59,959
He has to be withdrawn.

2527
03:06:01,560 --> 03:06:06,103
as a message was conveyed to me by the city messenger.

2528
03:06:06,583 --> 03:06:07,184
Thanks, Larry.

2529
03:06:11,346 --> 03:06:15,369
Papers in the hand of the clerk, we have two condolences here offered by Councilor Knight.

2530
03:06:16,409 --> 03:06:25,615
Be it resolved that the City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Catherine Scaramuzzo on her recent passing.

2531
03:06:26,916 --> 03:06:30,398
Second, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council

2532
03:06:31,078 --> 03:06:38,928
That it's extended deep and sincere condolences to the family of Carmella Milly Natarelli on her recent passing.

2533
03:06:39,569 --> 03:06:47,420
Both neighbors, if we could please rise for a moment of silence for both of these dedicated citizens, both fine women.

2534
03:07:00,670 --> 03:07:14,300
Offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved the City Administration report back to the Council on paper 15-356 regarding pedestrian signaling at Forest Street and King Ave.

2535
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:15,181
Councilor Knight.

2536
03:07:15,841 --> 03:07:17,142
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2537
03:07:17,462 --> 03:07:23,547
A few short weeks before the grand opening of McNally Park, we requested that crosswalks be installed.

2538
03:07:24,408 --> 03:07:30,870
across Forest Street so that individuals who would like to go and utilize our new multi-million dollar park are able to cross the street safely.

2539
03:07:31,550 --> 03:07:35,311
And I'm wondering if the administration would be kind enough to give us an update as to the status thereof.

2540
03:07:35,971 --> 03:07:36,311
Very good.

2541
03:07:36,351 --> 03:07:40,192
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

2542
03:07:40,352 --> 03:07:41,033
All those in favor?

2543
03:07:41,233 --> 03:07:41,893
All those opposed?

2544
03:07:42,373 --> 03:07:42,713
Carries.

2545
03:07:43,253 --> 03:07:44,374
Offered by Councilor Marks.

2546
03:07:44,454 --> 03:07:52,276
We resolve that the traffic division under the Metro Police Department monitor the speeding on Washington Street due to public safety concerns in the neighborhood.

2547
03:07:52,616 --> 03:07:53,316
Councilor Marks.

2548
03:07:54,315 --> 03:08:08,745
Mr. President, I was contacted by several neighbors on Washington Street that mentioned to me that there's drag racing going on.

2549
03:08:08,785 --> 03:08:11,307
We all know that's a long stretch of road.

2550
03:08:11,967 --> 03:08:19,913
And just recently, a young boy was struck on a bicycle and severely hurt himself on Washington Street.

2551
03:08:20,481 --> 03:08:32,384
And neighbors asked that there be an increased presence on the street, as well as possibly an electronic speed machine that we have in the community, and them to step up patrol.

2552
03:08:33,404 --> 03:08:48,027
And if we could put out a paper also asking the Traffic Commission to look into a potential raised crosswalk, in particular on Washington, because of the length of its street and the nature of cars flying down there, Mr. President.

2553
03:08:48,424 --> 03:08:51,945
I would ask that that also be sent to the Traffic Commission for review.

2554
03:08:52,325 --> 03:08:53,446
Very good measure, Councilor.

2555
03:08:53,726 --> 03:08:54,226
Councilor Knight.

2556
03:08:54,766 --> 03:08:56,027
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2557
03:08:56,127 --> 03:09:14,393
May I be so bold to suggest that we ask the Traffic Commission to also maybe temporarily place the temporary speed bumps that we have just purchased through the Community Improvement Initiative down there on Washington Street as well to prevent them from being able to race until we can come up with a long-term solution to the problem like an elevated crosswalk.

2558
03:09:15,009 --> 03:09:16,590
That's a great point, Mr. President.

2559
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:18,410
Could we get a report back?

2560
03:09:19,230 --> 03:09:28,893
Central Ave was supposed to be one of the three pilot race crosswalks, and there's a speed bump out there now, one of those temporary speed bumps.

2561
03:09:29,714 --> 03:09:34,055
Could we get a report back on why that's there and when the â€” as well as Harvard?

2562
03:09:34,095 --> 03:09:37,496
Harvard is supposed to get a race crosswalk, too.

2563
03:09:37,656 --> 03:09:39,737
When that â€” if it is going to take place?

2564
03:09:40,898 --> 03:09:45,822
So on the motion of Councillor Marks as amended by Councillor Knight and Councillor Marks.

2565
03:09:46,102 --> 03:09:46,942
All those in favour?

2566
03:09:47,243 --> 03:09:47,863
Aye.

2567
03:09:47,903 --> 03:09:48,203
Opposed?

2568
03:09:48,223 --> 03:09:49,684
Motion carries.

2569
03:09:49,745 --> 03:09:51,065
Offered by Councillor Camuso.

2570
03:09:51,686 --> 03:09:58,431
Be it resolved that the vacant building across the street from the Metro Fire Department headquarters on Main Street be discussed.

2571
03:09:59,312 --> 03:10:00,152
Councillor Camuso.

2572
03:10:01,273 --> 03:10:02,174
Thank you, Mr. President.

2573
03:10:02,274 --> 03:10:08,578
If we could send a request to the Building Commissioner to find out the status of the permits,

2574
03:10:09,782 --> 03:10:12,363
and everything else that goes along with that building.

2575
03:10:12,843 --> 03:10:14,664
It's the building right next to Tedeschi's.

2576
03:10:16,865 --> 03:10:19,467
And what's the wedding place by the dresses?

2577
03:10:21,267 --> 03:10:22,928
Teresa's boutique, exactly.

2578
03:10:23,989 --> 03:10:25,589
It's been sitting vacant for quite some time.

2579
03:10:25,629 --> 03:10:27,670
There really hasn't been that much activity.

2580
03:10:27,710 --> 03:10:33,213
So if we can get an update, and if they don't have an update, if they can reach out to the developer and find out what's going on with it.

2581
03:10:34,979 --> 03:10:35,299
Very good.

2582
03:10:35,379 --> 03:10:38,261
So on the motion of Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

2583
03:10:39,082 --> 03:10:39,622
Those opposed?

2584
03:10:40,242 --> 03:10:40,963
Motion carries.

2585
03:10:41,203 --> 03:10:41,663
Records.

2586
03:10:42,424 --> 03:10:50,229
Records of the tabled records of the July 21st, 2015 meeting are still in the possession of Councilor Penta.

2587
03:10:50,589 --> 03:10:55,472
Councilor Penta, could you please instruct us on how this is to be addressed?

2588
03:10:56,352 --> 03:10:57,933
Well, what would you like me to say, Councilor?

2589
03:10:59,434 --> 03:11:01,996
I'd like a motion in one way or another.

2590
03:11:02,016 --> 03:11:03,137
I read them.

2591
03:11:04,457 --> 03:11:04,837
I've read them.

2592
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:07,160
Want me to say I approve them?

2593
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:07,680
Yes.

2594
03:11:07,901 --> 03:11:08,101
Yes.

2595
03:11:09,002 --> 03:11:13,386
Councillor Pinto approves those records.

2596
03:11:13,486 --> 03:11:15,248
So on the motion for approval, all those in favour?

2597
03:11:15,288 --> 03:11:15,829
All those opposed?

2598
03:11:16,289 --> 03:11:17,030
Records are approved.

2599
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:23,376
Records of the September 22nd, 2015 meeting were passed to Councillor Karafiello.

2600
03:11:23,897 --> 03:11:25,718
Councillor Karafiello, how did you find those?

2601
03:11:27,058 --> 03:11:28,178
It's good to be in order, Mr. President.

2602
03:11:28,578 --> 03:11:31,779
So on the motion of Councilor Cairo-Viello for approval, all those in favor?

2603
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:32,900
All those opposed?

2604
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:36,521
And on the Councilor Penta's recommendation for adjournment.

2605
03:11:36,701 --> 03:11:37,141
Mr. President?

2606
03:11:37,621 --> 03:11:39,882
Councilor Marks?

2607
03:11:39,902 --> 03:11:48,124
Mr. President, I think it was brought up last week, but the American flag that is directly behind you, there used to be an eagle at the top of that flag.

2608
03:11:49,024 --> 03:11:51,405
And it has been missing for several weeks now.

2609
03:11:51,980 --> 03:11:57,242
And I would ask that it be replaced or a new flag be put in its place, Mr. President.

2610
03:11:57,542 --> 03:11:58,102
So noted.

2611
03:11:59,163 --> 03:12:03,964
On Councilor Penta, while we're still approaching our... Further point, while the meeting is on.

2612
03:12:04,304 --> 03:12:07,426
If you look up in the ceiling over there, when is it ever going to get fixed?

2613
03:12:07,466 --> 03:12:08,386
It's over two years old.

2614
03:12:08,546 --> 03:12:09,386
Over two years old.

2615
03:12:09,406 --> 03:12:10,027
It's over two years old.

2616
03:12:10,047 --> 03:12:11,527
We've all watched people almost die.

2617
03:12:11,667 --> 03:12:11,847
Right.

2618
03:12:12,848 --> 03:12:14,628
It's the current administration that's allowed it.

2619
03:12:15,028 --> 03:12:17,169
There's a lot that has to be done with this building.

2620
03:12:17,209 --> 03:12:19,390
It's about to fall over, and it's a gem.

2621
03:12:21,885 --> 03:12:23,991
A motion for what do we call this?

2622
03:12:24,051 --> 03:12:25,876
Adjournment by Councillor Penta.

2623
03:12:25,936 --> 03:12:26,678
