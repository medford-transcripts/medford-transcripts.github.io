    <p>[Hurley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=612.534s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=613.995s">I'll</a>  have to echo what everyone here had to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=616.858s">It's</a>  certainly an honor that we have a man from Medford on that hockey team. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=622.062s">He</a>  had competition to get on the team from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=624.785s">He's</a>  the only one from Medford, the only one from the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=628.308s">And</a>  they went over there to Italy, and they put on quite a show. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=631.45s">They</a>  won, brought back the gold. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=633.632s">I</a>  don't know much about hockey, but I do know that I used to hear noise in my house because I lived two doors from <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=642.017s">Max,</a>  and I hear bang, bang, bang. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=644.718s">And</a>  I said to my wife one day, I said, Sharon, what is that noise? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=647.959s">And</a>  she said, that's Max up there practicing his hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=650.64s">When</a>  he was seven and eight and nine years old, early in the morning, late at night, I'd see him going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=655.402s">So</a>  it took a lot to spend the three weeks in Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=659.924s">He's</a>  doing well in school, so they gave him the permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=662.865s">And</a>  we all know, especially George knows, he's been involved with numerous programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=667.347s">Adam's</a>  now starting his hockey career as a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=671.028s">Not</a>  in hockey, but a couple of other sports, and I know Michael's done a lot with his son, too, in this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=676.891s">This</a>  guy with his three children, and you with your son, and you're a hockey player. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=680.913s">He</a>  was at Tufts University as a hockey player. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=683.414s">So,</a>  Matt, indeed, it's a pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=685.034s">But</a>  I wanted to present this to Matt from State Representative Paul Donato of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=690.757s">Paul</a>  asked me to present this, he's unable to be with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=694.038s">The</a>  Commonwealth of Massachusetts House of Representatives, be it hereby known to all that the Massachusetts House of Representatives offers its sincerest congratulations to Matt Stephens in recognition of being the only representative from Massachusetts in the 2019 <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=714.306s">Olympic</a>  team where Team USA won a gold medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=720.83s">The</a>  entire membership extends their very best wishes and expresses the hope for future good fortunes and continued success in all endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=730.995s">It</a>  was signed today, the 21st day of January 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=735.638s">at</a>  the State House, Boston, by Barbara A.

    <p>[Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=821.329s">Thank</a>  you all for having me here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=822.93s">It</a>  was a great experience going to Italy and I look forward to seeing what else I can do in my hockey career. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=828.212s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=857.714s">On</a>  the motion of council night second of my council appears to take a brief recess to take a few pictures with the With max all those in favor all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=865.462s">We're</a>  now recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=866.163s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=972.039s">We</a>  will now reconvene the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=974.86s">A</a>  motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=979.601s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=980.922s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=981.622s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=983.862s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=985.643s">20-033</a>  offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=989.244s">Be</a>  it resolved that the issue of Verizon 5G installations be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=998.147s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1000.357s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1002.879s">Last</a>  week, Mr. President, there was a meeting held here at City Hall regarding the 5G network and potential installation in this community by Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1016.849s">Verizon</a>  has petitioned the city for, from my understanding, at least <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1024.039s">three</a>  to four dozen locations within the community to add these small cell networks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1032.025s">throughout</a>  the community, and we received a letter which I've already read into the record several weeks back from Verizon, dated December 10th, 2019, to then-Mayor Stephanie Burke regarding their applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1049.413s">And</a>  I won't read the whole letter, but more or less the letter is stating that method is in current violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1057.257s">of</a>  the FCC rules and regulations which requires the city of Medford after 60 days to either approve or deny small cell applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1074.146s">Verizon</a>  went on to say that they would be willing to give us an extension until January 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1082.79s">And</a>  I am not sure which I will be asking tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1086.88s">where</a>  the city stands with these current applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1090.421s">But</a>  for tonight's purpose, Mr. President, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1097.123s">This</a>  has been an issue that I've been on top of for the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1102.344s">And</a>  many residents who reached out were concerned not only with a number of issues related to 5G, but also the potential health impact it could have on residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1118.43s">So</a>  tonight, Mr. President, I will be offering a motion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1122.951s">But</a>  I would like to go through, which was provided to me by a number of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1129.313s">One</a>  being Jay Ritchie, who I think is in the audience here, Mr. President, provided this council along with the mayor with an abundance of information regarding health impacts, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1144.378s">ordinances</a>  in other cities and towns throughout the United States, and also actions taken by local legislatures throughout the United States as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1158.426s">But,</a>  Mr. President, local ordinances note various purposes for ordinances, such as preserving visual character, protecting environmental resources, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1172.099s">and</a>  protecting residents against adverse health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1177.102s">They</a>  take a variety of approaches, such as prohibiting small cells in certain areas, creating application and recertification fees, and imposing aesthetic and administrative requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1191.966s">Under</a>  location ordinance suggestions, Mr. President, and what I'm hoping to do tonight is just to start the dialogue because the mayor, in her wisdom, Mayor Burke, when we were approached with these requests originally, there was no city ordinance that governed these. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1210.555s">And</a>  I think the mayor did a tremendous job at the time for what resources that she had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1215.939s">She</a>  created an administrative policy that would govern the approach to applying for an application and how the city would handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1228.107s">And</a>  also the creation of what the city refers to as the method ad hoc small cell committee, which is the granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1238.735s">and</a>  they may have put together a several page policy, but in my opinion, it was good for the time that it was presented, but it doesn't go far enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1249.976s">to</a>  add the protections that we need as a community and to have a full-fledged ordinance because Verizon is going to be the first of many vendors that will be before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1261.618s">And</a>  you can count on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1263.179s">So</a>  getting back to the local ordinances, location suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1268.68s">Prohibiting</a>  small cell installations in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1273.341s">Requiring</a>  installations to be certain distance away from residences, schools, hospitals, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1280.99s">Specifying</a>  that installations must be relocated when they would interfere with public projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1287.832s">Aesthetics</a>  and environment ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1290.392s">These</a>  are just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1292.773s">Aesthetic</a>  design, noise requirements such as co-location, camouflage, height, and light limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1300.855s">The</a>  administrative legal suggestions for ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1304.296s">Requiring</a>  that residents who will be within a certain distance of an installation be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1310.496s">instating</a>  automatic time limits for permits, requiring annual recertification fees, requiring permittees to defend and indemnify the city for many liabilities arising from permits in the installation, operation, and maintenance of small cell installations, reserving the right to hire independent consultants at the applicant's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1335.674s">What</a>  was presented to us, Mr. President, and there were several states, but the state of New Hampshire has proposed a bill which would establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1351.099s">The</a>  state of Montana has proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives urging Congress to amend 1996 Telecommunications Act to account for health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1366.377s">So</a>  those are two proposals, Mr. President, that I will be offering tonight that we ask our state delegation submit on behalf of the city of Medford and on behalf of the Commonwealth, because we're not the only city in the Commonwealth that's struggling with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1384.833s">Mr.</a>  President, as we all know, this is an FCC regulation, and in my opinion, they really do tie the hands of local government to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1393.904s">And</a>  one thing we can act upon is creating an ordinance that will safeguard our residents and also re-insure that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1404.282s">When</a>  these installations if and when they do get approved that all the measures are in place mr. President that safeguards our residents So that will be what I'm offering tonight One resolution, I would like to offer now mr. President is be it resolved that the method City Council approve a resolution asking state lawmakers the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1428.587s">in</a>  Congress to limit 5G technology deployment in Massachusetts until the health effects are fully understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1447.577s">I</a>  can't speak for my colleagues, but I can say, Mr. President, many residents that I spoke to, no one's against <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1455.495s">new</a>  technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1456.836s">No</a>  one's against advancements in technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1460.058s">No</a>  one's against having our residents not have the technology that would enable them to use their devices and all sorts of angles and aspects and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1470.906s">But</a>  what we are against, Mr. President, is moving forward without getting the proper answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1481.307s">I</a>  have asked several times, I was here at the meeting that Verizon held, and Verizon will be the first to come out and say there are no health concerns that they are aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1493.896s">And</a>  I got that from every representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1496.658s">However,</a>  when you go on the internet, you'll see experts saying there are concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1502.418s">So</a>  this is no different than a trial when you have two experts, they may be physicians or accountants, say two completely different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1511.724s">And</a>  on behalf of our residents, Mr. President, we should proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1516.286s">And</a>  if that caution is that we take a while to explore this issue and make sure that it's safe, these devices are going to be within 200, 300 feet of residents' homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1528.268s">They're</a>  going to be in backyards where kids are playing, close to parks, close to schoolyards, close to churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1535.213s">So</a>  we have to make sure that we do our due diligence, Mr. President, when it comes to creating the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1542.657s">The</a>  second thing, Mr. President, I'd like to bring up is I happen to have bumped into recently a former member of the Burlington Selectmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1551.992s">And</a>  the town of Burlington, I would tell anyone interested in this subject, they should really go on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1559.054s">They</a>  have an application process, Mr. President, that is literally probably 10 pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1568.296s">And</a>  it's a very in-depth process that makes these particular vendors jump through many hurdles in order to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1579.474s">And</a>  from what I've been told by the town of Burlington is there was enough hurdles that they got tired jumping over hurdles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1590.14s">And</a>  the application process is equally, Mr. President, which I have equally as Cumminson, these design rules and regulations, which is about a 20-page report that was issued by the town of Burlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1606.943s">Very</a>  in depth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1608.903s">And</a>  then there was a number of correspondence back and forth from attorneys that were hired to discuss the issue on behalf of the town in Verizon, which I won't get into tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1623.387s">I</a>  would like to just briefly mention that some of the things that we should be looking at as a community, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1632.217s">And</a>  this is not unique to Method, but prior to any installation, a structural analysis should be completed to ensure the pole can handle the additional equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1644.069s">That</a>  should be the very first thing either in our policy, which is not there currently, or in our city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1652.177s">The</a>  city should ask about a host agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1656.314s">When</a>  we sign on, Mr. President, to anything happen in this community, the first thing that we usually do is sign a host agreement to make sure that if there are any issues that arise from this, that the city of Medford will be covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1673.283s">There</a>  should be an agreement in place that requires the removal of these systems when obsolete. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1679.346s">Right</a>  now, you can go down any street in our community, Mr. President, and you see dishes <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1686.052s">They're</a>  on the side of homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1687.933s">I</a>  have one across the street from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1690.133s">It's</a>  a two-family, but they have three dishes that have been disconnected for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1696.235s">It's</a>  just a blight, an eyesore, and there should be a provision in there when they become obsolete, no longer useful, that they be removed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1706.098s">I</a>  realize they're on private property, but I feel strongly about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1710.159s">And</a>  this is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1711.359s">These</a>  will be located on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1714.827s">and</a>  public right-of-ways, but when they're no longer useful, they should have a plan to remove them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1722.352s">The</a>  city should establish design rules and regulations that I won't get into, similar to what the town of Burlington did, as well as the application to ensure compliance with city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1735.08s">Verizon</a>  should also provide the city with a long-range plan, including future expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1743.308s">We</a>  should not be subjected to the one and twosies of these, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1748.315s">Last</a>  I spoke to the city engineer, I believe he said there were three or four dozen applications, and there possibly could be upwards to 100 from what he's being told. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1761.368s">And</a>  I believe at the very least, as a community, we should know what their intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1767.631s">Is</a>  the intent to put 100? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1769.372s">We</a>  should know the locations offhand, Mr. President, and we should know if they are the only ones that are gonna be doing this in the community, because in my opinion, they're not gonna be the only ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1780.197s">Verizon</a>  should also provide a public health, I'm sorry, public health concerns be addressed by an independent study. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1792.469s">So</a>  that would be, Mr. President, the city requesting, I know Verizon has done their studies on health and the impact and effects of 5G on residents and so forth, but the city should have its own independent study so therefore we can rely on valid information from a neutral party and not someone that's trying to make a dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1818.743s">And</a>  I wish them no <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1825.495s">I</a>  wish them no animosity, Mr. President, but our job as residents of city council is to ensure the public safety of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1836.209s">And</a>  this truly is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1839.733s">The</a>  second point, maybe the third point by now, Mr. President, is that several weeks back, the city, actually probably more than several weeks now, the city had its own public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1853.708s">And</a>  that was conducted by the ad hoc small cell committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1858.329s">And</a>  the correspondence that went out to residents at the time, and I know this has been expanded since, Ashcroft Road, Dutton Circle, Cedar, Lawrence Road, they received a letter from the city that did not really specify the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1877.735s">They</a>  received a letter, Mr. President, that wasn't signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1882.676s">They</a>  received a letter that called for a public hearing at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1888.945s">making</a>  no consideration for people working, people with kids, people that need childcare, people that may not be able to get there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1901.069s">There</a>  was no copy or scope of the project within this letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1907.371s">And</a>  they did adhere to the mayor's policy about notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1914.013s">And</a>  that was to notify residents within 300 feet of the installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1919.986s">As</a>  we both know, 300 feet would be here to probably the far back of the chamber and maybe a little further outside, Mr. President, in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1930.512s">It's</a>  not much notification to a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1933.874s">I</a>  requested, along with this council, it was unanimous, that we increase the notification to at least 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1941.058s">That</a>  was passed unanimously by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1944.481s">That</a>  any other future mailings that go out <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1947.219s">that</a>  the specific location be mailed along with a copy of the site plan by Verizon, and that all public hearings take place after 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1963.325s">so</a>  that we can have more resident involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1966.206s">That</a>  was sent to the city administration back, I think it was a month and a half, two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1971.848s">And,</a>  uh, I am not sure if the mayor, mayor Burke at the time, uh, updated the policy that was under her prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1980.291s">And</a>  that's why I think we need a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1982.932s">So,</a>  uh, I look forward, Mr. President, uh, to sending word out to our state delegation in the form of, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=1993.046s">If</a>  we want to do council resolution, asking that state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2004.172s">Bear</a>  with me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2006.813s">The</a>  state delegation, our state delegation establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2022.622s">So</a>  that's the second resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2024.383s">And</a>  the third resolution is that our state delegation offer before the House of Representatives and also the State Senate, which would include Senator Jalen, urging Congress to amend the Telecommunication Act 1996, of 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2037.206s">To</a>  account for health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2046.397s">So</a>  those would be the three resolutions I'd like to offer tonight, Mr. President, as well as you reconvening a meeting so we can start diligently working on our own ordinance to safeguard residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2059.085s">And</a>  I look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say and also residents in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2065.289s">Last</a>  week's meeting, I also thought was going to be a question answer type meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2070.393s">I</a>  know there were a lot of residents that were upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2073.054s">It</a>  was more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2074.42s">just</a>  an informational meeting where you can walk around and talk to representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2079.226s">And</a>  I'm not sure you're quite going to get that out of tonight's meeting, but I'm hoping after tonight's meeting we will invite Verizon down, we will invite <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2089.537s">the</a>  Method Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, who is the granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2093.999s">We</a>  will invite the mayor down, Mr. President, and have our own public hearing here so residents can ask Verizon the tough questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2102.422s">And</a>  this council, as well as the mayor, as well as this Ad Hoc Committee, can be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2107.824s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2114.626s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2115.207s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2116.407s">Councilor</a>  Marks, if I'm actually... <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2119.076s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, do you have the wording for all the resolutions? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2123.478s">I</a>  do have them written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2130.122s">You</a>  second each of the recommendations? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2131.802s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2132.663s">On</a>  the motion, we'll take individual votes in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2136.045s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, there are a number of councilors that want to speak on this issue, so I'll recognize them at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2148.151s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2149.264s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Marks for such a detailed presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2154.471s">I</a>  think it's incredibly important that massive multinational corporations be accountable to our local governance and not just allowed to run free and do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2163.944s">And</a>  I also agree that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2165.573s">This</a>  process has been reflective of an issue with the city around notification and making sure that residents are involved and engage the decisions that we're making. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2171.699s">So</a>  I think those changes are welcome and I would also agree with the motions asking our I mean it's ridiculous that the telecommunications act doesn't factor in health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2180.708s">That's</a>  that's nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2182.07s">So</a>  I think we need that state and federal action as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2185.712s">Just</a>  one thing I wanted to bring up and add to the conversation is that the small cell approach to 5G is not the only approach that the large corporations are using. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2195.038s">AT&T,</a>  T-Mobile, and Sprint are looking at different ways of deploying this technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2200.702s">As</a>  far as I'm aware, only Verizon right now is moving ahead with installing small cells as the way that this network would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2206.646s">So</a>  I'd really also like to get some <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2210.27s">Clarification</a>  about how that deployment might work differently in a policy or an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2217.295s">Obviously</a>  the small cells, that's been the focus of discussion because that's what Verizon's bringing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2222.7s">But</a>  there's definitely, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint are talking about many fewer antennas that are longer range. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2230.205s">And</a>  I'd like to make sure that any policy that we implement or any research that we bring up factors in different ways that potentially 5G may be deployed by these companies.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2240.828s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2243.13s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2244.451s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2246.232s">I</a>  just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2248.133s">I</a>  think he gave a very thorough and thoughtful presentation that laid out the issues that are really concerning this community and also presented solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2255.559s">So</a>  I appreciate his passion for the subject of thoughtfulness and the way that he put this together, and I support it wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2260.263s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2262.084s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2262.724s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2264.185s">Again,</a>  I want to <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2265.373s">I</a>  thank my council for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2268.715s">I</a>  was here in and out of the meeting last week because we did have our own committee meeting last week, but I was a little dismayed when I came in and saw a bunch of tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2277.301s">I</a>  thought it was going to be a question and answer period, and I did talk to a couple of representatives myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2284.929s">just</a>  some minimal answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2288.051s">And</a>  I did do some homework, and I did find what Councilor Bears's found. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2291.414s">There</a>  are other ways of providing this, not just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2293.636s">But</a>  if all these other companies are going to be looking at doing this community, why can't they maybe get together? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2300.331s">and</a>  do this jointly rather than piecemeally get with Verizon doing it, AT&T, all these different companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2308.096s">Maybe</a>  do it as a joint venture so we're not coming back doing this three or four times. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2313.74s">And</a>  maybe they can do something that they all can jointly share in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2320.684s">That</a>  would be also a suggestion that I'll bring up when we have our committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2325.487s">But</a>  again, I thank my Councilor for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2331.991s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2336.056s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2337.398s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2338.659s">I</a>  also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and doing so much research and also thank the residents for all the research they have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2345.117s">The</a>  emails I've received, this is really kind of a deep issue, complicated by the fact that the FCC, beyond the 1996 Telecommunications Act, came down last year and basically removed a lot of the power that local governments have to regulate this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2364.006s">So</a>  the challenge of the one benefit is that almost every city around the country is dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2370.049s">So</a>  there is a lot to learn from, as Councilor Mark said, people who are successfully developing ordinances to make sure the needs of their communities are being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2379.193s">So</a>  I support those resolutions and I thank Councilor Marks for going even farther than suggesting ordinance work and seeing what we can get from the state delegation because <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2389.978s">This</a>  isn't just affecting Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2391.299s">This</a>  is affecting the whole state, and we deserve the support at the state level and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2396.443s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2398.985s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2402.448s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2404.008s">To</a>  be redundant, I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2405.588s">So</a>  again, I thank Council Marks for bringing up such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2409.009s">I</a>  know that the emails and the phone calls I received, I think the frustration goes more in depth than just what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2418.052s">The</a>  whole lack of information, the fear that's still out there that hasn't been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2424.473s">As</a>  we move forward, I wonder if we can put an amendment that we can have the Acton City Solicitor to see if we can extend that period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2436.041s">I</a>  know that the 20th is the date, I believe, so- Yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2441.284s">Yesterday,</a>  so if there's a way that we can put a hold, if there's a way that the city can freeze that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2447.428s">There's</a>  some issues that if you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2450.57s">some</a>  of the members in the audience where other communities have put a stop to this, there's something to be gained by understanding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2459.556s">So</a>  having our city solicitor find any loophole that can stop this ASAP until we get the answers that Council Marks has brought up, I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2470.203s">So</a>  I'd like to make that into an amendment if I can.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2473.186s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2475.069s">I'd</a>  also like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2478.655s">It's</a>  a very important issue and I thank you for all the research that you've done because I know it takes a lot of time and effort and we all appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2489.17s">hearing</a>  the information that you're bringing to us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2491.691s">And</a>  I thank the residents as well for coming out tonight, because I know that this is a concern that many have throughout our entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2498.933s">So</a>  thank you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2501.473s">There</a>  are a number of resolutions, but is there anybody here that wanted to speak on this issue tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2507.715s">Okay,</a>  please do, feel free to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2510.595s">When</a>  you come forward, we just need your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Aire-Beckwith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2513.596s">Yes,</a>  my name is Jane Aire Beckwith, A-I-R-E. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2520.541s">I</a>  need to tell you that back in 1969, a group of students... Excuse me.</p>

    <p>[Aire-Beckwith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2534.309s">Apartment</a>  F. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2536.588s">And</a>  I want to tell you that in 1969, a group of students got up in the trees, the sycamore trees on Memorial Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2545.611s">They</a>  were not cut down by Harvard School, by Harvard Law School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2551.573s">And</a>  we did it because we thought those trees were important because it took about 100 years to grow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2557.614s">I</a>  am so grateful to hear you talking like this, Councilors, because things take time to know about health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2566.264s">The</a>  environment takes time, and if we don't give it time, corporations will not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2573.692s">I've</a>  been <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2575.239s">doing</a>  massage and reflexology for over 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2579.561s">I</a>  work with people recovering from all kinds of drugs and alcohol at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2584.944s">I</a>  have over 30 years in recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2588.506s">What</a>  I'm trying to say to you is what is important to me is that we take the time we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2593.989s">I've</a>  never had a patient or a client say to me, hurry up and finish with my feet and body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2602.096s">And</a>  that's what we have to do with this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2606.058s">Because</a>  what goes in the air gives off chlorine with those satellites. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2611.161s">And</a>  there has to be a lot sent up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2613.462s">And</a>  it won't just be Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2615.644s">It'll</a>  be Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2617.224s">It'll</a>  be all the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2618.905s">So</a>  please think of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2621.627s">And</a>  what's important to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2624.028s">Is</a>  it holding our families as we grow? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2628.069s">You</a>  know, almost 70 and possibly a great-grandmother in the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2633.133s">That's</a>  important that I hold my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2636.116s">And</a>  what else is important is Medford has so much open space and it's very precious to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2642.422s">And</a>  walking my little emotional support animal out in the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2648.24s">And</a>  so everything I do now, I take in consideration what I breathe, what I drink, what will happen for the future generations and the animals around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2658.887s">Thank</a>  you, and I'm grateful for your consideration on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2661.649s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2667.473s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Ritchie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2669.034s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2669.455s">John</a>  J. Ritchie, and it's 22 Bradley Road, 4A. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2677.054s">I'm</a>  not anti-business, I'm not anti-technology, I don't think anybody in their right mind is, but I am pro-common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2687.538s">and</a>  i think you guys are too because this uh... this issue is is not going to go away it's only going to get you know more attention as uh... as the time goes on and i'm thankful that you guys are bringing this up i'm not going to read everything that i have here because most of the stuff that i have here i've emailed to you and then a bunch of you here as well so uh... if you don't have it because of yahoo dumped it in your spam or never <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2717.231s">Received</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2717.812s">I</a>  have copies here that I can give you but I also you you mentioned that article on what other cities are doing But in that article, I don't know if you've seen it, but there is a model Wireless telecommunications ordinance, which I have seven copies here if you'd like me to leave them I don't know if you saw that but it's a model that you guys can look at as a guide to see what can Medford do to you know <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2744.329s">protect</a>  the residents from a new technology that not everybody understands completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2750.09s">And</a>  even Verizon, they were quite disingenuous when I was here at that meeting last week, or information session, and one of the gentlemen told me, oh, if you have any health concerns, you can go talk to our guy over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2766.674s">But</a>  he's already in the bag for Verizon, so he's not neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2770.675s">I</a>  mean, what incentive do they have to tell us that there might be an issue with health and safety? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2777.159s">I</a>  mean, they have no incentive as a business, as a corporation, whose bottom line is to make the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2784.563s">It's</a>  not, you know, what is the health of the residents that live around here? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2789.426s">You</a>  know, how is that going to be affected? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2791.147s">That's</a>  not their concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2792.588s">That's</a>  our concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2794.269s">And</a>  we want Verizon to feel comfortable with, you know, with Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2799.951s">And</a>  Medford is pro-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2801.192s">We're</a>  not anti-business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2802.993s">But</a>  we want to move forward carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2805.874s">And</a>  I thought they were disingenuous last week when he told me <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2809.736s">Because</a>  I said, where's this gonna, do you have one of these devices that's gonna be near my residence? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2818.219s">He</a>  said, yeah, where do you live? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2819.679s">Bradley</a>  Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2820.319s">Oh,</a>  it's gonna be on 13 Bradley Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2822.66s">I'm</a>  22. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2823.801s">So</a>  I'm like, that's right outside my door. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2828.022s">And</a>  he tells me, oh, don't worry because our technology is 20% stronger than your cell phone signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2834.864s">I'm</a>  like, if it's that strong, if it's that stronger than my cell phone, why do you need it right up my nose? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2842.425s">You</a>  don't need it that close to where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2844.206s">I</a>  mean, he says it can go through the wall, but you can definitely pick up the signal when you walk outside your house, but I don't wanna pick up the signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2854.008s">I</a>  don't wanna be bombarded by these EMF waves, and I know that there's a lot of buzz on, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2860.929s">Medford</a>  Square Facebook page who there's some people pushing back and saying oh, there's nothing wrong with this technology There's nothing to worry about It's only high Frequency waves that you have to worry about but that the research that I've done Suggests that it's not just high High levels of the frequency it's lower at their health concerns and health effects from over 800 studies <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2890.749s">that</a>  detail studies that were done not by people that are already in the bag for Verizon or these other companies, but neutral parties, some of them not even in the country, who have nothing but concern that is driving their research, not that they're getting paid for any American business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2912.15s">And</a>  there's <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2913.906s">there's</a>  quite a alarming evidence here that suggests that we shouldn't take pressure from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2921.449s">We</a>  should be welcoming, but we shouldn't have them come into our city and start installing these things in residential areas, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2929.451s">They're</a>  not even suggesting only putting them on top of commercial zones or even buildings that are owned by Citi, but inside <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2940.616s">where</a>  we have to go out and go to work or go to school, what have you, and then come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2946.84s">They</a>  wanna put these devices in our very streets, where the residents are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2952.964s">So</a>  I think that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2955.086s">So</a>  I don't know if there's a way to submit these to the delegation or whatever groups you have that wanna look into this further because we should, if they decide that they're gonna put them, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2969.605s">Yeah,</a>  here's the sample ordinance, and then here's a hard copy of all the information that I've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2976.249s">But</a>  if they want to put them in Medford, I think that they should put them further away from where residents don't have to deal with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2986.335s">There</a>  are effects to skin, to heartbeat, to fertility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2993.098s">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2995.919s">The</a>  further these things are away from where you live, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2999.281s">I'm</a>  not saying that we shouldn't have them at all, but they shouldn't be right outside where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3007.224s">They</a>  weren't necessary for 2G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3012.086s">3G</a>  and 4G, but now all of a sudden for 5G they're necessary to have these on poles outside where you live. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3019.131s">That</a>  doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3020.472s">So</a>  I appreciate you guys hearing me and I hope I wasn't rambling, but I appreciate you guys taking the time to really discuss this and coming up with a solution that is pro-business and business friendly, but also takes into consideration your constituents and their concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3039.424s">Thank</a>  you for being balanced.</p>

    <p>[Devine]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3048.395s">My</a>  name is Catherine Devine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3049.656s">I</a>  live at 5 Norton Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3053.116s">And</a>  I'm glad I don't have to come up here and be defensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3058.958s">Instead,</a>  I'm coming up here to thank you for being so considerate because I think some of what happens with these kind of new, you know, in fact, very exciting technologies <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3072.613s">is</a>  that people get swept up in the movement of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3077.417s">They</a>  seem inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3081.14s">And</a>  in fact, 5G installations are already being installed countrywide and worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3090.488s">And</a>  so now we're having to <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3097.065s">try</a>  and slow that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3098.607s">So</a>  thank you for being willing to step back and be considerate about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3104.174s">I</a>  actually work for the international leading software producer of software for scientists and engineers and my company makes a 5G toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3116.815s">So</a>  I'm gonna take my 5G for dummies questions to that team and see if they can, because I feel like we need to be factual and straightforward and not inflammatory about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3136.57s">I'm</a>  not interested in saying that this causes cancer if there's absolutely no evidence that it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3145.023s">On</a>  the other hand, the World Health Organization is recommending that we not go forward with 5G installations because there are so many questions and suggestions of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3160.438s">So</a>  I'll do my part to become more well-informed, to learn what I can about 5G from my company. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3167.425s">interesting,</a>  I didn't know there were other ways of deploying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3173.55s">So</a>  that may be a piece of evidence that we can use against Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3178.634s">But</a>  it seems to me, this is on a whole new scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3183.278s">Actually,</a>  it's how it's being promoted, 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3187.297s">is</a>  exploding onto the world as a new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3189.979s">It</a>  is a new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3191.52s">We've</a>  never had transmitters outside of people's homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3196.122s">That's</a>  new. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3197.723s">And</a>  one of the stories, and I promise I'll get you this reference because, again, I want to be factual and not inflammatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3205.907s">Apparently,</a>  they had put a 5G installation on a firehouse, and the firemen all started getting headaches, and they had it taken off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3217.396s">No</a>  joke that, you know, there seem to be health effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3223.442s">And</a>  I'll just close by saying I'm glad, oh, there was a meeting in Concord of 250 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3229.547s">So</a>  Burlington already succeeded in stopping 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3234.131s">Concord's</a>  right in the thick of it, so I'll try and get some contact names from there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3239.955s">Apparently</a>  there were lawyers there, there was a Nobel laureate there, so you know, hopefully each town isn't having to reinvent the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3249.681s">What</a>  was I starting to say before I thought about Concord? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3252.963s">Oh,</a>  I'm glad you're getting legal help because at least the way it stands at the moment, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3259.235s">You</a>  know, the way it reads, you can't deny Verizon based on health effects, which is, I think, mostly what we care about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3266.839s">So</a>  I think it may take some finagling for you to find a way to slow Verizon down, back them off, and, you know, protect the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3281.825s">So</a>  appreciate all your words today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3284.867s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3291.448s">Hey</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3291.988s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3292.488s">My</a>  name is Aaron Rumley and I live at 216 Grove Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3297.391s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3298.271s">Councilor</a>  Marks for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3300.513s">I</a>  think it's a really important topic and I'm happy to have the opportunity to discuss it publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3308.315s">I</a>  also went to the meeting last week and found it largely underwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3313.037s">I</a>  specifically felt bad for all of the elderly folks that came here that would have benefited from more of a panel discussion and listening to other people's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3323.641s">And</a>  thank you for also confirming my understanding that all that's in place right now is a policy for procedure to submit applications directly to the mayor to be ushered to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3335.492s">I</a>  think that that was all well and good to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3337.733s">And</a>  I agree, obviously, now we need an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3341.295s">And</a>  if I was to craft an ordinance tomorrow, I would want three things to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3348.539s">The</a>  first is the health and human safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3351.721s">Obviously,</a>  most people are here tonight because they're concerned about antennas cooking them or giving them cancer and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3359.847s">I</a>  will say on the record that I think people should be very careful about what they read on the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3365.99s">And</a>  I'm not really into fear mongering about technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3370.012s">But</a>  it is every citizen's right to have a record given to them saying that what's outside their house is not going to have any harm to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3381.238s">And</a>  in the industry, there are two RF studies that are used from an RF perspective <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3388.584s">that</a>  Verizon and any other proposing carrier can give to us willingly if we make them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3394.526s">The</a>  first is a shared study interference that is antenna to antenna interference. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3403.308s">That's</a>  seen mostly on cell towers where you have multiple carriers in one spot to make sure that one antenna doesn't knock the other out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3410.23s">And</a>  the second is called a near study. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3412.791s">And</a>  that acronym is NIR, and it stands for Non-Ionizing Radiation Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3418.055s">And</a>  that is exactly what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3421.597s">It's</a>  a study that we can mandate on every installation to say that this is stamped by an engineer who's not necessarily working on the corporate dime, who cares about his license, who will say that this isn't going to harm any humans. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3440.757s">Second</a>  is structural safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3442.737s">You</a>  mentioned this, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3445.438s">I</a>  think that we should require a stamped structural analysis for each site that these small cells are proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3453.4s">I</a>  don't think, I'll be candid, I think that a lot of the utility poles in Medford are in some state of disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3462.062s">And</a>  I think that putting antennas on these that are gonna create extra wind sail and otherwise you have <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3469.249s">the</a>  risk of a few different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3471.25s">Is</a>  the pole going to fall over if there's a windstorm or any type of weather event? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3476.211s">And</a>  are the antennas installed in a way that they're not going to blow off the pole and damage someone's house or property? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3484.013s">And</a>  as a sidebar, I would say we should have a blanket restriction on any installation on the double pole, unless, of course, the proposing carrier wants to replace the double pole with <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3495.248s">A</a>  new Singapore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3497.45s">And</a>  the last is the most important to me, and that's aesthetics. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3501.132s">And</a>  you alluded to this, and we should have conversations about what Medford wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3506.096s">I</a>  spent a little time with the construction guys here last week, and they had, I think, about 12 photographs on a three-sided poster board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3515.834s">I</a>  was disappointed to see only one was a stealth concealment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3520.236s">But</a>  I thought a lot of them looked pretty junky. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3523.177s">And</a>  my fear is that if we don't get ahead of this and tell these proposing carriers what we want, they will assume that we are OK with the cheapest possible installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3535.343s">So</a>  if it's not happening in Lexington, it shouldn't happen in Meadowbrook. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3541.685s">So</a>  we can tell people what we want, and we can demand it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3546.516s">And</a>  as an aside, I would say we should really stay away from blanket moratoriums on technology upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3553.84s">It's</a>  important to have these antennas in places that are going to increase cell coverage, specifically where people don't have landlines anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3561.125s">I</a>  want to be able to get a signal if I need somebody to come to my house and help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3565.528s">So</a>  we should keep those things in mind as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3568.07s">Thanks</a>  for your time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3568.95s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Dubuque]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3578.494s">My</a>  name is Melissa Dubuque. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3579.656s">I</a>  live at 10 Cherry Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3581.057s">I'm</a>  one of the lucky ones that is going to have supposedly one of those things in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3586.202s">My</a>  question is, is paperwork was due yesterday, and does that mean that they're going to start installing the 5G towers, or are we on hold with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3598.135s">Because</a>  my concern is, is where the tower is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3601.898s">is</a>  less than eight feet outside of my daughter's bedroom window. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3605.961s">And</a>  when I talked to one of the guys last week, I think I was talking, he was talking, somebody had asked a question if I was underneath it with the cell phone, would it directly hit the cell phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3615.788s">And</a>  the guy said, nope, it'll just be in an oval, probably only go out eight feet, you know, straight across, so it won't bother anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3623.433s">And</a>  when I asked him, I said, well, that would be my daughter's bedroom window. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3627.096s">He</a>  had no answer for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3629.037s">So</a>  my concern is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3631.181s">last</a>  week was just a nightmare out in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3633.602s">They've</a>  already come and changed the telephone pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3636.063s">So</a>  as I'm viewing it, it looks like it's sort of a go ahead and I've gotten no notification about it being outside of my house, National Grid coming and doing everything that they did last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3647.947s">So</a>  I just want, want to know if there is a date because the paperwork wasn't put in place that these things are going to start showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3656.946s">if</a>  anybody has the answer to that, if there's a way they can stop it or at least postpone putting it in front of my house, because as I said, it's been a nightmare.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3665.668s">I</a>  personally have not been notified by any city department telling us, you know, as far as the timeline is, when things will be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3672.17s">I'm</a>  not sure, Councilor Marks, have you been? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3674.15s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3676.731s">Yep,</a>  one minute please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3680.575s">Every</a>  petition comes with a start date. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3683.896s">So</a>  the date commences when the 60 day period starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3688.637s">So</a>  the first batch, and I'm not sure how many were in the first batch, the date that we had as a city was December 20th to act upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3698.038s">Verizon</a>  came back because the city did not act and said, okay, we'll give you another 30 days, which brought it to January 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3707.051s">Now,</a>  I'm under the impression they still need approval from the city of town, from this ad hoc committee that was created by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3717.136s">And</a>  when that's gonna happen, we can ask the city engineer who happens to chair that committee what his thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3725.181s">But</a>  as far as I know, it doesn't just automatically get approved.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3729.503s">Okay,</a>  because the poll is still... Excuse me, if you have any questions, I just ask you to please come up to the microphone just so everyone can hear and so people at home can hear as well.</p>

    <p>[Devine]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3741.428s">So</a>  from my reading, the carriers had initially wanted part there to be a deemed approved clause in the FCC regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3753.926s">and</a>  the FCC declined to include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3757.288s">So</a>  I have, and I can send it to you, a two-page synopsis put out by a congressional advisory board instructing Congress how to think about this regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3773.916s">So</a>  nothing automatically happens when the timeline has not been met, if anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3781.063s">if</a>  I was reading it correctly, they said that Verizon would have to come sue Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3787.166s">So</a>  that's part of what I think your legal due diligence needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3793.689s">So</a>  what's happening in other communities when they are or are not deciding this on time, but it is not an automatic installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3803.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Dubuque]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3806.696s">Because</a>  the pole like they have they still have the half of the old pole Attached to the new pole by a piece of wood with all of National Grid with all of their wires So I don't know how long that's gonna be like that either and it's really not too safe So I'm just kind of I just don't want to come home again and run into the same nightmare that I won't get into again.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3828.817s">So</a>  Point of information council on night</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3833.456s">How</a>  are you?</p>

    <p>[Dubuque]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3833.956s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3834.137s">How</a>  are you?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3834.577s">Good</a>  to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3835.838s">I</a>  spoke with you the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3837.199s">I</a>  spoke with your husband as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3839.401s">Relative</a>  to the debris that was left on the front lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3841.863s">And</a>  I left the city engineer's office on Wednesday evening with the assurances that there was going to be someone down there to clean it up.</p>

    <p>[RhUNhYl62Oo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3847.128s">It</a>  was.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3847.608s">It</a>  was cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3848.389s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3849.109s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3849.41s">And</a>  it's my understanding that the pole was installed by National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3852.952s">At</a>  that point in time, but they're installing it for future work So this the grid actually put the pole in right the work that's gonna happen is gonna be Verizon But I didn't want to follow up with that to make sure that that happened because when I spoke with your husband last They might have came out a little later in the day than earlier than he expected So that was just my concern I just didn't want to come home and have this I</p>

    <p>[Dubuque]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3875.808s">on</a>  top of a telephone pole without any, so I'm just glad and thank you everybody, so I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3882.694s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ducey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3886.097s">This</a>  is Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3889.44s">I</a>  have some information about this pole business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3892.262s">I</a>  had attended the November meeting that was at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3897.543s">Two</a>  weeks later, a contractor came to replace the pole two doors down from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3905.925s">That's</a>  one of the poles where the 5G was going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3909.225s">So</a>  I asked him what he was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3911.906s">He</a>  said he didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3912.446s">He</a>  was the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3914.286s">OK,</a>  there was a second pole further up the street that was going to be another 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3918.607s">And</a>  they replaced that pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3920.248s">The</a>  only two poles on the street that were replaced were the 5G poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3924.728s">And</a>  the new poles were taller. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3927.829s">So</a>  I called City Hall and they said that the poles belong to National Grid or whatever and they can replace the pole for any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3936.133s">That's</a>  maybe true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3937.974s">However,</a>  the poles were brand new. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3940.595s">No,</a>  nothing wrong with the poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3942.276s">The</a>  only change was that the new pole was taller. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3945.018s">There's</a>  still, as that lady said, the half pole, the two poles are attached to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3949.78s">The</a>  old poles cut off at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3952.801s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3954.022s">My</a>  concern at the time was, when I spoke to City Hall, I said, Verizon is coming here doing advanced work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3960.566s">They</a>  haven't even got the permit yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3962.107s">They're</a>  replacing the poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3964.189s">And</a>  he says, oh, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3965.089s">I</a>  said, well, how come the only two poles on the whole street in front of number 10 and in front of number 90 are the two poles that are being replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3972.894s">So</a>  Verizon was doing some advanced work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3975.836s">I</a>  don't know if they hired the contractor or National Grid or however it worked, but there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3981.4s">Okay,</a>  the second thing I want to call to your attention, I also came to the meeting last week here, the informational meeting, and I asked Verizon, there was a table in the middle here, and I asked the man there, I said, tell me what the pros and the cons are about this 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=3999.128s">He</a>  told me all about the pros, but on his table he had a whole packet of information here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4005.731s">And</a>  the last two handouts were the cons, which he didn't verbally <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4011.69s">talk</a>  about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4013.551s">When</a>  I got home, I read all this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4015.472s">So</a>  Verizon is well aware that there are cons to this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4019.954s">But</a>  they're not making it public. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4021.715s">I</a>  did talk to the table that was over here, the man that had the supposed to be the health hazards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4026.638s">He</a>  mentioned something about the high frequency radio signals may harm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4032.441s">But</a>  that's about the only thing he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4035.042s">So</a>  I have this packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4036.803s">I</a>  don't know if you picked this up, Michael, when you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4038.904s">Did</a>  you pick up the whole packet? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4040.805s">Well,</a>  I have a second packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4041.845s">You</a>  can have it just in case you missed the cons here and all the pros or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4047.407s">So</a>  there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4048.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4049.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edmonds]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4054.35s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4055.49s">My</a>  name is Donna Edmonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4056.51s">I</a>  live on Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4057.911s">And</a>  one of my concerns is the speed at which Verizon is going ahead with this because in November, every single, no less than five locations that were cited for the 5G <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4070.319s">Verizon</a>  came, they laid new cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4073.64s">One</a>  of my neighbors went and asked them, chatted them up friendly, saying, oh, what's this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4077.961s">And</a>  he said, we're laying the cable for 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4080.301s">So</a>  I notified Brianna, and she got in touch with Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4084.663s">And</a>  they said, no, no, Verizon does work all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4088.784s">But</a>  it was at the exact addresses where the 5G is going to be five places that I personally saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4096.724s">And</a>  so obviously, they're just, as soon as they get it, they're planning on getting approval and putting them in immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4103.507s">So</a>  I just wanted you to be aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4107.028s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4108.349s">I</a>  took pictures of them doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4113.831s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4114.231s">I</a>  just find it very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4115.712s">I</a>  find it concerning the number of 5G equipment that they're planning to put right close to my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4124.255s">My</a>  mother's 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4126.246s">I</a>  do believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4127.927s">I</a>  mean, it's questionable whether or not it will cause problems, but I believe that my mom would be susceptible to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4134.47s">So</a>  I just feel like it could happen anytime because they've already done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4140.934s">They</a>  did have a one thing I wanted to ask is they had a police detail at each of these locations and do they have to have, do they have to say what it's for? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4149.958s">Do</a>  they have to have a permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4151.299s">Like</a>  why were the police there assisting them? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4154.755s">That</a>  is something that I would like to know the answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4157.877s">And</a>  then lastly, I just want to thank everybody because this has been very helpful and I'm just very heartened to see it being approached so sensibly and intelligently.</p>

    <p>[Nagum]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4185.836s">Anita</a>  Nagum, 9 Norton Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4189.057s">I</a>  have a lot of concerns with the process that Verizon is following or not following. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4195.8s">I</a>  attended the permit hearing which was scheduled in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4200.861s">That</a>  meeting was canceled before it started because at the last minute Tim McGivern, the city engineer, got some advice from Mark Rumley that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4211.072s">The</a>  notification that Verizon sent out was deemed inadequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4215.395s">Those</a>  vague letters, not signed, not addressed, with no location specified for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4221.238s">It</a>  just said that a small cell facility will be placed on or near the right of way near your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4228.183s">It's</a>  interesting that Verizon has contacted the city and told you you're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4235.807s">I</a>  would definitely recommend that you get in touch with the city solicitor, and I would <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4241.274s">I'm</a>  not a legal expert, but I would push back against Verizon and tell them that they were not in compliance with the city regulations as far as notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4253.543s">And</a>  also, I mean, I highly recommend either the city solicitor or outside legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4260.287s">The</a>  FCC put into place some regulations that are very restrictive about what communities can do to restrict 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4269.645s">A</a>  portion of those regulations was struck down in August by the D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4275.271s">Court</a>  of Appeals regarding, I believe, effect on historic and environmental, because of historic <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4293.374s">Environmental</a>  concerns or historic preservation in local communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4300.796s">I'm</a>  sure that's going to be appealed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4302.696s">There's</a>  also another portion of that FCC rule, which is up in front of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which I believe is in San Francisco. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4313.938s">That</a>  is still pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4315.639s">But</a>  I would highly recommend that the city solicitor, someone who knows a lot more about it than I do, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4321.989s">look</a>  into these things and see what is going on, what exactly the legal issues are in these cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4330.553s">I</a>  do have a little bit of information which I can email you with more information, certainly on the opinion that was released in August, striking down a portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4343.32s">Again,</a>  I'm sure these things are going to be appealed and this will go on, but I highly recommend the city push back against Verizon because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4350.882s">their</a>  notification was adequate at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4353.764s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4358.928s">Hi</a>  there, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4364.732s">At</a>  first when I heard about this issue, I thought that I heard there was no scientific evidence that this technology was dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4375.785s">I</a>  looked it up on the internet, and it looks like there is some level of debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4379.97s">But</a>  there is one concern I wanted to address, and that is there's some suspicion that the fact that it's near your home means that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4388.536s">That</a>  comes across as strange to some folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4391.519s">I</a>  just wanted to talk a little bit about that because when you have a shorter wavelength, also a higher frequency, that's going to lead to more attenuation over the same amount of distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4405.355s">And</a>  just to give you an example, you guys, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4407.597s">might</a>  be familiar with over the course of your lifetime, or our grandparents' lifetime, of different signals we've used. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4416.002s">You</a>  might have heard of the VLF transmitter in Cutler, Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4419.704s">This</a>  is a massive antenna, and they use this to transmit all around the world to submarines, and it can transmit only one letter at a time, Morse code kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4431.752s">And</a>  you guys might be familiar with shortwave radios, which... <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4439.102s">Also</a>  have a fairly long wavelength and so those transmit a great distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4448.106s">They</a>  reflect off the ionosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4451.068s">And</a>  you might be familiar with AM and FM technologies and how the AM signals we're used to hearing are pretty lousy but go a pretty far distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4461.033s">FM</a>  go a shorter distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4463.634s">You</a>  might think about how if your neighbor is playing <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4466.471s">a</a>  tuba, you're not gonna be able to drown out that sound easily by just putting on headphones, whereas if they're playing a flute, it's gonna be a lot easier because of the higher pitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4475.236s">And</a>  so I just wanted to sort of explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4477.697s">I</a>  might have gotten a bit wrong with the short wave, now that I think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4480.399s">That</a>  might be specific to the ionosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4484.281s">Also,</a>  when there's an earthquake, there are two different kinds of waves that propagate throughout the world, and the ones with the shorter <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4494.363s">The</a>  higher frequency, meaning shorter wavelength, those are unable to go through the molten core of the Earth, whereas the others can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4503.567s">So</a>  I did want to address that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4505.408s">I</a>  think that that is, it seems scary because it's near your house, but the fact is, I believe the way that works is if you have a short wavelength, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4514.335s">just</a>  a little bit of destructive interference, it's gonna erase the wave, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4518.96s">Whereas</a>  if you have a big wavelength and it gets out of whack a little, you're still gonna be able to see the signal, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4526.288s">Sort</a>  of like that, whereas here it just covers itself up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4529.712s">I</a>  think that's more or less how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4531.394s">I</a>  tried to research on my phone just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4533.296s">I</a>  wasn't able to get anything perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4539.184s">I</a>  got a signal, but to be honest with you, a lot of people on there, they write the same thing over. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4544.966s">How</a>  does it work? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4545.666s">Higher</a>  frequency, but doesn't go as far, but it never says why. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4548.267s">I'm</a>  pretty sure that's how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4550.247s">I'm</a>  pretty sure if you have low wavelength, you get a little bit of interference with itself, boom, it's gone, whereas if it's bigger wavelength, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4559.33s">If</a>  it goes off a little, you still have basically a signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4562.411s">That's</a>  a very weird diagram, but that's what I came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4567.728s">So</a>  that's my understanding of that, and that's why I'm not scared of the distance to my house, because I understand that's more or less the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4575.812s">And</a>  I also wanted to say that there are some benefits to having a second internet provider in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4581.975s">If</a>  you're stuck with Comcast or I have Verizon Fios, which is actually not that bad, but I prefer choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4587.578s">People</a>  do get upset with having to pay the monopoly internet companies, and this is one way to avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4594.102s">I</a>  have seen on the computer or on my phone that there may be some debate that there could be health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4605.552s">I</a>  don't suspect that there are, but I respect if people do have that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4609.475s">But</a>  I do want to see that it's not just us versus the corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4613.799s">If</a>  this gets approved, there will be some benefits to the people of Bedford too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4617.922s">It</a>  won't all go to the corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4621.585s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Devine]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4626.394s">I'll</a>  just add this little tidbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4629.516s">And</a>  again, I'm gonna dig it out of my information and send it to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4632.859s">But</a>  apparently, somebody came across a Verizon internal memo where their lawyer said in very oblique language that if it is proven that there are adverse health effects to 5G transmission, they do not have the health coverage <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4656.329s">in</a>  place for their own Verizon workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4660.533s">So</a>  to me that indicates that Verizon has concern about this technology.</p>

    <p>[Ginnity]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4672.759s">Hi,</a>  my name is Eileen Ginnity, I live on Governor's Ave in Medford, and I just want to, first of all, thank Councilor Marks for researching and presenting this so thoroughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4683.747s">My</a>  main concern prior to the meeting tonight was just, gee, could we have a more formal way other than, I think they were calling it an informational fair, Verizon called last week's meeting an informational fair, when you went from table to table, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4698.957s">So</a>  sort of that kind of thing, you kind of miss, you know, hits and misses in terms of what you pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4704.507s">But</a>  just hearing the overall presentation from Councilor Marks about <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4708.598s">the</a>  whole issue of local ordinances, FCC approval process, dates and deadlines, it's all really important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4715.681s">So</a>  I appreciate that and I would very much support that however all those things and the research and the work and the legal, whatever, go together and fit together that whenever it's appropriate to do some sort of public hearing that that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4730.387s">A</a>  lot of people were probably here last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4733.348s">You</a>  know, they had a few tables, one is the benefits of small cell technology, one is construction, one is site architecture and engineering, and then the three sites they had highlighted where they wanted to do location, Tufts, South Medford, and Glenwood neighborhoods, and then the whole RF safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4751.637s">I</a>  didn't really even have time to get to the safety table, and I think that, so sort of, as people have talked, some kind of renewed public hearing that really is <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4761.55s">chock</a>  full of information and it would be real helpful to have as part of that someone representing the, in the public hearing, someone representing the small cell ad hoc subcommittee so we can just understand better about who those people are and how the process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4776.383s">And</a>  hopefully it sounds like the date of yesterday having been the second deadline passed now that there is not sort of an automatic go ahead for Verizon from what people are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4786.752s">So</a>  that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4787.653s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4788.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nazaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4797.675s">Mr.</a>  President city councilors my name is Joseph Nazaro and I have a host that it 98 Princeton Street in which my daughter lives I've moved to Winchester so I'm from one Dunham Street in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4813.728s">I</a>  was at the information meeting last week, and I'm sorry, ma'am, but you got my flyers that are discussing the adverse health effects of 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4822.713s">Make</a>  no question of it, 5G's deadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4827.856s">It's</a>  very, very harmful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4830.318s">The</a>  American military have used microwave radiation since the 1970s. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4836.962s">All</a>  of their reports indicate that it's deadly, and the federal government adopted military standards so that the military would be effective during the Cold War. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4849.107s">The</a>  telecom companies wanted those exact same standards, and those were the standards that were adopted, the military standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4857.774s">The</a>  United States and Canada currently have radiation standards that are 100 times those of the European Union. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4866.141s">And</a>  those are the standards that Verizon wishes to install here in Medford and in Winchester and over the entire United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4874.408s">I</a>  was at the information meeting here last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4877.887s">I</a>  was quite insulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4879.648s">I</a>  thought it was misleading and deceptive, and it was just, to me, I was embarrassed for the Verizon people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4890.377s">The</a>  information just was outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4895.221s">It's</a>  a boondoggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4898.304s">We</a>  all are very, very well served with copper wire and fiber optic cable, and they just want to install <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4906.152s">wireless</a>  for profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4908.173s">They</a>  want us to dump fiber optic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4910.094s">They</a>  want us to dump copper so that they can charge us whatever they like because it's not regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4917.318s">Copper</a>  and fiber optic is regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4921.36s">So</a>  what they're trying to tell us with 5G is we can disconnect our cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4926.462s">Well,</a>  we don't want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4928.023s">It's</a>  slower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4930.104s">The</a>  5G will be slower. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4932.425s">It</a>  will be less secure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4934.568s">They</a>  can pry on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4937.17s">It's</a>  actually a threat to the electric industry because they're going into the electric industry's wavelength, and it's an energy hog. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4945.957s">It</a>  will create more global warming because it's very expensive to run 5G as opposed to the fiber optic cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4957.315s">There</a>  has been a bill filed over three years ago to study the deleterious health effects of 5G in cell phone radiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4965.962s">It's</a>  been in the state legislature for over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4969.445s">It's</a>  H2885. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4971.887s">It's</a>  currently stuck in the telecom communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4974.61s">I</a>  have these handouts for the select people, if they would, including H2885. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4984.853s">It's</a>  in Mike Barrett of Lexington, Senator Mike Barrett of Lexington's Telecom Committee, where it has to be favorably passed, it has to move to Ways and Means by February 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=4999.147s">So</a>  everyone should call the Telecom Committee to get favorable action on this bill so it gets financed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5007.495s">There</a>  are no studies that show that 5G is healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5012.14s">All</a>  the studies do show that microwave radiation causes atrial fibrillation and other heart conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5022.236s">It</a>  causes arrhythmias. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5024.838s">It</a>  causes blood diseases. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5027.119s">It</a>  causes psychological problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5029.26s">It's</a>  the only thing that's known, that's not known, but causes autism in children. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5035.504s">It</a>  causes learning difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5038.546s">There's</a>  just loads of data and research on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5044.93s">Once</a>  it's installed, it's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5046.951s">Once</a>  they install these antennas in town, once they turn them on, the game's over for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5052.128s">There's</a>  no turning the clock back with the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5055.829s">I</a>  was the president of For a Cleaner Environment in Woburn during the time of the Harvard Health Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5061.95s">There</a>  were 21 kids with childhood leukemia in Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5065.651s">There</a>  were three more in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5067.312s">10</a>  of them died. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5069.953s">We</a>  called our federal senators and representatives, and Kennedy helped us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5076.814s">By</a>  the way, he died of a brain tumor caused by a cell phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5082.253s">We</a>  called our state agencies that are meant to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5087.518s">The</a>  Department of Public Health came and told us that the water was safe to drink. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5092.93s">The</a>  city council didn't protect the people of Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5096.332s">The</a>  last line of defense in this game is the city council here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5100.855s">I</a>  have called Kennedy, I mean, I've called Warren, I've called Markey, I've called my state senator, I've called my state rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5110.26s">None</a>  of them will return a call on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5113.362s">You</a>  people are the last line of defense now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5116.606s">There's</a>  really no help beyond you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5118.549s">And</a>  I do laud the work that you've done and the consideration you're giving, trying to hold up Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5125.097s">And</a>  I don't think that's going to be an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5129.062s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5129.863s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Von Berg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5139.807s">Hi,</a>  I'm Eric Von Berg, 369 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5145.469s">I</a>  really appreciate all the work that you've done on the council for this and also all the comments from the people here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5155.673s">I</a>  think that we really need to focus on the fact that the disease potential, the health potentials for this are unanswered at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5170.769s">And</a>  I want to read a few paragraphs from a Scientific American article about 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5179.531s">5G</a>  will not replace 4G. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5181.771s">It</a>  will accompany 4G for the near future and possibly over the long term if there are synergistic effects from simultaneous exposures to multiple types of RFR <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5195.174s">our</a>  overall risk of harm from the RFR may increase substantially. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5200.338s">Cancer</a>  is not the only risk, as there is considerable evidence that RFR causes neurological disorders and reproductive harm, likely due to oxidative stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5212.208s">As</a>  a society, should we invest hundreds of billions of dollars deploying 5G, a cellular technology that requires the installation of 800,000 or more new cell antenna sites in the U.S., close to where we live, work and play? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5229.128s">Instead,</a>  we should support the recommendations of the 250 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and demand that our government fund research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect our health and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5251.959s">And</a>  do we really want <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5256.058s">to</a>  allow these telecom giants to come into our city and install a system that could well be the next health crisis, where our city is not safe for its own residents due to radiation exposure from these towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5271.491s">If</a>  this technology is found to be safe in the future, we can revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5275.934s">But</a>  for now, its safety is completely unproven. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5279.858s">And</a>  I think that we need to stop it in any way that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5284.021s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Aire-Beckwith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5298.092s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5299.713s">Jane</a>  Eyre Beckwith, 9 Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5303.356s">I</a>  just want you all to know, how fast is fast enough?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5310.241s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5310.581s">Okay,</a>  so there are a number of resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5314.664s">So</a>  we have the main resolution, and then Councilor Marks offered three other resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5318.747s">So</a>  we will take them individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5320.688s">I</a>  actually want to let the board know that the overall strategy that you want</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5328.766s">Do</a>  you prefer separate votes on these? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5330.227s">I</a>  prefer separate just in case they all get sent, and then they all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5334.85s">Different</a>  directions.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5335.71s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5337.892s">Yes,</a>  so there'll be D, C, and B papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5340.413s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5340.593s">So</a>  we take them individually.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5341.854s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm not sure if I've asked already, but I would request that this council have a public hearing, and invite a state delegation, the mayor of the city of Medford, the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5359.249s">Verizon,</a>  our city solicitor, and Congresswoman Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5367.872s">At</a>  a public hearing here, Mr. President, at the earliest that you can call for that and get all the parties together to discuss 5G.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5377.816s">So</a>  what we'll do is we'll make that an amendment to the main resolution, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5381.017s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5381.817s">So</a>  the first paper we'll take up will be the D paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5388.178s">And</a>  Councilman Marks, can you please, because the clerk does not have the language, can you please read the D paper, which would be the last resolution that you offer?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5398.624s">The</a>  last one? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5399.585s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5400.045s">So</a>  the last one was that the state delegation proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House urging Congress to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5413.925s">the</a>  Telecommunication Act of 1996 to account for health effects.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5423.57s">On</a>  that motion, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5428.152s">Roll</a>  call vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5429.292s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5431.934s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, could you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5433.554s">On</a>  the D paper.</p>
