36
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:37,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

37
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:38,322

38
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,066

39
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:52,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Max are you here?

40
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:53,287
[SPEAKER_07]: There you are.

41
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:54,788
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come up to the rails.

42
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

43
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:13,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight we are here to congratulate Max Stephens for being part of a team that won the

44
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,331
[SPEAKER_07]: gold medal for hockey in the Deaf Olympics that were held in Italy this past December.

45
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:31,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Max, for those of you who don't know, was only 17 years old and he participated on a team that had teammates 25 to 35 years old, which is somewhere 10 years older than Max.

46
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Max played an integral part in this team.

47
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I think his dad told me he got a couple of goals and he had a pretty good season.

48
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:51,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Max has overcome his disability, for those of you who don't know, and this has come over the years.

49
00:04:51,656 --> 00:05:03,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I've known him since he was a little boy, but he's overcome this with a lot of hard work and dedication, and we're seeing the fruits of what's happened for the fine things that he's done.

50
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:12,380
[SPEAKER_07]: When someone looks at the word disability, it immediately conjures up the idea of what someone could not do, or something physically wrong,

51
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:17,289
[SPEAKER_07]: with that injury that prevents them from doing something as the majority of society can do.

52
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:25,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Max has proved everyone wrong, and being here tonight with his family and the gold medal is a tribute to his hard work and dedication.

53
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:34,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Max, people will always remember your name, but your success today tells a story of your indomitable courage and your inspiration for others to follow.

54
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Be the same forever and add many more feathers of success to your crown.

55
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to you and your family,

56
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,056
[SPEAKER_07]: as you have done yourself, your family, and the city of Medford proud.

57
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to congratulate you tonight.

58
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:12,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And before I present you with the citation, I think some of our colleagues may have some words to congratulate you.

59
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:14,396
[SPEAKER_07]: President Falco.

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be on.

61
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:21,203
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

62
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:31,693
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

63
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,635
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I doing wrong here?

64
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:35,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Should be on, no?

65
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:50,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, here we go, here we go.

66
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:50,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Who brought the smart kit?

67
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:51,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

68
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed?

69
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:08,343
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

70
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:09,363
[SPEAKER_10]: President Falco.

71
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:10,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

72
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:11,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

73
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Max, I just want to say congratulations.

74
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:14,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Great job.

75
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear a lot about you.

76
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,750
[SPEAKER_10]: My son goes to school with you at Medford High School.

77
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And he always says how you're a great guy.

78
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:24,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to say congratulations.

79
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:25,395
[SPEAKER_10]: That's quite an accomplishment.

80
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:28,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's remarkable.

81
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:31,820
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's great to see you've overcome so much.

82
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say congratulations.

83
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:35,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job.

84
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:35,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

85
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:35,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

86
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:41,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

87
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:43,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And Max, it was a pleasure meeting you earlier this evening.

88
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:51,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known your uncle and your dad now for a number of years, and I just want to let you know how proud we are as citizens of the city of Medford.

89
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:55,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about the accomplishment that you and your teammates were able to achieve.

90
00:07:55,397 --> 00:08:03,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only do you represent Medford, Massachusetts, you represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and you represent the United States of America, and you came back with a gold medal.

91
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something you should really be proud of.

92
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication.

93
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,605
[SPEAKER_05]: making this possible and bringing home the gold to the old 02155.

94
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for your work on this and congratulations.

95
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:14,907
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great accomplishment.

96
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be very proud of your goals.

97
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:17,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

98
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:18,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

99
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:19,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Baez.

100
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:30,412
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to second what everyone said and also just add that as a Mustang, as a graduate of Medford High School, it's just great that you made the school and the city so proud.

101
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:34,914
[SPEAKER_24]: And I hope we'll be able to congratulate you for something else again.

102
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:35,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

103
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:39,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

104
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank you, Max.

106
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:43,935
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it two goals?

107
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:44,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-hmm.

108
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Max, where is the gold?

109
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,136
[SPEAKER_19]: In my pocket.

110
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:48,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here.

111
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:53,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here.

112
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:53,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Doctor, we didn't believe you.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,921
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to wear that proudly around your neck.

114
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

115
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,523
[SPEAKER_16]: If I had one of those, I would never take it off.

116
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:00,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Believe me.

117
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:08,639
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to thank you personally for representing our city so well.

118
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,460
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wish you well in your future endeavors.

119
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can tell you there's a local sports team, the Boston Bruins, that can use a goal scorer.

120
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:19,842
[SPEAKER_16]: So don't stop here.

121
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:20,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep moving forward.

122
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:21,502
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the goal.

123
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

124
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:22,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

125
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:26,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

126
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

127
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:33,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to echo my colleagues and congratulate you on this really impressive athletic feat.

128
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:38,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a proud moment for Medford and I look forward to seeing many more great things from you in the future.

129
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:38,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

130
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:48,481
[SPEAKER_17]: So as a coach for 32 years at the high school level, you really try to find inspirations for kids to follow.

131
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,702
[SPEAKER_17]: You, sir, are a true inspiration.

132
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:57,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So this city is proud of you, Mustang Country's proud of you, and I wanna congratulate you on a job well done, so thank you.

133
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

134
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:58,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice job.

135
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

136
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:09,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we present dollars, we have Dan Hurley is in the house here tonight, and Dan has a citation for you from the State House.

137
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, if you'd like to present it to him.

138
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,595
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

139
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:16,317
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll have to echo what everyone here had to say.

140
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:21,702
[SPEAKER_25]: It's certainly an honor that we have a man from Medford on that hockey team.

141
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,704
[SPEAKER_25]: He had competition to get on the team from the state.

142
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:27,687
[SPEAKER_25]: He's the only one from Medford, the only one from the state of Massachusetts.

143
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:31,290
[SPEAKER_25]: And they went over there to Italy, and they put on quite a show.

144
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,252
[SPEAKER_25]: They won, brought back the gold.

145
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:39,978
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know much about hockey, but I do know that I used to hear noise in my house because I lived two doors from

146
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,698
[SPEAKER_25]: Max, and I hear bang, bang, bang.

147
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:47,579
[SPEAKER_25]: And I said to my wife one day, I said, Sharon, what is that noise?

148
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,520
[SPEAKER_25]: And she said, that's Max up there practicing his hockey.

149
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,342
[SPEAKER_25]: When he was seven and eight and nine years old, early in the morning, late at night, I'd see him going out.

150
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:59,864
[SPEAKER_25]: So it took a lot to spend the three weeks in Italy.

151
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,485
[SPEAKER_25]: He's doing well in school, so they gave him the permission.

152
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:07,247
[SPEAKER_25]: And we all know, especially George knows, he's been involved with numerous programs.

153
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Adam's now starting his hockey career as a coach.

154
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:16,571
[SPEAKER_25]: Not in hockey, but a couple of other sports, and I know Michael's done a lot with his son, too, in this stuff.

155
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:20,873
[SPEAKER_25]: This guy with his three children, and you with your son, and you're a hockey player.

156
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,733
[SPEAKER_25]: He was at Tufts University as a hockey player.

157
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,014
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Matt, indeed, it's a pleasure.

158
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:29,456
[SPEAKER_25]: But I wanted to present this to Matt from State Representative Paul Donato of Medford,

159
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Paul asked me to present this, he's unable to be with us today.

160
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:51,184
[SPEAKER_25]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts House of Representatives, be it hereby known to all that the Massachusetts House of Representatives offers its sincerest congratulations to Matt Stephens in recognition of being the only representative from Massachusetts in the 2019

178
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:38,608

182
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:48,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

183

[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of council night second of my council appears to take a brief recess to take a few pictures with the With max all those in favor all those opposed.

[SPEAKER_10]: We're now recess.

185
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:26,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I

186
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,179
[SPEAKER_11]: We will now reconvene the meeting.

187
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,521
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to revert to the regular order of business.

188
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,301
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

189
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:21,582
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

190
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:22,502
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

191
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

192
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:29,184
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-033 offered by Councilor Marks.

193
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:34,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the issue of Verizon 5G installations be discussed.

194
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:38,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

195
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

196
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:55,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week, Mr. President, there was a meeting held here at City Hall regarding the 5G network and potential installation in this community by Verizon.

197
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:03,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon has petitioned the city for, from my understanding, at least

198
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:11,522
[SPEAKER_16]: three to four dozen locations within the community to add these small cell networks.

199
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:28,353
[SPEAKER_16]: throughout the community, and we received a letter which I've already read into the record several weeks back from Verizon, dated December 10th, 2019, to then-Mayor Stephanie Burke regarding their applications.

200
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:36,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And I won't read the whole letter, but more or less the letter is stating that method is in current violation.

201
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:52,265
[SPEAKER_16]: of the FCC rules and regulations which requires the city of Method after 60 days to either approve or deny small cell applications.

202
00:17:54,146 --> 00:18:00,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon went on to say that they would be willing to give us an extension until January 20th.

203
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,812
[SPEAKER_16]: And I am not sure which I will be asking tonight.

204
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,671
[SPEAKER_16]: where the city stands with these current applications.

205
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:16,202
[SPEAKER_16]: But for tonight's purpose, Mr. President, I received a number of phone calls and emails from area residents.

206
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:21,264
[SPEAKER_16]: This has been an issue that I've been on top of for the last several months.

207
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:37,348
[SPEAKER_16]: And many residents who reached out were concerned not only with a number of issues related to 5G, but also the potential health impact it could have on residents in this community.

208
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So tonight, Mr. President, I will be offering a motion tonight.

209
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:48,132
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would like to go through, which was provided to me by a number of residents.

210
00:18:49,313 --> 00:19:01,536
[SPEAKER_16]: One being Jay Ritchie, who I think is in the audience here, Mr. President, provided this council along with the mayor with an abundance of information regarding health impacts,

211
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:17,706
[SPEAKER_16]: ordinances in other cities and towns throughout the United States, and also actions taken by local legislatures throughout the United States as well.

212
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:30,874
[SPEAKER_16]: But, Mr. President, local ordinances note various purposes for ordinances, such as preserving visual character, protecting environmental resources,

213
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,002
[SPEAKER_16]: and protecting residents against adverse health effects.

214
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:50,511
[SPEAKER_16]: They take a variety of approaches, such as prohibiting small cells in certain areas, creating application and recertification fees, and imposing aesthetic and administrative requirements.

215
00:19:51,966 --> 00:20:09,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Under location ordinance suggestions, Mr. President, and what I'm hoping to do tonight is just to start the dialogue because the mayor, in her wisdom, Mayor Burke, when we were approached with these requests originally, there was no city ordinance that governed these.

216
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:15,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the mayor did a tremendous job at the time for what resources that she had.

217
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:27,406
[SPEAKER_16]: She created an administrative policy that would govern the approach to applying for an application and how the city would handle it.

218
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:37,613
[SPEAKER_16]: And also the creation of what the city refers to as the method ad hoc small cell committee, which is the granting authority.

219
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:49,174
[SPEAKER_16]: and they may have put together a several page policy, but in my opinion, it was good for the time that it was presented, but it doesn't go far enough.

220
00:20:49,976 --> 00:21:00,598
[SPEAKER_16]: to add the protections that we need as a community and to have a full-fledged ordinance because Verizon is going to be the first of many vendors that will be before us.

221
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:02,539
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can count on that.

222
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:07,300
[SPEAKER_16]: So getting back to the local ordinances, location suggestions.

223
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Prohibiting small cell installations in residential areas.

224
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:19,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Requiring installations to be certain distance away from residences, schools, hospitals,

225
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Specifying that installations must be relocated when they would interfere with public projects.

226
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Aesthetics and environment ordinances.

227
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:32,153
[SPEAKER_16]: These are just a suggestion.

228
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:39,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Aesthetic design, noise requirements such as co-location, camouflage, height, and light limits.

229
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:43,636
[SPEAKER_16]: The administrative legal suggestions for ordinances.

230
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:49,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Requiring that residents who will be within a certain distance of an installation be notified.

231
00:21:50,496 --> 00:22:13,304
[SPEAKER_16]: instating automatic time limits for permits, requiring annual recertification fees, requiring permittees to defend and indemnify the city for many liabilities arising from permits in the installation, operation, and maintenance of small cell installations, reserving the right to hire independent consultants at the applicant's expense.

232
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:29,679
[SPEAKER_16]: What was presented to us, Mr. President, and there were several states, but the state of New Hampshire has proposed a bill which would establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology.

233
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:44,964
[SPEAKER_16]: The state of Montana has proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives urging Congress to amend 1996 Telecommunications Act to account for health effects.

234
00:22:46,377 --> 00:23:04,193
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are two proposals, Mr. President, that I will be offering tonight that we ask our state delegation submit on behalf of the city of Meffitt and on behalf of the Commonwealth, because we're not the only city in the Commonwealth that's struggling with this issue.

235
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:13,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, as we all know, this is an FCC regulation, and in my opinion, they really do tie the hands of local government to act.

236
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:21,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And one thing we can act upon is creating an ordinance that will safeguard our residents and also re-insure that

237
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:47,813
[SPEAKER_16]: When these installations if and when they do get approved that all the measures are in place mr. President that safeguards our residents So that will be what I'm offering tonight One resolution, I would like to offer now mr. President is be it resolved that the method City Council approve a resolution asking state lawmakers the Federal Communications Commission

238
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:56,231
[SPEAKER_16]: in Congress to limit 5G technology deployment in Massachusetts until the health effects are fully understood.

239
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:14,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't speak for my colleagues, but I can say, Mr. President, many residents that I spoke to, no one's against

240
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,376
[SPEAKER_16]: new technology.

241
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,598
[SPEAKER_16]: No one's against advancements in technology.

242
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:30,285
[SPEAKER_16]: No one's against having our residents not have the technology that would enable them to use their devices and all sorts of angles and aspects and so forth.

243
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:35,389
[SPEAKER_16]: But what we are against, Mr. President, is moving forward without getting the proper answers.

244
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:52,975
[SPEAKER_16]: I have asked several times, I was here at the meeting that Verizon held, and Verizon will be the first to come out and say there are no health concerns that they are aware of.

245
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:56,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got that from every representative.

246
00:24:56,658 --> 00:25:01,241
[SPEAKER_16]: However, when you go on the internet, you'll see experts saying there are concerns.

247
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:10,703
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is no different than a trial when you have two experts, they may be physicians or accountants, say two completely different things.

248
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:15,786
[SPEAKER_16]: And on behalf of our residents, Mr. President, we should proceed with caution.

249
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:25,032
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that caution is that we take a while to explore this issue and make sure that it's safe, these devices are going to be within 200, 300 feet of residents' homes.

250
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:33,912
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to be in backyards where kids are playing, close to parks, close to schoolyards, close to churches.

251
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:41,256
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to make sure that we do our due diligence, Mr. President, when it comes to creating the ordinance.

252
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:50,943
[SPEAKER_16]: The second thing, Mr. President, I'd like to bring up is I happen to have bumped into recently a former member of the Burlington Selectmen.

253
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:58,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And the town of Burlington, I would tell anyone interested in this subject, they should really go on their website.

254
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:07,056
[SPEAKER_16]: They have an application process, Mr. President, that is literally probably 10 pages long.

255
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:18,439
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a very in-depth process that makes these particular vendors jump through many hurdles in order to proceed.

256
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:27,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And from what I've been told by the town of Burlington is there was enough hurdles that they got tired jumping over hurdles.

257
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:45,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And the application process is equally, Mr. President, which I have equally as Cumminson, these design rules and regulations, which is about a 20-page report that was issued by the town of Burlington.

258
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:48,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Very in depth, Mr. President.

259
00:26:48,903 --> 00:27:02,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there was a number of correspondence back and forth from attorneys that were hired to discuss the issue on behalf of the town in Verizon, which I won't get into tonight, Mr. President.

260
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:10,749
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to just briefly mention that some of the things that we should be looking at as a community,

261
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:23,188
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is not unique to Method, but prior to any installation, a structural analysis should be completed to ensure the pole can handle the additional equipment.

262
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:31,116
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be the very first thing either in our policy, which is not there currently, or in our city ordinance.

263
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:35,260
[SPEAKER_16]: The city should ask about a host agreement.

264
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:51,222
[SPEAKER_16]: When we sign on, Mr. President, to anything happen in this community, the first thing that we usually do is sign a host agreement to make sure that if there are any issues that arise from this, that the city of Method will be covered.

265
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:58,065
[SPEAKER_16]: There should be an agreement in place that requires the removal of these systems when obsolete.

266
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:05,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, you can go down any street in our community, Mr. President, and you see dishes

267
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,212
[SPEAKER_16]: They're on the side of homes.

268
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one across the street from me.

269
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:14,895
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a two-family, but they have three dishes that have been disconnected for years.

270
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:25,778
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a blight, an eyesore, and there should be a provision in there when they become obsolete, no longer useful, that they be removed, Mr. President.

271
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:29,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize they're on private property, but I feel strongly about that.

272
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,139
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is no different.

273
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,520
[SPEAKER_16]: These will be located on public property.

274
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:41,431
[SPEAKER_16]: and public right-of-ways, but when they're no longer useful, they should have a plan to remove them.

275
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:54,119
[SPEAKER_16]: The city should establish design rules and regulations that I won't get into, similar to what the town of Burlington did, as well as the application to ensure compliance with city policy.

276
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon should also provide the city with a long-range plan, including future expansion.

277
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,914
[SPEAKER_16]: We should not be subjected to the one and twosies of these, Mr. President.

278
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:19,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Last I spoke to the city engineer, I believe he said there were three or four dozen applications, and there possibly could be upwards to 100 from what he's being told.

279
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:27,031
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe at the very least, as a community, we should know what their intent is.

280
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:28,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the intent to put 100?

281
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:38,957
[SPEAKER_16]: We should know the locations offhand, Mr. President, and we should know if they are the only ones that are gonna be doing this in the community, because in my opinion, they're not gonna be the only ones.

282
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:47,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon should also provide a public health, I'm sorry, public health concerns be addressed by an independent study.

283
00:29:52,469 --> 00:30:17,843
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be, Mr. President, the city requesting, I know Verizon has done their studies on health and the impact and effects of 5G on residents and so forth, but the city should have its own independent study so therefore we can rely on valid information from a neutral party and not someone that's trying to make a dollar.

284
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:19,444
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wish them no

285
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:35,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish them no animosity, Mr. President, but our job as residents of city council is to ensure the public safety of this community.

286
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,092
[SPEAKER_16]: And this truly is a public safety issue.

287
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:52,747
[SPEAKER_16]: The second point, maybe the third point by now, Mr. President, is that several weeks back, the city, actually probably more than several weeks now, the city had its own public hearing.

288
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:57,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was conducted by the ad hoc small cell committee.

289
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:16,134
[SPEAKER_16]: And the correspondence that went out to residents at the time, and I know this has been expanded since, Ashcroft Road, Dutton Circle, Cedar, Lawrence Road, they received a letter from the city that did not really specify the location.

290
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:21,156
[SPEAKER_16]: They received a letter, Mr. President, that wasn't signed.

291
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:27,658
[SPEAKER_16]: They received a letter that called for a public hearing at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

292
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:40,108
[SPEAKER_16]: making no consideration for people working, people with kids, people that need childcare, people that may not be able to get there, Mr. President.

293
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:45,730
[SPEAKER_16]: There was no copy or scope of the project within this letter.

294
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:53,252
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did adhere to the mayor's policy about notification.

295
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:58,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was to notify residents within 300 feet of the installation.

296
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:09,832
[SPEAKER_16]: As we both know, 300 feet would be here to probably the far back of the chamber and maybe a little further outside, Mr. President, in the hall.

297
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,074
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not much notification to a neighborhood.

298
00:32:13,874 --> 00:32:20,298
[SPEAKER_16]: I requested, along with this council, it was unanimous, that we increase the notification to at least 500 feet.

299
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:23,780
[SPEAKER_16]: That was passed unanimously by this council.

300
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:26,422
[SPEAKER_16]: That any other future mailings that go out

301
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:41,221
[SPEAKER_16]: that the specific location be mailed along with a copy of the site plan by Verizon, and that all public hearings take place after 5 p.m.

302
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,766
[SPEAKER_16]: so that we can have more resident involvement.

303
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:51,008
[SPEAKER_16]: That was sent to the city administration back, I think it was a month and a half, two months ago.

304
00:32:51,848 --> 00:33:00,011
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, I am not sure if the mayor, mayor Burke at the time, uh, updated the policy that was under her prerogative.

305
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,372
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why I think we need a city ordinance.

306
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:11,455
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, I look forward, Mr. President, uh, to sending word out to our state delegation in the form of, um,

307
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:17,528
[SPEAKER_16]: If we want to do council resolution, asking that state delegation.

308
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:25,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Bear with me one second.

309
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:36,218
[SPEAKER_16]: The state delegation, our state delegation establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology.

310
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:44,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the second resolution.

311
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:57,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And the third resolution is that our state delegation offer before the House of Representatives and also the State Senate, which would include Senator Jalen, urging Congress to amend the Telecommunication Act 1996, of 1996.

312
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,667
[SPEAKER_16]: To account for health effects.

313
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:19,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So those would be the three resolutions I'd like to offer tonight, Mr. President, as well as you reconvening a meeting so we can start diligently working on our own ordinance to safeguard residents.

314
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:24,529
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say and also residents in the community, Mr. President.

315
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week's meeting, I also thought was going to be a question answer type meeting.

316
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:33,034
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there were a lot of residents that were upset.

317
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:34,015
[SPEAKER_16]: It was more of a

318
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,324
[SPEAKER_16]: just an informational meeting where you can walk around and talk to representatives.

319
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:49,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not sure you're quite going to get that out of tonight's meeting, but I'm hoping after tonight's meeting we will invite Verizon down, we will invite

320
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:53,639
[SPEAKER_16]: the Method Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, who is the granting authority.

321
00:34:53,999 --> 00:35:02,002
[SPEAKER_16]: We will invite the mayor down, Mr. President, and have our own public hearing here so residents can ask Verizon the tough questions.

322
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:07,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council, as well as the mayor, as well as this Ad Hoc Committee, can be on the same page.

323
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:08,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

324
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:15,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

325
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:16,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

326
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, if I'm actually...

327
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hertoghez, do you have the wording for all the resolutions?

328
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:26,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have them written down.

329
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:31,502
[SPEAKER_10]: You second each of the recommendations?

330
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:32,083
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

331
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,724
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion, we'll take individual votes in a minute.

332
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:43,608
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, there are a number of councilors that want to speak on this issue, so I'll recognize them at this point.

333
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:48,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears?

334
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:53,210
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you Mr. President and I want to thank Councilor Marks for such a detailed presentation.

335
00:35:54,471 --> 00:36:01,982
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's incredibly important that massive multinational corporations be accountable to our local governance and not just allowed to run free and do whatever they want.

336
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:04,986
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also agree that.

337
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:11,619
[SPEAKER_24]: This process has been reflective of an issue with the city around notification and making sure that residents are involved and engage the decisions that we're making.

338
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:20,648
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think those changes are welcome and I would also agree with the motions asking our I mean it's ridiculous that the telecommunications act doesn't factor in health.

339
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:21,529
[SPEAKER_24]: That's that's nuts.

340
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,133
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we need that state and federal action as well.

341
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:34,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Just one thing I wanted to bring up and add to the conversation is that the small cell approach to 5G is not the only approach that the large corporations are using.

342
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:40,502
[SPEAKER_24]: AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint are looking at different ways of deploying this technology.

343
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:46,165
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as I'm aware, only Verizon right now is moving ahead with installing small cells as the way that this network would work.

344
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:48,127
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'd really also like to get some

345
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:56,074
[SPEAKER_24]: Clarification about how that deployment might work differently in a policy or an ordinance.

346
00:36:57,295 --> 00:37:01,539
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously the small cells, that's been the focus of discussion because that's what Verizon's bringing in.

347
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:09,585
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's definitely, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint are talking about many fewer antennas that are longer range.

348
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:20,113
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to make sure that any policy that we implement or any research that we bring up factors in different ways that potentially 5G may be deployed by these companies.

349
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:21,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

350
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:23,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

351
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

352
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Mox.

353
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:34,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he gave a very thorough and thoughtful presentation that laid out the issues that are really concerning this community and also presented solutions.

354
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate his passion for the subject of thoughtfulness and the way that he put this together, and I support it wholeheartedly.

355
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

356
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:42,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

357
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:44,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

358
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:44,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I want to

359
00:37:45,373 --> 00:37:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank my council for bringing this up.

360
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:57,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I was here in and out of the meeting last week because we did have our own committee meeting last week, but I was a little dismayed when I came in and saw a bunch of tables.

361
00:37:57,301 --> 00:38:01,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was going to be a question and answer period, and I did talk to a couple of representatives myself.

362
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,510
[SPEAKER_07]: just some minimal answers.

363
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:10,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did do some homework, and I did find what Councilor Baird's found.

364
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other ways of providing this, not just that.

365
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:19,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But if all these other companies are going to be looking at doing this community, why can't they maybe get together?

366
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:26,635
[SPEAKER_07]: and do this jointly rather than piecemeally get with Verizon doing it, AT&T, all these different companies.

367
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:33,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe do it as a joint venture so we're not coming back doing this three or four times.

368
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:39,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe they can do something that they all can jointly share in.

369
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:45,067
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be also a suggestion that I'll bring up when we have our committee meeting.

370
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,429
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I thank my counselor for bringing this up.

371
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:53,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

372
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

373
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

374
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:04,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and doing so much research and also thank the residents for all the research they have done.

375
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:22,065
[SPEAKER_04]: The emails I've received, this is really kind of a deep issue, complicated by the fact that the FCC, beyond the 1996 Telecommunications Act, came down last year and basically removed a lot of the power that local governments have to regulate this kind of thing.

376
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:29,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So the challenge of the one benefit is that almost every city around the country is dealing with this.

377
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:38,573
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a lot to learn from, as Councilor Mark said, people who are successfully developing ordinances to make sure the needs of their communities are being met.

378
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:49,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support those resolutions and I thank Councilor Marks for going even farther than suggesting ordinance work and seeing what we can get from the state delegation because

379
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:51,279
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't just affecting Medford.

380
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:55,683
[SPEAKER_04]: This is affecting the whole state, and we deserve the support at the state level and beyond.

381
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

382
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:00,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Murrell.

383
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:03,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

384
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,548
[SPEAKER_17]: To be redundant, I think it's important.

385
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:08,989
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I thank Council Marks for bringing up such an important issue.

386
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:17,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that the emails and the phone calls I received, I think the frustration goes more in depth than just what we're seeing.

387
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:22,413
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole lack of information, the fear that's still out there that hasn't been answered.

388
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:35,941
[SPEAKER_17]: As we move forward, I wonder if we can put an amendment that we can have the Acton City Solicitor to see if we can extend that period.

389
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:41,264
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that the 20th is the date, I believe, so- Yesterday.

390
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:47,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Yesterday, so if there's a way that we can put a hold, if there's a way that the city can freeze that.

391
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,590
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some issues that if you have,

392
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:59,496
[SPEAKER_17]: some of the members in the audience where other communities have put a stop to this, there's something to be gained by understanding that.

393
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:09,823
[SPEAKER_17]: So having our city solicitor find any loophole that can stop this ASAP until we get the answers that Council Marks has brought up, I think it's very important.

394
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:12,425
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to make that into an amendment if I can.

395
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:14,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

396
00:41:15,069 --> 00:41:18,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward tonight.

397
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:28,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very important issue and I thank you for all the research that you've done because I know it takes a lot of time and effort and we all appreciate that.

398
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,051
[SPEAKER_10]: hearing the information that you're bringing to us tonight.

399
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:38,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank the residents as well for coming out tonight, because I know that this is a concern that many have throughout our entire community.

400
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,353
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for being here tonight.

401
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:47,154
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a number of resolutions, but is there anybody here that wanted to speak on this issue tonight?

402
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, please do, feel free to do so.

403
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,256
[SPEAKER_10]: When you come forward, we just need your name and address for the record.

404
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:59,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, my name is Jane Aire Beckwith, A-I-R-E.

405
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:05,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to tell you that back in 1969, a group of students... Excuse me.

406
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:06,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to interrupt.

407
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:07,565
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you not hear me?

408
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,165
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we can hear you.

409
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,626
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk needs your address as well.

410
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:12,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, it's 9 Walkling Court.

411
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:13,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

412
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Apartment F.

413
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:24,751
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to tell you that in 1969, a group of students got up in the trees, the sycamore trees on Memorial Drive.

414
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:30,993
[SPEAKER_20]: They were not cut down by Harvard School, by Harvard Law School.

415
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:36,255
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did it because we thought those trees were important because it took about 100 years to grow them.

416
00:42:37,614 --> 00:42:45,182
[SPEAKER_20]: I am so grateful to hear you talking like this, counselors, because things take time to know about health.

417
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:51,790
[SPEAKER_20]: The environment takes time, and if we don't give it time, corporations will not.

418
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:54,152
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been

419
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,761
[SPEAKER_20]: doing massage and reflexology for over 40 years.

420
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:03,884
[SPEAKER_20]: I work with people recovering from all kinds of drugs and alcohol at this point.

421
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:07,786
[SPEAKER_20]: I have over 30 years in recovery.

422
00:43:08,506 --> 00:43:13,629
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm trying to say to you is what is important to me is that we take the time we need.

423
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:20,813
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never had a patient or a client say to me, hurry up and finish with my feet and body.

424
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:25,218
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what we have to do with this proposal.

425
00:43:26,058 --> 00:43:30,841
[SPEAKER_20]: Because what goes in the air gives off chlorine with those satellites.

426
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,022
[SPEAKER_20]: And there has to be a lot sent up.

427
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:35,203
[SPEAKER_20]: And it won't just be Verizon.

428
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:36,764
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be Comcast.

429
00:43:37,224 --> 00:43:38,205
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be all the others.

430
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:40,546
[SPEAKER_20]: So please think of this.

431
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:43,468
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's important to us?

432
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:46,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it holding our families as we grow?

433
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,553
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, almost 70 and possibly a great-grandmother in the next few years.

434
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,556
[SPEAKER_20]: That's important that I hold my family.

435
00:43:56,116 --> 00:44:01,861
[SPEAKER_20]: And what else is important is Medford has so much open space and it's very precious to me.

436
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:07,226
[SPEAKER_20]: And walking my little emotional support animal out in the environment.

437
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:18,427
[SPEAKER_20]: And so everything I do now, I take in consideration what I breathe, what I drink, what will happen for the future generations and the animals around us.

438
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:21,609
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, and I'm grateful for your consideration on that.

439
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:22,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

440
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:28,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Please have your name and address for the record.

441
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:29,315
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

442
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:32,937
[SPEAKER_21]: John J. Ritchie, and it's 22 Bradley Road, 4A.

443
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:45,781
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not anti-business, I'm not anti-technology, I don't think anybody in their right mind is, but I am pro-common sense.

444
00:44:47,538 --> 00:45:16,651
[SPEAKER_21]: and i think you guys are too because this uh... this issue is is not going to go away it's only going to get you know more attention as uh... as the time goes on and i'm thankful that you guys are bringing this up i'm not going to read everything that i have here because most of the stuff that i have here i've emailed to you and then a bunch of you here as well so uh... if you don't have it because of yahoo dumped it in your spam or never

445
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:17,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Received it.

446
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:42,791
[SPEAKER_21]: I have copies here that I can give you but I also you you mentioned that article on what other cities are doing But in that article, I don't know if you've seen it, but there is a model Wireless telecommunications ordinance, which I have seven copies here if you'd like me to leave them I don't know if you saw that but it's a model that you guys can look at as a guide to see what can Medford do to you know

447
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:50,050
[SPEAKER_21]: protect the residents from a new technology that not everybody understands completely.

448
00:45:50,090 --> 00:46:06,634
[SPEAKER_21]: And even Verizon, they were quite disingenuous when I was here at that meeting last week, or information session, and one of the gentlemen told me, oh, if you have any health concerns, you can go talk to our guy over there.

449
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:09,675
[SPEAKER_21]: But he's already in the bag for Verizon, so he's not neutral.

450
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:17,139
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, what incentive do they have to tell us that there might be an issue with health and safety?

451
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:24,243
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, they have no incentive as a business, as a corporation, whose bottom line is to make the bottom line.

452
00:46:24,563 --> 00:46:28,346
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not, you know, what is the health of the residents that live around here?

453
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:31,087
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, how is that going to be affected?

454
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:32,428
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not their concern.

455
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:33,608
[SPEAKER_21]: That's our concern.

456
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:39,871
[SPEAKER_21]: And we want Verizon to feel comfortable with, you know, with Medford.

457
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:41,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And Medford is pro-business.

458
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:42,292
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not anti-business.

459
00:46:42,993 --> 00:46:45,694
[SPEAKER_21]: But we want to move forward carefully.

460
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:48,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And I thought they were disingenuous last week when he told me

461
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:58,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I said, where's this gonna, do you have one of these devices that's gonna be near my residence?

462
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,639
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, yeah, where do you live?

463
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:00,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley Road.

464
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,620
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's gonna be on 13 Bradley Road.

465
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,180
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm 22.

466
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:07,642
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm like, that's right outside my door.

467
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:14,324
[SPEAKER_21]: And he tells me, oh, don't worry because our technology is 20% stronger than your cell phone signal.

468
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:21,825
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, if it's that strong, if it's that stronger than my cell phone, why do you need it right up my nose?

469
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,166
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't need it that close to where I live.

470
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:33,988
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, he says it can go through the wall, but you can definitely pick up the signal when you walk outside your house, but I don't wanna pick up the signal.

471
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:40,249
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't wanna be bombarded by these EMF waves, and I know that there's a lot of buzz on,

472
00:47:40,929 --> 00:48:08,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford Square Facebook page who there's some people pushing back and saying oh, there's nothing wrong with this technology There's nothing to worry about It's only high Frequency waves that you have to worry about but that the research that I've done Suggests that it's not just high High levels of the frequency it's lower at their health concerns and health effects from over 800 studies

473
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:31,569
[SPEAKER_21]: that detail studies that were done not by people that are already in the bag for Verizon or these other companies, but neutral parties, some of them not even in the country, who have nothing but concern that is driving their research, not that they're getting paid for any American business.

474
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's

475
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:41,429
[SPEAKER_21]: there's quite a alarming evidence here that suggests that we shouldn't take pressure from Verizon.

476
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:49,411
[SPEAKER_21]: We should be welcoming, but we shouldn't have them come into our city and start installing these things in residential areas, by the way.

477
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:58,975
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not even suggesting only putting them on top of commercial zones or even buildings that are owned by Citi, but inside

478
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:06,620
[SPEAKER_21]: where we have to go out and go to work or go to school, what have you, and then come back.

479
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:12,904
[SPEAKER_21]: They wanna put these devices in our very streets, where the residents are.

480
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:15,066
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that's an issue.

481
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:27,814
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if there's a way to submit these to the delegation or whatever groups you have that wanna look into this further because we should, if they decide that they're gonna put them,

482
00:49:29,605 --> 00:49:35,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, here's the sample ordinance, and then here's a hard copy of all the information that I've done.

483
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:44,994
[SPEAKER_21]: But if they want to put them in Medford, I think that they should put them further away from where residents don't have to deal with them.

484
00:49:46,335 --> 00:49:51,917
[SPEAKER_21]: There are effects to skin, to heartbeat, to fertility.

485
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:53,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, exactly.

486
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:59,261
[SPEAKER_21]: The further these things are away from where you live, the better.

487
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:07,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not saying that we shouldn't have them at all, but they shouldn't be right outside where I live.

488
00:50:07,224 --> 00:50:08,485
[SPEAKER_21]: They weren't necessary for 2G.

489
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:18,310
[SPEAKER_21]: 3G and 4G, but now all of a sudden for 5G they're necessary to have these on poles outside where you live.

490
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:20,432
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't make sense to me.

491
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:39,124
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate you guys hearing me and I hope I wasn't rambling, but I appreciate you guys taking the time to really discuss this and coming up with a solution that is pro-business and business friendly, but also takes into consideration your constituents and their concerns as well.

492
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:40,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for being balanced.

493
00:50:46,055 --> 00:50:46,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

494
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:49,636
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Catherine Devine.

495
00:50:49,656 --> 00:50:51,816
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 5 Norton Avenue.

496
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:58,898
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm glad I don't have to come up here and be defensive.

497
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:11,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead, I'm coming up here to thank you for being so considerate because I think some of what happens with these kind of new, you know, in fact, very exciting technologies

498
00:51:12,613 --> 00:51:17,036
[SPEAKER_22]: is that people get swept up in the movement of them.

499
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,698
[SPEAKER_22]: They seem inevitable.

500
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:29,587
[SPEAKER_22]: And in fact, 5G installations are already being installed countrywide and worldwide.

501
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,049
[SPEAKER_22]: And so now we're having to

502
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,487
[SPEAKER_22]: try and slow that down.

503
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:43,993
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for being willing to step back and be considerate about it.

504
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:56,048
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually work for the international leading software producer of software for scientists and engineers and my company makes a 5G toolbox.

505
00:51:56,815 --> 00:52:16,030
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm gonna take my 5G for dummies questions to that team and see if they can, because I feel like we need to be factual and straightforward and not inflammatory about this issue.

506
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:23,475
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not interested in saying that this causes cancer if there's absolutely no evidence that it does.

507
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:39,618
[SPEAKER_22]: On the other hand, the World Health Organization is recommending that we not go forward with 5G installations because there are so many questions and suggestions of issues.

508
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:46,825
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll do my part to become more well-informed, to learn what I can about 5G from my company.

509
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:52,009
[SPEAKER_22]: interesting, I didn't know there were other ways of deploying it.

510
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,594
[SPEAKER_22]: So that may be a piece of evidence that we can use against Verizon.

511
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:03,178
[SPEAKER_22]: But it seems to me, this is on a whole new scale.

512
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:04,980
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it's how it's being promoted, 5G.

513
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:09,919
[SPEAKER_22]: is exploding onto the world as a new thing.

514
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,039
[SPEAKER_22]: It is a new thing.

515
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,002
[SPEAKER_22]: We've never had transmitters outside of people's homes.

516
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:16,823
[SPEAKER_22]: That's new.

517
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:25,347
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the stories, and I promise I'll get you this reference because, again, I want to be factual and not inflammatory.

518
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:34,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently, they had put a 5G installation on a firehouse, and the firemen all started getting headaches, and they had it taken off.

519
00:53:37,396 --> 00:53:42,441
[SPEAKER_22]: No joke that, you know, there seem to be health effects.

520
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:49,167
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll just close by saying I'm glad, oh, there was a meeting in Concord of 250 people.

521
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:53,070
[SPEAKER_22]: So Burlington already succeeded in stopping 5G.

522
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:59,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Concord's right in the thick of it, so I'll try and get some contact names from there as well.

523
00:53:59,955 --> 00:54:08,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently there were lawyers there, there was a Nobel laureate there, so you know, hopefully each town isn't having to reinvent the wheel.

524
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,503
[SPEAKER_22]: What was I starting to say before I thought about Concord?

525
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:17,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I'm glad you're getting legal help because at least the way it stands at the moment,

526
00:54:19,235 --> 00:54:25,898
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the way it reads, you can't deny Verizon based on health effects, which is, I think, mostly what we care about.

527
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:41,805
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it may take some finagling for you to find a way to slow Verizon down, back them off, and, you know, protect the citizens of Medford.

528
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:44,086
[SPEAKER_22]: So appreciate all your words today.

529
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:45,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

530
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

531
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:51,968
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey everyone.

532
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:52,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

533
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:56,671
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Aaron Rumley and I live at 216 Grove Street in Medford.

534
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,071
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you.

535
00:54:58,271 --> 00:55:00,493
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks for putting this on the agenda tonight.

536
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:06,356
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's a really important topic and I'm happy to have the opportunity to discuss it publicly.

537
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:11,856
[SPEAKER_23]: I also went to the meeting last week and found it largely underwhelming.

538
00:55:13,037 --> 00:55:21,960
[SPEAKER_23]: I specifically felt bad for all of the elderly folks that came here that would have benefited from more of a panel discussion and listening to other people's questions.

539
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:34,886
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you for also confirming my understanding that all that's in place right now is a policy for procedure to submit applications directly to the mayor to be ushered to the city engineer.

540
00:55:35,492 --> 00:55:37,533
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that that was all well and good to start.

541
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:40,115
[SPEAKER_23]: And I agree, obviously, now we need an ordinance.

542
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:46,358
[SPEAKER_23]: And if I was to craft an ordinance tomorrow, I would want three things to be included.

543
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:50,440
[SPEAKER_23]: The first is the health and human safety.

544
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:59,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, most people are here tonight because they're concerned about antennas cooking them or giving them cancer and all of that.

545
00:55:59,847 --> 00:56:04,789
[SPEAKER_23]: I will say on the record that I think people should be very careful about what they read on the internet.

546
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,412
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not really into fear mongering about technology.

547
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:20,317
[SPEAKER_23]: But it is every citizen's right to have a record given to them saying that what's outside their house is not going to have any harm to them.

548
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:27,861
[SPEAKER_23]: And in the industry, there are two RF studies that are used from an RF perspective

549
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:33,265
[SPEAKER_23]: that Verizon and any other proposing carrier can give to us willingly if we make them.

550
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:42,728
[SPEAKER_23]: The first is a shared study interference that is antenna to antenna interference.

551
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:49,289
[SPEAKER_23]: That's seen mostly on cell towers where you have multiple carriers in one spot to make sure that one antenna doesn't knock the other out.

552
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,970
[SPEAKER_23]: And the second is called a near study.

553
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:57,674
[SPEAKER_23]: And that acronym is NIR, and it stands for Non-Ionizing Radiation Study.

554
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:01,117
[SPEAKER_23]: And that is exactly what we're talking about.

555
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:18,228
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a study that we can mandate on every installation to say that this is stamped by an engineer who's not necessarily working on the corporate dime, who cares about his license, who will say that this isn't going to harm any humans.

556
00:57:20,757 --> 00:57:21,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Second is structural safety.

557
00:57:22,737 --> 00:57:24,018
[SPEAKER_23]: You mentioned this, Councilor Marks.

558
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:31,999
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that we should require a stamped structural analysis for each site that these small cells are proposed.

559
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:41,221
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think, I'll be candid, I think that a lot of the utility poles in Medford are in some state of disrepair.

560
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:48,663
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that putting antennas on these that are gonna create extra wind sail and otherwise you have

561
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:50,509
[SPEAKER_23]: the risk of a few different things.

562
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,551
[SPEAKER_23]: Is the pole going to fall over if there's a windstorm or any type of weather event?

563
00:57:56,211 --> 00:58:03,073
[SPEAKER_23]: And are the antennas installed in a way that they're not going to blow off the pole and damage someone's house or property?

564
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:14,216
[SPEAKER_23]: And as a sidebar, I would say we should have a blanket restriction on any installation on the double pole, unless, of course, the proposing carrier wants to replace the double pole with

565
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:16,189
[SPEAKER_23]: A new Singapore.

566
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,111
[SPEAKER_23]: And the last is the most important to me, and that's aesthetics.

567
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:24,835
[SPEAKER_23]: And you alluded to this, and we should have conversations about what Medford wants.

568
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:35,182
[SPEAKER_23]: I spent a little time with the construction guys here last week, and they had, I think, about 12 photographs on a three-sided poster board.

569
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:39,396
[SPEAKER_23]: I was disappointed to see only one was a stealth concealment.

570
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:42,297
[SPEAKER_23]: But I thought a lot of them looked pretty junky.

571
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:54,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And my fear is that if we don't get ahead of this and tell these proposing carriers what we want, they will assume that we are OK with the cheapest possible installation.

572
00:58:55,343 --> 00:59:01,665
[SPEAKER_23]: So if it's not happening in Lexington, it shouldn't happen in Meadowbrook.

573
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:05,127
[SPEAKER_23]: So we can tell people what we want, and we can demand it that way.

574
00:59:06,516 --> 00:59:11,859
[SPEAKER_23]: And as an aside, I would say we should really stay away from blanket moratoriums on technology upgrades.

575
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:20,585
[SPEAKER_23]: It's important to have these antennas in places that are going to increase cell coverage, specifically where people don't have landlines anymore.

576
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:24,627
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to be able to get a signal if I need somebody to come to my house and help me.

577
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,429
[SPEAKER_23]: So we should keep those things in mind as well.

578
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:28,590
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for your time.

579
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:29,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

580
00:59:38,494 --> 00:59:39,616
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Melissa Dubuque.

581
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 10 Cherry Street.

582
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:45,021
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm one of the lucky ones that is going to have supposedly one of those things in front of their house.

583
00:59:46,202 --> 00:59:58,115
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is, is paperwork was due yesterday, and does that mean that they're going to start installing the 5G towers, or are we on hold with that?

584
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:01,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Because my concern is, is where the tower is going.

585
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,221
[SPEAKER_15]: is less than eight feet outside of my daughter's bedroom window.

586
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:15,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I talked to one of the guys last week, I think I was talking, he was talking, somebody had asked a question if I was underneath it with the cell phone, would it directly hit the cell phone?

587
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:23,413
[SPEAKER_15]: And the guy said, nope, it'll just be in an oval, probably only go out eight feet, you know, straight across, so it won't bother anybody.

588
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:26,595
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I asked him, I said, well, that would be my daughter's bedroom window.

589
01:00:27,096 --> 01:00:28,437
[SPEAKER_15]: He had no answer for me.

590
01:00:29,037 --> 01:00:30,318
[SPEAKER_15]: So my concern is that,

591
01:00:31,181 --> 01:00:33,502
[SPEAKER_15]: last week was just a nightmare out in front of my house.

592
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:35,983
[SPEAKER_15]: They've already come and changed the telephone pole.

593
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:47,887
[SPEAKER_15]: So as I'm viewing it, it looks like it's sort of a go ahead and I've gotten no notification about it being outside of my house, National Grid coming and doing everything that they did last week.

594
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:55,229
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want, want to know if there is a date because the paperwork wasn't put in place that these things are going to start showing up.

595
01:00:56,946 --> 01:01:03,948
[SPEAKER_15]: if anybody has the answer to that, if there's a way they can stop it or at least postpone putting it in front of my house, because as I said, it's been a nightmare.

596
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:12,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally have not been notified by any city department telling us, you know, as far as the timeline is, when things will be installed.

597
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure, Councilor Mox, have you been?

598
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, just if I could.

599
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:17,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, one minute please.

600
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:23,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Every petition comes with a start date.

601
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:27,997
[SPEAKER_16]: So the date commences when the 60 day period starts.

602
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:37,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first batch, and I'm not sure how many were in the first batch, the date that we had as a city was December 20th to act upon it.

603
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:45,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon came back because the city did not act and said, okay, we'll give you another 30 days, which brought it to January 20th.

604
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:56,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I'm under the impression they still need approval from the city of town, from this ad hoc committee that was created by the mayor.

605
01:01:57,136 --> 01:02:03,920
[SPEAKER_16]: And when that's gonna happen, we can ask the city engineer who happens to chair that committee what his thoughts are.

606
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:09,323
[SPEAKER_16]: But as far as I know, it doesn't just automatically get approved.

607
01:02:09,503 --> 01:02:19,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because the poll is still... Excuse me, if you have any questions, I just ask you to please come up to the microphone just so everyone can hear and so people at home can hear as well.

608
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:33,153
[SPEAKER_22]: So from my reading, the carriers had initially wanted part there to be a deemed approved clause in the FCC regulation.

609
01:02:33,926 --> 01:02:36,647
[SPEAKER_22]: and the FCC declined to include that.

610
01:02:37,288 --> 01:02:52,235
[SPEAKER_22]: So I have, and I can send it to you, a two-page synopsis put out by a congressional advisory board instructing Congress how to think about this regulation.

611
01:02:53,916 --> 01:03:00,019
[SPEAKER_22]: So nothing automatically happens when the timeline has not been met, if anything,

612
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:05,865
[SPEAKER_22]: if I was reading it correctly, they said that Verizon would have to come sue Medford.

613
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:13,168
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's part of what I think your legal due diligence needs to be.

614
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:23,433
[SPEAKER_22]: So what's happening in other communities when they are or are not deciding this on time, but it is not an automatic installation.

615
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:23,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

616
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:48,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the pole like they have they still have the half of the old pole Attached to the new pole by a piece of wood with all of National Grid with all of their wires So I don't know how long that's gonna be like that either and it's really not too safe So I'm just kind of I just don't want to come home again and run into the same nightmare that I won't get into again.

617
01:03:48,817 --> 01:03:52,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So Point of information council on night

618
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

619
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:54,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

620
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:54,557
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?

621
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you.

622
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke with you the other night.

623
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:58,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke with your husband as well.

624
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:01,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Relative to the debris that was left on the front lawn.

625
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:06,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And I left the city engineer's office on Wednesday evening with the assurances that there was going to be someone down there to clean it up.

626
01:04:07,128 --> 01:04:07,348
[SPEAKER_13]: It was.

627
01:04:07,608 --> 01:04:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cleaned up.

628
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:09,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

629
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:09,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

630
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's my understanding that the pole was installed by National Grid.

631
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:34,746
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point in time, but they're installing it for future work So this the grid actually put the pole in right the work that's gonna happen is gonna be Verizon But I didn't want to follow up with that to make sure that that happened because when I spoke with your husband last They might have came out a little later in the day than earlier than he expected So that was just my concern I just didn't want to come home and have this I

632
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:42,554
[SPEAKER_15]: on top of a telephone pole without any, so I'm just glad and thank you everybody, so I appreciate it.

633
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:43,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

634
01:04:46,097 --> 01:04:48,239
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Mariana Ducey, 2 North Street.

635
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I have some information about this pole business.

636
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:56,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I had attended the November meeting that was at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

637
01:04:57,543 --> 01:05:05,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Two weeks later, a contractor came to replace the pole two doors down from me.

638
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:08,325
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one of the poles where the 5G was going to go.

639
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:11,886
[SPEAKER_14]: So I asked him what he was doing.

640
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:12,426
[SPEAKER_14]: He said he didn't know.

641
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:13,386
[SPEAKER_14]: He was the contractor.

642
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:18,147
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, there was a second pole further up the street that was going to be another 5G.

643
01:05:18,607 --> 01:05:19,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And they replaced that pole.

644
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:23,788
[SPEAKER_14]: The only two poles on the street that were replaced were the 5G poles.

645
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:26,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And the new poles were taller.

646
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:35,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So I called City Hall and they said that the poles belong to National Grid or whatever and they can replace the pole for any reason.

647
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,334
[SPEAKER_14]: That's maybe true.

648
01:05:37,974 --> 01:05:39,515
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the poles were brand new.

649
01:05:40,595 --> 01:05:41,856
[SPEAKER_14]: No, nothing wrong with the poles.

650
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,698
[SPEAKER_14]: The only change was that the new pole was taller.

651
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:49,720
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still, as that lady said, the half pole, the two poles are attached to each other.

652
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,121
[SPEAKER_14]: The old poles cut off at the bottom.

653
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:53,002
[SPEAKER_14]: So

654
01:05:54,022 --> 01:06:00,526
[SPEAKER_14]: My concern at the time was, when I spoke to City Hall, I said, Verizon is coming here doing advanced work.

655
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:01,907
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't even got the permit yet.

656
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:03,328
[SPEAKER_14]: They're replacing the poles.

657
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says, oh, no, no.

658
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:12,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, well, how come the only two poles on the whole street in front of number 10 and in front of number 90 are the two poles that are being replaced?

659
01:06:12,894 --> 01:06:15,416
[SPEAKER_14]: So Verizon was doing some advanced work.

660
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:19,859
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they hired the contractor or National Grid or however it worked, but there it is.

661
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:37,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the second thing I want to call to your attention, I also came to the meeting last week here, the informational meeting, and I asked Verizon, there was a table in the middle here, and I asked the man there, I said, tell me what the pros and the cons are about this 5G.

662
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:44,010
[SPEAKER_14]: He told me all about the pros, but on his table he had a whole packet of information here.

663
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:50,773
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last two handouts were the cons, which he didn't verbally

664
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,230
[SPEAKER_14]: talk about.

665
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,332
[SPEAKER_14]: When I got home, I read all this stuff.

666
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:59,154
[SPEAKER_14]: So Verizon is well aware that there are cons to this thing.

667
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:01,655
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're not making it public.

668
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:06,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I did talk to the table that was over here, the man that had the supposed to be the health hazards.

669
01:07:06,638 --> 01:07:12,361
[SPEAKER_14]: He mentioned something about the high frequency radio signals may harm hearing.

670
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:14,082
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's about the only thing he said.

671
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have this packet.

672
01:07:16,803 --> 01:07:18,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you picked this up, Michael, when you were here.

673
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:20,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you pick up the whole packet?

674
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:21,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have a second packet.

675
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:26,987
[SPEAKER_14]: You can have it just in case you missed the cons here and all the pros or whatever.

676
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:28,188
[SPEAKER_14]: So there it is.

677
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

678
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:29,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

679
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:34,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

680
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,470
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Donna Edmonds.

681
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on Marion Street.

682
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:49,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my concerns is the speed at which Verizon is going ahead with this because in November, every single, no less than five locations that were cited for the 5G

683
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Verizon came, they laid new cable.

684
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,941
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my neighbors went and asked them, chatted them up friendly, saying, oh, what's this all about?

685
01:07:57,961 --> 01:07:59,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, we're laying the cable for 5G.

686
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:04,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So I notified Brianna, and she got in touch with Verizon.

687
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, no, no, Verizon does work all the time.

688
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:14,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was at the exact addresses where the 5G is going to be five places that I personally saw.

689
01:08:16,724 --> 01:08:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And so obviously, they're just, as soon as they get it, they're planning on getting approval and putting them in immediately.

690
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:26,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted you to be aware of that.

691
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

692
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:30,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I took pictures of them doing that.

693
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:34,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

694
01:08:34,231 --> 01:08:35,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find it very concerning.

695
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:43,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it concerning the number of 5G equipment that they're planning to put right close to my house.

696
01:08:44,255 --> 01:08:44,635
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother's 94.

697
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:47,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that.

698
01:08:47,927 --> 01:08:53,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's questionable whether or not it will cause problems, but I believe that my mom would be susceptible to that.

699
01:08:54,470 --> 01:09:00,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just feel like it could happen anytime because they've already done it.

700
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:09,938
[SPEAKER_01]: They did have a one thing I wanted to ask is they had a police detail at each of these locations and do they have to have, do they have to say what it's for?

701
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:10,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have to have a permit?

702
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:13,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why were the police there assisting them?

703
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:16,676
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that I would like to know the answer to.

704
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:30,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, I just want to thank everybody because this has been very helpful and I'm just very heartened to see it being approached so sensibly and intelligently.

705
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:31,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

706
01:09:31,365 --> 01:09:31,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

707
01:09:31,985 --> 01:09:37,048
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk did not get your name.

708
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:38,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Donna Edmonds.

709
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:39,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Donna Edmonds.

710
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:40,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

711
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:40,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

712
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:40,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Edmonds.

713
01:09:45,836 --> 01:09:47,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Anita Nagum, 9 Norton Avenue.

714
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:54,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a lot of concerns with the process that Verizon is following or not following.

715
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I attended the permit hearing which was scheduled in November.

716
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:10,665
[SPEAKER_12]: That meeting was canceled before it started because at the last minute Tim McGivern, the city engineer, got some advice from Mark Rumley that

717
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:14,934
[SPEAKER_12]: The notification that Verizon sent out was deemed inadequate.

718
01:10:15,395 --> 01:10:21,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Those vague letters, not signed, not addressed, with no location specified for anyone.

719
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:26,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It just said that a small cell facility will be placed on or near the right of way near your house.

720
01:10:28,183 --> 01:10:34,787
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting that Verizon has contacted the city and told you you're in violation.

721
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:40,350
[SPEAKER_12]: I would definitely recommend that you get in touch with the city solicitor, and I would

722
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:51,001
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not a legal expert, but I would push back against Verizon and tell them that they were not in compliance with the city regulations as far as notification.

723
01:10:53,543 --> 01:10:59,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I mean, I highly recommend either the city solicitor or outside legal counsel.

724
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:07,953
[SPEAKER_12]: The FCC put into place some regulations that are very restrictive about what communities can do to restrict 5G.

725
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:15,250
[SPEAKER_12]: A portion of those regulations was struck down in August by the D.C.

726
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:28,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Court of Appeals regarding, I believe, effect on historic and environmental, because of historic

727
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:39,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Environmental concerns or historic preservation in local communities.

728
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:41,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that's going to be appealed.

729
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:53,538
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also another portion of that FCC rule, which is up in front of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which I believe is in San Francisco.

730
01:11:53,938 --> 01:11:54,879
[SPEAKER_12]: That is still pending.

731
01:11:55,639 --> 01:12:01,280
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would highly recommend that the city solicitor, someone who knows a lot more about it than I do,

732
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:09,593
[SPEAKER_12]: look into these things and see what is going on, what exactly the legal issues are in these cases.

733
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:22,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have a little bit of information which I can email you with more information, certainly on the opinion that was released in August, striking down a portion.

734
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:30,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm sure these things are going to be appealed and this will go on, but I highly recommend the city push back against Verizon because I don't think

735
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:32,863
[SPEAKER_12]: their notification was adequate at all.

736
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:34,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

737
01:12:38,928 --> 01:12:43,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

738
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:54,959
[SPEAKER_00]: At first when I heard about this issue, I thought that I heard there was no scientific evidence that this technology was dangerous.

739
01:12:55,785 --> 01:12:59,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked it up on the internet, and it looks like there is some level of debate.

740
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:06,697
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is one concern I wanted to address, and that is there's some suspicion that the fact that it's near your home means that

741
01:13:08,536 --> 01:13:11,098
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes across as strange to some folks.

742
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:24,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk a little bit about that because when you have a shorter wavelength, also a higher frequency, that's going to lead to more attenuation over the same amount of distance.

743
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:26,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give you an example, you guys,

744
01:13:27,597 --> 01:13:35,162
[SPEAKER_00]: might be familiar with over the course of your lifetime, or our grandparents' lifetime, of different signals we've used.

745
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:39,584
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have heard of the VLF transmitter in Cutler, Maine.

746
01:13:39,704 --> 01:13:49,931
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a massive antenna, and they use this to transmit all around the world to submarines, and it can transmit only one letter at a time, Morse code kind of thing.

747
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:55,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys might be familiar with shortwave radios, which...

748
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:03,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have a fairly long wavelength and so those transmit a great distance.

749
01:14:08,106 --> 01:14:09,987
[SPEAKER_00]: They reflect off the ionosphere.

750
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:20,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be familiar with AM and FM technologies and how the AM signals we're used to hearing are pretty lousy but go a pretty far distance.

751
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:22,333
[SPEAKER_00]: FM go a shorter distance.

752
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:25,815
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think about how if your neighbor is playing

753
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:34,616
[SPEAKER_00]: a tuba, you're not gonna be able to drown out that sound easily by just putting on headphones, whereas if they're playing a flute, it's gonna be a lot easier because of the higher pitch.

754
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:37,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to sort of explain that.

755
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:40,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have gotten a bit wrong with the short wave, now that I think about it.

756
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,900
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be specific to the ionosphere.

757
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:52,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when there's an earthquake, there are two different kinds of waves that propagate throughout the world, and the ones with the shorter

758
01:14:54,363 --> 01:15:01,246
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher frequency, meaning shorter wavelength, those are unable to go through the molten core of the Earth, whereas the others can.

759
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:04,927
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did want to address that concern.

760
01:15:05,408 --> 01:15:13,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is, it seems scary because it's near your house, but the fact is, I believe the way that works is if you have a short wavelength,

761
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:18,940
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit of destructive interference, it's gonna erase the wave, right?

762
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you have a big wavelength and it gets out of whack a little, you're still gonna be able to see the signal, you know?

763
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like that, whereas here it just covers itself up.

764
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:31,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more or less how it works.

765
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to research on my phone just now.

766
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:35,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to get anything perfect.

767
01:15:39,184 --> 01:15:44,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a signal, but to be honest with you, a lot of people on there, they write the same thing over.

768
01:15:44,966 --> 01:15:45,626
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it work?

769
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher frequency, but doesn't go as far, but it never says why.

770
01:15:48,267 --> 01:15:50,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

771
01:15:50,247 --> 01:15:59,310
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure if you have low wavelength, you get a little bit of interference with itself, boom, it's gone, whereas if it's bigger wavelength, you know what I mean?

772
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:01,390
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes off a little, you still have basically a signal.

773
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:06,072
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very weird diagram, but that's what I came up with.

774
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:13,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my understanding of that, and that's why I'm not scared of the distance to my house, because I understand that's more or less the reason.

775
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:21,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also wanted to say that there are some benefits to having a second internet provider in town.

776
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:26,738
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're stuck with Comcast or I have Verizon Fios, which is actually not that bad, but I prefer choice.

777
01:16:27,578 --> 01:16:32,601
[SPEAKER_00]: People do get upset with having to pay the monopoly internet companies, and this is one way to avoid that.

778
01:16:34,102 --> 01:16:44,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen on the computer or on my phone that there may be some debate that there could be health issues.

779
01:16:45,552 --> 01:16:49,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suspect that there are, but I respect if people do have that concern.

780
01:16:49,475 --> 01:16:53,198
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to see that it's not just us versus the corporations.

781
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:57,902
[SPEAKER_00]: If this gets approved, there will be some benefits to the people of Bedford too.

782
01:16:57,922 --> 01:17:01,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't all go to the corporations.

783
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:01,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

784
01:17:06,394 --> 01:17:09,116
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just add this little tidbit.

785
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:12,799
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, I'm gonna dig it out of my information and send it to you all.

786
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:35,415
[SPEAKER_22]: But apparently, somebody came across a Verizon internal memo where their lawyer said in very oblique language that if it is proven that there are adverse health effects to 5G transmission, they do not have the health coverage

787
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:39,372
[SPEAKER_22]: in place for their own Verizon workers.

788
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:45,958
[SPEAKER_22]: So to me that indicates that Verizon has concern about this technology.

789
01:17:52,759 --> 01:18:03,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Eileen Ginnity, I live on Governor's Ave in Medford, and I just want to, first of all, thank Councilor Marks for researching and presenting this so thoroughly.

790
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:18,477
[SPEAKER_02]: My main concern prior to the meeting tonight was just, gee, could we have a more formal way other than, I think they were calling it an informational fair, Verizon called last week's meeting an informational fair, when you went from table to table, et cetera.

791
01:18:18,957 --> 01:18:23,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of that kind of thing, you kind of miss, you know, hits and misses in terms of what you pick up.

792
01:18:24,507 --> 01:18:28,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But just hearing the overall presentation from Councilor Marks about

793
01:18:28,598 --> 01:18:35,601
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole issue of local ordinances, FCC approval process, dates and deadlines, it's all really important information.

794
01:18:35,681 --> 01:18:50,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that and I would very much support that however all those things and the research and the work and the legal, whatever, go together and fit together that whenever it's appropriate to do some sort of public hearing that that would be really helpful.

795
01:18:50,387 --> 01:18:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were probably here last week and

796
01:18:53,348 --> 01:19:11,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they had a few tables, one is the benefits of small cell technology, one is construction, one is site architecture and engineering, and then the three sites they had highlighted where they wanted to do location, Tufts, South Medford, and Glenwood neighborhoods, and then the whole RF safety.

797
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:20,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really even have time to get to the safety table, and I think that, so sort of, as people have talked, some kind of renewed public hearing that really is

798
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:36,303
[SPEAKER_02]: chock full of information and it would be real helpful to have as part of that someone representing the, in the public hearing, someone representing the small cell ad hoc subcommittee so we can just understand better about who those people are and how the process works.

799
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:46,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it sounds like the date of yesterday having been the second deadline passed now that there is not sort of an automatic go ahead for Verizon from what people are saying.

800
01:19:46,752 --> 01:19:47,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

801
01:19:47,653 --> 01:19:48,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

802
01:19:48,753 --> 01:19:49,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

803
01:19:57,675 --> 01:20:11,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President city councilors my name is Joseph Nazaro and I have a host that it 98 Princeton Street in which my daughter lives I've moved to Winchester so I'm from one Dunham Street in Winchester.

804
01:20:13,728 --> 01:20:22,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the information meeting last week, and I'm sorry, ma'am, but you got my flyers that are discussing the adverse health effects of 5G.

805
01:20:22,713 --> 01:20:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Make no question of it, 5G's deadly.

806
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very harmful.

807
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:34,840
[SPEAKER_03]: The American military have used microwave radiation since the 1970s.

808
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:47,663
[SPEAKER_03]: All of their reports indicate that it's deadly, and the federal government adopted military standards so that the military would be effective during the Cold War.

809
01:20:49,107 --> 01:20:57,034
[SPEAKER_03]: The telecom companies wanted those exact same standards, and those were the standards that were adopted, the military standards.

810
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:05,301
[SPEAKER_03]: The United States and Canada currently have radiation standards that are 100 times those of the European Union.

811
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:13,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the standards that Verizon wishes to install here in Medford and in Winchester and over the entire United States.

812
01:21:14,408 --> 01:21:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the information meeting here last week.

813
01:21:17,887 --> 01:21:19,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I was quite insulted.

814
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:28,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was misleading and deceptive, and it was just, to me, I was embarrassed for the Verizon people.

815
01:21:30,377 --> 01:21:33,340
[SPEAKER_03]: The information just was outrageous.

816
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:36,202
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a boondoggle.

817
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:44,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We all are very, very well served with copper wire and fiber optic cable, and they just want to install

818
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: wireless for profits.

819
01:21:48,173 --> 01:21:50,054
[SPEAKER_03]: They want us to dump fiber optic.

820
01:21:50,094 --> 01:21:56,497
[SPEAKER_03]: They want us to dump copper so that they can charge us whatever they like because it's not regulated.

821
01:21:57,318 --> 01:21:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Copper and fiber optic is regulated.

822
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're trying to tell us with 5G is we can disconnect our cable.

823
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:07,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't want to do that.

824
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:08,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slower.

825
01:22:10,104 --> 01:22:12,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The 5G will be slower.

826
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:13,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be less secure.

827
01:22:14,568 --> 01:22:16,069
[SPEAKER_03]: They can pry on us.

828
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a threat to the electric industry because they're going into the electric industry's wavelength, and it's an energy hog.

829
01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:36,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It will create more global warming because it's very expensive to run 5G as opposed to the fiber optic cable.

830
01:22:37,315 --> 01:22:45,922
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been a bill filed over three years ago to study the deleterious health effects of 5G in cell phone radiation.

831
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in the state legislature for over three years.

832
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:51,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's H2885.

833
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:54,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's currently stuck in the telecom communication.

834
01:22:54,610 --> 01:23:01,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I have these handouts for the select people, if they would, including H2885.

835
01:23:04,853 --> 01:23:18,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Mike Barrett of Lexington, Senator Mike Barrett of Lexington's Telecom Committee, where it has to be favorably passed, it has to move to Ways and Means by February 4th.

836
01:23:19,147 --> 01:23:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone should call the Telecom Committee to get favorable action on this bill so it gets financed.

837
01:23:27,495 --> 01:23:31,439
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no studies that show that 5G is healthy.

838
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:41,270
[SPEAKER_03]: All the studies do show that microwave radiation causes atrial fibrillation and other heart conditions.

839
01:23:42,236 --> 01:23:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes arrhythmias.

840
01:23:44,838 --> 01:23:46,379
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes blood diseases.

841
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:49,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes psychological problems.

842
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:54,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing that's known, that's not known, but causes autism in children.

843
01:23:55,504 --> 01:23:57,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes learning difficulties.

844
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:00,687
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just loads of data and research on it.

845
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's installed, it's over.

846
01:24:06,951 --> 01:24:11,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they install these antennas in town, once they turn them on, the game's over for us.

847
01:24:12,128 --> 01:24:14,509
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no turning the clock back with the technology.

848
01:24:15,829 --> 01:24:21,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the president of For a Cleaner Environment in Woburn during the time of the Harvard Health Study.

849
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 21 kids with childhood leukemia in Woburn.

850
01:24:25,651 --> 01:24:27,292
[SPEAKER_03]: There were three more in Winchester.

851
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 of them died.

852
01:24:29,953 --> 01:24:36,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We called our federal senators and representatives, and Kennedy helped us.

853
01:24:36,814 --> 01:24:39,635
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, he died of a brain tumor caused by a cell phone.

854
01:24:42,253 --> 01:24:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We called our state agencies that are meant to protect us.

855
01:24:47,518 --> 01:24:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Public Health came and told us that the water was safe to drink.

856
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council didn't protect the people of Woburn.

857
01:24:56,332 --> 01:25:00,194
[SPEAKER_03]: The last line of defense in this game is the city council here in Medford.

858
01:25:00,855 --> 01:25:09,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I have called Kennedy, I mean, I've called Warren, I've called Markey, I've called my state senator, I've called my state rep.

859
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,881
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them will return a call on this.

860
01:25:13,362 --> 01:25:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You people are the last line of defense now.

861
01:25:16,606 --> 01:25:18,288
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no help beyond you.

862
01:25:18,549 --> 01:25:25,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do laud the work that you've done and the consideration you're giving, trying to hold up Verizon.

863
01:25:25,097 --> 01:25:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's going to be an easy job.

864
01:25:29,062 --> 01:25:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

865
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:30,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

866
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:43,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, I'm Eric Von Berg, 369 High Street.

867
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:54,593
[SPEAKER_26]: I really appreciate all the work that you've done on the council for this and also all the comments from the people here tonight.

868
01:25:55,673 --> 01:26:09,279
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that we really need to focus on the fact that the disease potential, the health potentials for this are unanswered at this point.

869
01:26:10,769 --> 01:26:18,191
[SPEAKER_26]: And I want to read a few paragraphs from a Scientific American article about 5G.

870
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:21,571
[SPEAKER_26]: 5G will not replace 4G.

871
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:33,634
[SPEAKER_26]: It will accompany 4G for the near future and possibly over the long term if there are synergistic effects from simultaneous exposures to multiple types of RFR

872
01:26:35,174 --> 01:26:39,718
[SPEAKER_26]: our overall risk of harm from the RFR may increase substantially.

873
01:26:40,338 --> 01:26:51,207
[SPEAKER_26]: Cancer is not the only risk, as there is considerable evidence that RFR causes neurological disorders and reproductive harm, likely due to oxidative stress.

874
01:26:52,208 --> 01:27:08,107
[SPEAKER_26]: As a society, should we invest hundreds of billions of dollars deploying 5G, a cellular technology that requires the installation of 800,000 or more new cell antenna sites in the U.S., close to where we live, work and play?

875
01:27:09,128 --> 01:27:30,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Instead, we should support the recommendations of the 250 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and demand that our government fund research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect our health and safety.

876
01:27:31,959 --> 01:27:34,200
[SPEAKER_26]: And do we really want

877
01:27:36,058 --> 01:27:50,730
[SPEAKER_26]: to allow these telecom giants to come into our city and install a system that could well be the next health crisis, where our city is not safe for its own residents due to radiation exposure from these towers.

878
01:27:51,491 --> 01:27:55,614
[SPEAKER_26]: If this technology is found to be safe in the future, we can revisit it.

879
01:27:55,934 --> 01:27:59,017
[SPEAKER_26]: But for now, its safety is completely unproven.

880
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:03,441
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that we need to stop it in any way that we can.

881
01:28:04,021 --> 01:28:04,421
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

882
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

883
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:22,675
[SPEAKER_20]: Jane Eyre Beckwith, 9 Walkland Court.

884
01:28:23,356 --> 01:28:27,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want you all to know, how fast is fast enough?

885
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

886
01:28:30,581 --> 01:28:34,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so there are a number of resolutions.

887
01:28:34,664 --> 01:28:38,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the main resolution, and then Councilor Mox offered three other resolutions.

888
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:40,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will take them individually.

889
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:46,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually want to let the board know that the overall strategy that you want

890
01:28:48,766 --> 01:28:50,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you prefer separate votes on these?

891
01:28:50,227 --> 01:28:54,830
[SPEAKER_16]: I prefer separate just in case they all get sent, and then they all.

892
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:55,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Different directions.

893
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

894
01:28:57,892 --> 01:29:00,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so there'll be D, C, and B papers.

895
01:29:00,413 --> 01:29:00,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

896
01:29:00,593 --> 01:29:01,414
[SPEAKER_10]: So we take them individually.

897
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:17,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I'm not sure if I've asked already, but I would request that this council have a public hearing, and invite a state delegation, the mayor of the city of Medford, the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee,

898
01:29:19,249 --> 01:29:25,671
[SPEAKER_16]: Verizon, our city solicitor, and Congresswoman Clark.

899
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:36,475
[SPEAKER_16]: At a public hearing here, Mr. President, at the earliest that you can call for that and get all the parties together to discuss 5G.

900
01:29:37,816 --> 01:29:40,977
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we'll do is we'll make that an amendment to the main resolution, okay?

901
01:29:41,017 --> 01:29:41,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

902
01:29:41,817 --> 01:29:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first paper we'll take up will be the D paper.

903
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:57,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilman Marks, can you please, because the clerk does not have the language, can you please read the D paper, which would be the last resolution that you offer?

904
01:29:58,624 --> 01:29:59,264
[SPEAKER_16]: The last one?

905
01:29:59,585 --> 01:29:59,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

906
01:30:00,045 --> 01:30:12,232
[SPEAKER_16]: So the last one was that the state delegation proposed a joint resolution of the Senate and the House urging Congress to amend

907
01:30:13,925 --> 01:30:18,927
[SPEAKER_16]: the Telecommunication Act of 1996 to account for health effects.

908
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,911
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

909
01:30:28,152 --> 01:30:29,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

910
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:30,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote has been requested.

911
01:30:31,934 --> 01:30:33,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Hertoghez, could you please call the roll?

912
01:30:33,554 --> 01:30:35,535
[SPEAKER_18]: On the D paper.

913
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,256
[SPEAKER_10]: On the D paper.

914
01:30:36,456 --> 01:30:36,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

915
01:30:37,576 --> 01:30:38,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello.

916
01:30:38,317 --> 01:30:38,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

917
01:30:39,497 --> 01:30:39,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

918
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:40,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

919
01:30:40,898 --> 01:30:41,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

920
01:30:41,818 --> 01:30:42,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

921
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:43,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell.

922
01:30:44,144 --> 01:30:44,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

923
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:44,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

924
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:46,145
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

925
01:30:46,386 --> 01:30:46,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

926
01:30:46,946 --> 01:30:48,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

927
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:49,348
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

928
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up would be the C paper.

929
01:30:55,172 --> 01:30:55,712
[SPEAKER_16]: C paper.

930
01:30:56,552 --> 01:31:08,921
[SPEAKER_16]: So it would be that a state delegation proposed a bill which would establish a commission to study the environmental and health effects of 5G technology.

931
01:31:11,718 --> 01:31:17,079
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

932
01:31:18,299 --> 01:31:19,859
[SPEAKER_18]: On the C paper, Councilor Marks.

933
01:31:19,879 --> 01:31:22,440
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, Councilor Bears.

934
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

935
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello.

936
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

937
01:31:26,721 --> 01:31:27,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

938
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:27,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

939
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:28,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

940
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:29,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

941
01:31:29,601 --> 01:31:30,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell.

942
01:31:30,501 --> 01:31:30,621
Yes.

943
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:31,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli.

944
01:31:31,881 --> 01:31:32,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

945
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:32,882
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco.

946
01:31:33,022 --> 01:31:33,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

947
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:35,662
[SPEAKER_10]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

948
01:31:36,122 --> 01:31:37,042
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

949
01:31:38,643 --> 01:31:41,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, could you please read the B paper?

950
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,931
[SPEAKER_16]: And the B paper is a resolution from this council.

951
01:31:46,692 --> 01:32:07,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council approve a resolution asking our state delegation, the Federal Communications Commission, and Congress to limit 5G technology deployment in Massachusetts until the health effects are fully understood.

952
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:15,403
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion offered by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Clerk Harnaby, could you please call the roll?

953
01:32:18,103 --> 01:32:18,744
[SPEAKER_18]: On the B paper.

954
01:32:20,264 --> 01:32:20,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears?

955
01:32:20,764 --> 01:32:20,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

956
01:32:22,165 --> 01:32:22,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello?

957
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:23,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

958
01:32:23,725 --> 01:32:24,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight?

959
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:24,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

960
01:32:24,985 --> 01:32:25,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks?

961
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:26,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

962
01:32:26,466 --> 01:32:26,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell?

963
01:32:27,006 --> 01:32:27,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

964
01:32:28,223 --> 01:32:30,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli, President Falco.

965
01:32:30,464 --> 01:32:33,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

966
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:44,853
[SPEAKER_10]: On the main motion offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the issue of Verizon 5G installations be discussed as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Marks again.

967
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:50,897
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Clerk Herterby's, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

968
01:32:50,937 --> 01:32:52,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk Herterby's, could you please call the roll?

969
01:32:53,922 --> 01:32:55,803
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the creation of a public hearing?

970
01:32:56,123 --> 01:32:56,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

971
01:32:56,944 --> 01:33:04,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

972
01:33:12,633 --> 01:33:14,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

973
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:14,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

974
01:33:20,218 --> 01:33:22,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

975
01:33:26,223 --> 01:33:26,903
[SPEAKER_05]: You are?

976
01:33:26,963 --> 01:33:37,209
[SPEAKER_05]: My dear friend, Mr. President, who would appear before this council as city solicitor, who has gone on to his retirement, would always come before this body and remind us that there is a difference between a public hearing and a public meeting.

977
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:37,769
[SPEAKER_15]: You are correct.

978
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:43,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And a public hearing would be something that is a creature of statute that is required by law versus a public meeting, which is something that we can call.

979
01:33:44,113 --> 01:33:48,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just like clarification from the council as to whether or not we're looking for a public hearing or a public meeting.

980
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:54,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume it's a public meeting because the council doesn't really have a vote over whether or not these things can go into play.

981
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:55,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

982
01:33:57,236 --> 01:33:57,776
[SPEAKER_09]: That is correct.

983
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,437
[SPEAKER_16]: That is correct, and I appreciate that clarification.

984
01:34:00,457 --> 01:34:01,697
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a public meeting, Mr. President.

985
01:34:01,717 --> 01:34:02,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, OK.

986
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:04,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So do you have that, clerk?

987
01:34:04,838 --> 01:34:07,279
[SPEAKER_18]: On the main paper as amended by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpelli.

988
01:34:08,019 --> 01:34:08,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

989
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:08,900
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

990
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:11,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears?

991
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:12,161
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

992
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:13,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello?

993
01:34:13,701 --> 01:34:13,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

994
01:34:14,401 --> 01:34:14,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight?

995
01:34:15,001 --> 01:34:15,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

996
01:34:15,522 --> 01:34:16,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks?

997
01:34:16,322 --> 01:34:16,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

998
01:34:16,982 --> 01:34:17,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell?

999
01:34:17,502 --> 01:34:17,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1000
01:34:18,302 --> 01:34:18,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1001
01:34:18,983 --> 01:34:19,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1002
01:34:19,643 --> 01:34:20,323
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco?

1003
01:34:20,383 --> 01:34:20,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1004
01:34:21,003 --> 01:34:22,304
[SPEAKER_10]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1005
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,124
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1006
01:34:24,184 --> 01:34:25,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, everyone, for coming out tonight.

1007
01:34:25,705 --> 01:34:26,725
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate your input.

1008
01:34:35,475 --> 01:34:49,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, thank you very much for bringing this forward.

1009
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:50,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1010
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:52,321
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-034, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1011
01:34:52,881 --> 01:35:00,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the city administration inform the city council on any plans involving the very important process of the census count.

1012
01:35:01,244 --> 01:35:02,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1013
01:35:02,884 --> 01:35:04,325
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Falco.

1014
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:23,220
[SPEAKER_17]: For those who might look at the census as just an irritant piece of mailing that almost every family gets, every household, and then disregarded and thrown away, I assure to spread the main

1015
01:35:25,874 --> 01:35:38,610
[SPEAKER_17]: issues with the census is making sure that Medford gets as due when it comes to funding from the federal government for education, police, fire, and so on.

1016
01:35:39,471 --> 01:35:43,536
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's important that as the process is now getting underway,

1017
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:51,619
[SPEAKER_17]: that we get an idea of what our plan for our city administration is to get the word out.

1018
01:35:52,740 --> 01:36:09,425
[SPEAKER_17]: Neighbor communities I'm seeing are starting a ground roots effort where if you see what the census is doing, they're now offering $28 an hour for workers knowing that it's important to get these issues and these numbers verified.

1019
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,706
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you can see, Medford is now a very

1020
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:14,860
[SPEAKER_17]: diverse community.

1021
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:25,045
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that diverse community comes people of questionable residency.

1022
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:30,489
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the concerns we have are those numbers count.

1023
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:32,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Those numbers are very important.

1024
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:47,732
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've met and I've talked to different census bureau members that have talked to me about this being a federal law and how this cannot hold against anybody whether their documentation is updated or not.

1025
01:36:48,392 --> 01:36:55,536
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's something that we need to make sure that our administration has a plan in place that will reach all of our families.

1026
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:04,616
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have an opportunity that it's being sent out in a variety of different ways.

1027
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:13,703
[SPEAKER_17]: The important thing that I'm finding out is that the census now, seldom are we gonna see paper versions of the census.

1028
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:17,506
[SPEAKER_17]: You can now do it on the telephone, you can do it online.

1029
01:37:18,928 --> 01:37:23,874
[SPEAKER_17]: There are so many different ways to get this information that's so needed in our community.

1030
01:37:23,914 --> 01:37:31,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to know, I know that from what I've heard that Neil Osborne is going to be

1031
01:37:31,924 --> 01:37:46,421
[SPEAKER_17]: spearheading this, but I'd really like to know his plan and what we can do as a council to make sure that they're doing everything possible to get the word out and the comfort level to all the residents of this community that this information is vital.

1032
01:37:47,282 --> 01:37:52,143
[SPEAKER_17]: to make sure we get everything that's due to us and from the federal government.

1033
01:37:52,183 --> 01:37:54,723
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for hearing me out, Mr. President.

1034
01:37:54,963 --> 01:37:56,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1035
01:37:57,124 --> 01:38:06,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor LaNitte, during last Committee of the Whole, we did talk briefly about the census.

1036
01:38:06,486 --> 01:38:13,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we're going to do is we're actually going to invite Neil Osborne to a Committee of the Whole meeting where we can talk about the census.

1037
01:38:14,187 --> 01:38:20,009
[SPEAKER_10]: get the plan and just see what his plan is to roll out the census and whatnot.

1038
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:21,809
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be receiving an update on that.

1039
01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:23,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

1040
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:26,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I was hoping a second, but Councilor Knight beat me to it.

1041
01:38:27,551 --> 01:38:27,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1042
01:38:28,231 --> 01:38:31,552
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was also hoping to catch some of the people leaving the room.

1043
01:38:32,452 --> 01:38:40,354
[SPEAKER_24]: If you know me, and this may speak strangely to my character, but two of my favorite things in the world are the post office and the census.

1044
01:38:40,594 --> 01:38:41,775
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just,

1045
01:38:42,515 --> 01:38:47,217
[SPEAKER_24]: to the people watching can't implore you enough to fill out your census form.

1046
01:38:48,017 --> 01:38:50,918
[SPEAKER_24]: It means we've done a census since 1800.

1047
01:38:51,018 --> 01:38:52,919
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of the biggest things we do every 10 years.

1048
01:38:52,979 --> 01:38:58,561
[SPEAKER_24]: It's one of the biggest non-wartime mobilizations of people by the government that we do.

1049
01:38:59,901 --> 01:39:02,282
[SPEAKER_24]: And it goes into so much more.

1050
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:05,443
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it goes into everything that Councilor Scarpelli said, which is incredibly important.

1051
01:39:05,819 --> 01:39:15,225
[SPEAKER_24]: It's also the foundation of basically all the statistics and facts that we have on the population of this country, most of the social science research that's done at the local, state, and federal level.

1052
01:39:16,286 --> 01:39:23,591
[SPEAKER_24]: And you may not have voted for me for this, but I'm incredibly passionate about the census, and I'd love to talk to Director Osborne about it.

1053
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:29,955
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to remind everyone that April 1st is Census Day.

1054
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:32,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Have your forms in by April 1st.

1055
01:39:33,898 --> 01:39:34,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1056
01:39:37,022 --> 01:39:38,944
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk has told me the official date is 1790.

1057
01:39:39,004 --> 01:39:39,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1058
01:39:44,538 --> 01:39:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think it's also very important to point out that this is the year 10 of the census.

1059
01:39:51,043 --> 01:39:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also the census that will have an impact on the redistricting of our state house and congressional seats.

1060
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:07,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very important that we do complete the census and fill it out so that we give an accurate count to the people that are making up the districts.

1061
01:40:07,696 --> 01:40:12,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe then we can get a rep that represents all of Medford and not just a portion of it.

1062
01:40:13,872 --> 01:40:14,473
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct.

1063
01:40:15,113 --> 01:40:15,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1064
01:40:15,954 --> 01:40:16,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1065
01:40:17,975 --> 01:40:22,638
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Pearce.

1066
01:40:23,299 --> 01:40:24,139
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1067
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:25,300
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1068
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,101
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1069
01:40:26,121 --> 01:40:31,184
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-035 offered by Councilor Marks.

1070
01:40:34,022 --> 01:40:47,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello and Council and I be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Carol Clements on her retirement after more than 40 years working for the City of Medford, first at the Medford Police Department and then in the City Clerk's office.

1071
01:40:47,576 --> 01:40:49,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council thank Ms.

1072
01:40:50,019 --> 01:40:54,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Clements for her four decades of service to the residents of our community.

1073
01:40:55,605 --> 01:40:56,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

1074
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:58,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1075
01:40:58,849 --> 01:41:04,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank my colleagues, Vice President Caraviello and Councilor Knight for signing on to this.

1076
01:41:05,212 --> 01:41:09,854
[SPEAKER_16]: All of us that behind this reel, Mr. President, can appreciate the work.

1077
01:41:10,353 --> 01:41:12,255
[SPEAKER_16]: that Carol has done over four decades.

1078
01:41:12,935 --> 01:41:15,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person.

1079
01:41:16,138 --> 01:41:19,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Always has a smile on her face and willing to help.

1080
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:29,889
[SPEAKER_16]: And anyone that could stay in this city service for 40 years deserves a recommendation, Mr. President, of great service, believe me.

1081
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:35,013
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to commend her and thank her personally for her many years of city service.

1082
01:41:35,813 --> 01:41:37,755
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we should dedicate this meeting

1083
01:41:38,251 --> 01:41:41,453
[SPEAKER_16]: after Carol for all the years of service, Mr. President.

1084
01:41:41,633 --> 01:41:42,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1085
01:41:42,414 --> 01:41:42,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1086
01:41:44,155 --> 01:41:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

1087
01:41:45,356 --> 01:41:46,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1088
01:41:47,577 --> 01:41:51,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten to know Carol over the last 10 years in being here.

1089
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Though small in size, she was very large in stature in the community.

1090
01:41:57,243 --> 01:42:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Always with a smile, no matter if I saw her either in City Hall or outside.

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1095
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:37,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, one minute, Councilor Knight.

1096
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:38,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I hit the wrong button.

1097
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:41,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1098
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:42,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1099
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:54,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Being someone who's 40 years of age and thinking back and saying that my whole entire life, since I've been on this earth, Carol was working in one way or another for the city of Medford is amazing when I think about that, because I feel old.

1100
01:42:57,297 --> 01:43:01,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just imagine how she feels after putting four decades in to the City of Medford, Mr. President.

1101
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,680
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a great worker.

1102
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,041
[SPEAKER_05]: She was someone who was pleasant to be around.

1103
01:43:04,642 --> 01:43:10,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Rick said, small in stature, but really someone that you knew had a presence in the office and had a presence in the room.

1104
01:43:10,926 --> 01:43:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Did a great job down in the clerk's office.

1105
01:43:12,527 --> 01:43:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the relationship that I was able to develop with her over the short period of time that I've been working here in City of Medford's government.

1106
01:43:18,383 --> 01:43:20,184
[SPEAKER_05]: but she will sadly be missed.

1107
01:43:20,224 --> 01:43:24,025
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a great team down there, Clerk Herterbeest, and she was a key player.

1108
01:43:25,185 --> 01:43:32,447
[SPEAKER_05]: As we see time pass and we see Dottie leave, now we see Carol leave, and we see the changing face of the clerk's office.

1109
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:33,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed Finn leave and you come in.

1110
01:43:34,428 --> 01:43:43,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very interesting time right now, and I just want to have the opportunity to thank Carol for all the work that she did down there and how she helped transform the office into what it is today.

1111
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:46,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counsel Knight.

1112
01:43:46,974 --> 01:44:11,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Consular morale Thank You mr. President like councillor bears I have not had the pleasure many of you had of working with Carol so many years, but I do thank her for her long service to the city and Being a stalwart and the many people like her as administration change as counselors change Having those people that are in the office that are those warm faces that you can depend on and that really reflect the city of Medford I think they mean so much to people that come here one day they come here all the time so

1113
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:15,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank her for her many years of service and hope she enjoys her retirement.

1114
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:16,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilwoman Murrell.

1115
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:24,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I may add really quick, I'd also like to thank Carol for many years of service, 40 years is a long time.

1116
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:35,266
[SPEAKER_10]: You really don't hear these days people working 40 years for one company or a city or town and this is remarkable and I want to thank Carol for

1117
01:44:35,946 --> 01:44:38,728
[SPEAKER_10]: continuous commitment to our community throughout the years.

1118
01:44:39,388 --> 01:44:48,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only worked with her for four plus years, but she's always been extremely a joy to work with, a pleasure to work with.

1119
01:44:48,453 --> 01:44:53,795
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been very helpful and very kind, and I thank her for years of service as well.

1120
01:44:54,376 --> 01:44:59,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1121
01:45:00,139 --> 01:45:01,039
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1122
01:45:01,419 --> 01:45:01,999
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1123
01:45:02,019 --> 01:45:02,780
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1124
01:45:05,782 --> 01:45:09,827
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Council of Knight, to take papers in the hands of the clerk, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1125
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:10,608
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1126
01:45:10,928 --> 01:45:11,709
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1127
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:12,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1128
01:45:33,206 --> 01:45:35,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Knight, 2-0-036.

1129
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:50,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send a letter in support of HB 2881, which would require a five cent deposit on nip bottles to our state delegation.

1130
01:45:50,715 --> 01:45:51,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1131
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1132
01:45:53,397 --> 01:45:58,179
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an item that came up during the last legislative session in the State House and it was defeated.

1133
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this council, if you recall last term, asked the licensing commission to examine a feasibility as to whether or not it would make sense to implement the NIP ban with the issuance of new licenses or the transfer of licenses among our package stores here in the community.

1134
01:46:17,793 --> 01:46:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: That resolve was filed in direct response to the state legislature not being able to pass the expansion of the bottle bill to NIPS.

1135
01:46:24,036 --> 01:46:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: This piece of legislation was refiled.

1136
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:30,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming up for a hearing right now in the Department of Telecommunications and Energy subcommittee, I do believe, Mr. President.

1137
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: But the intent of this resolution is to have this council go in support in extending the bottle bill to NIP bottles with the hope that that will result in proper disposal and recycling of these plastic bottles that we can find just about anywhere in our community.

1138
01:46:44,784 --> 01:46:47,406
[SPEAKER_05]: River Cleanup Day, if we go down there, you'll see thousands of them.

1139
01:46:47,706 --> 01:46:51,189
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk through the parking lot down at Anthony's Liquor Store, you see them all over the place.

1140
01:46:51,869 --> 01:47:01,857
[SPEAKER_05]: They're everywhere, Mr. President, and it's become an epidemic in our community, so much so that the council thought about taking action on it, and the state delegations thought about taking action on it, and the state legislatures thought about taking action on it.

1141
01:47:02,157 --> 01:47:03,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's time to take action, Mr. President.

1142
01:47:03,859 --> 01:47:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that this council request that the city clerk be authorized with the power to draft a letter supporting House Bill 2881 and send that to our state delegation and request that they vote in favor of it.

1143
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:19,344
[SPEAKER_05]: and take whatever appropriate steps they can to get favorable recommendations out of subcommittee and make this come to a reality.

1144
01:47:20,365 --> 01:47:21,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1145
01:47:21,326 --> 01:47:22,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

1146
01:47:23,808 --> 01:47:31,094
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to add that if I'm on Facebook, Medford Square, Medford Politics, whichever group it might be, this might be the issue I see most.

1147
01:47:31,734 --> 01:47:32,975
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, there's things that come and go.

1148
01:47:32,995 --> 01:47:34,356
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a consistent issue.

1149
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:36,898
[SPEAKER_24]: And we need to address it.

1150
01:47:36,978 --> 01:47:39,240
[SPEAKER_24]: We need our state delegation to address it.

1151
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:39,701
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1152
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:41,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1153
01:47:41,772 --> 01:47:42,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

1154
01:47:42,673 --> 01:47:43,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1155
01:47:43,894 --> 01:47:45,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1156
01:47:45,195 --> 01:47:48,878
[SPEAKER_07]: He was out in front of this last year on this issue.

1157
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:52,301
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that our state delegation will support this.

1158
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:57,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there is, like he said, you know, there's not a place where you go and you don't find these little bottles all over.

1159
01:47:58,465 --> 01:47:59,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I come out of my own house every day.

1160
01:47:59,787 --> 01:48:00,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I see them.

1161
01:48:00,227 --> 01:48:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, people just dump them as they're driving by.

1162
01:48:02,469 --> 01:48:03,910
[SPEAKER_07]: But believe it or not, they're on.

1163
01:48:05,882 --> 01:48:13,670
[SPEAKER_07]: At the liquor store, they're one of the largest sellers at their, no matter what store you go into.

1164
01:48:14,111 --> 01:48:21,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I've talked to several different stores and some guys said they sell almost $1,000 a day, if not more.

1165
01:48:23,241 --> 01:48:24,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who's buying them.

1166
01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:28,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, people are buying them, and they're buying them quite frequently.

1167
01:48:28,636 --> 01:48:40,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully with this five cent deposit, similar to how people are picking up cans and bottles all over the street, hopefully people will start picking up these little small bottles too.

1168
01:48:40,683 --> 01:48:42,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wholeheartedly support this.

1169
01:48:42,904 --> 01:48:44,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1170
01:48:44,265 --> 01:48:44,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

1171
01:48:45,779 --> 01:48:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1172
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up again.

1173
01:48:48,602 --> 01:49:00,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I know last session, everyone kind of went into the virtues of collecting these and the fact that any time you do a river cleanup, any cleanup in the city, you may as well have a separate bag for nymphs because that's pretty much what you're picking up the entire time.

1174
01:49:01,554 --> 01:49:04,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, anything we can do to get these, you know,

1175
01:49:04,657 --> 01:49:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: off the streets off out of our waterways there it's obviously not just a medford problem and literally if they get thrown on the road in medford it's not just a medford problem because they're so light they go on the water they go on the drains they they blow around so anything we can do to um get all at least some of this plastic um out of our environment so i support this thank you consular morale consular beers i hate to speak twice um but i think

1176
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:47,103
[SPEAKER_24]: The other aspect of this, Councilor Caraviello, you made me think of it, is, you know, we've been talking about behavioral health and substance use disorder, and there's commission being proposed currently, and I think it might be worth, and I won't offer this as an amendment, I'll offer this as just a point of information, but I think it might be worth considering.

1177
01:49:47,623 --> 01:50:01,087
[SPEAKER_24]: what we could do around providing additional literature around addiction and substance use disorders, which I think we know, and I personally know of people in my life who are drinking nips because they have a substance use disorder.

1178
01:50:01,988 --> 01:50:02,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1179
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:07,647
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I may conclude, Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward tonight.

1180
01:50:07,707 --> 01:50:11,148
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been on top of this since day one, last session.

1181
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:14,710
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's something that I wholeheartedly support as well.

1182
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for your efforts with regard to this.

1183
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:21,573
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, please call the roll.

1184
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:22,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears?

1185
01:50:22,774 --> 01:50:22,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1186
01:50:23,854 --> 01:50:24,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Vice President Caraviello?

1187
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:25,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1188
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:25,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight?

1189
01:50:26,095 --> 01:50:26,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1190
01:50:26,596 --> 01:50:27,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks?

1191
01:50:27,396 --> 01:50:27,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1192
01:50:28,056 --> 01:50:28,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Morell?

1193
01:50:28,857 --> 01:50:29,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1194
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:30,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1195
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:33,779
[SPEAKER_18]: President Falco?

1196
01:50:34,161 --> 01:50:37,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1197
01:50:37,082 --> 01:50:46,846
[SPEAKER_10]: 2-0-039 offered by Councilor Bears.

1198
01:50:47,006 --> 01:50:57,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask the DPW to repaint the crosswalk on City Hall Mall between Harvard Vanguard and the rear of Medford City Hall.

1199
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:00,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

1200
01:51:01,214 --> 01:51:02,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you Mr. President.

1201
01:51:02,895 --> 01:51:13,625
[SPEAKER_24]: I got a message this week from a Medford resident who crosses regularly at the crosswalk that if I stood up I might be able to see from the window right here and it is pretty faded.

1202
01:51:14,365 --> 01:51:17,528
[SPEAKER_24]: It's you know this can be a pretty high speed area here on City Hall Mall.

1203
01:51:18,169 --> 01:51:23,173
[SPEAKER_24]: There's the merging traffic and then they're going back out and Harbour Vanguard's pretty high traffic.

1204
01:51:23,213 --> 01:51:25,415
[SPEAKER_24]: City Hall can be pretty high traffic and I just think

1205
01:51:26,184 --> 01:51:28,766
[SPEAKER_24]: It's important for that crosswalk to be visible for drivers.

1206
01:51:29,546 --> 01:51:33,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And I will also talk to the DPW about it myself as well this week.

1207
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:37,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1208
01:51:38,253 --> 01:51:40,794
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1209
01:51:41,675 --> 01:51:42,195
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1210
01:51:42,215 --> 01:51:42,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1211
01:51:42,776 --> 01:51:43,336
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1212
01:51:43,356 --> 01:51:44,117
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1213
01:51:47,113 --> 01:51:48,736
[SPEAKER_10]: 20-038 offered by Consul-a-Night.

1214
01:51:49,318 --> 01:51:56,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Teresa Roberti on her recent passing.

1215
01:51:58,687 --> 01:51:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1216
01:51:59,648 --> 01:52:00,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1217
01:52:01,269 --> 01:52:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, Mrs. Roberti was laid to rest, a longtime resident of Leiden Ave.

1218
01:52:06,032 --> 01:52:09,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Her husband, Nick, is a very close friend of mine, and it's very sad to see her go.

1219
01:52:10,174 --> 01:52:17,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I first met her maybe nine or ten years ago at a community event, and her daughter, and she was just a very wonderful person, very nice lady.

1220
01:52:17,659 --> 01:52:21,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Her husband, Nicky, is a great guy as well, and we're really sad to see her go.

1221
01:52:21,761 --> 01:52:23,102
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a stalwart in the neighborhood.

1222
01:52:23,702 --> 01:52:26,324
[SPEAKER_05]: a friendly face that everybody could come up and say hello to and talk to.

1223
01:52:26,344 --> 01:52:29,245
[SPEAKER_05]: She was always willing to open her door and her home to any individual in the neighborhood.

1224
01:52:30,025 --> 01:52:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, she will be sadly missed in the South Medford neighborhood of Lydon Avenue, Mr. President, as we all know, especially up that fire in South Medford and that stretch of South Medford that's a very close-knit community.

1225
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody down there knows each other, walks into each other's house without knocking the door, and so on and so forth.

1226
01:52:46,394 --> 01:52:48,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was no different for Mrs. Roberti.

1227
01:52:48,155 --> 01:52:50,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's certainly someone that will be sadly missed.

1228
01:52:50,316 --> 01:52:52,477
[SPEAKER_05]: She was an asset to this community and we're sad to see her go.

1229
01:52:52,877 --> 01:52:59,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to have my council colleagues join me in offering the deepest condolences to her family on her recent passing.

1230
01:52:59,582 --> 01:53:00,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1231
01:53:01,863 --> 01:53:12,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved at 2-0-040, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time resident Gerard Edouard on his recent passing.

1232
01:53:15,663 --> 01:53:16,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Chancellor Marks.

1233
01:53:17,344 --> 01:53:19,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1234
01:53:19,164 --> 01:53:23,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Gerard was a true family man that lived in this community for a number of years.

1235
01:53:25,346 --> 01:53:31,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, someone that always had a smile on his face and was willing to lend a hand if need be.

1236
01:53:32,088 --> 01:53:39,311
[SPEAKER_16]: He is also the father of our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent.

1237
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:42,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And he will surely be missed, Mr. President.

1238
01:53:43,001 --> 01:53:44,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1239
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:51,804
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, I would ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence, thoughts and prayers with their families.

1240
01:54:11,894 --> 01:54:14,918
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more paper, Councilman.

1241
01:54:16,741 --> 01:54:17,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Caraviello.

1242
01:54:41,598 --> 01:54:41,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1243
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:45,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Falco, 20041.

1244
01:54:45,424 --> 01:54:56,760
[SPEAKER_07]: We resolve that the mayor issue an executive order prohibiting the boards and commissions from meeting prior to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

1245
01:54:59,241 --> 01:54:59,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1246
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:01,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1247
01:55:01,903 --> 01:55:07,467
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an issue that we've discussed as a council and a body for a number of years, and we were moving in the right direction.

1248
01:55:07,487 --> 01:55:11,630
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of our meetings were being scheduled after 6 PM in the night for our boards and commissions.

1249
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:15,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been running into some circumstances with certain boards and commissions, a meeting.

1250
01:55:16,775 --> 01:55:25,665
[SPEAKER_05]: At a time of the day that's not conducive to doing business with residents of the general public, people that work for a living and have a concern in the neighborhood can't attend a meeting because they have other obligations.

1251
01:55:26,626 --> 01:55:33,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So back several years ago, we requested that Mayor Burke make changes to the meeting structure and the boards and commissions were all meeting after 5 p.m.

1252
01:55:33,814 --> 01:55:34,035
[SPEAKER_05]: at night.

1253
01:55:34,495 --> 01:55:36,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was all well and good for a period of time.

1254
01:55:36,658 --> 01:55:41,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as time passed, so did the stringency of those requirements, Mr. President.

1255
01:55:42,024 --> 01:55:52,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And certain boards and commissions are now meeting at a time that's not really conducive to conducting business in the government sphere for quality of life issues in the neighborhood, such as the traffic commission, for example.

1256
01:55:53,117 --> 01:56:00,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we had some discussions in our priority meeting about what direction the council should be going in over this next term.

1257
01:56:00,943 --> 01:56:03,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that came up was the meeting times of boards and commissions.

1258
01:56:04,366 --> 01:56:12,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And while the boards and commissions don't fall under council purview and do have some autonomy, they also do fall under the branch of the executive.

1259
01:56:13,232 --> 01:56:20,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mayor does have the power and authority to issue an executive directive or an executive order that would say that they're not allowed to meet before 6 p.m.

1260
01:56:21,298 --> 01:56:28,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday through Friday so that people that live in this community, but also work for a living, will have the ability to come to these meetings and participate in their government.

1261
01:56:28,442 --> 01:56:31,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the intent behind this proposal, Mr. President.

1262
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:37,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that Councilor Falco and I spoke about before the meeting this evening, and it's something that I hope my council colleagues will join me in supporting.

1263
01:56:38,587 --> 01:56:38,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1264
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:39,748
[SPEAKER_05]: President Falco.

1265
01:56:40,302 --> 01:56:42,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1266
01:56:42,603 --> 01:56:45,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I'm in full support of this.

1267
01:56:45,364 --> 01:56:48,565
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that many residents have called about.

1268
01:56:50,126 --> 01:56:56,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our goal is always to try to get more people involved in government in what's happening throughout the community.

1269
01:56:56,849 --> 01:57:02,952
[SPEAKER_10]: And a way of doing this is to actually have meetings that make sense for the majority of the population.

1270
01:57:02,992 --> 01:57:06,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Having meetings during the afternoon does not work for a lot of people.

1271
01:57:06,593 --> 01:57:10,937
[SPEAKER_10]: And for many people throughout our community, you know, having meetings at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

1272
01:57:10,957 --> 01:57:14,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Councilor Marks, you mentioned it earlier with regard to the Verizon hearing.

1273
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that doesn't make sense.

1274
01:57:16,722 --> 01:57:21,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really make sense to have meetings at 2 o'clock in the afternoon if you want the general public to attend.

1275
01:57:21,766 --> 01:57:22,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people are working.

1276
01:57:23,047 --> 01:57:24,549
[SPEAKER_10]: They're picking up their kids from school.

1277
01:57:25,309 --> 01:57:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: They might have other appointments as well.

1278
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:28,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, you know, having meetings anytime after 6 p.m.

1279
01:57:30,073 --> 01:57:31,214
[SPEAKER_10]: makes complete sense.

1280
01:57:31,614 --> 01:57:56,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the general public can come to meetings at that time, and I think it's something that we need to make sure that this happens, to make sure that, you know, in the sense of transparency, in the sense of getting people involved in what's going on throughout the community, I think it'd be in the benefit of most people throughout this community, and the city in general, that we make sure that these meetings are held, you know, anytime after 6 p.m.

1281
01:57:56,669 --> 01:57:57,510
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you very much.

1282
01:57:57,710 --> 01:57:58,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1283
01:57:58,190 --> 01:57:59,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, as well.

1284
01:58:00,572 --> 01:58:01,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a morale.

1285
01:58:01,713 --> 01:58:02,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. President.

1286
01:58:02,493 --> 01:58:05,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank counselors Falco a night for bringing this forward.

1287
01:58:05,175 --> 01:58:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I raised at our legislative meeting.

1288
01:58:08,338 --> 01:58:11,280
[SPEAKER_04]: The commission that I get the most questions about is is the traffic commission.

1289
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:16,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one at least the one that meets at a time that's really hard to me for people to get to.

1290
01:58:16,584 --> 01:58:21,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important that we make these meetings accessible and it goes a long way.

1291
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in goodwill and people understanding how to move things forward, how to get issues addressed that they face all the time moving throughout the city.

1292
01:58:29,722 --> 01:58:32,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So I fully support this resolution.

1293
01:58:33,509 --> 01:58:33,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1294
01:58:35,506 --> 01:58:36,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

1295
01:58:37,267 --> 01:58:38,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1296
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:39,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with the intent.

1297
01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:45,031
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not quite sure an executive order, uh, would be the Avenue.

1298
01:58:45,051 --> 01:58:54,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and the reason why I say that is traffic commission is set up by state statute and they're an autonomous, as the councilor mentioned, an autonomous body.

1299
01:58:55,057 --> 01:58:59,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not sure enough executive directive can change that.

1300
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but I think it's,

1301
01:59:02,779 --> 01:59:12,501
[SPEAKER_16]: worthy to ask, or maybe you can ask more of a general question, if the mayor would be willing to reach out to the different boards and commissions to see if she can get a buy-in.

1302
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:14,801
[SPEAKER_16]: But either way, I support it.

1303
01:59:15,922 --> 01:59:24,303
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe strongly that, as my council colleagues mentioned, that these meetings should be open to everyone to attend, and during the day is just not adequate enough.

1304
01:59:25,404 --> 01:59:26,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So I support it.

1305
01:59:26,944 --> 01:59:27,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1306
01:59:28,104 --> 01:59:32,566
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight and Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1307
01:59:33,807 --> 01:59:34,668
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1308
01:59:35,568 --> 01:59:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1309
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:40,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

1310
01:59:41,991 --> 01:59:42,572
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1311
01:59:44,693 --> 01:59:45,473
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

1312
01:59:56,704 --> 02:00:04,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Reports of committees, 2-0-017, Committee of the Whole meeting report, Wednesday, January 15, 2020 at 6 p.m.

1313
02:00:05,087 --> 02:00:07,828
[SPEAKER_10]: in room 207, Council Office, Medford City Hall.

1314
02:00:08,288 --> 02:00:15,991
[SPEAKER_10]: We met last Wednesday as a Committee of the Whole to discuss the priorities for the Medford City Council for this year, 2020.

1315
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:16,371
[SPEAKER_10]: We went through

1316
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:31,472
[SPEAKER_10]: A number of items ranging from the basic city services and how to actually provide them more efficiently.

1317
02:00:32,693 --> 02:00:37,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked a little bit about headcount in each of the departments and hopefully increasing headcount.

1318
02:00:38,239 --> 02:00:42,403
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about meetings, regular meetings with department heads ahead of the budget season.

1319
02:00:42,443 --> 02:00:44,085
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we have any questions we can ask them.

1320
02:00:44,645 --> 02:00:46,806
[SPEAKER_10]: before the budget is crafted for the upcoming year.

1321
02:00:48,427 --> 02:00:52,350
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked a little bit about strategic about a strategic master plan.

1322
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:57,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about meeting with the mayor and we will I'll be scheduling that soon.

1323
02:00:57,753 --> 02:01:04,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be reaching out to the mayor's office to discuss our priorities with her so we can invite her to committee the whole meeting.

1324
02:01:04,837 --> 02:01:07,519
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about housing, inclusionary zoning,

1325
02:01:10,169 --> 02:01:12,299
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the traffic commission meetings as well.

1326
02:01:12,922 --> 02:01:13,987
[SPEAKER_10]: We also talked about

1327
02:01:16,657 --> 02:01:41,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see we talked about actually the city council Having a legal services line item so that the council can have its own legal counsel of various priorities including city ordinances in other Items, and I think that's something that the council agrees on would go a long way Especially the number of ordinances that we're trying to write at this point in time We talked about revenue priorities.

1328
02:01:41,297 --> 02:01:45,460
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about various ordinances that we have to work on in the upcoming year and

1329
02:01:46,147 --> 02:01:50,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about citywide technology, pedestrian safety.

1330
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,531
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the behavioral health commission.

1331
02:01:54,732 --> 02:01:59,655
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about breweries ordinance, food trucks.

1332
02:02:02,193 --> 02:02:03,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Talked a little bit about taxes.

1333
02:02:04,474 --> 02:02:11,278
[SPEAKER_10]: So the meeting wasn't limited to that, but we talked about a far-ranging number of issues and priorities for the upcoming year.

1334
02:02:11,999 --> 02:02:19,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And to say the least, it will be a very busy year, a lot of meetings, but I think there's a lot of work that needs to get done, and I know we can get it done together.

1335
02:02:20,483 --> 02:02:27,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello to approve the committee report, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1336
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:29,168
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could?

1337
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:30,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, of course.

1338
02:02:30,765 --> 02:02:31,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Karl Marx.

1339
02:02:32,046 --> 02:02:33,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1340
02:02:33,066 --> 02:02:33,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1341
02:02:33,886 --> 02:02:39,369
[SPEAKER_16]: There were a lot of great ideas and priorities brought up during this meeting.

1342
02:02:40,029 --> 02:02:46,392
[SPEAKER_16]: The one thing that I am grateful, and I believe you were the first to bring it up, were the pre-budget meetings.

1343
02:02:46,452 --> 02:02:46,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1344
02:02:47,212 --> 02:02:56,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Because for many years, we were, as a council, I believe, and I won't speak for everyone, but I think there was a sense of frustration once we got the budget.

1345
02:02:57,557 --> 02:02:59,338
[SPEAKER_16]: It was already in ink.

1346
02:03:00,459 --> 02:03:12,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And our only authority was really to cut from the bottom line and not to offer suggestions, like I think many of us have, on ways of improving how government operates.

1347
02:03:12,838 --> 02:03:14,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's very helpful that

1348
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:25,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn now is talking about us looking at the budget and potentially April, which has never happened in my 18 years on the council.

1349
02:03:25,929 --> 02:03:39,000
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look forward to actually a preview of the budget where we can have some input before it goes into final status on obtaining some of the priorities and important measures that we see as a body.

1350
02:03:39,361 --> 02:03:40,121
[SPEAKER_16]: There's seven of us.

1351
02:03:40,822 --> 02:03:53,565
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we're out in the streets, we're listening to constituents, we receive the same emails and phone calls, and what better advice or counsel to have than members of this council when you are putting together the budget.

1352
02:03:54,006 --> 02:03:57,046
[SPEAKER_16]: And that has never happened since I've been on this council.

1353
02:03:57,386 --> 02:04:10,010
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look forward under your leadership, along with this new mayor, to actually sit down around the table and discuss not only the mayor's priorities, but our priorities and how do we incorporate that in a budget process.

1354
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:12,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1355
02:04:12,659 --> 02:04:26,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking to, like I said, schedule a meeting soon with the mayor, and have the mayor come to Committee of the Whole so we can all talk together, and then we'll hopefully schedule some department head meetings after that to get working on those issues.

1356
02:04:27,042 --> 02:04:29,303
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point, I recognize Councilor Caraviello.

1357
02:04:29,543 --> 02:04:34,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1358
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,924
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the budget.

1359
02:04:36,944 --> 02:04:38,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask... We'll talk about the budget again.

1360
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:47,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask you to convey this to the mayor, and it's something that's been a sore spot since the day I've been on this council, is that we have an actual budget.

1361
02:04:48,504 --> 02:04:52,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've had it for a couple of years, and then we didn't have it.

1362
02:04:52,225 --> 02:04:56,327
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I don't wanna just see what's proposed.

1363
02:04:56,447 --> 02:05:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, like we had a couple of budgets ago, we saw what was spent in the past.

1364
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:08,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, if we could have that again going forward, if we could relay that to the mayor before we get the budget, that we get an actual budget,

1365
02:05:09,895 --> 02:05:10,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just spreadsheets.

1366
02:05:10,816 --> 02:05:12,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just a spreadsheet, but a real budget.

1367
02:05:13,218 --> 02:05:20,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Back a few years ago, when I first got on the council, that was one of my big priorities, was getting a budget with a narrative.

1368
02:05:20,524 --> 02:05:24,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We did, we did have it for a couple of years, and then it got lost, I don't know where it went.

1369
02:05:24,828 --> 02:05:29,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, so we're hoping to continue forward with that, and I would think and hope that the mayor would as well.

1370
02:05:29,272 --> 02:05:35,397
[SPEAKER_07]: That was something I asked for my first year on the council, when I got my first budget, was I kind of flabbergasted at what I saw.

1371
02:05:36,263 --> 02:05:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1372
02:05:36,543 --> 02:05:36,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_10]: Consulate Beers.

1375
02:05:38,724 --> 02:05:39,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Very quickly.

1376
02:05:39,504 --> 02:05:44,585
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to say I think the legal counsel issue is incredibly important and also that we get official city emails.

1377
02:05:45,125 --> 02:05:45,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1378
02:05:46,106 --> 02:05:46,426

1388
