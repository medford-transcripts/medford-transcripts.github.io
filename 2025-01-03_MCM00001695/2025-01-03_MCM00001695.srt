1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:00,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:02,932
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the City of Medford Conservation Commission.

3
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:05,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Opening up our hearing.

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:12,634
[SPEAKER_19]: We have one item for the first in the agenda that we're actually going to be asking for continuance.

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,634
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to move forward on that first.

6
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:22,636
[SPEAKER_19]: A notice of intent for Mystic River Road improvements, DEP file number 215-0239, which is continued from the last hearing on December 4th.

7
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:37,382
[SPEAKER_19]: City has is the city's engineering office is working on getting the documents that the board requested, but weren't able to get them in the 2 weeks timeframe.

8
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:41,605
[SPEAKER_19]: So, we are asking continuance until the new year.

9
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:43,086
[SPEAKER_19]: To work on them.

10
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:57,718
[SPEAKER_19]: The next possible meeting date we could have is the 8th, but the city engineer requested today if we could just ask for continuance until January 22nd just to make sure with the Christmas holidays that everything gets done prior to that hearing.

11
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,660
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sorry, Dennis, which project is this for?

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,100
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the, oh, sorry, Mr. Grover Road.

13
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the Duggar Park project.

14
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Right around Duggar Park, yeah, exactly, sorry.

15
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,664
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a few Mystic River things going on.

16
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:16,985
[SPEAKER_19]: That is true, you're not wrong.

17
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:17,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, apologies.

18
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:23,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, DEP file number 215-0239, the Mystic River road improvements.

19
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:28,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, so you are the proponent.

20
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:29,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

21
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:36,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're asking the commission, and so do we have to vote on that?

22
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to vote to continue until

23
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,302
[SPEAKER_19]: January 22nd, yes.

24
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, then I can have a motion, please.

25
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:51,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a motion to continue the hearing for notice of intent DEP file number 215-0239 until January 22nd of 2025.

26
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:51,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

27
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

28
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:53,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Caroline?

29
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:53,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

30
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:53,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric?

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:53,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather?

33
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Craig?

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy.

37
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:15,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I myself as an eye.

38
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:16,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

39
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:24,912
[SPEAKER_19]: So in our next time when the agenda is a notice of intent for 28 Sycamore Avenue DT file number 215-0238 continued from December 4th, 2024.

40
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:35,663
[SPEAKER_19]: NRL Medford I LLC has tried to notice of intent for proposed expansion of an existing parking lot at 28 Sycamore Avenue.

41
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:41,026
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposal will accommodate 15 additional vehicles and will consist of pervious asphalt over an existing gravel area.

42
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:44,388
[SPEAKER_19]: The proposed parking lot is within isolated land subject to flooding.

43
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dennis.

44
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

45
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:55,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Salvo, if you could please present the project to the commission, we'd appreciate it.

46
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:56,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

47
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:56,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

48
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, my name is Rick Salvo with Engineering Alliance.

49
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here this evening on behalf of the proponent.

50
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:12,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with me as well, the new owners of this property, Andy and Ben Dulac, they acquired the property about two years ago.

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They are working towards trying to fill that building, which is what has brought us here this evening.

52
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:27,077
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can share my screen, it looks like I have the ability.

53
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that work?

54
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:33,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone see my screen?

55
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So this property is located at 28 Sycamore Avenue.

56
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the subject of a notice of intent many years ago, I think around 2004, ultimately got built in 2010.

57
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:59,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, this was the original building footprint that exists on site, and this large addition was permitted and constructed back then.

58
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:05,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If I switch to an aerial figure just to kind of put it in perspective, this was the original building.

59
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:16,462
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the expansion that was built, and part of this parking lot expansion was built as part of that same expansion.

60
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:22,166
[SPEAKER_03]: This was originally proposed to be an industrial building.

61
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:28,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The uses that are in that building right now are far from industrial.

62
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:37,137
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an arch storage facility that's in there right now that takes up about 1,400 square feet.

63
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:55,565
[SPEAKER_03]: They're currently in negotiations to lease about 14,000 square feet of the building to a gym, and then the remainder of the building they're expecting would most likely be leased to someone for some form of storage.

64
00:04:56,885 --> 00:05:04,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So that requires a total of 60 spaces, and there are not currently 60 spaces on site.

65
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:12,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here this evening to do a modest expansion of the parking lot to try to add about 15 spaces in this area here.

66
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:19,626
[SPEAKER_03]: The resource areas that are on site are isolated land subject to flooding.

67
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:29,194
[SPEAKER_03]: In the interest of full disclosure, we did not recalculate the limits of land subject to, isolated land subject to flooding.

68
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:37,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We simply used the same elevation that was permitted under the previous filing under DEP file number 215-0129.

69
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And there would be sort of an apples to apples comparison.

70
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:54,882
[SPEAKER_03]: The area where the parking lot would be exposed would be this area here, be about 15 spaces would be added.

71
00:05:56,163 --> 00:06:04,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, this is an existing loading dock, and there's sort of a hardpan gravel in this area right here.

72
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposal would be to take this hardpan gravel area and this, what I would call an existing area, but it had all been previously degraded.

73
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,954
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of humps and bumps in there.

74
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:20,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Smooth that out.

75
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:35,790
[SPEAKER_03]: install a pervious pavement section to try to create as little impact as possible, try to stick with more of a low-impact design measure in that area, also to meet the stormwater standards.

76
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:51,997
[SPEAKER_03]: and enable us to basically keep the existing topography with some minor cuts and fills in that area, knowing that this area would still be allowed to flood.

77
00:06:52,017 --> 00:07:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: The stone in the pavement layer would certainly create more flood storage capacity that exists today, and also,

78
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:11,984
[SPEAKER_03]: plant some form of evergreen planting around that parking to keep it screened.

79
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first embarked on this project and went to the site, you couldn't see the neighborhood over here through the trees.

80
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:27,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there today and with all the trees down, you can see the neighborhood clear as day.

81
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we've shown arborvitaes on here.

82
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not necessarily married to the arborvitae idea.

83
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:52,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to plant whatever would be the pleasure of the commission, but we certainly would propose an evergreen type planting in that area to provide us a good solid screen there.

84
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That's essentially the proposal.

85
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:03,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We did go there today to evaluate the tree loss that would happen.

86
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:12,685
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be about seven trees that would need to come down in order to facilitate this particular configuration.

87
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:20,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seven trees would be made up of six trees that are about five to six inch caliper.

88
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And 1 tree that's a lot treats a 36 inch caliber.

89
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:30,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think with that, I'd be happy to turn it back to the commission for any questions or comments.

90
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:42,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I see that we have a lot of numbers of the public here that I was interested in this project, but before we hear from them, I would like to.

91
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn discussion over to the commission and have our.

92
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,864
[SPEAKER_11]: listen to our questions and comments.

93
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:54,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to kick it off?

94
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:56,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to.

95
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a I think a fairly straightforward technical question Mr. Salvo.

96
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:10,878
[SPEAKER_04]: In your narrative in the proposed conditions you identify a four-inch reservoir course and then it's shown as six inches on the plan.

97
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:16,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is working in your favor but I just wanted to clarify which was the proposed condition.

98
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:23,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the six inch is what we had in the calculations.

99
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the four inch was just a typo.

100
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

101
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:40,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I would just ask if you could confirm that with Dennis at some point.

102
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I had nothing further.

103
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:44,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be happy to.

104
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:45,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

105
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Salvo, I have a question for you about existing trees.

106
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned about seven trees that would need to be removed.

107
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at the drawing that's on the screen here.

108
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:04,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the existing condition survey below there, it's quite a bit more than seven trees.

109
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:12,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you provide a drawing that elaborates on the tree removal and maybe some part of the narrative?

110
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:17,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I saw mention of the tree removal in the narrative that was submitted.

111
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies if I missed it.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would be happy to.

113
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I went through and counted them today.

114
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,425
[SPEAKER_03]: There were seven, so we'll be happy to do that.

115
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll also mention, I think, with that, that information will be really helpful, but I wonder if it's worth the Conservation Commission making a site visit to see this at some point to get a better understanding of the condition there for ourselves.

116
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be an excellent idea because it really needs to be looked at.

117
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can show it on a plan, but, you know, to physically see it, I think it would be a very good thing.

118
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, I appreciate that.

119
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:08,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last thought here is I see that you're trying to do some, you know, some screening, something beneficial to try and block the view of the parking.

120
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:15,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask you to take another look at the species of tree or shrub that you're putting in there.

121
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:18,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's consider something that's maybe native.

122
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there could be some diversity or variety in that.

123
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to learn a little bit more about the vegetation that's there.

124
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:35,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there may be as much value in something that's contributing ecologically as it is to the screening that we should consider there, so.

125
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:37,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree and happy to do that.

126
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:38,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

127
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:43,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I can go.

128
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:46,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Heidi, do you want to go?

129
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just wanted to clarify.

130
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,362
[SPEAKER_11]: You did say that, and I see on the notice, that the limit of the ILSF is at elevation 19.9, and that is from what year?

131
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:01,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, I think that notice of intent was originally filed in 2004.

132
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:23,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to recalculate it too, based on the current condition, but I just, I thought it was more appropriate to keep the resource areas the same as what was previously reviewed.

133
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:32,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the commission might have concern that a 20-year-old delineation may not be accurate, but we can discuss further.

134
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:53,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the one thing that would certainly change in that delineation would be what is the rainfall intensity of a 1% annual rainfall, which would obviously be different today than previous standards, but we thought that this was an appropriate starting point.

135
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

136
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:00,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Salva, I do have a few questions.

137
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:13,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also appreciate either seeing whatever the calculations are based on, if you have them from 2004 or the new calculations.

138
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:22,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And any idea, is this water coming from the groundwater or the surface water or both?

139
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:25,033
[SPEAKER_05]: What is contributing to the flooding?

140
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:26,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Surface water.

141
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:27,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Surface water, okay.

142
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:42,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there any, the boundary of the isolated land subject to flooding, is that, was that the maximum extent of flooding or was there an outlet that was, it was draining to?

143
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think there can't be an inlet or an outlet for it to be an ILSF by definition.

144
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:50,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

145
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:56,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did look at the regulations in the DEP policy today.

146
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't calculated those before.

147
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:06,114
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll rely on either new calculations or seeing what was done back in 2004.

148
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:13,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned in the narrative that there would be soil testing in the future.

149
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that happened yet?

150
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It has not happened yet.

151
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:23,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't happen, you know, on purpose, knowing how close we were to a residential neighborhood.

152
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that this was sort of a sensitive area with a lot of the, as you can see, with the amount of abutters that are here today.

153
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was back in 2004.

154
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing we wanted to do was bring an excavator on site and start punching holes before we came before this commission and alerted everyone to what the proposal was.

155
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:42,894
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to do that.

156
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil testing is part of this process, but

157
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to start off with an excavator showing on site.

158
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd prefer to start off with a presentation and let everyone know what the proposal was.

159
00:14:57,447 --> 00:15:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that might be a point of discussion for the rest of the commission members.

160
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be interested.

161
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:11,640
[SPEAKER_05]: In some type of written submittal of how this project meets the performance standards for the resource area.

162
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:19,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see that explicitly, but I would like just written so we can all see how it meets the performance standards.

163
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:19,748
[SPEAKER_05]: If it does.

164
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:24,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You answered my tree question.

165
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did see that I think it was checked off that this was a redevelopment.

166
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:36,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears that this is new development and would need to meet the stormwater standards fully.

167
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:41,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually checked the box of mix of redevelopment and new development.

168
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,753
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some redevelopment that'll happen in this area over here, and this is all new development.

169
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:47,753
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

170
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:50,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So the parking space are in the new development is what?

171
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

172
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

173
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that needs to meet the.

174
00:15:54,592 --> 00:16:00,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, some of the work will occur in a redeveloped area and part of the and then the remainder of the work is new development.

175
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:09,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on the stormwater topic, low impact developments required to be considered.

176
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see that any were.

177
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:21,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you had checked off that it wasn't in a wetland resource area as a low impact development, but it is.

178
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,112
[SPEAKER_05]: in ILSF.

179
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an ILSF.

180
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:27,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't in BVW though.

181
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what I meant.

182
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:30,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I misunderstood that.

183
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:32,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

184
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:40,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask you to go back and look at some LID measures that could be implemented here.

185
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:57,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And go ahead, I just wanted to thank you and I think we specifically need to see a demonstration that the project meets the performance standards under 10.574 B1.

186
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Blood damage due to filling.

187
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:22,905
[SPEAKER_11]: A proposed project in ILSF shall not result in flood damage due to filling, which causes lateral displacement of water that would otherwise be confined within said area.

188
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Caroline, is that all you had?

189
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:25,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I can jump in it.

190
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:29,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I had two more, but I'm going to pause and let you go.

191
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

192
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:46,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Rick are we generally going in at grade with this previous slot or I think have you done a cut field analysis for that change in volume?

193
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:52,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we're the intent is to go in at grade there is one area

194
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:06,591
[SPEAKER_03]: basically in here, based on my observation today, where there might be a slight fill, I got to get some more topographic information to be able to identify that.

195
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the topographic information that we had wasn't quite tight enough.

196
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:22,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it'll be obvious if we do a site visit out there, you'll see there's some like micro humps and bumps in there that didn't show up in the contours and probably need to be accounted for.

197
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:22,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

198
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, that, that makes sense.

199
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:31,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a cut fill analysis would be really valuable here.

200
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:40,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I think in general, characterizing existing conditions a little further would go a long way to kind of quantify impacts.

201
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:47,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, on that, I think, uh, getting some soil testing would be huge.

202
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, I pulled web soil survey.

203
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,354
[SPEAKER_15]: I know USDA has this as, as type A.

204
00:18:55,267 --> 00:19:04,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, given the hydro quality and given that this is a low point, I don't think I trust, uh, the USDA survey on this.

205
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:10,836
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, I think that would be really valuable, uh, doing, doing a test better too.

206
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:19,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, if the test bits show that this doesn't line up with web soil might be worth getting an infiltration test.

207
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:23,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I mean, on that.

208
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:41,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, you know, looking at the design standards for pervious paving in the mass stormwater manual, you know, given the kind of historical knowledge that we've gotten from some of the residents, it sounds like we may have a really shallow water table.

209
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,581
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm a little concerned about meeting the two-foot setback to water table with pervious paving.

210
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:54,442
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's also a setback in the stormwater standards for

211
00:19:55,949 --> 00:20:00,151
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, pervious paving of a 10-foot setback from slab foundations.

212
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:12,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, that this is right against the slab foundation for the older, uh, building on this property.

213
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:21,341
[SPEAKER_15]: So we want to kind of look at that and make sure that what we're proposing here kind of lines up with the performance standards that we've got on the books.

214
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:32,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, to that, LID measures may go a way to kind of help kind of get over the step there.

215
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:39,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Has there been, actually, let me just look at my notes here.

216
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:44,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Has there been any other alternative analysis in terms of kind of stormwater drainage from this?

217
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:50,470
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like you guys have a smattering of the BMPs across the site.

218
00:20:51,325 --> 00:21:02,322
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like you guys are pressed for grade kind of working in the subsurface, but is there any way of tying in drainage from this area to the existing site system?

219
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:08,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

220
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:14,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it'd be possible.

221
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:22,553
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole reason why we went with the pervious solution was to not extensively raise grades.

222
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I shared the same concern and it was something that I expect to do after this meeting is I'd like to schedule some soil testing and really get an idea of where the groundwater table is.

223
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:51,771
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole reason why the pervious pavement solution was chosen was to not create a big fill in this area, try to work with the existing topography to the maximum extent possible here so as to minimize any impact to the ILSF.

224
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:56,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally understand that.

225
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,876
[SPEAKER_15]: It is absolutely a good first step.

226
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:05,338
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad that this wasn't opened up with asphalt and getting negotiated down from there.

227
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:11,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, 1 other consideration towards kind of existing conditions.

228
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,104
[SPEAKER_15]: The hydro modeling that you guys have done so far only shows proposed conditions.

229
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:26,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Having hydro for both existing proposed and kind of the soil test and can go to kind of.

230
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Support this to show net change and run off from the site.

231
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:36,394
[SPEAKER_15]: May be useful to demonstrate, you know, if if we, if this previous paving is a viable option.

232
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:44,519
[SPEAKER_15]: It can, it might demonstrate decrease in runoff, depending how that soil test comes back.

233
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,362
[SPEAKER_15]: But I definitely want to see pre to post.

234
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:53,045
[SPEAKER_15]: In the stormwater report and having a table to kind of summarize that in the narrative would be really useful.

235
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:55,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, not a problem.

236
00:22:55,416 --> 00:23:03,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, you know, if the soils are there, you know, mathematically, it would have to result in that improvement.

237
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be impossible for it to work any other way.

238
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:17,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we go on, I have to request that the individual from the public who is posting chat items please refrain from doing so.

239
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not believe that meets the open hearing laws.

240
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:34,424
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not something that is recorded or in writing, and please do put your concerns in writing and address them to the Conservation Commission, but chat messages are not appropriate during a hearing.

241
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:35,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

242
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:44,782
[SPEAKER_15]: In only one other comment, my review is generally focused on the stormwater standards.

243
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:57,154
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see a construction period O&M plan that meets the kind of the checklist items beyond just the straw waddles on the design plans.

244
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:09,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of making sure that standards 8 and 9 are both fully met and meet the full set of checklists in the stormwater checklist document would be would be useful.

245
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:11,499
Okay, got it.

246
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:14,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's all I've got for now.

247
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:15,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Caroline, if you want to jump back in.

248
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:16,904
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all yours.

249
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:17,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

250
00:24:17,685 --> 00:24:18,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

251
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 in the certificate of compliance that was issued in 2010, the continuing condition was the performance of the maintenance plan.

252
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking to see if you have records.

253
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:39,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Showing what maintenance has been done, say, in the last 3 years that you could share with us.

254
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:42,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy to reach back to the owner.

255
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this owner is only on the property for just under two years, but I will find out hopefully those records exist, but we would be happy to provide whatever does exist.

256
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:54,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and the last.

257
00:24:57,223 --> 00:25:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: item is I appreciate any insight or a summary of any oil and hazardous waste material that may be on the site or was on the site and remediated in where that is in relation to this project and how that impacts the project.

258
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

259
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:16,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

260
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,301
[SPEAKER_11]: And to clarify comments from the

261
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:23,139
[SPEAKER_11]: public will get a chance to speak.

262
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:32,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Comments need to be either written or in writing, posted to the commission or verbally spoken of.

263
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:36,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat comments are not part of the public record.

264
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Heidi, I have a couple of questions.

265
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do go, Heather.

266
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

267
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, much of it has been covered already, but certainly a planting plan that would provide more native species, especially if it does turn out that there is existing wildlife there.

268
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:01,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious about the 36-inch caliper tree.

269
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:05,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious what the variety is.

270
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:14,426
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also was wondering, because there's been mention in some of the letters from the abutters of nesting red-tailed hawks,

271
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:19,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I would definitely be interested in making a site visit.

272
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:27,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the last thing, which I thought Carolyn was going to add, was what are we talking about in terms of snow removal and storage?

273
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this obviously is right on.

274
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:36,027
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't have snow storage in that area.

275
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:39,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a plan, Rick, that you folks have already thought about?

276
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:44,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me get with the with the owner on that, you know, where there is an existing site.

277
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,992
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this isn't a brand new parking lot.

278
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find out what their means and methods are.

279
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:53,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to speak for him, but let me find out what his means and methods are.

280
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be happy to get you some info on that.

281
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:56,514
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be good.

282
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be including salting and that as well, not just storage, but plumbing storage.

283
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:08,557
[SPEAKER_10]: But what is there, especially since you one of my other one of the other commissioners already talked about are there.

284
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,479
[SPEAKER_10]: where is this water draining?

285
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:15,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this point, it looks like it's pretty much remaining in and around the area.

286
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:17,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

287
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:19,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

288
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:27,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Heidi, I will make one other just observation.

289
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:34,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the commission's on the right track with the inland or

290
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:45,618
[SPEAKER_15]: I say the plan subject to flooding elevations being 20 years out of date, but I will note that the entire project is within that ILSF boundary as it stands now.

291
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:56,122
[SPEAKER_15]: So while it is worth having more up-to-date numbers, that won't necessarily change the facts on the ground of the applicability of the project to the WPI.

292
00:27:57,382 --> 00:27:57,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

293
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,243
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good observation.

294
00:27:59,263 --> 00:27:59,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Craig.

295
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:02,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, likely isn't going to go down.

296
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:04,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

297
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there was a flood storage capacity that was added as part of the previous project but I get the point.

298
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:30,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you speak, I'd like you to please introduce yourselves and state your address.

299
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:37,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a lot of people, obviously, so if you could limit your comments, if possible, to three minutes, we'd appreciate it.

300
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:42,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that somebody has prepared a PDF that they would like to present, is that true?

301
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, yes?

302
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:54,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Heidi, may I also suggest that if people wish to make comments that they raise their hand in the Zoom function,

303
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:58,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way, Dennis or a commission member could call on them in order.

304
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:01,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent suggestion.

305
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:01,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

306
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're calling in by phone, I see there are a couple of people that have dialed in.

307
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:12,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You can press star 9 to raise your hand and star 6 to unmute yourself.

308
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:17,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

309
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:20,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I understand that somebody has a presentation.

310
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:23,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct, Dennis?

311
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:31,269
[SPEAKER_19]: That is correct, Mr. D'Angelo sent us some information earlier.

312
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a second, John?

313
00:29:38,732 --> 00:29:39,352
[SPEAKER_19]: You are all set.

314
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,054
[SPEAKER_19]: We cannot hear you, John.

315
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:49,896
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not on mute, but... I was... There we go.

316
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:51,036
[SPEAKER_18]: I was unmuted.

317
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:52,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

318
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I'm going to share my screen.

319
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:10,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

320
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:11,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, everybody.

321
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,406
[SPEAKER_18]: So here's the site that you've seen already.

322
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,868
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically what we're looking at... Oh, sorry.

323
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:19,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Just before you start, can you just get your name and address for the record?

324
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,493
[SPEAKER_18]: John D'Angelo, 30 Sherman Place.

325
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:29,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we're looking at is this strip of land right here.

326
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:36,903
[SPEAKER_18]: The measurement from Sherman Place, from the middle of Sherman Place to the wall is about 99 feet according to Google Maps.

327
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:41,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And the proposed work is going to come in more than half of that.

328
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:43,645
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll show that in the next couple of slides.

329
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:51,670
[SPEAKER_18]: So this plan was the original one that was sent with the original notice of intent at the time.

330
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:57,013
[SPEAKER_18]: It did not mention that this was the only area that was crushed stone or gravel.

331
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:08,659
[SPEAKER_18]: But just to clarify, and it was updated this morning by the contractor, but we have from the wall out to this edge here is about 21 feet.

332
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:17,321
[SPEAKER_18]: But you need, according to the plan and the depth of these parking spots, you need about 44 feet or so, not including this planting area.

333
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:20,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And by scale, this looks like it could be another eight to 10 feet.

334
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:24,423
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where I have this 55 feet approximately, 53, 55 feet, something to that matter.

335
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,460
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to point that out.

336
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,782
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the rest of these, all these parking spots in the planting area would be in that wetland habitat.

337
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:37,123
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is just the view.

338
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:38,804
[SPEAKER_18]: This was taken on Sunday.

339
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,784
[SPEAKER_18]: You notice my measuring wheel is here.

340
00:31:41,184 --> 00:31:43,385
[SPEAKER_18]: From the wall, it comes out 21 feet.

341
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a little spot here that kind of cuts out a little bit, but the rest in general is about 21 feet.

342
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,494
[SPEAKER_18]: But that extent of the paving would come out to this 44 feet.

343
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:56,555
[SPEAKER_18]: So this includes all these trees here.

344
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,998
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to disagree with Mr. Salvo.

345
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I do believe that there's more than seven trees.

346
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,942
[SPEAKER_18]: There are multiple larger trees that you can see just from this view alone.

347
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:09,285
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are others off camera, off to the left as well.

348
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:19,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to point out, too, that in the notice of intent on page 27, it was mentioned here, and this is just cut right from page 27.

349
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:26,233
[SPEAKER_18]: You notice here, it just simply says that this curious asphalt will be built over an existing hot pan gravel.

350
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,346
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, it has been updated as of this morning, I believe, that this area here, this 21 feet, is all that it is.

351
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:40,751
[SPEAKER_18]: But the original application actually showed or actually said that it was over the entire area.

352
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:47,917
[SPEAKER_18]: This area, this crushed stone area or hardpan gravel area, is only about a quarter of the proposed site.

353
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:50,679
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of it is all in a wetland habitat.

354
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:53,936
[SPEAKER_18]: This is another view here.

355
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,457
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a measurement of 44 feet from the wall.

356
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:58,598
[SPEAKER_18]: You notice the multiple large trees.

357
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:06,040
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say that these are more than five, six inches in diameter, but you definitely have some of the ones that are significantly more than that.

358
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:15,043
[SPEAKER_18]: And this will remind the committee that this is only up to the edge of the asphalt, does not include the planting area, which includes far more trees.

359
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:19,287
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also, you can notice there's a slope here.

360
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:31,549
[SPEAKER_18]: If you look at the chart on the plan, you'll see that from the 20-foot mark of the limit of the ILSF, right where the parking area is, is a three-foot depression.

361
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,690
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have to disagree.

362
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,530
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not a small amount of fill that has to happen.

363
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,771
[SPEAKER_18]: This whole area floods generally when it rains.

364
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:46,773
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll show in the next couple of slides as well, part of the reason why it also floods beyond just simply the rain itself in that area.

365
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:53,526
[SPEAKER_18]: This whole area, there's a tremendous amount of wildlife in this spot.

366
00:33:54,787 --> 00:34:01,352
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to the usual rabbits and squirrels and raccoons, we also have all sorts of other things.

367
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:10,440
[SPEAKER_18]: There are hawks, but we've actually seen not just simply hawks, but we've seen two mated pair of hawks on multiple occasions.

368
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:15,100
[SPEAKER_18]: There are coyotes, foxes, there are turkeys.

369
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,403
[SPEAKER_18]: This image in the middle was taken on Sunday afternoon about 2 o'clock.

370
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:26,186
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nine turkeys just right there clearly in the area that's under consideration for this proposed parking area.

371
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:32,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And those same turkeys in those same trees that we're talking about having to be cut down, you can see them at the bottom of the photograph.

372
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,091
[SPEAKER_18]: They're up in those trees.

373
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:36,272
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a very active wildlife area.

374
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,244
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also a tremendous number of birds.

375
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:54,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And more recently, there has been owl sightings, of all things in Medford, owl sightings by multiple residents all throughout the area, from Hamlin Ave all the way to Gibson Circle and everything in between.

376
00:34:54,231 --> 00:34:57,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's quite a bit that's here.

377
00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:02,915
[SPEAKER_18]: There's also, I've heard recently, there's also been some bat sightings as well.

378
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,897
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a tremendously ecologically diverse area.

379
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:17,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of the problem, too, is that Sherman Place and all the basements in the area, the area has a very high water table.

380
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:23,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Flooding is a massive problem in all of the streets that have been mentioned, and it's a constant battle.

381
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:27,285
[SPEAKER_18]: But then also, Sherman Place floods routinely.

382
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,346
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's issues with the storm drains.

383
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:32,208
[SPEAKER_18]: This has been an ongoing issue literally for decades.

384
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:40,376
[SPEAKER_18]: In the solution, the city of Medford came up with, because they have limited things that they can do with the stormwater system, which I can certainly appreciate.

385
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:46,838
[SPEAKER_18]: But the solution was to add this pipe on the left-hand side of the image that's circled by that ellipse.

386
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,060
[SPEAKER_18]: That pipe takes water that floods in the street.

387
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:53,545
[SPEAKER_18]: and diverts it into this wetland area.

388
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:57,288
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have standing water all throughout this image that you're looking for.

389
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:03,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Straight on, you see how it's dipping down beyond these first couple of trees.

390
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:06,356
[SPEAKER_18]: This whole area takes on water.

391
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:13,423
[SPEAKER_18]: If you start raising it up, especially in that three-foot depression, you're going to be limiting the amount of water that that can absorb.

392
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,805
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to make a major issue for the street.

393
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:21,426
[SPEAKER_18]: You see in this one inset picture on the right-hand side, that's just a small amount of mud that happens.

394
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:24,567
[SPEAKER_18]: This used to happen routinely before this pipe was added.

395
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:28,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Mud will come from the wetland area and flood into the street.

396
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:40,310
[SPEAKER_18]: That whole back, the whole end of that street has had mud, and everything within this, what I'm showing is the flood line, that entire part of the street has flooded multiple times before.

397
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,870
[SPEAKER_18]: It still does flood.

398
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,251
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not as bad as it has been, so that pipe does help out.

399
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:55,453
[SPEAKER_18]: But one of the fears is, in addition to the wildlife issue, we will end up having more flooding and more mud deposited into the street.

400
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:58,135
[SPEAKER_18]: And also the basements, right?

401
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:06,541
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have the issues all throughout Sherman Place, all throughout Sherman Court, Hamlin Ave, Gibson Street, Gibson Circle, and Glenwood Street as well.

402
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,423
[SPEAKER_18]: That whole area gets a lot of flooding.

403
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:13,179
[SPEAKER_18]: That was it.

404
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:15,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I just rushed through because I don't only have a few minutes.

405
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,322
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of people want to talk, but we have multiple letters.

406
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:25,566
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple of them didn't make it in here because they were submitted after this presentation was submitted to Dennis.

407
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:30,148
[SPEAKER_18]: But you notice we have one letter from Gibson Circle.

408
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:31,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there was a couple others as well.

409
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,533
[SPEAKER_18]: This letter here with all the signatures, we have about 30 signatures from residents on Hamlin Ave, Sherman Place, Sherman Court.

410
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:44,850
[SPEAKER_18]: We're very concerned with the proposal and for so many different reasons.

411
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:51,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And I haven't mentioned anything in terms of any other issues with it being a gym and more people, et cetera, et cetera.

412
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:58,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to stay on point with the Conservation Commission, but there are other problems or other considerations that we do have.

413
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,940
[SPEAKER_18]: With that, I'd like to say thank you.

414
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,102
[SPEAKER_18]: If there are any questions of me, I'd be more than happy to share anything.

415
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:09,744
[SPEAKER_18]: or respond to anything people want to talk about.

416
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:12,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. D'Angelo.

417
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:14,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

418
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:22,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Dennis, I'm going to let you choose the next commenter.

419
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:28,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, the first hand that raised was Jennifer Huntley.

420
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:33,142
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Jennifer, if you want to just state your name and your address for the record.

421
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, my name is Jennifer Huntley.

422
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:40,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 50 Hamlin Avenue.

423
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:48,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm behind Sherman places, but I'm the last house on there.

424
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:59,613
[SPEAKER_13]: The property that is directly adjacent to me recently in the last couple of years cut down all the trees that were there.

425
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And now the flooding that was once,

426
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:11,670
[SPEAKER_13]: not too terrible, maybe an inch or so, you know, like if my pump couldn't keep up, to me having to get a

427
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:21,342
[SPEAKER_13]: much larger, high-capacity sun pump, and I still get a couple of inches of flooding anytime there's a really good rain.

428
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:33,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So the trees definitely help with the flooding in my area, and so I can only assume that this is going to happen to people on Sherman Place and Sherman Court as well.

429
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:41,247
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a huge number of wildlife that's here, and we've got bumblebees and bats,

430
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:46,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Like is the two, we have two mated pairs of red-tailed hawks.

431
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:47,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I have pictures of both pairs.

432
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:51,110
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot that lives here.

433
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Owls, all kinds of really, really nice stuff.

434
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:59,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you, you know, where people are complaining that they see coyotes all the time now.

435
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:05,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're gonna keep encroaching on all of their space, where are they supposed to go?

436
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:09,238
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like this is the only place that they have left around in this area.

437
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:18,210
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really don't think that this is going to help anybody but the gym people.

438
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,632
[SPEAKER_13]: There's another gym nearby, all I can say.

439
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:33,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And aside from that, I know they said they wanted to put up plants so that people couldn't see, but there's an incredible amount of noise.

440
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:40,387
[SPEAKER_13]: that echoes off the buildings into all hours of the night into over here.

441
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:45,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's definitely a problem.

442
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:50,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I can only see it being worse with that many more people coming.

443
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for listening to me.

444
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:55,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the time.

445
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your comments.

446
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:07,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to remind everyone that we can only address issues as they relate to the Wetlands Protection Act.

447
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:13,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the only part of our jurisdiction.

448
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:19,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So there may be concerns about traffic or noise, but this is not the forum for that.

449
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:20,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

450
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Dennis?

451
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Slocum, if you would please just say your name and address to the record.

452
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, good evening.

453
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,794
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is David Slocum.

454
00:41:35,914 --> 00:41:39,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm an abutter over on Gibson Circle.

455
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:48,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And I sent in a, I sent in an email about 2 weeks ago before the 1st meeting was supposed to happen, raising some concerns.

456
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,850
[SPEAKER_16]: I absolutely do have concerns and I'll try to limit.

457
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not familiar exactly with the statute for the jurisdiction of this commission, but.

458
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that it's wildlife and trees.

459
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:02,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Wildlife and trees is a huge part of my concern.

460
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:15,197
[SPEAKER_16]: When my wife and I bought this house six years ago, something that we tremendously valued was that when we look out our back porch into our backyard, there's trees, there's tall trees.

461
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:23,079
[SPEAKER_16]: And all summer long, it's an unbelievable blessing to be able to see those trees, have the shade from them and look

462
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:30,241
[SPEAKER_16]: At the wind, it is just so soothing and it's a huge part of our enjoyment in life.

463
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean that sincerely.

464
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:36,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And we just don't want to see those trees cut down, any of them.

465
00:42:36,043 --> 00:42:41,564
[SPEAKER_16]: We're a little bit over on the other side, away from, you know, exactly where this work is supposed to happen.

466
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:43,645
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, the whole

467
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:49,122
[SPEAKER_16]: The trees are all one cluster there, and it's important.

468
00:42:49,643 --> 00:43:00,897
[SPEAKER_16]: I can personally attest, I didn't have a photo to send to John of an owl, but just like two months ago, I saw this unbelievably impressive large owl in my backyard.

469
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,778
[SPEAKER_16]: It's coming from that area right there.

470
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:06,100
[SPEAKER_16]: We see abundant wildlife all the time.

471
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Bunnies, there's tons of bunnies.

472
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,582
[SPEAKER_16]: The coyotes are there because they're coming for the bunnies.

473
00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:20,008
[SPEAKER_16]: The bunnies shoot back and forth underneath the burrows that they make a my fence to go into that area back there.

474
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:22,209
[SPEAKER_16]: which went on property.

475
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:30,691
[SPEAKER_16]: We see the hawks, we see the coyotes, we see animals, and they're valued, and I think that they should be valued.

476
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,312
[SPEAKER_16]: We have huge concerns about water.

477
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:39,754
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that is this commission's jurisdiction, but flooding over here and a high water table is a massive concern.

478
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:43,895
[SPEAKER_16]: We have finished all of the properties on Gibson Circle over here that are abutters.

479
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:44,795
[SPEAKER_16]: We are abutters.

480
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:46,116
[SPEAKER_16]: We have finished

481
00:43:46,656 --> 00:44:03,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Living area below grade part of our homes here and we are subject when there are heavy rains we get water into our properties and it's not it's not unfinished basement is finished living area and we're all dependent on some pumps.

482
00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:06,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And someday when there's a big storm and the power goes out, we're all going to get flooded bad.

483
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:17,911
[SPEAKER_16]: My neighbor two doors down, who isn't a butter, may or may not be part of this hearing right now, but he told me that back before the expansion to this building, they didn't used to get those problems.

484
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:27,315
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when there's more impervious space on that site, the water problems of water getting into their below-grade living area got much worse.

485
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:45,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So my, you know, I don't know, I haven't had time to look very closely at this notice of intent or whatever, but if we're putting in more fill and more finished more surfaces that are just going to force the water somewhere else towards us, it can't be good.

486
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:45,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

487
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:53,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's probably the extent of what I have to say, but I appreciate being heard.

488
00:44:55,156 --> 00:44:57,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in a butter with very strong concerns.

489
00:44:57,238 --> 00:45:00,721
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd urge the commission to take our concerns very seriously.

490
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:03,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Slocum.

491
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:12,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Flooding is one of the concerns that the commission does look at.

492
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, it's one of the interests of the Wetlands Protection Act.

493
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:23,743
[SPEAKER_11]: that is within our domain.

494
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:29,308
[SPEAKER_19]: The next one is a telephone number ending 5073.

495
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:35,895
[SPEAKER_19]: If you care to speak, please do so and just state your name and your address for the record.

496
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:57,074
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it looks like they just unmuted themselves.

497
00:45:58,075 --> 00:45:59,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so if you.

498
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a leader and you wish to speak, please do so.

499
00:46:02,798 --> 00:46:09,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise, we're going to move on to the next person.

500
00:46:09,924 --> 00:46:10,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, do you hear me now?

501
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:10,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, yes.

502
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:19,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm very sorry.

503
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:22,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, I am Arlene D'Angelo.

504
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:32,119
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband and I, we have lived on Sherman Place for over 52 years and we're in full support of what my son John wants to say.

505
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to emphasize that this is a very high water table.

506
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not just surface water, it is groundwater.

507
00:46:40,242 --> 00:46:45,684
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have problems with this area with the high water table.

508
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:55,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And by cutting down all the trees, it's going to result in more flooding on our street and basements and disrupting all the beautiful wildlife that live there.

509
00:46:56,888 --> 00:47:03,311
[SPEAKER_07]: After heavy rains, there are pools of water that pool in the wetlands.

510
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:13,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of our street, after heavy flooding, we get so much rain, the system cannot take it.

511
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,815
[SPEAKER_07]: We are left with a bunch of mud on the street, and we're elderly.

512
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:23,737
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to go out there with shovels and clean the street.

513
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:24,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a nuisance.

514
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:26,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It's smelly.

515
00:47:26,379 --> 00:47:27,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stinky.

516
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:30,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible, especially in the summer.

517
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:32,924
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets buggy.

518
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:41,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just want to make sure that the Conservation Committee takes all of this into consideration.

519
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for your time and your support.

520
00:47:47,046 --> 00:47:49,148
[SPEAKER_11]: You're very welcome, thank you for your comments, Ms.

521
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:49,648
[SPEAKER_11]: D'Angelo.

522
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:53,371
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

523
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:55,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

524
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Next in line is Robert Hines.

525
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:58,435
[SPEAKER_19]: Just please...

526
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:07,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Robert Hines, 29 Sherman Court, budding the wetlands here.

527
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:25,241
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree with people have said that flooding is a concern, that just have reducing the amount of air, land that the water can disperse over is just going to make it worse.

528
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:46,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think any sort of permeable pavement is ever going to take that place of natural habitat, and also taking the trees, which will absorb raw water out of the ground.

529
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:54,628
[SPEAKER_14]: And just repeating whatever I've said, it's a very high water table, and any sort of reduction in the plan will just, I think,

530
00:48:56,948 --> 00:49:03,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Reduce it and reduce the increase the problems of flooding and reduce the ability of the land to absorb water.

531
00:49:03,512 --> 00:49:07,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just yeah, that's.

532
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:13,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I would encourage the conservation commission to really turn down this proposal.

533
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:17,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if these are necessary, but that's I don't think, as you said, purview of this.

534
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,063
[SPEAKER_14]: This commission, but I do encourage them to.

535
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:24,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Take this into consideration and.

536
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:35,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think any sort of mitigation is really going to do enough to prevent it.

537
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:37,642
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you.

538
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:40,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Hines.

539
00:49:40,304 --> 00:49:42,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And next is Loretta James.

540
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:08,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hello.

541
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:11,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Loretta James, 13 Sherman Place.

542
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:13,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

543
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

544
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:17,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can.

545
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good.

546
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:19,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent a letter in.

547
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:26,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an abutter to the abutters, December 4th, with just a few days notice of this meeting.

548
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:28,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope you read the letter.

549
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:33,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had a few more things to add to that since I've had more time to think about this.

550
00:50:34,516 --> 00:50:41,898
[SPEAKER_06]: The proposed new parking area will have automobile exhaust pollution that falls on the wetlands and stormwater.

551
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:48,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that I didn't mention in the letter until I thought about it more.

552
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,120
[SPEAKER_06]: That particular area is not an existing parking lot.

553
00:50:52,180 --> 00:51:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, as you have seen in the pictures that John D'Angelo had done in his presentation, it's a gravel area.

554
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:03,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So cars generally do not park there.

555
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:06,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would be quite a change to the wetlands.

556
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:07,343
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is,

557
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:10,184
[SPEAKER_06]: With the tree canopy leaves.

558
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at it now it doesn't look like much because it's fall and winter, and there's no leaves but it's completely fills in and those pictures are on the.

559
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,805
[SPEAKER_06]: presentation that John D'Angelo submitted.

560
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:34,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a quite dense forest area, and those leaves help filter the air pollution that would drop onto the wetland.

561
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:39,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also provides shade to the wetland and prevents heat gain.

562
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,586
[SPEAKER_06]: With removal of any of the trees, the land will turn really hard and cause more flooding.

563
00:51:49,136 --> 00:51:54,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the last thing, I had sent this in to Dennis, but I don't know if he got my e-mail because it's such e-mail questions.

564
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this project reviewed by the National Heritage and Endangered Species Program?

565
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:03,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to consider that there's a lot of animals.

566
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:15,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be there right now, but there's opossum, skunks, the hawks, owls, and that's one of the considerations I'd like you to consider.

567
00:52:16,818 --> 00:52:20,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an email, I'm sure you're probably aware of this.

568
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:35,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It says their responsibility for review is the primary responsibility of us is to review any proposed projects or activities you may have in rare species habitat, estimated or priority habitat.

569
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:38,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is to protect rare species and their habitats.

570
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:44,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a review process for how to file a MESA project review.

571
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was wondering if that's been submitted.

572
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:50,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, thank you for your time.

573
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:52,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate this.

574
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,385
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be quite a change to the area.

575
00:52:54,925 --> 00:53:01,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It does flood from Spring Street all the way down our whole street, not just at the end.

576
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:13,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, of course, the end cuts the, all the water runs down the end of the street, but all our houses on the street have flooded before when there's been impact rain.

577
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:15,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the climate change,

578
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:24,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really surprised there are other options to provide more green and friendly spaces like bikes.

579
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:31,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be something that could be considered since our city is Go Green Medford.

580
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:39,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope the owner and developer considers putting in bicycle stations, which are very popular in Medford.

581
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:51,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Since it is a proposed gym, I find it a little ironic that that's, you know, a health gym is to provide health sustainability, but not in the environment.

582
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time.

583
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:55,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

584
00:53:56,014 --> 00:53:56,334
[SPEAKER_06]: James.

585
00:53:59,614 --> 00:53:59,934
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

586
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Next, there is Lauren Moresky.

587
00:54:03,518 --> 00:54:09,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to go on the record and say that I support

588
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:28,012
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past.

589
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:34,534
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just, there's a lot of rain and everyone has a sump pump and they're working maximum overdrive.

590
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:54,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I did have one question and my question was whether or not there was a written comment period for this and if there is a deadline and if that is already passed, if we respectfully request to extend that so I can submit some written comments to the commission.

591
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:00,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

592
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:10,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we will probably request to continue this hearing, so we will accept written comments.

593
00:55:10,555 --> 00:55:13,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

594
00:55:20,257 --> 00:55:22,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Just in the chat right now, I just put my email address.

595
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:25,080
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have any comments, please send them to me and I will forward them to the board.

596
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:31,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And next up it's Will Sherwood.

597
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:33,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there.

598
00:55:33,825 --> 00:55:34,345
[SPEAKER_12]: You hear me okay?

599
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:35,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

600
00:55:36,106 --> 00:55:36,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

601
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:37,927
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Will Sherwood.

602
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 30 Woodside Road.

603
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:43,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I am not in a butter, but I am a recent

604
00:55:45,543 --> 00:56:09,932
[SPEAKER_12]: transplant into medford i'm looking to make this my home indefinitely uh... and i am speaking in some uh... in support of what all of my new neighbors have had to say about this project i think that medford has their climate resiliency plan in place they have to go green initiatives i think that erasing these uh... fragile wetlands

605
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:14,875
[SPEAKER_12]: For parking is honestly a little inexcusable.

606
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:21,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that is short sighted, especially as we're seeing record rainfall these last few years.

607
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,481
[SPEAKER_12]: And general changes in our climate.

608
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:29,464
[SPEAKER_12]: If this is going to be my long time home, I want to make sure that it is everyone is kept safe.

609
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:33,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we are following our climate resilient resiliency plans.

610
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:37,168
[SPEAKER_12]: To make sure that we are keeping not just our neighbors.

611
00:56:37,848 --> 00:56:42,849
[SPEAKER_12]: But our homes, our wildlife and our nature areas safe.

612
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:46,330
[SPEAKER_12]: For generations to come, thank you.

613
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

614
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:48,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. sure.

615
00:56:57,532 --> 00:57:00,553
[SPEAKER_19]: I see no other hands raised and let me just check.

616
00:57:01,253 --> 00:57:07,697
[SPEAKER_19]: And in my emails, the only other email that I received is the email that Ms.

617
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:08,458
[SPEAKER_19]: James referenced.

618
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

619
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:16,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Tracy Tetrault, please name and address for the record.

620
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:21,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And unmute.

621
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:29,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Asking to unmute.

622
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:30,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, can you hear me?

623
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:33,623
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Tracy Tetrault.

624
00:57:35,563 --> 00:57:37,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not a butter.

625
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:42,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I live at 49 Farragut Ave in a different neighborhood, but I did grow up in this neighborhood.

626
00:57:43,886 --> 00:57:52,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And over the years, a lot has changed with the green space that all these butters have been talking about.

627
00:57:52,129 --> 00:58:01,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I've seen over these decades is this wetland in green space that was so amazing as a child,

628
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:16,013
[SPEAKER_08]: getting filled in with houses, FedEx, Budweiser, neighborhoods, the exact property that you're talking about.

629
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:19,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see all these things when I was a child.

630
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:26,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, we had space that we could roam around and scoop up tadpoles in a pond.

631
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:30,818
[SPEAKER_08]: But over the years, all of this has been filled in.

632
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,051
[SPEAKER_08]: filled in and filled in.

633
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:45,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And as it goes on, this wetland filling in has caused more and more problems for all these people in this neighborhood, flooding, like they're saying.

634
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:57,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's surprising to me because Method has this amazing space, and I can't believe that they don't want to protect it.

635
00:58:57,428 --> 00:58:59,730
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not many spaces in a city

636
00:59:00,446 --> 00:59:03,108
[SPEAKER_08]: that you can protect, and this is one of them.

637
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would be a shame to see this area paved over, cause problems for all the tax paying citizens of this city.

638
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:28,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And not just that, but the wildlife, the coyotes, the rabbits, the hawks, I mean,

639
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:35,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't imagine that Medford isn't interested in preserving green space.

640
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to say that and voice my opinion.

641
00:59:40,615 --> 00:59:47,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad that you are at least listening to everyone and listening to everyone's opinions.

642
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:49,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

643
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:52,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

644
00:59:52,684 --> 00:59:53,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetreault.

645
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:56,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anybody else?

646
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,048
[SPEAKER_19]: That would like to raise the next is window loud.

647
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:02,573
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, Toby.

648
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:06,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Please name and address the record.

649
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:07,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

650
01:00:08,163 --> 01:00:08,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

651
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:08,985
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

652
01:00:10,494 --> 01:00:11,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can.

653
01:00:11,715 --> 01:00:15,276
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Linda Loud, and I live at 25 Sherman Court.

654
01:00:16,017 --> 01:00:19,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've lived here for 46 years.

655
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:28,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've always had wonderful animals that have come out of the wetlands back there.

656
01:00:28,323 --> 01:00:32,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to agree with what Tracy just said.

657
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:36,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing up here, my kids always had tadpoles and everything.

658
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,148
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd go in there, and they'd

659
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, bring them out and bring them in the house, unfortunately.

660
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:53,286
[SPEAKER_09]: But they over the years, I've noticed the depletion of these animals because of prior that building going in over there.

661
01:00:53,666 --> 01:01:00,109
[SPEAKER_09]: We had all sorts of different kinds of animals as well as

662
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:09,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so excited to see and I put a picture in also of all these turkeys that were up on my roof and in the trees the other day.

663
01:01:09,994 --> 01:01:17,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the hawks in the backyard, we used to have cardinals all over the place.

664
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:21,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's getting less and less and less.

665
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:28,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And we really need to think about this and really need to be concerned with

666
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:33,534
[SPEAKER_09]: getting rid of this land there because we're going to lose more animals.

667
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:36,616
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have more problems in our basement.

668
01:01:37,096 --> 01:01:38,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always had a sump pump.

669
01:01:38,517 --> 01:01:40,037
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two going all the time.

670
01:01:40,057 --> 01:01:40,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I said something.

671
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:42,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't help it.

672
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:55,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel as though I'm really glad that someone is listening to us and put some really good thought into all of this so that we won't have to deal with more loss.

673
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank you for hearing me.

674
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:01,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

675
01:02:01,773 --> 01:02:01,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladd.

676
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:03,453
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

677
01:02:04,193 --> 01:02:06,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have anyone else from the public that would like to speak?

678
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:14,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I see no other hands raised but just to respond to a question that came to me about written comments.

679
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:24,100
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say, and I'm not rifting anything, but if the matter is continued, which as Chair Davis said, it seems likely, we will announce during this hearing

680
01:02:25,105 --> 01:02:33,750
[SPEAKER_19]: When it will be continued to and prior any time up until prior to that hearing, you're welcome to submit comments to me in this office and they will get forwarded to the commission.

681
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:37,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dennis.

682
01:02:37,973 --> 01:02:55,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And before I turn this back to the commission to see if they have any other comments, I do want everybody to understand part of the process is that once the commission comes to a decision, they will issue a decision called an order of conditions, which will either allow or deny that project.

683
01:02:57,137 --> 01:03:01,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way, there are a number of parties that have the right to appeal that decision.

684
01:03:02,713 --> 01:03:09,215
[SPEAKER_11]: If the commission denied the order, then the proponent has the right to appeal that, and that appeal would be to the Mass.

685
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:10,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Environmental Protection.

686
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:24,421
[SPEAKER_11]: If we allow that project, then Director Butters may appeal, 10 concerned citizens may appeal, and the department can appeal of its own volition.

687
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:29,283
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want you all to be aware that there is a process in place.

688
01:03:31,326 --> 01:03:39,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I would now like to turn it back to the commission, and after hearing all of the comments, I wanted to know if you have any other thoughts or questions.

689
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:41,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

690
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:50,789
[SPEAKER_10]: basically because this is a long-term flooding area and problem for the town.

691
01:03:51,829 --> 01:04:04,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I am curious if there was anything in the engineering department, etc., any plans, especially as we're looking at climate, other climate issues, in terms of any kind of

692
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:12,230
[SPEAKER_10]: work anticipated to somehow deal with all of the stormwater.

693
01:04:14,031 --> 01:04:27,158
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would, once again, I know that the question, Dennis, I already forwarded to you, and I know that you've already alerted the engineering department, but I'm just very curious about that.

694
01:04:27,398 --> 01:04:31,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to know if there's going to be any other kinds of relief.

695
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:53,310
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing that I found interesting, and this is just a comment, not really a question, in listening to all of these folks in the long term, is it was since the Conservation Commission and the related legislation that has brought such commissions as ours to

696
01:04:55,497 --> 01:05:07,811
[SPEAKER_10]: every city and town all over the Commonwealth, many of the buildings, plans, and filling that people have been seeing over the last number of years probably would never have been allowed.

697
01:05:10,727 --> 01:05:15,548
[SPEAKER_10]: since the development of the commissions and the regulations related to it.

698
01:05:16,188 --> 01:05:29,011
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's interesting to have this kind of historical perspective of what this neighborhood looked like and what has happened and is probably part of why we exist today as a commission.

699
01:05:29,151 --> 01:05:31,851
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you neighbors for sharing that.

700
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:32,952
[SPEAKER_10]: That was interesting.

701
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dennis, if you could get us some information from the-

702
01:05:40,795 --> 01:05:42,997
[SPEAKER_19]: Jump back on the question you asked for yesterday.

703
01:05:43,037 --> 01:05:45,840
[SPEAKER_19]: I did speak to the city engineer today and.

704
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:51,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, he actually had a event with 1 of his kids tonight because he was actually what time is the meeting?

705
01:05:51,726 --> 01:05:52,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I come on?

706
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:56,911
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he was like, I'm not able to join, but he was going to talk to me more about this.

707
01:05:57,391 --> 01:06:00,875
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, it's sort of, I'll get some answers to you and be able to ride the commission.

708
01:06:01,135 --> 01:06:02,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Any, any responses that he might have.

709
01:06:03,435 --> 01:06:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's just add to that, not just past historical, but do they have any plans?

710
01:06:07,737 --> 01:06:13,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any future thinking and planning engineering department in the city?

711
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very helpful.

712
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:15,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

713
01:06:17,162 --> 01:06:17,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

714
01:06:18,743 --> 01:06:24,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a few follow up comments given the feedback we've gotten here.

715
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:25,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

716
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:32,509
[SPEAKER_15]: The 1st, 1 kind of from the sides that John D'Angelo provided.

717
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:40,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I went back to the PDF and Rick, it does look like there's a measurement error on your PDF.

718
01:06:41,216 --> 01:06:42,837
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got a 1 to 20 scale.

719
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:49,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Plan and based on my measurement, the offset from that building is.

720
01:06:51,238 --> 01:06:56,320
[SPEAKER_15]: It is greater than 40 feet rather than the 24 that you have in your call-out.

721
01:06:57,001 --> 01:07:05,184
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think in a revised version of that plan, it would be good to have that number updated or at least in line with the scale that's being shown.

722
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:07,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Which dimension?

723
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:11,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you referring to the dimension from the building or the parking spaces?

724
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:15,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's from the building to the parking spaces.

725
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:18,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so to- That's the dry vial.

726
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:23,365
[SPEAKER_15]: It is, and it's perfectly in line with the paint stripe.

727
01:07:24,465 --> 01:07:27,466
[SPEAKER_15]: And that makes it look like that measurement is going all the way to the back of the pavement.

728
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:29,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I apologize, Matt.

729
01:07:29,366 --> 01:07:33,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, that's showing a 24-foot dry vial and a 18-foot deep space.

730
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:37,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Adding some clarifying annotations that would be useful.

731
01:07:37,908 --> 01:07:38,248
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

732
01:07:40,883 --> 01:07:43,385
[SPEAKER_15]: A few other questions.

733
01:07:44,786 --> 01:07:55,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Given that this is a flood, stagnant flood area, I know one of the easiest ways to kill pervious paving is for it to clog.

734
01:07:55,876 --> 01:08:03,502
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're seeing mud wash up onto the street, I'm a little curious about the lifespan of that pervious paving is going to be moving forward.

735
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:04,703
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know,

736
01:08:05,855 --> 01:08:20,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking to my earlier comment about the long-term O&M plan, I think that's a really good consideration to have, whether it's increased maintenance frequencies, varying mix of BMPs, whatever it is, that should be a consideration on here.

737
01:08:24,048 --> 01:08:31,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And one additional comment, we've heard a lot tonight about the wetlands.

738
01:08:31,973 --> 01:08:32,753
[SPEAKER_15]: in this area.

739
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:38,874
[SPEAKER_15]: They're on the plan as ILSF, but pointedly that we don't have wetland flagging on here.

740
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:43,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you had a wetland scientist out here to delineate the extent of wetlands at the site?

741
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:55,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if we can get that mapped, I think that will go a long way to at least helping the commission address the habitat concerns that have been raised tonight.

742
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:57,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We can certainly do that.

743
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in 2004, there was no BVW noted in there.

744
01:09:02,102 --> 01:09:04,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only regulated as ILSF.

745
01:09:04,963 --> 01:09:12,327
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be happy to have a wetland scientist take a look and confirm whether or not there is BVW on site.

746
01:09:12,568 --> 01:09:17,450
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be getting a wetlands report on this, I think, would be very useful for me, at least.

747
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't speak for the rest of my commission members.

748
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:25,735
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it for my additional comments here, Heidi.

749
01:09:26,075 --> 01:09:26,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

750
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:29,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Craig.

751
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:31,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two, if I may know.

752
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:32,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

753
01:09:32,956 --> 01:09:33,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

754
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And Craig, just to your comment, part of the reason why I wanted to see what maintenance has been done is to see what is going on in that area as well.

755
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:49,626
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand that this owner has only owned it for a few years, but those maintenance logs for the years that he's owned it would be helpful.

756
01:09:49,646 --> 01:09:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: To answer one,

757
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:57,180
[SPEAKER_05]: of the public's comments on endangered species and natural heritage.

758
01:09:59,502 --> 01:10:12,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Division of fisheries and wildlife runs the natural heritage and endangered species program and it's their job to map habitat of rare and endangered wildlife.

759
01:10:12,812 --> 01:10:15,314
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the most recent map which is from 2021,

760
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,057
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no mapped habitat.

761
01:10:19,217 --> 01:10:22,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we have to go off of.

762
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,063
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a procedure of how to get the maps changed.

763
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:29,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, the public can look into that.

764
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:32,168
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, it's not in a mapped habitat.

765
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did look at that.

766
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,612
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant did look at that and correctly identified that.

767
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:40,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how that plays out.

768
01:10:42,276 --> 01:10:55,221
[SPEAKER_05]: The other item is I would be also interested in a site visit if any markers of where the limit of the work would be would be helpful ahead of a site visit if that should happen.

769
01:10:56,021 --> 01:11:06,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, I would just encourage the applicant, if he has any appetite, to speak with the neighbors separately and see if there might be a solution to the flooding problem.

770
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:12,448
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all neighbors here, so I would just encourage that and leave that up to the applicant to decide.

771
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:13,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

772
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,091
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll, I'll 2nd, the request for a site visit.

773
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:18,773
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it'd be great to get out there with the engineer record.

774
01:11:19,273 --> 01:11:24,176
[SPEAKER_15]: If we can get the proposed limits of payment staked out beforehand, that would be great.

775
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:34,904
[SPEAKER_15]: might be worth having that site visit after there's been a chance to collect some additional data, wetlands data and soils testing.

776
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:38,806
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would love to be part of that site visit.

777
01:11:41,787 --> 01:11:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to accommodate a site visit whenever the commission would choose.

778
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

779
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you amenable to continuing this hearing?

780
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:54,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think that's in order for sure.

781
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:55,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent, thank you.

782
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:11,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to, if I, if the commission has no more comments, and I did want to clarify, Caroline, you mentioned mapped habitat, and that's explicitly mapped habitat of rare and endangered species.

783
01:12:12,337 --> 01:12:19,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So we understand there is wildlife habitat there, but not, it isn't mapped for rare and endangered species.

784
01:12:21,013 --> 01:12:23,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have a motion from the commission?

785
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Before a motion, I think we might want to discuss how long it would take Mr. Salvo to put together the requested materials and whether it's appropriate to hold the hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting, which I think, Dennis, you said was the 22nd?

786
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,521
[SPEAKER_19]: No, there should be one before that.

787
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:49,463
[SPEAKER_19]: We could have a meeting on the 8th, and that seems likely, but

788
01:12:50,368 --> 01:13:05,995
[SPEAKER_19]: the next the one that we continued the other matter we continue to the 22nd and just maybe tie it in together the city engineer will actually be on that meeting because he is one of the applicants so maybe that might help as well.

789
01:13:08,976 --> 01:13:13,958
[SPEAKER_15]: If maybe we're trying to get a site visit before if we're going to go all the way to the 22nd if possible.

790
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:19,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes I think that would be helpful for our standpoint as well.

791
01:13:20,348 --> 01:13:33,613
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I think what we can do for a site visit is we can work on actually setting a date for our members and then it can be posted on the city's website when we're doing it because I think that will probably constitute more of a actual.

792
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Meeting, but we can do that separately.

793
01:13:36,966 --> 01:13:39,508
[SPEAKER_19]: We can just, you know, let some folks know that it's going to be happening.

794
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:49,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Just so if people wish to be there and just under, it's more, it's probably more of an observatory thing with the board members asking some questions, but more members won't be conferring among themselves.

795
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:54,864
[SPEAKER_19]: During that, it won't be a deliberation type of hearing be more just informational and observational.

796
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:55,885
[SPEAKER_19]: For the members.

797
01:13:57,817 --> 01:14:08,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to also suggest that we move it along, but I'm also concerned that some of the suggestions that Craig made that the information be there that we require.

798
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,007
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am concerned because we are getting into snow season.

799
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:19,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to see something other than the layer of snow.

800
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:28,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I can how about Rick, how about tomorrow?

801
01:14:28,483 --> 01:14:35,046
[SPEAKER_19]: I sort of talk with you and we can pick some dates and I'll forward it to the members and see how many we can what we can do with the members availability.

802
01:14:35,526 --> 01:14:39,488
[SPEAKER_19]: And then once we sort of have that, we can sort of hash that out because I think sort of try to figure out.

803
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,650
[SPEAKER_19]: What's a possible meeting date for 6 individuals.

804
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:48,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, isn't super your schedule with my schedule with the member schedule.

805
01:14:48,432 --> 01:14:54,115
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can sort of work on that and then, but it will be open to the city's website and, you know, I know, Mr. was asked to.

806
01:14:56,130 --> 01:15:18,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Dennis, could we also, though, before we leave, get an idea of what time of day might be best, especially for the commission members that, I mean, I'm pretty flexible, but for others, so that as the two of you are looking at dates, we're taking into consideration whether early morning meeting, late meetings, you know, what's going to work for the rest of the group.

807
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:29,768
[SPEAKER_15]: most times of days I will say I am out of town for the week of Christmas so preferably we can avoid the week of Christmas.

808
01:15:30,748 --> 01:15:31,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds reasonable.

809
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I think given the early sunsets and hopefully days will be getting longer in January but still I think we're better off looking in the early morning rather than late afternoon.

810
01:15:49,855 --> 01:15:52,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah early morning or no later than three I would say.

811
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,524
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's like 7.30 in the morning.

812
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:04,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then do we have, can I have a motion to continue this hearing with a date to be determined?

813
01:16:06,548 --> 01:16:11,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I will make a motion to continue this hearing with a date for second hearing to be determined.

814
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:17,792
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're gonna do a motion to continue the actual hearing to the 22nd, January 22nd with

815
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:23,601
[SPEAKER_19]: The acknowledgement that we're going to do a site visit, which will be posted in the city's website.

816
01:16:25,003 --> 01:16:28,446
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, prior to that sometime in the interim.

817
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:34,291
[SPEAKER_19]: So the actual hearing will be continued to January 22nd with the site visit in the interim.

818
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:41,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want you to know, I may not be available, but I will make an effort to reschedule something.

819
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:43,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I will let Dennis know that within 2 days.

820
01:16:46,337 --> 01:16:54,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I will make a motion to continue this hearing to the 22nd of January with a site visit in the interim at a date to be determined.

821
01:16:55,123 --> 01:16:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second that motion.

822
01:16:57,324 --> 01:16:57,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thanks.

823
01:16:58,125 --> 01:16:58,805
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

824
01:16:58,945 --> 01:16:59,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Caroline?

825
01:16:59,425 --> 01:17:00,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

826
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:01,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Eric?

827
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:02,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

828
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:03,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Heather?

829
01:17:03,728 --> 01:17:04,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

830
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:05,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Greg?

831
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:07,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

832
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:07,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy?

833
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:08,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

834
01:17:09,932 --> 01:17:10,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And myself as an aye.

835
01:17:11,769 --> 01:17:12,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

836
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:13,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

837
01:17:13,269 --> 01:17:14,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for your time, everyone.

838
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:15,750
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it.

839
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:16,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

840
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:17,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good holiday.

841
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:26,412
[SPEAKER_11]: You too.

842
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:31,993
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

843
01:17:32,113 --> 01:17:35,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Next item on the agenda is a notice of intent.

844
01:17:35,773 --> 01:17:38,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Route 28 pathway and boardwalk, DEV file number 215-0240.

845
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:47,248
[SPEAKER_19]: The city of Medford has filed a notice of intent for the construction of proposed pathways and a boardwalk under the Fellsway slash Route 28 bridge in Medford.

846
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,729
[SPEAKER_19]: The project is located within and adjacent to the following resource areas.

847
01:17:51,209 --> 01:18:01,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Bordering land subject to flooding, Vancouver Perennial River, land underwater, bordering land subject to flooding, riverfront area, the Mystic River, and the 100-foot adjacent upland resource area buffer zone to bordering vegetated wetland.

848
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:06,634
[SPEAKER_19]: This project is considered a limited project per section 10.533J of the Wetland Protection Act.

849
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:10,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

850
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:20,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to let the commission know that I need to recuse myself from this hearing as I will be the signatory on another permit that this project also requires.

851
01:18:21,124 --> 01:18:23,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to turn this over to my vice chair.

852
01:18:25,407 --> 01:18:26,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Heidi.

853
01:18:26,107 --> 01:18:27,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

854
01:18:28,528 --> 01:18:31,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Who here is representing the applicant?

855
01:18:32,531 --> 01:18:34,872
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be me, John Michalak from Niche Engineering.

856
01:18:35,767 --> 01:18:43,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Mister mccullough the floor is yours if you want to give the commission an overview of the project we'd appreciate it thanks.

857
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:48,247
[SPEAKER_17]: I can share my screen bring up the plan all that notice from 10.

858
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:03,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, thank you and thank you for giving us the opportunity to present this project.

859
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:10,743
[SPEAKER_17]: The City of Medford is the applicant and Niche Engineering is the design consultant that's working for the City of Medford.

860
01:19:11,944 --> 01:19:16,625
[SPEAKER_17]: The property owner is the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

861
01:19:17,725 --> 01:19:28,048
[SPEAKER_17]: This project is going through the MassDOT's review process and then construction will be undertaken by MassDOT and their contractor.

862
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:37,679
[SPEAKER_17]: The project involves constructing a timber boardwalk that will connect the east and west side of Route 28.

863
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:44,503
[SPEAKER_17]: And it'll be similar and mimic the timber boardwalk structure on the Somerville side of the river.

864
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:57,229
[SPEAKER_17]: This boardwalk will provide a safe crossing for Route 28, will connect McDonald Park to the west and Station Landing and ultimately to Wellington Station to the east.

865
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:15,307
[SPEAKER_17]: The project proposes to install a 12-foot wide tuminous path that will connect to a timber boardwalk, which will be constructed of Ipe timber, which is a hardwood that's commonly used by the DCR for their boardwalk structures.

866
01:20:16,528 --> 01:20:22,091
[SPEAKER_17]: It's more resistant to fire and insect damage and lasts longer.

867
01:20:23,892 --> 01:20:32,679
[SPEAKER_17]: As Dennis mentioned, this boardwalk structure will involve construction within and around the Mystic River.

868
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:45,650
[SPEAKER_17]: The boardwalk itself is proposed to extend beneath the Route 28 Fellsway Bridge between the abutment and the first bridge pier where the water is shallower.

869
01:20:50,378 --> 01:21:07,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Project also will provide bicycle connections to the new bike lanes that were recently installed along route 28 will also include a paved connection to the bridge that extends over to McDonald park.

870
01:21:07,849 --> 01:21:21,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And then also walking paths along this, the desired walking lines, desired lines, as well as connecting to the sidewalk that extends over the river along route 28.

871
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:39,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Second plan shows the colored resource areas and the anticipated impacts of construction.

872
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:49,136
[SPEAKER_17]: The construction will be contained within compost filter tubes to avoid any erosion and runoff.

873
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:59,539
[SPEAKER_17]: And adjacent to the boardwalk construction, we're proposing to install a turbidity barrier on either side, which will

874
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:09,450
[SPEAKER_17]: contain any disturbance or silt that could be caused by the construction activities.

875
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:18,020
[SPEAKER_17]: The proposed boardwalk is going to be installed on helical pile foundations, so they won't require any excavation within the river.

876
01:22:18,961 --> 01:22:27,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Helical piles are screwed into the riverbed until they reach a sufficient depth so that they can support the structure.

877
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:40,542
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a similar method that was used on the Somerville side, thereby not requiring any excavation, any dredging, or any soils to be removed from the riverbed.

878
01:22:42,047 --> 01:22:53,535
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be construction, but it will be upland for the abutments that will begin and end the boardwalk structure.

879
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,777
[SPEAKER_17]: There will be limited impacts to bank.

880
01:22:57,057 --> 01:23:01,040
[SPEAKER_17]: The bank itself is actually a riprap armored slope along the river.

881
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:11,326
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have identified these as as temporary construction impacts immediately adjacent to where the boardwalk will be constructed.

882
01:23:11,346 --> 01:23:24,034
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also some shading impacts that we've calculated and included in the application for the portion of the boardwalk that extends over the mystic river.

883
01:23:24,614 --> 01:23:25,494
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's also.

884
01:23:27,615 --> 01:23:33,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Shading that already exists underneath the bridge, so that area is already shaded.

885
01:23:34,358 --> 01:23:38,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've calculated these in different colors and shown the areas on the plan.

886
01:23:38,419 --> 01:23:50,323
[SPEAKER_17]: There is 1 small triangular area of impact about 24 square feet that will be reestablished.

887
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:54,545
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just maybe disturbed during the construction activities.

888
01:23:55,925 --> 01:24:01,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's also temporary construction impacts within bordering land subject to flooding.

889
01:24:01,668 --> 01:24:03,969
[SPEAKER_17]: That's also been identified on these plans.

890
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:10,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, those areas will be restored and will be located beneath the timber boardwalk.

891
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:15,995
[SPEAKER_17]: So they'll be maintained once the boardwalk has been constructed.

892
01:24:19,027 --> 01:24:24,572
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this plan shows some of the existing and proposed vegetation.

893
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:28,796
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see that there is some vegetation removal.

894
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:39,325
[SPEAKER_17]: There were some invasive species identified, primarily bittersweet, and the DCR has a bittersweet removal program that they enact to

895
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:54,410
[SPEAKER_17]: reduce the amount of bittersweet within their parks and then all mass dot standards for controlling invasive species and removal of invasive species within the project work zone will be followed during construction.

896
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:13,006
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a site visit conducted with MassDOT's landscape architect as well as DCR's arborist and determined several of the trees were dying or were in severe decay.

897
01:25:14,146 --> 01:25:22,268
[SPEAKER_17]: So the tree removals have been coordinated with the DCR and MassDOT as part of the review process for the plans.

898
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:27,129
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are proposing a total of 24 new trees on the site.

899
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:33,194
[SPEAKER_17]: to repopulate the trees and then some along this park area.

900
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:42,062
[SPEAKER_17]: The primary use of this is anticipated to be pedestrian, even though it is designed for bicycle use.

901
01:25:43,463 --> 01:25:53,752
[SPEAKER_17]: And as I said, there's connections to station landing to the east, which is on the bottom of the sheet, McDonald Park to the west, which is on the top of the sheet.

902
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:08,214
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess there's probably a lot going on here, so maybe I'll just open it up to questions now and see if there's any specific areas that you want me to address.

903
01:26:10,535 --> 01:26:10,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

904
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:16,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the presentation and overview and the very comprehensive notice of intent.

905
01:26:17,658 --> 01:26:25,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a few questions, but I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues on the commission to see if they have any questions or comments.

906
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:33,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing.

907
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:38,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got one minor nitpick.

908
01:26:39,016 --> 01:26:57,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think this has any major consequence on permit documentation, but on the off chance that it does, as it's shown on this plan, the limit of disturbance excludes some of the planting areas that you've got called out on the southern half of this plan.

909
01:27:03,297 --> 01:27:08,781
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think that has a huge consequence, and I'm not going to complain about getting new trees as part of the plan.

910
01:27:08,981 --> 01:27:11,582
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my one comment.

911
01:27:11,682 --> 01:27:14,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, it was a very complete submittal.

912
01:27:14,804 --> 01:27:18,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate including the SWP as the appendix, as well as the no rise cert.

913
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:25,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the use of helical piles is a really good way to have de minimis impact on the floodplain for this part of the river.

914
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:26,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's always appreciated.

915
01:27:26,852 --> 01:27:29,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

916
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:29,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

917
01:27:33,619 --> 01:27:41,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess 1 question I had and I admit that I read this notice of intent last week so just going through my notes.

918
01:27:43,122 --> 01:27:46,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited project is mentioned multiple times, but then you go.

919
01:27:46,703 --> 01:27:48,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that you go through the performance standards.

920
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there specific performance standards that you're not meeting and hoping that the limited project covers or.

921
01:27:55,586 --> 01:28:00,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that kind of was that kind of a belt and suspenders approach?

922
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:05,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think we went through extensive review with mass dots permitting group.

923
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:14,615
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I think, and being a mass dot project, we're cognizant to to meet all of the standards to the greatest extent practical, but I don't.

924
01:28:15,575 --> 01:28:20,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it is a limited project, but, you know, we're doing everything that we can to meet meet the standards.

925
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:24,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks and I'm just going to flag that.

926
01:28:25,712 --> 01:28:29,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited project is discretionary for us, but I do appreciate that.

927
01:28:29,495 --> 01:28:34,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that you met the performance standards to the greatest extent extent extent possible.

928
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:36,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

929
01:28:41,084 --> 01:28:48,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps I missed it, but I didn't see a planting plan that specified.

930
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Which species are going where.

931
01:28:54,234 --> 01:28:58,016
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we do have that on our plans if that's something that.

932
01:28:59,017 --> 01:29:02,118
[SPEAKER_17]: We could provide, um, we have that on our.

933
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:07,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Construction plans that we've just recently submitted to mass dot for review.

934
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:14,419
[SPEAKER_17]: So here's the planting list for those new trees.

935
01:29:16,382 --> 01:29:27,636
[SPEAKER_17]: So three serviceberry, four red maple, two river heritage birch, two redbud, three hawthorn, two tulip trees, three black

936
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:31,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Topelo and 5 Swamp White Oak.

937
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:34,019
[SPEAKER_17]: So you see there's a nice variety.

938
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:41,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this has been reviewed by DCR's landscape architect as well as MassDOT's landscape architect.

939
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:46,883
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you want, we can submit these for your information.

940
01:29:47,873 --> 01:29:53,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I, I think it would be appropriate to include the planting plan in the submission.

941
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:59,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll defer to my colleague Jeremy on the selection of species, but I'm curious.

942
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you expect.

943
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:06,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Feedback from either mass daughter on this list that it might shift before.

944
01:30:06,224 --> 01:30:07,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's final.

945
01:30:10,307 --> 01:30:10,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

946
01:30:11,027 --> 01:30:21,771
[SPEAKER_17]: This was this is these 100% plans that were actually submitted to mass that we just received comments from them and I didn't see any comments on the particular species, but.

947
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:29,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah, we can send this to you and if there was a comment, we'll address that and then send that to you.

948
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

949
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was terrific.

950
01:30:33,169 --> 01:30:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll turn it over to Jeremy if he has more.

951
01:30:37,073 --> 01:30:37,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

952
01:30:37,914 --> 01:30:38,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eric.

953
01:30:39,316 --> 01:30:40,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that request.

954
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:44,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking through the packet myself and looking for the planting plan.

955
01:30:45,283 --> 01:30:49,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say just initially here, the list looks good.

956
01:30:49,227 --> 01:30:50,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like plants that are

957
01:30:51,269 --> 01:30:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: generally appropriate for this context and this topography and hydrology and condition.

958
01:30:59,132 --> 01:31:05,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just look forward to reviewing the plan itself and providing any comment on that.

959
01:31:05,355 --> 01:31:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like this is good information.

960
01:31:09,277 --> 01:31:09,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

961
01:31:15,817 --> 01:31:18,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Turning to something a bit more technical in nature.

962
01:31:18,558 --> 01:31:24,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to understand the impervious area calculations net new.

963
01:31:26,963 --> 01:31:33,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Table 2 on page 24 of the PDF of the NOI.

964
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:37,310
[SPEAKER_04]: PDF identifies 0.09 acres of

965
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: What I assumed to be net new impervious area, but that seems.

966
01:31:48,329 --> 01:31:52,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Different than what's shown in table 3, I think it is.

967
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:58,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, some of that, so these are the.

968
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:02,818
[SPEAKER_17]: New impervious areas within resource areas, so.

969
01:32:02,838 --> 01:32:05,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Another 986 square feet within the 200 foot riverfront and then.

970
01:32:12,062 --> 01:32:18,564
[SPEAKER_17]: 6,226 additional within the 100-foot buffer zone.

971
01:32:21,484 --> 01:32:24,005
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we got it broken out in a couple different ways.

972
01:32:24,945 --> 01:32:33,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a particular number that... Well, isn't that... So you add that up, it's over 7,000 square feet, and that's more than 0.09.

973
01:32:36,745 --> 01:32:41,746
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I don't I don't have these drawn out, but I'm wondering if there's some overlap between these.

974
01:32:42,406 --> 01:32:43,446
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my suspicion.

975
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:48,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I could break that down for you further just to clarify.

976
01:32:49,107 --> 01:32:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

977
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And then while you're on this under riverfront area.

978
01:32:57,189 --> 01:33:04,370
[SPEAKER_04]: The narrative just below this table says there are permanent and temporary impacts, but there's no temporary impact identified in the table.

979
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:07,829
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a standalone sentence there.

980
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:18,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Proposed pathways will be partially located within the RFA and 100 foot adjacent upland resource area will cause some permanent and temporary impacts.

981
01:33:18,957 --> 01:33:23,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we listed the temporary construction disturbance to land underwater.

982
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:24,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

983
01:33:26,221 --> 01:33:27,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm reading this.

984
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:29,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And the piles were permanent.

985
01:33:38,102 --> 01:33:44,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perhaps the temporary impacts was not intended to be associated with the RFA.

986
01:33:44,527 --> 01:33:47,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's my answer.

987
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:48,429
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

988
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,691
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can clean up that text.

989
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:51,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

990
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:53,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

991
01:33:54,353 --> 01:33:58,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I know these are minor quibbles, but just curious.

992
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:05,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that I hope you can help me understand is impacts to bank.

993
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've broken out very handily the temporary and permanent impacts, but it seems, first I'd like to understand what the 98 square feet of proposed replacement is meant to represent.

994
01:34:25,835 --> 01:34:32,220
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in form three, at the very top, page eight of the PDF.

995
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:35,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that proposed,

996
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:42,806
[SPEAKER_04]: But use quotes around replacement is going to be and then why is it for the total both temporary and permanent.

997
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:48,073
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I assume that's what it is.

998
01:34:58,654 --> 01:35:02,437
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess that's just the total of the impacts to the bank.

999
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:06,160
[SPEAKER_17]: But the bank is going to still be the bank.

1000
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:08,522
[SPEAKER_17]: The permanent impact is just the shading to it.

1001
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:20,492
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the temporary construction is just because there'll be construction activities occurring over that portion of the bank on either side as they're installing the boardwalk.

1002
01:35:22,033 --> 01:35:28,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's just a quantification rather than what one would typically consider as replacement.

1003
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:33,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, I guess it was really not being replaced, but being retained, I guess.

1004
01:35:36,507 --> 01:35:45,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can add a note to it or... Yeah, I know these forms are tricky, right?

1005
01:35:45,811 --> 01:35:48,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're stuck with the headers that they provide.

1006
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:50,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1007
01:35:51,434 --> 01:35:51,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1008
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:56,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's any need to make a change if it's just quantifying the total area of...

1009
01:35:57,655 --> 01:36:00,357
[SPEAKER_04]: permanent and temporary impact, I think that's fair.

1010
01:36:00,978 --> 01:36:06,262
[SPEAKER_17]: The bank is armored stone, so it's really, for the most part, going to remain in place.

1011
01:36:07,003 --> 01:36:10,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1012
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:17,432
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I'm hoping you can help me understand is,

1013
01:36:19,788 --> 01:36:33,816
[SPEAKER_04]: The shade impacts, and as a limited project, I think 1 of the parameters is adequate light to maintain vegetation and how that was evaluated in this instance.

1014
01:36:36,962 --> 01:36:48,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I guess we went, we went back and forth a lot with some of the reviewers about whether we counted all of the shading or just the shading outside of the bridge.

1015
01:36:48,205 --> 01:36:51,285
[SPEAKER_17]: So we tried to break that out, you know, like the new shading.

1016
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:57,147
[SPEAKER_17]: But we did calculate that as a permanent impact, the shading that the.

1017
01:36:58,598 --> 01:37:06,702
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're familiar with the area, a lot of that, you know, this is a rocky bottom.

1018
01:37:06,722 --> 01:37:14,386
[SPEAKER_17]: There's probably not a lot of vegetation in this area, but we didn't want to look like we were, you know, avoiding something.

1019
01:37:14,406 --> 01:37:20,529
[SPEAKER_17]: There's probably going to be some, you know, some light that's still going to get under depending on the angle of the sun.

1020
01:37:20,649 --> 01:37:24,710
[SPEAKER_17]: So we just, to be conservative, counted it all as a permanent impact.

1021
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:41,558
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion among the team about selection of materials that might minimize shading rather than EPA decking, if there was some other solution that still met ADA requirements, anything of that nature.

1022
01:37:42,397 --> 01:37:43,237
[SPEAKER_17]: No, not really.

1023
01:37:43,277 --> 01:37:47,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the Ipe decking is used by the DCR because of its durability.

1024
01:37:49,059 --> 01:38:00,421
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a replenishable resource because it grows pretty quickly in the forests that they have in South America.

1025
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:04,942
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's fire resistant, insect resistant.

1026
01:38:05,222 --> 01:38:07,223
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a very, very durable hardwood.

1027
01:38:08,184 --> 01:38:12,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if there's a type of material that would let light through it.

1028
01:38:12,773 --> 01:38:16,722
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't want to use any type of plastic or glass or anything on this.

1029
01:38:17,604 --> 01:38:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: No, certainly.

1030
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric, may I make a comment?

1031
01:38:23,651 --> 01:38:24,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please.

1032
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to clarify something.

1033
01:38:26,794 --> 01:38:43,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that EPA is actually considered a rare resource and is, you know, across projects, people are trying to find alternatives to tropical hardwood use for decking projects like this.

1034
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are actually some species like cedar,

1035
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:54,994
[SPEAKER_02]: and black locusts and others that may be more appropriate and more environmentally friendly alternatives.

1036
01:38:56,447 --> 01:39:21,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I think please do look into Eric's request further and evaluate what other options are out there as far as wood species or alternative materials or even ways of modifying details of the decking to provide a little bit more gap between boards or other things that could let additional light pass through to the resource area below.

1037
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:26,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I certainly, I appreciate that, Jeremy.

1038
01:39:26,244 --> 01:39:26,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1039
01:39:26,665 --> 01:39:32,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And I sympathize there, you know, there are significant constraints to make sure this is ADA compliant.

1040
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:42,659
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no spacing of material, but I would be interested in some alternative approaches for those materials.

1041
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:43,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1042
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:56,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I'm going to raise, and I hope Craig can chime in if I'm getting too far afield because I'm getting into his area of expertise, and that's stormwater.

1043
01:39:56,483 --> 01:40:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: For the groundwater recharge volume, was that calculated from the net increase in impervious area?

1044
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:12,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Craig, I'll defer to you again.

1045
01:40:12,352 --> 01:40:23,039
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think we're attempting to meet the standard to the maximum extent practicable in this instance, but I don't think I saw that calculated.

1046
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:27,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And same for peak rate calculations.

1047
01:40:30,904 --> 01:40:32,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let John respond to that first.

1048
01:40:34,266 --> 01:40:35,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see.

1049
01:40:35,586 --> 01:40:36,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go look at the...

1050
01:42:00,296 --> 01:42:04,217
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, see the calculations, so you want you want the actual calculations.

1051
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:09,319
[SPEAKER_15]: I think to to pick up on the thread that Eric is dropping here.

1052
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:14,341
[SPEAKER_15]: The project is a limited project.

1053
01:42:14,781 --> 01:42:16,941
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to meet the standards to the extent practical.

1054
01:42:18,242 --> 01:42:24,684
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't look given that it doesn't look like there's been a ton of thought put into the stormwater for the site.

1055
01:42:25,592 --> 01:42:30,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, to to what Eric was talking about, Eric and Jeremy are talking about alternatives analysis.

1056
01:42:32,255 --> 01:42:41,219
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, for a, a walkway, seeing an alternative analysis for things like impervious paving.

1057
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,421
[SPEAKER_15]: To minimize impervious cover.

1058
01:42:46,098 --> 01:42:51,521
[SPEAKER_15]: know, fully recognize this isn't necessarily the best spot to put a full BMP.

1059
01:42:52,541 --> 01:43:02,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Given the landscape and wetlands resources that we have here, it may not be the best spot to do, you know, swales and treatment structures and things like that.

1060
01:43:02,065 --> 01:43:07,628
[SPEAKER_15]: But there are ways to minimize the impact that this would have on things like your peak runoff rate and your groundwater recharge.

1061
01:43:10,362 --> 01:43:14,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Maximum extent practicable still does mean maximum extent practicable.

1062
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:18,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So showing some effort being put towards that would be useful.

1063
01:43:19,038 --> 01:43:33,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and we did discuss a lot of those and similar to what you said that we didn't think creating swales or, you know, a rain garden or a BMP in this, you know, because it's a park setting was going to provide a benefit.

1064
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,432
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't want to channel the water to the river.

1065
01:43:36,452 --> 01:43:42,877
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, right now it's, you know, there's a path there today where we're widening it to meet standards.

1066
01:43:44,878 --> 01:43:48,622
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we didn't want to create any new flows.

1067
01:43:49,062 --> 01:43:52,726
[SPEAKER_17]: We're reseeding the area.

1068
01:43:52,866 --> 01:44:02,495
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have a no-mow grass seed mix because the DCR doesn't want to have to come and mow the grass.

1069
01:44:02,735 --> 01:44:08,400
[SPEAKER_17]: But we can certainly review the calculations and provide those.

1070
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:15,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Assess just even even assessing alternatives if they don't work for the site, you know.

1071
01:44:17,195 --> 01:44:20,957
[SPEAKER_15]: That's understandable, but but things that are more pervious in nature.

1072
01:44:22,678 --> 01:44:27,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Demonstrating that those were either thought of and found to be a really good idea and and could, you know.

1073
01:44:28,442 --> 01:44:33,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Help help pushed towards meeting those standards or that they don't work and kind of explaining why.

1074
01:44:34,606 --> 01:44:37,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Demonstrating that effort, I think, is is what Eric is.

1075
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,301
[SPEAKER_15]: and pushing towards.

1076
01:44:39,741 --> 01:44:41,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate that clarity.

1077
01:44:41,963 --> 01:44:42,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1078
01:44:42,283 --> 01:44:51,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in particular, the potential locations of the MPs and some of these other techniques would be helpful to see in a plan.

1079
01:44:51,870 --> 01:45:06,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And one last topic near and dear to my heart, if the applicant would be willing, I think it would be helpful for the commission to see

1080
01:45:09,412 --> 01:45:17,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, presuming that the project is subject to chapter 91, you need a license and water quality serve potentially and any army core.

1081
01:45:18,396 --> 01:45:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Approvals if the applicant would be willing to provide the commission with those approvals when they're issued.

1082
01:45:24,899 --> 01:45:27,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're we've been meeting with them.

1083
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,280
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a.

1084
01:45:28,799 --> 01:45:42,743
[SPEAKER_17]: another Chapter 91 meeting, got their comments on the draft Chapter 91 application, and we had a meeting with Coast Guard and Army Corps just to confirm that Coast Guard's not required and what, if any, Army Corps permit is required.

1085
01:45:42,823 --> 01:45:45,604
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have been in discussions with them recently.

1086
01:45:45,624 --> 01:45:47,304
[SPEAKER_17]: So... That's great.

1087
01:45:47,844 --> 01:45:57,047
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all happening simultaneously, so... I certainly... And I guess we need this, the order of conditions in order to file Army Corps, so...

1088
01:45:57,947 --> 01:46:00,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and probably same for Chapter 91.

1089
01:46:01,469 --> 01:46:10,973
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you do get to the end of those processes, I think I would like a condition in our order that requests that you submit those permits when they're granted.

1090
01:46:10,993 --> 01:46:12,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, absolutely.

1091
01:46:12,934 --> 01:46:19,397
[SPEAKER_17]: The city's the applicant, so they'll get those too, yeah.

1092
01:46:20,898 --> 01:46:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else have anything?

1093
01:46:25,331 --> 01:46:36,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I should say if there's anyone from the public who is on who would like to speak, ask that you raise your hand using the Zoom function.

1094
01:46:36,222 --> 01:46:46,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see anybody having dialed in, but if people are on and they would like to ask questions or make comments, now's the time.

1095
01:46:46,391 --> 01:46:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Please raise your hand.

1096
01:46:51,932 --> 01:46:53,073
[SPEAKER_04]: and not seen anyone.

1097
01:46:53,693 --> 01:47:00,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, if anybody else on the commission has anything, I think I would entertain a motion here.

1098
01:47:00,517 --> 01:47:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're suggesting that we'd like to see the planting plan and those few other details.

1099
01:47:14,206 --> 01:47:16,547
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody can make a motion, that would be terrific.

1100
01:47:19,069 --> 01:47:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: What hearing we're continuing into, sorry.

1101
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:23,462
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of stream of consciousness here.

1102
01:47:25,764 --> 01:47:33,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I mean, it's up to John, but we actually did get a filing for another hearing.

1103
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:41,157
[SPEAKER_19]: A new project came in just yesterday, but I have not really had any time to review it because of everything leading up to today.

1104
01:47:41,217 --> 01:47:42,859
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's pretty much my tomorrow morning.

1105
01:47:43,299 --> 01:47:46,142
[SPEAKER_19]: But looking at dates,

1106
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:57,035
[SPEAKER_19]: If we continued, if we have that one, I think January 8th is the opening, is that, depending on number of availability.

1107
01:47:58,176 --> 01:48:04,620
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we do that to the 8th, and John thinks they can get everything back by the 8th, we can continue this to the 8th.

1108
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:06,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think we can.

1109
01:48:06,922 --> 01:48:11,685
[SPEAKER_17]: When would you need everything sent to you by in advance of that meeting?

1110
01:48:17,773 --> 01:48:23,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, I think a week ahead of time is fair, but we have the intervening holidays and a week before is the first.

1111
01:48:23,615 --> 01:48:29,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think in this instance, I would be fine with a shorter lead time than usual.

1112
01:48:29,776 --> 01:48:40,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if my fellow commissioners feel differently, but if we can see something by COB the third or maybe the sixth.

1113
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:47,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, especially since you were very specific about what we're looking for, it seems like that's reasonable.

1114
01:48:48,387 --> 01:48:49,268
[SPEAKER_19]: COB, the 6th.

1115
01:48:49,428 --> 01:48:53,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, the planning plan seems to be done, so that can just be submitted tomorrow.

1116
01:48:54,051 --> 01:48:55,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So that'll, we can check that off right away.

1117
01:48:55,752 --> 01:48:59,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was going to say the Monday before, if that sounds fine to me.

1118
01:48:59,934 --> 01:49:00,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree.

1119
01:49:01,235 --> 01:49:03,056
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, yeah, the 30th.

1120
01:49:03,156 --> 01:49:03,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

1121
01:49:04,557 --> 01:49:05,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, John.

1122
01:49:05,057 --> 01:49:05,258
[SPEAKER_10]: The 6th.

1123
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:06,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

1124
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:10,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and we'll try to get that in sooner.

1125
01:49:12,644 --> 01:49:17,768
[SPEAKER_17]: but there's just some alternatives analysis and some calculations that you were looking for also.

1126
01:49:18,188 --> 01:49:19,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1127
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:27,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess with that, I'd entertain a motion to continue the hearing to our next regularly scheduled hearing, which will be on January 8th, 2025.

1128
01:49:31,935 --> 01:49:45,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make a motion with the applicant's consent to continue this matter DEP file 215-0240 to the commission's next hearing on January 8th, 2025.

1129
01:49:46,586 --> 01:49:47,226
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that.

1130
01:49:48,607 --> 01:49:49,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll consent to that.

1131
01:49:50,549 --> 01:49:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, John.

1132
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: If the commission will now vote upon calling their name.

1133
01:49:57,334 --> 01:49:57,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Caroline.

1134
01:49:58,375 --> 01:49:58,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1135
01:49:59,355 --> 01:49:59,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg.

1136
01:50:00,316 --> 01:50:00,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1137
01:50:01,077 --> 01:50:01,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Heather.

1138
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:07,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I. And Jeremy, and I am an eye and the eyes have it.

1139
01:50:07,385 --> 01:50:08,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, John.

1140
01:50:08,105 --> 01:50:13,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate the filing and the thought that went into it and you're accommodating our request.

1141
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:14,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Much appreciate it.

1142
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:14,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1143
01:50:14,971 --> 01:50:15,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for your comments.

1144
01:50:17,013 --> 01:50:17,593
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll see you soon.

1145
01:50:17,613 --> 01:50:18,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

1146
01:50:18,574 --> 01:50:19,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1147
01:50:20,075 --> 01:50:21,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Really an excellent time.

1148
01:50:24,342 --> 01:50:27,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Dennis, I've put my secretary on.

1149
01:50:27,743 --> 01:50:30,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be available for the 22nd.

1150
01:50:30,964 --> 01:50:32,865
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be able to exchange.

1151
01:50:33,605 --> 01:50:34,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1152
01:50:34,565 --> 01:50:40,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Then just to give you a brief little, literally, I just got this yesterday, the other filing.

1153
01:50:40,827 --> 01:50:46,789
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a notice of intent for a, basically, it's a house that's adjacent to the Fells,

1154
01:50:47,703 --> 01:50:54,725
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all the project work is buffers all the work and it's basically an existing house that they want to take down and put up a new house in the same.

1155
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:58,005
[SPEAKER_19]: On the property, so I literally.

1156
01:50:59,066 --> 01:51:05,647
[SPEAKER_19]: At 53 went from like, this is so I just got it, but it's interesting because the property.

1157
01:51:05,667 --> 01:51:12,729
[SPEAKER_19]: Is in both Winchester and Medford, but I think the entirety of their work proposed is solely in Medford.

1158
01:51:14,246 --> 01:51:18,709
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I don't know if there's going to be, I'm going to need to look and see if they actually filed in Winchester as well.

1159
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:21,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if that's the case, then we would need to coordinate with them.

1160
01:51:21,271 --> 01:51:23,293
[SPEAKER_19]: I would think, but given that the majority of the product.

1161
01:51:24,133 --> 01:51:26,315
[SPEAKER_19]: You have a lot of experience went for way.

1162
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:28,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but given given the.

1163
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:34,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost probably, I'd say 90% of the property is Medford and the house is fully in Medford that.

1164
01:51:35,135 --> 01:51:38,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally, in these situations, like, we would sort of take the lead and then.

1165
01:51:39,217 --> 01:51:41,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Winchester would just sort of say, what were your conditions?

1166
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:42,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's fine.

1167
01:51:42,898 --> 01:51:46,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Sort of, you know, if they have anything special, they might throw it in, but usually they kind of defer to the.

1168
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:55,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Primary city in these sort of cases, so, but I will review this tomorrow morning and I will send it off to you.

1169
01:51:55,183 --> 01:51:58,645
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can take a look at it.

1170
01:52:00,557 --> 01:52:05,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, luckily, comparatively, some of our other projects, this is a lot thinner than some of the more recent ones.

1171
01:52:05,446 --> 01:52:05,627
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1172
01:52:08,612 --> 01:52:10,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I jumped on someone, but I couldn't see you.

1173
01:52:11,133 --> 01:52:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was going to say, what is the update with South Street?

1174
01:52:15,196 --> 01:52:18,778
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw that on the agenda, but we're the only ones left.

1175
01:52:18,798 --> 01:52:20,199
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be completely honest with you.

1176
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,521
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not gone back to the property owner.

1177
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:23,502
[SPEAKER_19]: That's OK.

1178
01:52:23,522 --> 01:52:27,845
[SPEAKER_19]: So tomorrow, I need to go talk to him so we can get him to come on the meeting on the 8th as well.

1179
01:52:28,465 --> 01:52:29,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm sorry about that.

1180
01:52:29,586 --> 01:52:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's end this thing.

1181
01:52:32,688 --> 01:52:34,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Heidi quit on us here, it seems.

1182
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:35,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

1183
01:52:36,211 --> 01:52:38,032
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little scary.

1184
01:52:38,332 --> 01:52:39,473
[SPEAKER_19]: She saw her out and took it.

1185
01:52:41,298 --> 01:52:42,079
[SPEAKER_19]: You did great, Eric.

1186
01:52:42,799 --> 01:52:43,840
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.

1187
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:44,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys.

1188
01:52:45,661 --> 01:52:46,242
[SPEAKER_10]: A good meeting.

1189
01:52:46,282 --> 01:52:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done.

1190
01:52:46,902 --> 01:52:48,864
[SPEAKER_10]: We still need to close the meeting.

1191
01:52:50,505 --> 01:52:52,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to raise one point.

1192
01:52:53,928 --> 01:52:58,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It sort of bounced around my head when people started talking about a site visit.

1193
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, Caroline, you at some point mentioned some interest in revisiting the bylaw.

1194
01:53:06,787 --> 01:53:18,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if people would be interested in evaluating the potential for including in our filing schedule a date for a site visit.

1195
01:53:18,836 --> 01:53:25,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning you'd have to file by X date, the potential for a site visit would be on Y date, and the hearing would be on Z date.

1196
01:53:26,662 --> 01:53:36,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't necessarily have to hold a site visit, but just hold that in the schedule so that if as people file, we feel that it would be worthwhile to have a notice of intent.

1197
01:53:36,277 --> 01:53:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The applicant can expect to have that on their schedule.

1198
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:43,761
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's something people would be interested in, I think it's worth contemplating.

1199
01:53:43,801 --> 01:53:48,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they've started doing that in Boston, and it seems to be a fairly efficient process.

1200
01:53:48,387 --> 01:53:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't end up after the fact, people raising the point that they like a site visit, and we have to sort of scramble to get things on the calendar.

1201
01:53:57,258 --> 01:54:19,128
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as those of you who are employed write this or put this in in such a way that there's enough flexibility so that it's really your schedules that get mostly impacted, at least historically that's been the problem, not the problem but the challenge, wouldn't you say Dennis?

1202
01:54:19,488 --> 01:54:23,210
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, I usually make side visits to everything anyway on my own.

1203
01:54:26,313 --> 01:54:28,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Just eat, but I like, I like the concept.

1204
01:54:29,095 --> 01:54:33,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure you write it in such a way that you don't set yourselves up.

1205
01:54:34,358 --> 01:54:35,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that my.

1206
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:43,184
[SPEAKER_15]: My feedback on that is I work a job in civil engineering, but I'm virtually based map sites all over the country.

1207
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:47,707
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have travel booked out through February right now.

1208
01:54:49,328 --> 01:54:59,214
[SPEAKER_15]: If we were to set up a program where we had dictated kind of site visit dates based on whenever folks decided to apply, I wouldn't be able to attend anything.

1209
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:15,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I think our current setup where if we deem we need a site visit after hearings, which I think we've had this happen twice in the last year and a half now, we can schedule it kind of based on availability is a little more flexible, given that, you know,

1210
01:55:17,956 --> 01:55:20,617
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my case.

1211
01:55:20,657 --> 01:55:23,999
[SPEAKER_15]: That works a lot easier for me, I have to say.

1212
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:25,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

1213
01:55:25,179 --> 01:55:26,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that, Craig.

1214
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:27,260
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1215
01:55:30,202 --> 01:55:44,908
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a really good idea, but given the current level of effort that the CONCOM is, it's great.

1216
01:55:45,128 --> 01:55:46,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And being able to schedule is also great.

1217
01:55:48,926 --> 01:55:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect did we land on a date for a site visit, or do we want to try to nail that down tonight or follow?

1218
01:55:56,990 --> 01:56:01,472
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I was going to have the applicant sort of give us a couple of dates and then sort of set it up to you.

1219
01:56:01,532 --> 01:56:06,214
[SPEAKER_19]: I could just let him sort of talk with him and this client about what dates work best for him.

1220
01:56:06,474 --> 01:56:09,155
[SPEAKER_19]: And then once I get a couple from them, I just do a little.

1221
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:16,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Doodle poll to you all and sort of say, you know, but I think we sort of did pretty much settle on early morning early morning.

1222
01:56:16,726 --> 01:56:17,446
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know.

1223
01:56:18,127 --> 01:56:25,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the preference that is on that point, you know, a couple of people, the public expressed interest.

1224
01:56:25,093 --> 01:56:26,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding.

1225
01:56:26,854 --> 01:56:28,476
[SPEAKER_05]: This is still private property.

1226
01:56:28,576 --> 01:56:32,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't require them to open their property up.

1227
01:56:32,679 --> 01:56:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: We might yeah, so, yeah, we're just going to keep it.

1228
01:56:37,122 --> 01:56:42,586
[SPEAKER_05]: An email to the commissioners and we do have to post I know if there's a quorum, we do have to post it.

1229
01:56:43,607 --> 01:56:46,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.

1230
01:56:46,029 --> 01:56:47,590
[SPEAKER_19]: So the, the other thing, and then this.

1231
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:53,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Came from the property owner contacted me asking for some of the contact and for some of the people in the meeting tonight.

1232
01:56:53,932 --> 01:56:57,673
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I believe he's going to get in touch with them and try and talk to them prior to the hearing.

1233
01:56:57,853 --> 01:57:05,155
[SPEAKER_19]: He actually did ask me prior to this if anyone was interested and there was a woman who had called me a few times and I put the 2 of them in touch.

1234
01:57:06,076 --> 01:57:08,136
[SPEAKER_19]: And she was on the northern side.

1235
01:57:09,437 --> 01:57:12,578
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe the contact and then, but, you know, I think some of the others.

1236
01:57:13,283 --> 01:57:18,287
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, seemed willing to speak with the property owner, the property owner seemed willing to speak with the abutters.

1237
01:57:18,607 --> 01:57:19,968
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's fairly positive.

1238
01:57:23,591 --> 01:57:33,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to harp on my favorite scab to pick at, Dennis, but do we have any minutes to approve before we close this out?

1239
01:57:33,418 --> 01:57:37,281
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's pretty much my, I am here all next week.

1240
01:57:38,325 --> 01:57:39,506
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not going away anywhere.

1241
01:57:39,606 --> 01:57:44,772
