    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=29.106s">President</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=30.006s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=30.427s">Seven</a>  members present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=32.387s">Please</a>  join me in rising to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=34.708s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=36.749s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=44.032s">15-716</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved for Metro City Council have Mayor notified the T and Department of Transportation regarding the problems and recent incidents regarding the gates at the West Medford train station that have been knocked down several times within four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=69.152s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=70.369s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=71.589s">Mr.</a>  President, being a resident, living in West Medford, I get to see those trains a little more than some of our other councilors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=81.792s">Folks,</a>  can we quiet it down in the back of the room, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=85.233s">Council,</a>  continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=85.953s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=86.793s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=88.514s">Over</a>  the last few weeks, there's been several incidents at that train station where trucks have knocked those gates down a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=96.936s">A</a>  woman got hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=99.537s">about</a>  six weeks ago there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=102.278s">And</a>  I think it's time that we have the DOT and the T come down and investigate that and maybe working some other kind of configuration, especially with those, since they put in those, that lane divider there, the trucks can't make that turn if they're coming off a place that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=120.131s">So</a>  if you can send something, if the mayor can send something to the T and the DOT, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=127.055s">to</a>  maybe do some kind of study or maybe work something out with those cones there.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=133.678s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=134.639s">So</a>  on that motion of Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.0s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=138.981s">And</a>  I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=143.303s">You</a>  know, this is becoming a major problem in the West Medford area, not only for the business community, but also for the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=150.79s">And</a>  unfortunately, these things over the last few weeks have been knocked down at the height of rush hour, whether it's five o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=159.734s">It</a>  comes to a total gridlock every time the trains are coming by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=163.495s">They</a>  have to get the police cruisers out there, stop the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=166.277s">It's</a>  just becoming a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=169.198s">I</a>  think it's about time, given that it's a state road, Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=172.5s">that</a>  the Department of Transportation has to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=176.843s">There</a>  has to be a total look at that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=179.165s">We</a>  still have those things down the middle of the road that divide the road that we had to put in in lieu of the horns being blown every time a train comes by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=189.032s">But</a>  at this point, I think we have to look at a major upgrade of the entire West Medford train station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=196.018s">You</a>  know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=198.72s">In</a>  the coming few years, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=202.824s">excuse</a>  me, in the coming few years, there's going to be possibility down in that area for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=206.967s">Have</a>  we ever looked at putting the train platform on the other side of the train tracks so that it stops behind, say, the liquor store in that area, so that it doesn't have to keep the gates down for a long time, that it stops before the gates, and then it, when it's coming from Lowell, it would go by the gate and then stop <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=226.471s">I'm</a>  not so sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=227.211s">I</a>  don't know if we have the room, but with all the projects going on here from the DOT and our community right now, whether it's Craddock Bridge, whether it's the Green Line, I think we have to take a serious look at the West Medford train station because it is becoming a nuisance, not only this particular matter, but just the amount of foot traffic in the area, which we encourage for environmentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=249.388s">We</a>  want to have people take the train, but at the same token, we want to have it the safest possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=254.485s">And</a>  the best aesthetically pleasing that we can do as well, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=258.587s">So</a>  just food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=261.308s">We</a>  are going to have to do a big cleanup of that parking lot at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=264.81s">And</a>  it may be the appropriate time to tie all this in together, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=270.905s">If</a>  there's people in that immediate area that are looking to maybe sell their property, might be an opportunity for an economic development engine too, where you could actually reconfigure some of the area down there, build brand new storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=284.554s">There's</a>  a million things you could do down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=287.636s">It's</a>  over an acre of land if you take the, what is it, Stevens Auto Body? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=293.44s">The</a>  West Medford parking lot and, like, that whole area, it's over an acre of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=297.562s">So</a>  the development possibilities are endless. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=301.063s">So</a>  it's something to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=303.264s">It</a>  also abuts the Medford Housing Authority, which is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=306.365s">So</a>  I think it's something long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=308.646s">We've</a>  got to have a long-term vision in this community, and I think it's one area we could look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=312.447s">But</a>  on the immediate concern that Councilor Caraviello brought up, I think it's something that has to be looked at sooner than later.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=322.6s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=324.061s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=325.422s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=326.362s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing up this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=331.405s">This</a>  actually plays right into the presentation we just received from a group called Walk Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=339.19s">And</a>  they just sent us a seven page brochure, I guess, on issues that were pointed out within our community and ways that <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=351.881s">We</a>  as a community could be eligible for capital improvement investments of up to $12.5 million from MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=360.846s">And</a>  all we need to do is outline a detailed program on complete streets and be certified by MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=369.591s">And</a>  we could be eligible for the funding, which would improve many walkways in our community, many areas right now that are deemed unsafe or unfit for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=381.605s">And</a>  this is a perfect segue into this walk method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=386.328s">And</a>  at some point, Mr. President, we should either have a Committee of the Whole meeting or maybe a public safety meeting to discuss some of the initiatives that were put forth in this particular presentation and see how we, as a council, can actively participate in putting forward a complete street program so we can become eligible for <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=410.54s">federal</a>  funding and state funding also for projects within our community to help with pedestrian safety.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=419.803s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=420.223s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=422.083s">So</a>  on the motion of Caraviello as amended by Councilor Marks, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=426.584s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=428.105s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=428.545s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=428.965s">15-717</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=432.546s">Be</a>  it resolved that the bus stops in the Main Street and Harvard Street locations be discussed.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=438.298s">Regarding</a>  these bus stop locations, Mr. President, there seems to be an ongoing concern as it relates to traffic into the business part of the community of Main Street into the South Medford area over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=450.425s">And</a>  the bus stops have continuously kept coming up after speaking with some of the business merchants on maybe looking at them, maybe moving them or readjusting their locations and taking that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=462.071s">And</a>  I think it was almost a month ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=464.573s">The</a>  council asked for the T to come down to the city council as it relates to Medford Square and the Kratik Bridge and the moving of the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=472.456s">Have</a>  you heard anything yet?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=474.276s">I</a>  think we're still waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=475.337s">The</a>  clerk and I are going to be meeting on a couple of things we're still waiting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=479.958s">We</a>  were good enough, the clerk arranged for us to have that meeting from the Eversource people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=486.243s">last</a>  week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=486.743s">I</a>  know that took some coordinating with their schedules and hours, but I think the clerk's still waiting to hear from DOT and the T on the issue that you mentioned.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=497.348s">Well,</a>  relative to the bus stops, I'd like to include this in there because before this becomes a problem that's probably not needed, maybe just have a look and see as to where the bus stops might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=508.593s">Maybe</a>  they can be rearranged, move around because there's a serious problem as it relates to the commercial part of <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=514.728s">trucks</a>  coming down there loading and unloading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=516.87s">And,</a>  um, I just think it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=520.813s">It's</a>  been discussed in the past, but I think it's gotten to the point right now it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=525.076s">All</a>  those businesses down there, it's full occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=527.698s">So</a>  there's some concerns relative to the safety and to the locations for where trucks can make deposits and during the course of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=536.085s">So</a>  I just think, um, I don't know why it takes so long for the T to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=540.929s">Do</a>  you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=542.974s">The</a>  bus drops are in the control of the council.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=545.637s">So,</a>  well, I think, uh, I have an opinion from, uh, uh, former city solicitor Riley saying that, uh, uh, that we cannot, uh, we do not have the authority to pass an ordinance empowering it to establish or relocate bus stops on our own volition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=564.063s">And</a>  so that has to be done in concert with the MBTA, as well as I think it would be prudent to involve the Traffic Commission in this decision-making process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=576.948s">Move</a>  the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=579.269s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=582.91s">Was</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=583.55s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=586.212s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=587.012s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn was in queue first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=589.373s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=591.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=591.948s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=592.209s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=594.37s">I,</a>  too, just want to concur with the sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=596.751s">We</a>  were here two weeks ago to discuss the issue with regards to businesses, delivery trucks, parking on the sidewalks in the South Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=607.038s">And</a>  the restaurants do need a place to be able to load and unload. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=612.001s">But</a>  we do have an issue with the bus stops, and I think we definitely need to roundtable it with the MBTA and create <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=618.987s">make</a>  some changes to not only make it pedestrian safe, but also allow for businesses to have a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=626.794s">And</a>  I think moving that bus stop, we just need to figure out, in unison with all the businesses, the best place to move it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=633.84s">I</a>  think that's something we definitely need to take a good hard look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=637.002s">We</a>  thank you to the DPW who installed Bullards where <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=643.073s">the</a>  traffic commission voted to place them a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=646.776s">But</a>  those were recently placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=648.898s">And</a>  still, I got a photo from a resident who cares about the safety in the community and in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=659.586s">And</a>  trucks, as of today, are still parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=662.368s">It's</a>  almost worse at this point, because the bullets are making the trucks completely take over the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=669.154s">So</a>  if you're on Harvard Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=672.006s">There</a>  is no pedestrian access on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=676.987s">And</a>  I, you know, we have senior citizens, we have strollers, we have the average person who, it's unsafe in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=683.248s">It's</a>  highly, it's a highly, highly trafficked area and we cannot have delivery trucks parked on our sidewalks for extended periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=692.53s">It's</a>  unsafe for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=695.77s">We</a>  need to figure out a way to accommodate pedestrian safety, number one, and number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=701.233s">some</a>  loading zones for our businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=702.934s">So</a>  I hope that we can call a meeting with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=706.497s">Um,</a>  next, next week is the election, but hopefully the week after, hopefully somebody is available so that we can sit down and make that change.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=718.045s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=719.205s">Um,</a>  I think that this should be sent to the transportation subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=722.788s">Um,</a>  there's a couple of papers in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=724.309s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Penton is the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=726.612s">There's</a>  one paper in there from October 2014, a year ago, to discuss bicycle safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=733.236s">And</a>  that hasn't been called yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=734.737s">Maybe</a>  we can put that, as well as the Craddock Bridge discussion that was supposed to take place in the Transportation Subcommittee from March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=741.461s">Maybe</a>  if we have one meeting, if Councilor Pentos thinks there's a need for it, call a meeting as the chairperson and take all three of these matters up on the same evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=752.087s">But</a>  there's been quite some time has surpassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=756.828s">And</a>  there's also a couple other ones on the committee of the whole regarding the bus stop down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=762.552s">Maybe,</a>  do we want to move it all into the transportation subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=766.014s">I</a>  don't know if we can parliamentary, but.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=772.277s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=773.178s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=774.319s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=775.739s">I</a>  think it's safe to say that there have been a variety of issues that have come up before this body relative to the MBTA or the Massachusetts Highway Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=783.764s">Councilor</a>  Marks gave a great <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=785.94s">discussion</a>  and a great synopsis on the walk grant money that's available for us there, provided we get certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=793.244s">And</a>  I think it's important, Mr. President, if we're going to keep calling MassDOT down here to address certain issues in this community, that maybe we establish a comprehensive list so that we can do it all in one shot, as opposed to doing a resolution, sending it out there, telling DOT to come down here on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=806.411s">They</a>  come down here on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=807.872s">We</a>  resolve that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=808.853s">They</a>  go back to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=810.313s">Two</a>  weeks later, something else comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=811.774s">We</a>  send another resolution and bring them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=813.897s">and</a>  go on and on and on and on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=816.021s">I</a>  think it might make sense for us to have our transportation subcommittee take a look at the issues that are out there pending right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=822.45s">and</a>  put a list together, maybe then we can meet in the Committee of the Whole, prioritize that list, and then have the representative from the DOT come down, which encompasses the MBTA, the Massachusetts Highway Department, the road management for the DCR, and we can move forward in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=835.714s">But</a>  at least it'll be a little bit more comprehensive as opposed to, you know, picking one fish out of the barrel at a time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=841.015s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=841.536s">So</a>  a motion of Councilor Pente as amended by Councilors Camuso, Knight, and Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=849.658s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=852.751s">Ma'am,</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=854.872s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Ann Fretts]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=857.833s">Ann</a>  Marie Fretz, 215 Harvard Street, overlooking Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=861.815s">I</a>  was here two weeks ago to address the parking on South Redford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=866.797s">If</a>  you all took a look at this, this is prior to the two bollards that were installed at the crosswalk here, preventing cars from driving directly into the Oasis private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=879.794s">What</a>  was approved by the Traffic Commission back on March 18th of 2015 were bollards around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=888.045s">It</a>  specifically says on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=890.469s">And</a>  this is what Chief Sacco and I had put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=893.51s">last</a>  October on the same corner right here to prevent trucks from driving straight through and parking on the sidewalk and blocking the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=902.913s">The</a>  bollards have been installed, two bollards right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=906.714s">Cars</a>  cannot block through, but what they're doing is jumping the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=911.116s">This</a>  was this morning taken by my husband at 11 o'clock this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=915.833s">truck</a>  drove right up onto the sidewalk, just as they have been doing all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=921.537s">So</a>  there's no question that the bollards were supposed to be put along Harvard Street to prevent trucks from going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=927.401s">There's</a>  supposed to be a 10-foot gap to allow public parking, I'm sorry, public waste management services to get in and empty the dumpster. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=936.688s">I</a>  spoke with them again today, and yes, that's all they need is a 10-foot gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=940.551s">And</a>  please put a chain there so no one else goes through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=944.269s">And</a>  what I would like to ask is that someone find out why the bollards were not installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=949.372s">I</a>  was told by several of the DPW workers that there were intended to put in the bollards along Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=956.057s">I</a>  can't get an answer from anyone in any of the departments, whether it be DPW, the police department, and the chief is in Chicago at this point, but I'm sure he would be checking up on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=967.024s">Mark</a>  Rolney doesn't know of any legal issue that the bollards would not be installed along Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=972.732s">So</a>  the neighborhood expectations were that bollards would be put up to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=976.793s">We</a>  have no place to walk that's safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=979.434s">We</a>  cannot walk on either side of the street because trucks parking on that side drives cars to park on the other side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=987.357s">I'm</a>  sorry, not the street, parked on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=990.618s">All</a>  the more reason to have a loading dock for Bocelli's, for Oasis, and for all of the other places that need their deliveries made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1000.161s">Licenses</a>  were granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1003.31s">for</a>  these restaurants without loading zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1006.232s">And</a>  when the street was paved in 2010, October 2010, by North Shore Construction and Development, they had asked for a cutout next to Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1018.059s">At</a>  that time, there could have been negotiations to take over some of Oasis's private property to make it a sidewalk so they could have a loading zone cutout at that time, and it was refused by the community development saying the street would not allow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1032.956s">So</a>  what I would ask is that the DPW, in lieu of putting up the bollards because of unknown reasons, A, find out what the reason is for the delay in the bollards along Harvard Street, and put these up to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1046.186s">Please,</a>  along the lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1047.607s">They</a>  could go all the way down to the driveway entry at 215 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1052.211s">That's</a>  how many trucks park on this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1054.393s">They</a>  may be customers of Oasis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1056.875s">They</a>  may be delivery trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1058.276s">We</a>  cannot traverse these sidewalks because of these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1062.199s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1259.893s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1261.354s">You</a>  know, I think the ironic thing about this whole issue is we're talking about a bus stop, we're talking about commercial vehicles parking on a sidewalk, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1271.47s">And</a>  actually, the issue is that now we have a bus stop that's right next to the commercial vehicles parking on the sidewalk, which is an accident waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1283.038s">So</a>  I would offer a motion, Mr. President, to get clarification from the Traffic Commission on the bollards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1291.404s">It</a>  was my understanding, too, the bollards would circle around the corner of Haven and Main. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1297.468s">And</a>  that's, I thought, was the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1300.043s">If</a>  we can get clarification from the Traffic Commission on the balls going up Harvard, so that would prevent any type of trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1308.969s">Clearly,</a>  that picture is shows an accident waiting to happen with a truck of that nature parked on a sidewalk where baby carriages and young kids and seniors are walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1323.218s">It</a>  just doesn't make a good mix, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1326.2s">And</a>  also, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1327.61s">You</a>  know, this topic has been discussed for a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1331.371s">When</a>  we traversed, along with the Salt and Effort residents in Smarto with the chief of police, there were a slew of issues brought up, and one of them was a loading zone and the need for a loading zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1343.974s">And</a>  at that time, we said it may be advantageous to move that particular bus stop, which takes up at least five or six parking spots, over to the other corner, or maybe even a little further down, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1357.556s">So</a>  it would help not only the Oasis, but other businesses that are getting deliveries throughout the course of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1364.722s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not sure why this has taken so long, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1370.787s">But</a>  within the next couple of weeks, we should be able to have a sit-down with all the inter- and I agree with you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1377.713s">If</a>  the team needs to be at the table, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1379.535s">The</a>  business owners should be at the table, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1381.536s">The</a>  residents, everyone that needs to be at the table, because we have to iron this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1386.059s">There's</a>  no reason why the wheels of government have to turn this slow and wait for an accident to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1393.483s">So</a>  I'd move that motion for clarification on the ball, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1397.845s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1400.486s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1403.163s">This</a>  petition was before us last week looking for action on the bollards, actually a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1408.63s">And</a>  this council was pretty vocal getting the bollards done in a quick fashion from the meeting moving forward, not a quick leading up to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1420.783s">Obviously,</a>  we're all aware that somewhat created World War III down there, as you just alluded to, the businesses and the neighbors and there's a lot of friction right now and there's some animosity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1434.949s">being</a>  thrown at some certain members of this city council, too, which is unfair, because council has fought for what they believe was the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1441.714s">But</a>  I think once and for all, maybe we slow these modifications down, the loading zone and the bus stop, and get in a traffic engineer that actually we can pay, the city can pay, and they can look at it and find out what the safest, the most business-friendly solution <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1462.376s">is</a>  that certainly will help the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1465.458s">Because</a>  the chief of police, the DPW commissioner, Cassandra up in engineering, they're all very good professionals at what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1474.183s">But</a>  only a traffic engineer can come in and tell us that, hey, you're going to get the best impact, the safest cutout in the curb is in this spot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1484.969s">That</a>  the loading zone should actually be at this spot here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1489.251s">And</a>  if we spend $5,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1491.419s">for</a>  a consultant to come in here and give us an actual framework on what the best solution is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1498.641s">At</a>  that point, it's totally on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1501.102s">It's</a>  not the neighbors against the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1503.063s">It's</a>  not the businesses against the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1505.243s">It's</a>  the city taking the leadership role and taking the ball right out of your court, so to say, and doing what is needed in that immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1514.546s">Because</a>  I can tell you right now, there's already a lot of animosity about this current paper on here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1519.748s">And</a>  it hasn't even been heard yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1521.46s">until</a>  about five minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1524.923s">So</a>  with that being said, I think we should put the brakes on and ask the mayor to bring in a traffic engineer and come up with a solid plan that no one can be blamed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1536.391s">Because</a>  quite honestly, as I said last Wednesday, when those bollards went in, I spoke to several city councilors and the phones were ringing off the hook to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1546.243s">And</a>  quite honestly, I don't even think that's over yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1549.204s">There</a>  may be some legal action with those bollards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1553.425s">Businesses</a>  feel that the city shouldn't have come in and did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1557.786s">But</a>  that's a situation for our law department to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1561.627s">So</a>  with that being said, I just think the professionals need to come in and make these determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1567.808s">And</a>  quite honestly, if we're getting them in here, we should have them maybe in West Medford look too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1573.15s">Bargain</a>  spot lickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1575.285s">Right</a>  now, they're a little upset with the parking lot closing down in a few weeks, where they have no parking in front of their store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1585.767s">Maybe</a>  we look at some of these squares as a whole, including Medford Square, and have a traffic engineer tell us, tell the city representatives where these bus stops should be, and not moving them because someone picks up the phone and haphazardly calls us and asks us to move a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1601.63s">We</a>  can make an educated <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1603.193s">decision</a>  on it based upon fact and not hearsay and people's personal preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1610.159s">Because</a>  one thing I know about this, it's like permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1612.641s">You</a>  do this street, and they love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1614.943s">The</a>  next street now starts, it's the trickle-down effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1617.585s">And</a>  you do that, it's the same thing with bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1619.727s">You</a>  put it in front of one business, and then the bank gets upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1623.209s">And</a>  then you move it from the bank, and the next store gets upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1626.712s">So</a>  if we could look to hire a traffic engineer, I just think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1631.863s">It's</a>  the most professional way to proceed at this point.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1635.085s">So</a>  on the main motion of Councilor Penta, it's additionally amended by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1642.371s">Vice</a>  President Lango-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1645.133s">You</a>  did, yes, we have that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1647.314s">I</a>  should have summed it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1648.395s">It's</a>  been amended by Vice President Lango-Kern, yourself, Councilor Camuso twice, and I think Councilor Knight had an amendment on there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1658.523s">Madam</a>  Vice President, please.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1659.543s">Briefly,</a>  thank you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1661.924s">I</a>  agree with possibly getting a traffic engineer to maybe look at the traffic in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1667.266s">But</a>  with regards to the public safety of pedestrians, I don't think that can wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1672.169s">And</a>  I think this council's trying to also help the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1675.39s">So</a>  I'm not really sure who the businesses are upset with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1678.111s">But</a>  it really doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1680.072s">I</a>  mean, I personally know and see probably five different people that traverse Medford streets primarily by wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1690.915s">It's</a>  best if we have them on the sidewalk, and I think this is measures that need to be taken for the safety of pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1698.159s">So</a>  traffic study, I mean, could take months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1700.821s">I</a>  think we need some resolve now, and whether or not you do a traffic study, I think pedestrian safety needs to come first.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1707.604s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1710.486s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1712.86s">The</a>  two papers that are before us are to move a bus stop, and then the second one is to possibly the amendment was to add a loading zone, loading dock, loading zone area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1722.364s">That's</a>  not going to affect pedestrian traffic at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1725.106s">Those</a>  are both on the main street and not the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1728.827s">So</a>  I'm just not really hearing how it's going to affect the pedestrian traversing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1735.05s">I'm</a>  not sure where you've been the last half hour, but we've been discussing the sidewalk and trucks parking on the sidewalk on Harvard Street blocking <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1742.567s">the</a>  entire sidewalk for the last half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1745.129s">I</a>  think we've included that within our discussion, and it's the utmost important in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ysQghC7EzOg&t=1750.193s">Businesses</a>  come second.</p>
