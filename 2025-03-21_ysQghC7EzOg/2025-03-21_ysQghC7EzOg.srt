[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:01:08,392
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-716 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved for Metro City Council have Mayor notified the T and Department of Transportation regarding the problems and recent incidents regarding the gates at the West Medford train station that have been knocked down several times within four weeks.

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

23
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,209
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

24
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:20,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, being a resident, living in West Medford, I get to see those trains a little more than some of our other councilors here.

25
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Folks, can we quiet it down in the back of the room, please?

26
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:25,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Council, continue.

27
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,533
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

28
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

29
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:36,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Over the last few weeks, there's been several incidents at that train station where trucks have knocked those gates down a couple of times.

30
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:37,916
[SPEAKER_23]: A woman got hit by a car.

31
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,797
[SPEAKER_23]: about six weeks ago there.

32
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:59,550
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it's time that we have the DOT and the T come down and investigate that and maybe working some other kind of configuration, especially with those, since they put in those, that lane divider there, the trucks can't make that turn if they're coming off a place that road.

33
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:05,094
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you can send something, if the mayor can send something to the T and the DOT,

34
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:12,838
[SPEAKER_23]: to maybe do some kind of study or maybe work something out with those cones there.

35
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:14,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

36
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,200
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that motion of Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Camuso.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

38
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:22,943
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.

39
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:29,306
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, this is becoming a major problem in the West Medford area, not only for the business community, but also for the traffic.

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,853
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, these things over the last few weeks have been knocked down at the height of rush hour, whether it's five o'clock at night.

41
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:43,475
[SPEAKER_16]: It comes to a total gridlock every time the trains are coming by.

42
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,217
[SPEAKER_16]: They have to get the police cruisers out there, stop the traffic.

43
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,357
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just becoming a nightmare.

44
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,639
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's about time, given that it's a state road, Route 60.

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,383
[SPEAKER_16]: that the Department of Transportation has to get involved.

46
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,725
[SPEAKER_16]: There has to be a total look at that whole area.

47
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:08,232
[SPEAKER_16]: We still have those things down the middle of the road that divide the road that we had to put in in lieu of the horns being blown every time a train comes by.

48
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:15,417
[SPEAKER_16]: But at this point, I think we have to look at a major upgrade of the entire West Medford train station.

49
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:16,618
[SPEAKER_16]: You know something?

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,341
[SPEAKER_16]: In the coming few years, there's

51
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:26,327
[SPEAKER_16]: excuse me, in the coming few years, there's going to be possibility down in that area for business.

52
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:45,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we ever looked at putting the train platform on the other side of the train tracks so that it stops behind, say, the liquor store in that area, so that it doesn't have to keep the gates down for a long time, that it stops before the gates, and then it, when it's coming from Lowell, it would go by the gate and then stop

53
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:47,191
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not so sure.

54
00:03:47,211 --> 00:04:09,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if we have the room, but with all the projects going on here from the DOT and our community right now, whether it's Craddock Bridge, whether it's the Green Line, I think we have to take a serious look at the West Medford train station because it is becoming a nuisance, not only this particular matter, but just the amount of foot traffic in the area, which we encourage for environmentally.

55
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:13,892
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to have people take the train, but at the same token, we want to have it the safest possible.

56
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:18,007
[SPEAKER_16]: And the best aesthetically pleasing that we can do as well, too.

57
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:19,888
[SPEAKER_16]: So just food for thought.

58
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:24,250
[SPEAKER_16]: We are going to have to do a big cleanup of that parking lot at some point.

59
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,391
[SPEAKER_16]: And it may be the appropriate time to tie all this in together, maybe.

60
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:44,334
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's people in that immediate area that are looking to maybe sell their property, might be an opportunity for an economic development engine too, where you could actually reconfigure some of the area down there, build brand new storefronts.

61
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,255
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a million things you could do down there.

62
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:52,839
[SPEAKER_16]: It's over an acre of land if you take the, what is it, Stevens Auto Body?

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,241
[SPEAKER_16]: The West Medford parking lot and, like, that whole area, it's over an acre of land.

64
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,223
[SPEAKER_16]: So the development possibilities are endless.

65
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,343
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's something to look at.

66
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:05,525
[SPEAKER_16]: It also abuts the Medford Housing Authority, which is right there.

67
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,626
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's something long-term.

68
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:12,027
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to have a long-term vision in this community, and I think it's one area we could look at.

69
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:20,450
[SPEAKER_16]: But on the immediate concern that Councilor Caraviello brought up, I think it's something that has to be looked at sooner than later.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

71
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:24,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

72
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:26,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

73
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:30,024
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing up this important issue.

74
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:38,449
[SPEAKER_22]: This actually plays right into the presentation we just received from a group called Walk Method.

75
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:51,457
[SPEAKER_22]: And they just sent us a seven page brochure, I guess, on issues that were pointed out within our community and ways that

76
00:05:51,881 --> 00:06:00,206
[SPEAKER_22]: We as a community could be eligible for capital improvement investments of up to $12.5 million from MassDOT.

77
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:09,071
[SPEAKER_22]: And all we need to do is outline a detailed program on complete streets and be certified by MassDOT.

78
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:20,618
[SPEAKER_22]: And we could be eligible for the funding, which would improve many walkways in our community, many areas right now that are deemed unsafe or unfit for pedestrians.

79
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:25,767
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is a perfect segue into this walk method.

80
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:49,340
[SPEAKER_22]: And at some point, Mr. President, we should either have a Committee of the Whole meeting or maybe a public safety meeting to discuss some of the initiatives that were put forth in this particular presentation and see how we, as a council, can actively participate in putting forward a complete street program so we can become eligible for

81
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:58,322
[SPEAKER_22]: federal funding and state funding also for projects within our community to help with pedestrian safety.

82
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:00,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

83
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:01,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Councilor Marks.

84
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,864
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Caraviello as amended by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

85
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,264
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

86
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:08,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Carries.

87
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:08,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

88
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:12,086
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-717 offered by Councilor Penta.

89
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:17,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the bus stops in the Main Street and Harvard Street locations be discussed.

90
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:30,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Regarding these bus stop locations, Mr. President, there seems to be an ongoing concern as it relates to traffic into the business part of the community of Main Street into the South Medford area over there.

91
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:41,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And the bus stops have continuously kept coming up after speaking with some of the business merchants on maybe looking at them, maybe moving them or readjusting their locations and taking that into consideration.

92
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:43,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was almost a month ago,

93
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:52,176
[SPEAKER_07]: The council asked for the T to come down to the city council as it relates to Medford Square and the Kratik Bridge and the moving of the bridge.

94
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:53,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard anything yet?

95
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:55,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're still waiting.

96
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:59,578
[SPEAKER_14]: The clerk and I are going to be meeting on a couple of things we're still waiting on.

97
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:05,420
[SPEAKER_14]: We were good enough, the clerk arranged for us to have that meeting from the Eversource people.

98
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:06,683
[SPEAKER_14]: last week.

99
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:17,328
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that took some coordinating with their schedules and hours, but I think the clerk's still waiting to hear from DOT and the T on the issue that you mentioned.

100
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:28,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, relative to the bus stops, I'd like to include this in there because before this becomes a problem that's probably not needed, maybe just have a look and see as to where the bus stops might be.

101
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:33,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they can be rearranged, move around because there's a serious problem as it relates to the commercial part of

102
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,650
[SPEAKER_07]: trucks coming down there loading and unloading.

103
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, I just think it needs to be addressed.

104
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been discussed in the past, but I think it's gotten to the point right now it needs to be addressed.

105
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,158
[SPEAKER_07]: All those businesses down there, it's full occupancy.

106
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some concerns relative to the safety and to the locations for where trucks can make deposits and during the course of the day.

107
00:08:56,085 --> 00:09:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think, um, I don't know why it takes so long for the T to come here.

108
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:01,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you?

109
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: The bus drops are in the control of the council.

110
00:09:05,637 --> 00:09:23,258
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well, I think, uh, I have an opinion from, uh, uh, former city solicitor Riley saying that, uh, uh, that we cannot, uh, we do not have the authority to pass an ordinance empowering it to establish or relocate bus stops on our own volition.

111
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:35,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that has to be done in concert with the MBTA, as well as I think it would be prudent to involve the Traffic Commission in this decision-making process as well.

112
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Move the question, Mr. President.

113
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

114
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Was I?

115
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,151
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

116
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:46,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

117
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn was in queue first.

118
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:49,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

119
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:51,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

120
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:52,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

121
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

122
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I, too, just want to concur with the sentiments.

123
00:09:56,751 --> 00:10:06,918
[SPEAKER_12]: We were here two weeks ago to discuss the issue with regards to businesses, delivery trucks, parking on the sidewalks in the South Medford area.

124
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:11,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And the restaurants do need a place to be able to load and unload.

125
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:17,525
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do have an issue with the bus stops, and I think we definitely need to roundtable it with the MBTA and create

126
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:26,393
[SPEAKER_12]: make some changes to not only make it pedestrian safe, but also allow for businesses to have a loading zone.

127
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:33,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think moving that bus stop, we just need to figure out, in unison with all the businesses, the best place to move it to.

128
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's something we definitely need to take a good hard look at.

129
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:41,506
[SPEAKER_12]: We thank you to the DPW who installed Bullards where

130
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,736
[SPEAKER_12]: the traffic commission voted to place them a while back.

131
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But those were recently placed.

132
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:59,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And still, I got a photo from a resident who cares about the safety in the community and in this area.

133
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:02,268
[SPEAKER_12]: And trucks, as of today, are still parking on the sidewalk.

134
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:09,074
[SPEAKER_12]: It's almost worse at this point, because the bullets are making the trucks completely take over the sidewalk.

135
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:10,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're on Harvard Street,

136
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:16,947
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no pedestrian access on the sidewalk.

137
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:23,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, you know, we have senior citizens, we have strollers, we have the average person who, it's unsafe in this area.

138
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:32,470
[SPEAKER_12]: It's highly, it's a highly, highly trafficked area and we cannot have delivery trucks parked on our sidewalks for extended periods of time.

139
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,190
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unsafe for pedestrians.

140
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,751
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to figure out a way to accommodate pedestrian safety, number one, and number two,

141
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,854
[SPEAKER_12]: some loading zones for our businesses.

142
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope that we can call a meeting with the MBTA.

143
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:53,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, next, next week is the election, but hopefully the week after, hopefully somebody is available so that we can sit down and make that change.

144
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

145
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:58,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

146
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I think that this should be sent to the transportation subcommittee.

147
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, there's a couple of papers in there.

148
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Councilor Penton is the chair.

149
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:12,616
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one paper in there from October 2014, a year ago, to discuss bicycle safety issues.

150
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,297
[SPEAKER_16]: And that hasn't been called yet.

151
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:21,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we can put that, as well as the Craddock Bridge discussion that was supposed to take place in the Transportation Subcommittee from March.

152
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:31,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe if we have one meeting, if Councilor Pentos thinks there's a need for it, call a meeting as the chairperson and take all three of these matters up on the same evening.

153
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,748
[SPEAKER_16]: But there's been quite some time has surpassed.

154
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:42,091
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also a couple other ones on the committee of the whole regarding the bus stop down here.

155
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:45,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, do we want to move it all into the transportation subcommittee?

156
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:50,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if we can parliamentary, but.

157
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:53,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

158
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:53,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

159
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

160
00:12:55,739 --> 00:13:03,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's safe to say that there have been a variety of issues that have come up before this body relative to the MBTA or the Massachusetts Highway Department.

161
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks gave a great

162
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,804
[SPEAKER_11]: discussion and a great synopsis on the walk grant money that's available for us there, provided we get certified.

163
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:26,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important, Mr. President, if we're going to keep calling MassDOT down here to address certain issues in this community, that maybe we establish a comprehensive list so that we can do it all in one shot, as opposed to doing a resolution, sending it out there, telling DOT to come down here on this issue.

164
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,592
[SPEAKER_11]: They come down here on this issue.

165
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:28,773
[SPEAKER_11]: We resolve that issue.

166
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:29,813
[SPEAKER_11]: They go back to Boston.

167
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:31,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Two weeks later, something else comes up.

168
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We send another resolution and bring them in.

169
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,001
[SPEAKER_11]: and go on and on and on and on, Mr. President.

170
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:41,992
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it might make sense for us to have our transportation subcommittee take a look at the issues that are out there pending right now, Mr. President.

171
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:55,694
[SPEAKER_11]: and put a list together, maybe then we can meet in the Committee of the Whole, prioritize that list, and then have the representative from the DOT come down, which encompasses the MBTA, the Massachusetts Highway Department, the road management for the DCR, and we can move forward in that regard.

172
00:13:55,714 --> 00:14:00,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But at least it'll be a little bit more comprehensive as opposed to, you know, picking one fish out of the barrel at a time.

173
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:01,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

174
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:09,118
[SPEAKER_14]: So a motion of Councilor Pente as amended by Councilors Camuso, Knight, and Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

175
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:09,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes?

176
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Ma'am, welcome.

177
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

178
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Ann Marie Fretz, 215 Harvard Street, overlooking Yale Street.

179
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:26,757
[SPEAKER_18]: I was here two weeks ago to address the parking on South Redford Square.

180
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:38,922
[SPEAKER_18]: If you all took a look at this, this is prior to the two bollards that were installed at the crosswalk here, preventing cars from driving directly into the Oasis private property.

181
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:47,765
[SPEAKER_18]: What was approved by the Traffic Commission back on March 18th of 2015 were bollards around the corner.

182
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,988
[SPEAKER_18]: It specifically says on the corner.

183
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,872
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is what Chief Sacco and I had put up.

184
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:02,473
[SPEAKER_18]: last October on the same corner right here to prevent trucks from driving straight through and parking on the sidewalk and blocking the sidewalk.

185
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,914
[SPEAKER_18]: The bollards have been installed, two bollards right here.

186
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:10,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Cars cannot block through, but what they're doing is jumping the curb.

187
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:14,277
[SPEAKER_18]: This was this morning taken by my husband at 11 o'clock this morning.

188
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:21,077
[SPEAKER_18]: truck drove right up onto the sidewalk, just as they have been doing all along.

189
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:27,381
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's no question that the bollards were supposed to be put along Harvard Street to prevent trucks from going in.

190
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:36,548
[SPEAKER_18]: There's supposed to be a 10-foot gap to allow public parking, I'm sorry, public waste management services to get in and empty the dumpster.

191
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:40,151
[SPEAKER_18]: I spoke with them again today, and yes, that's all they need is a 10-foot gap.

192
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,133
[SPEAKER_18]: And please put a chain there so no one else goes through it.

193
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,332
[SPEAKER_18]: And what I would like to ask is that someone find out why the bollards were not installed.

194
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:56,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I was told by several of the DPW workers that there were intended to put in the bollards along Harvard Street.

195
00:15:56,057 --> 00:16:06,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't get an answer from anyone in any of the departments, whether it be DPW, the police department, and the chief is in Chicago at this point, but I'm sure he would be checking up on it as well.

196
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:12,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Mark Rolney doesn't know of any legal issue that the bollards would not be installed along Harvard Street.

197
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:16,693
[SPEAKER_18]: So the neighborhood expectations were that bollards would be put up to protect us.

198
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,954
[SPEAKER_18]: We have no place to walk that's safe.

199
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:26,816
[SPEAKER_18]: We cannot walk on either side of the street because trucks parking on that side drives cars to park on the other side of the street.

200
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:30,398
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, not the street, parked on the sidewalk.

201
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:39,760
[SPEAKER_18]: All the more reason to have a loading dock for Bocelli's, for Oasis, and for all of the other places that need their deliveries made.

202
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Licenses were granted.

203
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,852
[SPEAKER_18]: for these restaurants without loading zones.

204
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:57,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And when the street was paved in 2010, October 2010, by North Shore Construction and Development, they had asked for a cutout next to Oasis.

205
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:11,687
[SPEAKER_18]: At that time, there could have been negotiations to take over some of Oasis's private property to make it a sidewalk so they could have a loading zone cutout at that time, and it was refused by the community development saying the street would not allow it.

206
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:25,406
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I would ask is that the DPW, in lieu of putting up the bollards because of unknown reasons, A, find out what the reason is for the delay in the bollards along Harvard Street, and put these up to protect us.

207
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:27,367
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, along the lane.

208
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:31,771
[SPEAKER_18]: They could go all the way down to the driveway entry at 215 Harvard Street.

209
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,952
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how many trucks park on this street.

210
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,414
[SPEAKER_18]: They may be customers of Oasis.

211
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,955
[SPEAKER_18]: They may be delivery trucks.

212
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:41,498
[SPEAKER_18]: We cannot traverse these sidewalks because of these trucks.

213
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:42,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

214
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:43,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

215
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:46,034
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll do that as an amendment, Councilor Penta?

216
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

217
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,696
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as an amendment by Councilor Penta.

218
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:49,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

219
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

220
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Jim Silva, 115 Yale Street.

221
00:17:54,314 --> 00:18:01,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Going forward with this proposal of the bus stop move, I would suggest that we engage the community as well as the business community.

222
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,819
[SPEAKER_21]: We have ideas.

223
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:04,960
[SPEAKER_21]: We have proposals.

224
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,982
[SPEAKER_21]: We should have three or four different options for both groups that will satisfy.

225
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:16,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I think a lot of the issues that go through is stuff is brought down and nobody understands what's happening.

226
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:21,308
[SPEAKER_21]: So by all of us working together, we could really come to some sort of resolution.

227
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:22,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

228
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, sir.

229
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:26,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, welcome.

230
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

231
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

232
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:45,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to follow up and say I look forward to any subcommittee meetings and discussions with regard to finding some solution for the businesses on Main Street.

233
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:48,057
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not anti-business.

234
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:51,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted some safety measures instituted.

235
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're more than willing, I am more than willing to work with any of the business owners on Main Street.

236
00:18:57,432 --> 00:19:07,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have interpreted our efforts as being somehow trying to affect negatively their businesses.

237
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:08,717
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.

238
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Times have changed.

239
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Traffic has increased.

240
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Parking has increased.

241
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to make some good, solid changes that look forward.

242
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:25,442
[SPEAKER_01]: with regard to perhaps some ideas about parking on Main Street.

243
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:29,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we could do head-in parking where Arthur's Pastry is.

244
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:29,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

245
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can make some adjustments there.

246
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:39,648
[SPEAKER_01]: But the businesses definitely need a loading zone that is safe for them and for the pedestrians.

247
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:42,189
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have a sidewalk on Yale Street.

248
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,590
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a curb.

249
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that they need to make deliveries.

250
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:52,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there can be a small entrance into the alleyway.

251
00:19:53,256 --> 00:20:06,785
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem got so difficult and so, it was so exacerbated by so many cars and trucks, okay, and trucks parking there that it became very, very unsafe.

252
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just tempting fate to leave it that way.

253
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:14,670
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm more than willing to work with the guys and the gals on Main Street.

254
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:27,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish some of them had come here this evening, but hopefully they'll come to a subcommittee meeting and hopefully the MBTA will be there so that we can get some adjustment with the bus stop.

255
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:35,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see the bus stop just a few feet away from where it is now, perhaps in front of that dry cleaners.

256
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:43,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be sufficient and maybe even more safe than what is there now, right at the intersection of Harvard and Maine.

257
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:53,307
[SPEAKER_01]: We're willing, ready, and we just need the cooperation of the city and the business owners.

258
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:53,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

259
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:55,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

260
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Councilor Marx.

261
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:00,874
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

262
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:10,622
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I think the ironic thing about this whole issue is we're talking about a bus stop, we're talking about commercial vehicles parking on a sidewalk,

263
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:22,618
[SPEAKER_22]: And actually, the issue is that now we have a bus stop that's right next to the commercial vehicles parking on the sidewalk, which is an accident waiting to happen.

264
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:30,504
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would offer a motion, Mr. President, to get clarification from the Traffic Commission on the bollards.

265
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:36,388
[SPEAKER_22]: It was my understanding, too, the bollards would circle around the corner of Haven and Main.

266
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:39,390
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's, I thought, was the vote.

267
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:48,648
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can get clarification from the Traffic Commission on the balls going up Harvard, so that would prevent any type of trucks.

268
00:21:48,969 --> 00:22:02,477
[SPEAKER_22]: Clearly, that picture is shows an accident waiting to happen with a truck of that nature parked on a sidewalk where baby carriages and young kids and seniors are walking.

269
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:05,559
[SPEAKER_22]: It just doesn't make a good mix, Mr. President.

270
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,820
[SPEAKER_22]: And also,

271
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,091
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this topic has been discussed for a year now.

272
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:23,574
[SPEAKER_22]: When we traversed, along with the Salt and Effort residents in Smarto with the chief of police, there were a slew of issues brought up, and one of them was a loading zone and the need for a loading zone.

273
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:37,097
[SPEAKER_22]: And at that time, we said it may be advantageous to move that particular bus stop, which takes up at least five or six parking spots, over to the other corner, or maybe even a little further down,

274
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:44,242
[SPEAKER_22]: So it would help not only the Oasis, but other businesses that are getting deliveries throughout the course of the day.

275
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:50,747
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I'm not sure why this has taken so long, to be honest with you.

276
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:57,073
[SPEAKER_22]: But within the next couple of weeks, we should be able to have a sit-down with all the inter- and I agree with you, Mr. President.

277
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,294
[SPEAKER_22]: If the team needs to be at the table, fine.

278
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:01,276
[SPEAKER_22]: The business owners should be at the table, fine.

279
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:05,560
[SPEAKER_22]: The residents, everyone that needs to be at the table, because we have to iron this out.

280
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:13,443
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason why the wheels of government have to turn this slow and wait for an accident to happen.

281
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:17,825
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd move that motion for clarification on the ball, Mr. President.

282
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:20,226
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended by Councilor Marks, Councilor Camuso.

283
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

284
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:28,069
[SPEAKER_16]: This petition was before us last week looking for action on the bollards, actually a couple of weeks ago.

285
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:39,864
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council was pretty vocal getting the bollards done in a quick fashion from the meeting moving forward, not a quick leading up to the meeting.

286
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:53,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, we're all aware that somewhat created World War III down there, as you just alluded to, the businesses and the neighbors and there's a lot of friction right now and there's some animosity.

287
00:23:54,949 --> 00:24:01,154
[SPEAKER_16]: being thrown at some certain members of this city council, too, which is unfair, because council has fought for what they believe was the right thing to do.

288
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:21,769
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think once and for all, maybe we slow these modifications down, the loading zone and the bus stop, and get in a traffic engineer that actually we can pay, the city can pay, and they can look at it and find out what the safest, the most business-friendly solution

289
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:25,018
[SPEAKER_16]: is that certainly will help the neighborhood.

290
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:33,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the chief of police, the DPW commissioner, Cassandra up in engineering, they're all very good professionals at what they do.

291
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:43,548
[SPEAKER_16]: But only a traffic engineer can come in and tell us that, hey, you're going to get the best impact, the safest cutout in the curb is in this spot here.

292
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,970
[SPEAKER_16]: That the loading zone should actually be at this spot here.

293
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:50,091
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we spend $5,000,

294
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:57,981
[SPEAKER_16]: for a consultant to come in here and give us an actual framework on what the best solution is.

295
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,722
[SPEAKER_16]: At that point, it's totally on the city.

296
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:02,742
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the neighbors against the businesses.

297
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:04,743
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the businesses against the neighbors.

298
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:14,326
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the city taking the leadership role and taking the ball right out of your court, so to say, and doing what is needed in that immediate area.

299
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:19,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I can tell you right now, there's already a lot of animosity about this current paper on here this evening.

300
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:20,948
[SPEAKER_16]: And it hasn't even been heard yet.

301
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,022
[SPEAKER_16]: until about five minutes ago.

302
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:36,371
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that being said, I think we should put the brakes on and ask the mayor to bring in a traffic engineer and come up with a solid plan that no one can be blamed for.

303
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:45,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Because quite honestly, as I said last Wednesday, when those bollards went in, I spoke to several city councilors and the phones were ringing off the hook to all of us.

304
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:49,164
[SPEAKER_16]: And quite honestly, I don't even think that's over yet.

305
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:52,705
[SPEAKER_16]: There may be some legal action with those bollards.

306
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:57,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Businesses feel that the city shouldn't have come in and did that.

307
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:01,087
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's a situation for our law department to deal with.

308
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:07,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that being said, I just think the professionals need to come in and make these determinations.

309
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:12,530
[SPEAKER_16]: And quite honestly, if we're getting them in here, we should have them maybe in West Medford look too.

310
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Bargain spot lickers.

311
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:24,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, they're a little upset with the parking lot closing down in a few weeks, where they have no parking in front of their store.

312
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:41,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we look at some of these squares as a whole, including Medford Square, and have a traffic engineer tell us, tell the city representatives where these bus stops should be, and not moving them because someone picks up the phone and haphazardly calls us and asks us to move a bus stop.

313
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,570
[SPEAKER_16]: We can make an educated

314
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:49,718
[SPEAKER_16]: decision on it based upon fact and not hearsay and people's personal preferences.

315
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Because one thing I know about this, it's like permit parking.

316
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,462
[SPEAKER_16]: You do this street, and they love it.

317
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:57,285
[SPEAKER_16]: The next street now starts, it's the trickle-down effect.

318
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,286
[SPEAKER_16]: And you do that, it's the same thing with bus stops.

319
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:03,129
[SPEAKER_16]: You put it in front of one business, and then the bank gets upset.

320
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,192
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you move it from the bank, and the next store gets upset.

321
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,916
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could look to hire a traffic engineer, I just think it's

322
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,705
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the most professional way to proceed at this point.

323
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:20,850
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the main motion of Councilor Penta, it's additionally amended by Councilor Camuso.

324
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Lango-Kern.

325
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,914
[SPEAKER_14]: You did, yes, we have that amendment.

326
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,215
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have summed it up.

327
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:37,122
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been amended by Vice President Lango-Kern, yourself, Councilor Camuso twice, and I think Councilor Knight had an amendment on there as well.

328
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Vice President, please.

329
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Briefly, thank you, President Dello Russo.

330
00:27:41,924 --> 00:27:47,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with possibly getting a traffic engineer to maybe look at the traffic in the area.

331
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:51,889
[SPEAKER_12]: But with regards to the public safety of pedestrians, I don't think that can wait.

332
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:55,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this council's trying to also help the businesses.

333
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,971
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not really sure who the businesses are upset with.

334
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,052
[SPEAKER_12]: But it really doesn't matter.

335
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:08,636
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I personally know and see probably five different people that traverse Medford streets primarily by wheelchair.

336
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:18,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's best if we have them on the sidewalk, and I think this is measures that need to be taken for the safety of pedestrians.

337
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,641
[SPEAKER_12]: So traffic study, I mean, could take months.

338
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:27,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we need some resolve now, and whether or not you do a traffic study, I think pedestrian safety needs to come first.

339
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. President?

340
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:31,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

341
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:41,604
[SPEAKER_16]: The two papers that are before us are to move a bus stop, and then the second one is to possibly the amendment was to add a loading zone, loading dock, loading zone area.

342
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,066
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not going to affect pedestrian traffic at all.

343
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are both on the main street and not the sidewalk.

344
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:53,269
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just not really hearing how it's going to affect the pedestrian traversing.

345
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:02,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure where you've been the last half hour, but we've been discussing the sidewalk and trucks parking on the sidewalk on Harvard Street blocking

346
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,109
[SPEAKER_12]: the entire sidewalk for the last half hour.

347
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:10,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've included that within our discussion, and it's the utmost important in my mind.

348
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Businesses come second.

349
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:26,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, with all due respect to the Councilor, the trucks are blocking a street and a sidewalk that are not even on the bus route, and they were asking for a loading zone to be placed on Main Street and not Harvard Street, because there isn't the room on Harvard Street.

350
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:28,306
[SPEAKER_16]: You couldn't get two trucks by if one truck was parked.

351
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:29,727
[SPEAKER_16]: And with the bollards now,

352
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:34,030
[SPEAKER_16]: They can't do that if you put one more, like you said, down at what, 259?

353
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:37,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you say 259 Harvard Street?

354
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:38,473
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd like to see the bollards go down to?

355
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:39,514
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

356
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:41,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Which was the address you said on Harvard?

357
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:41,115
215.

358
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,077
[SPEAKER_16]: 215, OK.

359
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:43,837
[SPEAKER_16]: So 215.

360
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:54,425
[SPEAKER_16]: So as I stated, the pedestrians traversing these bus stops moving in a quick fashion in the loading zone does not affect the pedestrians.

361
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Dealing with the problem at hand on Harvard Street

362
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:02,327
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll do that, but I think we're making some progress with the bollards, but they have to be extended.

363
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

364
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilors and Councilor Knight.

365
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:12,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yes, Mr. President, looking at the minutes from the, uh, October 13th meeting, uh, we did pass a resolution.

366
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,516
[SPEAKER_11]: The resolution had a number of parts.

367
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:25,444
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we look at part E amended by Councilor Camuso, that the chief of police look into doing community policing in the area a couple of days a week for the next two months to prepare a list of concerns and then draft a plan to resolve them.

368
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that still makes sense.

369
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:30,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's a good course of action and a strong way for us to move forward.

370
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:34,155
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can get the chief of police down there, because it seems like this is an enforcement issue more than anything else.

371
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:35,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an enforcement issue.

372
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

373
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,858
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we wouldn't need bollards if they wouldn't park on the sidewalk.

374
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:43,940
[SPEAKER_11]: They won't park on the sidewalk if they get tickets, but they're not getting tickets, so they're parking on the sidewalk.

375
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's an enforcement issue, Mr. President.

376
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,983
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it makes sense that we reinforce our position from October 13th.

377
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:51,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, councillor.

378
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:54,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

379
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

380
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:58,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

381
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:00,067
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm all about public safety.

382
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a safe place to walk.

383
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,129
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have one in my neighborhood.

384
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:05,390
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not being sarcastic in any way.

385
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:11,114
[SPEAKER_18]: I took the chief and Councilman Caraviello on a walk October 7th, 2014.

386
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:19,219
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked at the trucks pulling into the private property that is owned by Oasis Restaurant, driving over the sidewalk.

387
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,301
[SPEAKER_18]: We looked at their dumpster on the sidewalk.

388
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:24,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I have sent all of you every picture I have taken

389
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:28,293
[SPEAKER_18]: of a car or truck blocking the sidewalk.

390
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:35,656
[SPEAKER_18]: I've called the police to the point where the police don't want to hear from me anymore about cars being parked on the sidewalk.

391
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:41,139
[SPEAKER_18]: They do not have the manpower to go out and deal with a minor traffic issue.

392
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:47,521
[SPEAKER_18]: They're aware of it, they're paying attention to it, but they're called away because there are two cars in each district.

393
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:49,162
[SPEAKER_18]: In our sector, there's two.

394
00:31:49,575 --> 00:32:02,686
[SPEAKER_18]: They do not have time, in particular at the time of day when the school buses are going through and kids are exiting onto the sidewalk while the trucks are trying to deliver because cars and trucks deliver to Oasis all day long.

395
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:04,368
[SPEAKER_18]: They start at four o'clock in the morning.

396
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,071
[SPEAKER_18]: We know this because we can hear them and all of our neighbors can hear them.

397
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:09,893
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a safety issue.

398
00:32:09,993 --> 00:32:14,757
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand why we're putting roadblocks up again when we've already spent since

399
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:24,738
[SPEAKER_18]: I think December of 2012, we met with Oasis and many of the neighbors and several of the councilmen to discuss parking.

400
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:30,461
[SPEAKER_18]: That was primarily on Yale Street, and we addressed the driving on the sidewalk and the deliveries on the sidewalk.

401
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:40,087
[SPEAKER_18]: You all read the letter that I sent to Morgan Memorial and to M&M Transport about their truck parking on the sidewalk and totally blocking the sidewalk.

402
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:42,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Unattended with engine running.

403
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what we face every single day and it's not just on Monday through Friday.

404
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:49,587
[SPEAKER_18]: It's every day of the week.

405
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,348
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been calling the police.

406
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:53,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked to the chief.

407
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:55,529
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief has examined the area.

408
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:57,230
[SPEAKER_18]: He knows the issues well.

409
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:03,906
[SPEAKER_18]: to have him or Rich Carroll, Sergeant Carroll, or anyone else patrol the area to look for problems.

410
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:05,688
[SPEAKER_18]: They're aware of the problems.

411
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:15,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Alva Erickson has an eight-inch book, a listing of the problems and the incidents, because we wanted this documented because no one's doing anything about it.

412
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:24,241
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't even get orange barrels put down to protect us on Harvard Street because it has to be ordered by the Traffic Commission, who then tells the DPW,

413
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,841
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's approved by the police department.

414
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:30,644
[SPEAKER_18]: The police cannot go out and put traffic barrels out there to protect us.

415
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,726
[SPEAKER_18]: We cannot walk down there.

416
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:35,648
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to drive if we want to get to Arthur's Bakery.

417
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,371
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to drive if we want to get to La Casha, if we want to get there safely.

418
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:43,975
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand why you want to delay any further from doing anything.

419
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:45,756
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of you have seen it.

420
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I've sent you all the emails.

421
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:48,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I've sent you all the pictures.

422
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:50,312
[SPEAKER_18]: It's real time.

423
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:51,833
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what we're living with.

424
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:53,874
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm begging you to do something.

425
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:54,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

426
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:55,374
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

427
00:33:58,396 --> 00:34:00,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Jim Silva, 115 Yale Street.

428
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:04,158
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as the bus stop and its current configuration, it's totally illegal.

429
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:05,979
[SPEAKER_21]: The bus can't pull to the curb.

430
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:12,881
[SPEAKER_21]: And from my understanding, the MBTA is not supposed to drop people or receive passengers in that sort of configuration.

431
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:16,869
[SPEAKER_21]: people are, it's a very dangerous situation.

432
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,185
[SPEAKER_21]: People have to go out to the street, they can slip and fall, jump over a river of water.

433
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:27,289
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition, if it's an older RTS bus, the lift is on the back door.

434
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:30,230
[SPEAKER_21]: The bus itself sits in the middle of Harvard Street.

435
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:35,712
[SPEAKER_21]: So as far as moving the bus stop is concerned, it should have been something that should have been looked at years ago.

436
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:39,874
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand you want a transportation person to come down, but it's a no-brainer.

437
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:42,075
[SPEAKER_21]: It really is common sense to move the bus stop.

438
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:46,316
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition, this is the sixth busiest stop on the 101 route.

439
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:50,358
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as the businesses that would impact move the stop,

440
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:57,116
[SPEAKER_21]: There's potential for 100 plus additional customers for the dry cleaner, for instance, that are getting on and off that bus.

441
00:34:57,797 --> 00:34:59,718
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think it should be looked at.

442
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:01,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

443
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

444
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:04,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor?

445
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:07,481
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Caraviello.

446
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:08,322
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

447
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:18,307
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we, um, we hired a parking company to enforce parking, but, uh, we, we, we hired an understaffed parking company, uh, because,

448
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,941
[SPEAKER_23]: You obviously can't patrol the whole city with two people.

449
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:32,829
[SPEAKER_23]: And maybe if they had a little more presence down there, we maybe wouldn't be talking about this as much.

450
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,774
[SPEAKER_23]: Two guys in two trucks can't do the whole thing.

451
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,976
[SPEAKER_23]: I would think the republic need to be brought into this.

452
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:46,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, as much as we don't like them, they're part of the problem there also, Mr. President.

453
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:47,862
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think Mr. Silva's right.

454
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:54,127
[SPEAKER_23]: with the bus stop, all the other bus stops were able to pull right up to the curb.

455
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:59,890
[SPEAKER_23]: To do that in that area, you'd probably have to lose half of those angle parking spots too.

456
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,731
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's something we're going to have to look into.

457
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:04,632
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor.

458
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:05,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

459
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:07,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. President.

460
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:12,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to point out that the issue before us is the placement of the bus stops, not the ballings or anything else.

461
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,378
[SPEAKER_11]: On October 13th, we sat down, we met as a council, we passed a resolution.

462
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,218
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a multiple part resolution.

463
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:22,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of that resolution was for our transportation subcommittee to meet to discuss the issues related to the ball.

464
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,560
[SPEAKER_11]: It's down there.

465
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,940
[SPEAKER_11]: That subcommittee meeting is yet to be scheduled, Mr. President.

466
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,182
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, until that subcommittee meeting happens, I don't know how much of a productive conversation we're going to have other than the fact that we're just going to be rehashing all of the items that we discussed two weeks ago.

467
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:38,303
[SPEAKER_11]: As we already have, you know, so with that being said, Mr. President, um, I move for approval on the paper.

468
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:39,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

469
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:43,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Council a motion of council, uh, night to move the paper.

470
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:45,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am.

471
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:52,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to, uh, to Councilor Camuso, through you, Mr. President, Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

472
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:56,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I, it's interesting.

473
00:36:56,665 --> 00:37:05,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we hit a hornet's nest when that curb went up and the bollards went up, but you noted that you got loads of phone calls and as did the other councilors.

474
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:14,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they could pick up the phone to call you and complain why they didn't pick up the phone and find out

475
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,312
[SPEAKER_01]: when the meetings were or when we could have a meeting and get together and discuss this.

476
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:24,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, we went through the proper channels.

477
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:27,895
[SPEAKER_01]: We came before the city council, and there was a council resolve.

478
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:37,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was 7-0 to take this action of restoring the curb and putting some sort of barrier up on Harvard Street.

479
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,560
[SPEAKER_01]: We then went to the traffic commission.

480
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,381
[SPEAKER_01]: We presented our case at that time, and at that time,

481
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:51,041
[SPEAKER_01]: The owners of Oasis and I believe the ex-owner of Maze Cafe were in attendance.

482
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:52,462
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their case.

483
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:53,923
[SPEAKER_01]: We made ours.

484
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chief and the traffic commission ruled on the issue.

485
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:05,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was to go forward from that time on in terms of they chose to restore the curb and put the bollards up.

486
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:07,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no surprise with this.

487
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been a little bit tense there.

488
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been blame assigned and a lot

489
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,767
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of nasty attitude.

490
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:30,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other piece of this is that we've always been willing to work with the businesses to do something about where they can load and unload their vendors and to find some place for their delivery vehicles.

491
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:43,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to clarify and say, you know, it hasn't been a surprise and I think they should pull back on blaming people and blaming the residents and, you know, sort of it's gotten nasty and it shouldn't be.

492
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't have been a surprise to them.

493
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did have the opportunity to speak.

494
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:50,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I wanted to say.

495
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:50,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

496
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:53,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

497
00:38:54,597 --> 00:39:03,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And this evening, as I suggested, we send this to the Subcommittee on Transportation because the paper before us by Councilor Penta is to move the bus stop.

498
00:39:04,204 --> 00:39:12,151
[SPEAKER_16]: And for us to do anything without, as you stated and as Mr. Silva stated, you want to work together, everyone should be at that table.

499
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:13,747
[SPEAKER_16]: as the last process.

500
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:28,191
[SPEAKER_16]: So the appropriate subcommittee is the transportation subcommittee where these things can be hashed out collectively and as well take up some of the stuff that's been left over hanging in there from 2014 and early 15 that has not been addressed yet.

501
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:32,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we can have like a marathon meeting and get some of it cleared up.

502
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,874
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not my committee.

503
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:38,814
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not my committee.

504
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:41,875
[SPEAKER_14]: All my papers have been cleared up.

505
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:44,422
[SPEAKER_14]: And we welcome you, citizen, to speak.

506
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:48,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

507
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:49,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

508
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:52,969
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Rachel Tannenhaus.

509
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:58,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I can spell it for who has ever taken notes, because it's one of those, aren't you sorry you cut last names?

510
00:39:59,914 --> 00:40:00,395
[SPEAKER_17]: You live at?

511
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,435
[SPEAKER_17]: 26 Pearl Street.

512
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:02,076
[SPEAKER_17]: 26 Pearl Street.

513
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:02,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

514
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:05,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

515
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:07,038
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, sir.

516
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I am a pedestrian.

517
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,523
[SPEAKER_17]: I am also a bus user, and I am blind.

518
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:22,651
[SPEAKER_17]: It is extremely unsafe for me if the bus stop is set up such that the bus has to let me off in the middle of the street.

519
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:27,235
[SPEAKER_17]: My dog does his best, but he can't really take on a whole car.

520
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:32,415
[SPEAKER_17]: We do not disappear when we get off the bus.

521
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,976
[SPEAKER_17]: We magically become pedestrians.

522
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,720
[SPEAKER_17]: So when there is a bus stop issue, there is absolutely a pedestrian issue.

523
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:45,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other thing is that if I cannot go safely to a place, I'm not going to patronize the businesses there.

524
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:54,073
[SPEAKER_17]: This is absolutely a business issue in that if people can't walk safely to, I mean, obviously I'm not driving there.

525
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Even in Massachusetts, they don't give me a license.

526
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:05,889
[SPEAKER_17]: If people cannot walk to a business, particularly people with disabilities, if we can't get safely to that business, it's not getting our money.

527
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's all there is to it.

528
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:16,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And I heard talk earlier about looking at complete streets policies for the city.

529
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,437
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm familiar with complete streets policies.

530
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:20,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm extremely in favor of them.

531
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:22,200
[SPEAKER_17]: But they don't magically start when you get a grant.

532
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:27,537
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got to walk the walk, as it were.

533
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:36,725
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this is, if you want complete streets, and you want to be able to put into a grant that you are committed to this, make it happen.

534
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:39,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't just wait for the grant to show up.

535
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,489
[SPEAKER_17]: This is part of complete streets.

536
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,771
[SPEAKER_17]: This is part of this policy y'all are excited about.

537
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:45,032
[SPEAKER_17]: So get excited about it.

538
00:41:46,623 --> 00:41:55,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it is—it's one thing to talk about it and to say you're into it, but this has been sitting around, so make it happen.

539
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that it's best for the business, really.

540
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:02,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm not a business owner, but I bet they like it when people come in and give them money.

541
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:08,757
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's absolutely safest for the citizens.

542
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:14,861
[SPEAKER_17]: And you might want to—I am not an attorney, but I have 15 years providing—

543
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:34,812
[SPEAKER_17]: professional assistance on the Americans with Disabilities Act, and you might want to talk to council for the city about what your ADA liability is if you don't take care of that, and also what the business's ADA liability is if their accessible routes are being blocked on a regular basis, and they're not doing anything to change that.

544
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:41,036
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you'll find that the Department of Justice doesn't look really kindly on that, and neither does case law.

545
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:51,091
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not saying that to threaten, I'm saying that it's really best for everybody that this be addressed quickly before somebody gets killed and before they lose money over it.

546
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:53,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Rachel.

547
00:42:53,772 --> 00:43:02,076
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta, as amended by Councilors Penta, uh, Vice President Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso, and Councilor Martins.

548
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:03,576
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

549
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,538
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

550
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:07,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

551
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:09,659
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-718 offered by Councilor Penta.

552
00:43:10,113 --> 00:43:15,194
[SPEAKER_14]: be resolved that the rodent problem resulting from the Craddock Bridge reconstruction be addressed.

553
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:16,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

554
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:26,576
[SPEAKER_07]: During this past week, Mr. President, I was contacted by some of the tenants that live on work, excuse me, on the commercial pieces of property on Riverside Avenue.

555
00:43:26,716 --> 00:43:37,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result of the Craddock Bridge being reconstructed at the present time, there's been an ongoing weekly rodent problem that's continuing to exist, which is costing

556
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:45,033
[SPEAKER_07]: a considerable amount of money, not only to the owners of the property, but it's going to eventually come down to the renters because they are the ones that are feeling it.

557
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'd like to get a report back from the, um, board of public health on that.

558
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:56,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, this was one of the things that we brought up as to why something called mitigation couldn't have been taken into consideration.

559
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Having the forethought to recognize that a situation like this could happen.

560
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:06,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think it's unfortunate that it is happening, but it has an effect on not only the business owners, but the renters.

561
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:11,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And their custom is, it's a daily cost, it's a weekly cost, and it's an ongoing cost.

562
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:15,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that they should be the ones that should have to pay for it.

563
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So I move that forward, Mr. President.

564
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:32,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I also move that to the city solicitor's office to have them investigate and figure out if there's a way that the city, in behalf of the property owners, can retrieve financial remuneration for what they're going through as a result of this bridge.

565
00:44:32,912 --> 00:44:34,932
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

566
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:35,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

567
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:35,973
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

568
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:38,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

569
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:40,473
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-719, offered by Councilor Penter.

570
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:56,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that Teresa Castagnetti, a teacher within our Medford Public Schools, be congratulated for being chosen as the Massachusetts Teacher of the Year by the Massachusetts Association of Teachers of Speakers of Other Languages.

571
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:56,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penter.

572
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:14,647
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting about this resolve is the fact that the young lady, not only having been a well-recognized teacher within our Medford public school system, and she also has this ability to deal with students that need to speak from other languages as it relates to interacting with English.

573
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:23,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the unique opportunity this past week to address a special class up at the high school as it relates to government as we speak.

574
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:35,467
[SPEAKER_07]: but the recognition of other teachers within the building and what they can do and how they're being recognized seems to be something that's not ongoing on a daily basis, or strike at, or on any kind of a basis.

575
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:41,911
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a huge, there is a huge inventory of teacher talent that exists in our method public school systems.

576
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And this young lady, Teresa Castagnetti, is one of them.

577
00:45:46,334 --> 00:45:53,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like an unrecognized hero, because on a daily basis, she has to deal with a bunch of students, once again, speakers of other languages,

578
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:58,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And to some teachers or to some students, that can be a hard interaction.

579
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But she seems to work it well.

580
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,042
[SPEAKER_07]: She's recognized for it as the Teacher of the Year from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

581
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:07,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think she deserves a public acknowledgement for that.

582
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:15,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And also at the same time, on many occasions, her husband, sitting out in the audience, speaks as it relates to that.

583
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:21,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's blessed to have a wife who has this type of ability and to be recognized for receiving this award.

584
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:33,603
[SPEAKER_07]: So I move the question, and hopefully, again, it sets a nice tempo for teachers within the school system to know that they can and they are being recognized for the work that they do.

585
00:46:34,164 --> 00:46:38,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Councilor, and congratulations, Professor.

586
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:43,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

587
00:46:44,027 --> 00:46:44,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

588
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:49,168
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Penta, for putting this on this evening.

589
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:50,729
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know Ms.

590
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:51,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Castagnetti.

591
00:46:52,191 --> 00:47:17,990
[SPEAKER_16]: just a wonderful person a great teacher in our community and of course her husband who's not only a biggest biggest fan of all the city councillors, but also a friend of my aunt Carol, so just want to want to congratulate you and your lovely wife for this honor and thank you for councillor Penta for Bringing it up this evening giving her the recognition that she deserves Thank You Councilor Councilor Marks

592
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:23,397
[SPEAKER_22]: I too just want to echo that, Mr. President, and I thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up.

593
00:47:24,037 --> 00:47:29,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Teresa has been with the school department for a number of years and has been a dedicated professional.

594
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:36,604
[SPEAKER_22]: And on behalf of this council and the entire community, I want to congratulate her on being chosen for this prestigious award.

595
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:37,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

596
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:39,886
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

597
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:41,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Opposed?

[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

599
00:47:42,508 --> 00:47:44,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

600
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:46,450
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-720 offered by President Dello Russo.

601
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:54,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the council cancel the November 3rd, 2015 meeting due to the municipal election held that day.

602
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:58,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a note, that's a customary practice from time immemorial.

603
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:01,252
[SPEAKER_14]: On motion of myself, all those in favor?

604
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:02,812

[SPEAKER_14]: 15-722 offered by Councilor Knight.

00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:16,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council support HB 3811, an act regulating oxycontin

608
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,404
[SPEAKER_14]: prescriptions to minors.

609
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:19,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

610
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

611
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:24,486
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully you'll bear with me for a moment here.

612
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:29,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to speak with Representative DiZaglio from Methuen.

613
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:33,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And she represents the 14th Essex district, Mr. President.

614
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:40,453
[SPEAKER_11]: She's the lead sponsor of House Bill 3811, an act to regulate oxycontin prescriptions to minors.

615
00:48:40,593 --> 00:48:44,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And she has prepared a written statement because she was unable to appear this evening, Mr. President.

616
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to read that into the record on her behalf.

617
00:48:47,977 --> 00:48:49,518
[SPEAKER_11]: coming from Representative DiZaglio.

618
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:57,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I write to express my deepest gratitude to the members of the Medford City Council for your resolution and strong show of support in favor of my sponsored resolution, hopefully.

619
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:02,087
[SPEAKER_11]: House Bill 3811, an act regulating OxyContin prescriptions for minors.

620
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:14,015
[SPEAKER_11]: This past August, the Food and Drug Administration approved the prescribing of OxyContin, the extended release version of the painkiller Oxycodone, known in recent years for its frequent abuse for children as young as 11 years old.

621
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:21,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Under this legislation, OxyContin would be prohibited for prescription to children under the age of 17 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

622
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:33,318
[SPEAKER_11]: OxyContin is manufactured by Purdue Pharma, a drug company which came under fire in 2007 after three of its top executives pled guilty to misleading doctors and the public about OxyContin's risks of addiction.

623
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:41,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Recently, the FDA decided to ask the same company to conduct its own studies on whether or not they deemed this highly addictive substance safe for young children.

624
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,291
[SPEAKER_11]: When I heard about this, I was outraged.

625
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:48,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We are, after all, in the middle of an epidemic related to opioids.

626
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:53,455
[SPEAKER_11]: It is no time to expand access to opioids, least of all to young, vulnerable children.

627
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:57,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I was immensely pleased when, on September 9th, a bipartisan group of eight U.S.

628
00:49:57,857 --> 00:50:05,980
[SPEAKER_11]: senators, including Senator Edward Markey, Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire, and Senator Gene Shaheen from New Hampshire, penned a letter to the U.S.

629
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee calling for an investigation into the FDA's decision to approve OxyContin

630
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:16,249
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as an examination of the rise in opiate abuse and overdose deaths.

631
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:24,111
[SPEAKER_11]: The letter noted the FDA decision was made without the advice of an independent advisory committee, which was approved by the FDA regulations on approving drugs.

632
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:31,913
[SPEAKER_11]: In a study conducted in 2014, the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that nearly one in 30 high school seniors had abused OxyContin.

633
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:41,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Each day, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2,500 youth in the United States abuse a prescription pain reliever for the first time.

634
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:47,425
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of opioids prescribed to adolescents and young adults has nearly doubled between 1994 and 2007.

635
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:54,809
[SPEAKER_11]: We in the Commonwealth have a duty to our children to regulate the distribution of an opioid like OxyContin to these vulnerable citizens.

636
00:50:55,269 --> 00:51:01,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank the members of the Medford City Council for their support of this legislation and commitment to forcefully addressing the Commonwealth's opioid crisis.

637
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:06,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I bring this resolution forward because the statistics are alarming.

638
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:21,474
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do a little bit of research and you take a look into opioid abuse here in Massachusetts, you'll find that the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services conducted a survey in 2012 relative to the adolescent admissions into treatment programs.

639
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:27,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And this focused on the abuse rate among youths averaged age 12 to 17 years old.

640
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,220
[SPEAKER_11]: In Massachusetts during FY12,

641
00:51:30,568 --> 00:51:38,670
[SPEAKER_11]: There were 2,254 admissions to substance abuse treatment services for children that were under 18 years of age, Mr. President.

642
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,191
[SPEAKER_11]: 48% of those seeking treatment were related to opiate abuse, Mr. President.

643
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:49,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's very important that the Medford City Council get on board and support this legislation.

644
00:51:50,713 --> 00:51:53,614
[SPEAKER_11]: The city messenger was kind enough to pass around a packet that I had.

645
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:59,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And inside this packet, Mr. President, you'll find a copy of Representative DiZaglio's statement.

646
00:52:00,296 --> 00:52:03,897
[SPEAKER_11]: an article from the Lawrence eagle tribune that outlines a little bit of the history of the bill as well.

647
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:08,279
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll also find in this packet, Mr. President, a legislative history of the bill.

648
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:12,541
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a hearing on the bill in the committee on mental health and substance abuse.

649
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:16,282
[SPEAKER_11]: This hearing was on the 22nd of this month.

650
00:52:16,862 --> 00:52:21,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And from what I understand, Mr. President, it's going to be reported out of this committee favorably.

651
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:26,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Also you will find house bill number 3811 attached to this packet as well, Mr. President.

652
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:29,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So I asked my colleagues here in the Medford city council

653
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:36,058
[SPEAKER_11]: to continue their proactive efforts in combating opiate abuse here measured by joining me in voting in the affirmative to support House Bill 3811.

654
00:52:36,098 --> 00:52:36,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

655
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,619
[SPEAKER_23]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Caraviello.

656
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:42,480
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

657
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,040
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up.

658
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,601
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think there's anybody in this room that hasn't had someone touched by this.

659
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:56,762
[SPEAKER_23]: And I would hope that our legislators will take this and pass it swiftly.

660
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:59,263
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up.

661
00:53:00,755 --> 00:53:01,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

662
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,175
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Patu.

663
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:16,058
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that the bill addresses, it goes back to 2007, where it takes in particular an age group between the ages of 15 and 19, which basically represented 4.3%.

664
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:24,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm assuming, I would have to assume that since 2007 coming forward, as we all know, that has greatly increased.

665
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,240
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing that's disturbing, I think, in this press release is the fact where it states in the study conducted in 2014,

666
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:36,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The National Institute of Drug Abuse found that nearly 1 in 30 high school seniors had abused oxycodone.

667
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:42,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when you say 1 in 30 high school students, I mean, just look at Medford High in and of itself.

668
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:48,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I can't believe that 1 in 30 of every one of those high school kids uses it or abused it.

669
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the damning effect, when you make press releases like that, I don't know how Medford High gets itself involved into the national statistic.

670
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:01,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam, you had statistics there for the state.

671
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:11,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if the state was broken down by each city and town, because these responses had to come from students who readily admitted and acknowledged that they either used it or abused it or were on it, one or the other.

672
00:54:12,678 --> 00:54:21,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't want people to think, when they hear 1 in 30, that that represents Medford High School as well, because it's a national statistic that took place in 2014.

673
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:24,983
[SPEAKER_07]: We know we have a problem here in the city of Medford.

674
00:54:25,203 --> 00:54:25,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We know we have some.

675
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an excessive 84 deaths over the last five years, and it is a problem.

676
00:54:32,817 --> 00:54:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't want people to think that our high school is lumped into this national drug survey that's unsubstantiated.

677
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:44,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an unfair commentary.

678
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:49,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, the data that I referred to was put forward again by the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services.

679
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:58,360
[SPEAKER_11]: The report was prepared by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services, and the Office of Data Analytics and Decision Support, Mr. President.

680
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:09,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Books like this fact sheet was put out in 2012 that I have here relative to the press release that Representative Zaglia put out and asked for me to read into the record, Mr. President.

681
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:13,230
[SPEAKER_11]: She didn't cite where she got her data.

682
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:20,035
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I take it on face value this is part of her testimony that she used when she chaired the caucus relative to the passage of the bill in the hearing as well.

683
00:55:20,537 --> 00:55:23,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can understand what Councilor Penta says.

684
00:55:23,898 --> 00:55:26,158
[SPEAKER_11]: However, he doesn't see it in Medford High.

685
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,839
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little bit closer to some of these children and I do see it, Mr. President.

686
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:32,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you think one in 30 children, you're thinking one kid in every single class.

687
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:41,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we're looking at this epidemic that's facing our city, our state, our region, and the country,

688
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:45,640
[SPEAKER_11]: It's foolish for us to think that we're immune to it, Mr. President.

689
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,440
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't discriminate.

690
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And national averages and national averages and, you know, we're a part of that.

691
00:55:50,703 --> 00:55:53,124
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a part of this nation and we're a part of the data collection module.

692
00:55:55,465 --> 00:56:08,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I would happen to think, Mr. President, that the students in our city and the parents in our city that unfortunately might have children that are either using it or have been abused from using it had to go through that suffering.

693
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:15,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But I cannot believe that one out of every 30 students or one out of every students in the classroom is either using it or abusing it.

694
00:56:15,936 --> 00:56:18,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes statistics can leave you in a different way.

695
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:19,240
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact.

696
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,973
[SPEAKER_07]: The press release is even different than that for which is being presented from 2012 to 2014.

697
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:27,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight can have his opinion.

698
00:56:27,456 --> 00:56:28,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I have mine.

699
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:32,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I just think that one particular statistic, um, doesn't vote well.

700
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:39,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a, uh, a false representation of every school district and every school throughout this entire country where they got these statistics.

701
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:46,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that method city, um, people from the city of Medford that families and students become part of it, that they take part of it.

702
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:48,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I just think it's a,

703
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:54,687
[SPEAKER_07]: an unfair commentary to make that one in 30 high school seniors have either used it or abused it or run it.

704
00:56:57,368 --> 00:56:58,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

705
00:56:58,928 --> 00:57:01,689
[SPEAKER_14]: The chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

706
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

707
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:17,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there was an article in the Medford Patch last week that stated, I think statistics are statistics, but the Patch article stated that Medford had one of the highest

708
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:21,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Top 10 highest death rates from opiate abuse.

709
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:24,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Top 25 in the state.

710
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, top 10, top 25.

711
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:29,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the article came out last week, so I think that's what we need to focus on.

712
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:39,439
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to focus on the facts, and we recently had a Medford resident pass away this past weekend, so it's happening.

713
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,060
[SPEAKER_12]: It's real.

714
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:46,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Statistics are statistics, but let's face the fact, and I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

715
00:57:46,672 --> 00:58:00,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Anytime this is a topic of discussion, it's important to continue to bring awareness and continue to take measures statewide, citywide, nationwide to help stop this epidemic.

716
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:02,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this is very important.

717
00:58:02,296 --> 00:58:07,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the language of the actual bill is what people need to focus on.

718
00:58:08,038 --> 00:58:16,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And the language states, no pharmacy or pharmacist shall issue, dispense, or distribute medications or prescriptions containing oxycontin.

719
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:31,125
[SPEAKER_12]: to any person under 17, and no practitioner, nurse, licensed practical nurse shall utilize, dispense, or prescribe a controlled substance in the Commonwealth to anybody under the age of 17.

720
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a no-brainer.

721
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:36,709
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one paper I didn't need to have two weeks ago to decide on.

722
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:37,810
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a no-brainer.

723
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,571
[SPEAKER_12]: These drugs are killing people.

724
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:44,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a measure that probably should have been enacted years ago.

725
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:55,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And any measure that's going to prevent this epidemic and children from suffering from this epidemic, you know, I'm in full support of.

726
00:58:57,328 --> 00:58:58,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

727
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:00,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Camuso.

728
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

729
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,711
[SPEAKER_16]: And this isn't about statistics.

730
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:07,673
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't one in 30, one in 60, one in 10, one in five.

731
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:09,274
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one.

732
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:10,535
[SPEAKER_16]: It's one.

733
00:59:10,962 --> 00:59:18,105
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's one person in the city of Medford that we can help save their life and put them in the right direction, then we support it or we don't.

734
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:20,126
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all entitled to our vote this evening.

735
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:24,567
[SPEAKER_16]: The statistics, as far as I'm concerned, are semantics.

736
00:59:25,788 --> 00:59:30,790
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something good that the Medford City Council can get behind to save one life.

737
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:33,566
[SPEAKER_16]: One life is enough, as far as I'm concerned.

738
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:44,174
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you go up to Medford High School, you go to Somerville High School, you go to Woburn High School, you go to any number of high schools around here, and the kids will tell you, it's easier to get pills than it is to buy a case of Budweiser down at the liquor store.

739
00:59:44,754 --> 00:59:45,394
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easier.

740
00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:47,876
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easier.

741
00:59:49,257 --> 01:00:00,465
[SPEAKER_16]: So, when there's a paper like this before us, and of course, on first face value, when I got my packet this weekend, I reached out and I discussed this with Councilor Knight, and just, I wanted to make sure that

742
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:20,399
[SPEAKER_16]: that kids that are suffering with terminal ill cancer, kids that are suffering with diseases that are going to ultimately be fatal, whether there is still mechanisms in place that they can be prescribed the needed doses of pain medication so that they can die with dignity.

743
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my little research I did this weekend, there is many.

744
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:29,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether it's Dilaudid, whether it's morphine, there are other substances out there that can

745
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:34,108
[SPEAKER_16]: be used, but I think this is a positive thing.

746
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:48,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Just look at collectively as a city council, this council as a whole, all seven of us stood in unity a year ago to push for the hiring of a full-time substance abuse coordinator for our community.

747
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,513
[SPEAKER_16]: We stood strong

748
01:00:52,831 --> 01:00:58,572
[SPEAKER_16]: And the mayor took our collective recommendation from all seven members of this council.

749
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,033
[SPEAKER_16]: That is in effect today.

750
01:01:00,433 --> 01:01:12,795
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't hire a full-time $80,000 a year salaried position that had unanimous support from the seven members of this council and the city administration because topics that we're talking about right now are not an issue.

751
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:14,415
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a major issue.

752
01:01:14,735 --> 01:01:17,556
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something we can get behind on the ground level.

753
01:01:17,936 --> 01:01:22,097
[SPEAKER_16]: We can be, and I get passionate about this obvious for obvious reasons.

754
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:31,521
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, but if we can get behind this and it can save one life, one life, then as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best votes we can take as a city councilor.

755
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:33,963
[SPEAKER_16]: We were arguing about bus stops a half hour ago.

756
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:36,505
[SPEAKER_16]: We were arguing about other stuff.

757
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:38,387
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the real deal stuff.

758
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:44,552
[SPEAKER_16]: And I ask my colleagues to all support this this evening in the interest of saving one life here in our community.

759
01:01:45,313 --> 01:01:46,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

760
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:48,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

761
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:49,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

762
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:51,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

763
01:01:51,493 --> 01:01:58,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I thank my council colleague, Councilman Knight, for providing the documentation and also for putting this on the agenda.

764
01:01:58,936 --> 01:02:04,598
[SPEAKER_22]: As part of the House bill, it lists the petitioners that have signed on to this.

765
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:07,660
[SPEAKER_22]: And many times, it's multiple pages.

766
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,262
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was just wondering if any of our state delegation has signed on to this, Mr. President.

767
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:17,484
[SPEAKER_22]: And if not, maybe if we can ask the reasoning why.

768
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:23,116
[SPEAKER_22]: I assume there are probably more petitioners than what's on this page one.

769
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,440
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is a worthy legislation, and I agree with all the comments that were made here.

770
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:36,566
[SPEAKER_22]: And I would like to also see our state delegation, whereas they would have a direct vote in this, be on board also, Mr. President.

771
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Markswell.

772
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:40,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, do you perhaps have any information on that?

773
01:02:40,348 --> 01:02:44,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can let the people from the podium speak, Mr. President, if that's all right with you, and then I'll close.

774
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:45,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

775
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,667
[SPEAKER_14]: You're all set, Councilor Marks?

776
01:02:47,947 --> 01:02:48,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

777
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:49,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

778
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:52,210
[SPEAKER_14]: The Chair recognizes the lady at the podium.

779
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:55,193
[SPEAKER_14]: If you would again, share your name and address with us for the record.

780
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:56,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sir.

781
01:02:56,233 --> 01:02:56,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

782
01:02:57,214 --> 01:02:58,495
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Rachel Tannenhaus.

783
01:02:58,555 --> 01:02:59,936
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 26 Pearl Street.

784
01:03:01,117 --> 01:03:07,842
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I was coming up here for one thing, but it turns out I'm coming up for two, because as it happens, I am a public health professional.

785
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:10,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not represent my employer.

786
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I am standing up here.

787
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,792
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just make that clear right now.

788
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:29,825
[SPEAKER_17]: But I am familiar with some of the survey instruments that are used, so I would like to address both the meat of the issue and also answer your question about the statistics.

789
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:35,510
[SPEAKER_17]: The years on the citations can be a little confusing.

790
01:03:36,537 --> 01:03:42,360
[SPEAKER_17]: misleading in terms of how recent they are, just in that it can take a year or two to process the data.

791
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:49,043
[SPEAKER_17]: So, for example, we don't have 2015 data in 2015, because it can take a while to... It doesn't mean it's bad data.

792
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:54,526
[SPEAKER_17]: It means it takes a while to... That's a lot of data that they got a crunch, a lot of numbers they got a crunch.

793
01:03:56,047 --> 01:04:01,689
[SPEAKER_17]: What they're asking, the exact wording of the question matters a great deal.

794
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:11,396
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're looking at have you used or abused Oxycontin, that could be as simple as have you ever taken Oxycontin without a prescription?

795
01:04:12,156 --> 01:04:16,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And that can be a situation where somebody was in pain

796
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:25,788
[SPEAKER_17]: and say their parent gave them one of their pills and that's illegal and that's off the prescription, but it doesn't mean the kid is necessarily addicted or is abusing it habitually.

797
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:31,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Or they could be asking questions about, are you habitual, and again, I'm not sure exactly what the questions are.

798
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:38,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm willing to bet that the citation on there is for the Youth Health Survey, the YHS.

799
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:42,797
[SPEAKER_17]: That's usually what's given in the school, one of the,

800
01:04:43,477 --> 01:04:46,898
[SPEAKER_17]: surveys that's given in the school system to survey the health behaviors of youth.

801
01:04:48,138 --> 01:05:00,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it is an underestimate because there are some kids to whom it's not accessible, and so they don't necessarily, you know, if you're in a special ed class, for example, or you need help filling out the survey, then, you know, you may not be taking the survey.

802
01:05:01,222 --> 01:05:10,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Likewise, it's self-report, so you always have to, you know, I mean, obviously there's probably kids who didn't say that they were using OxyContin.

803
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,572
[SPEAKER_17]: It does look at statewide.

804
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:24,514
[SPEAKER_17]: You may be able to, I mean, it's public data, so Department of Public Health may be able to get you data down to certain areas.

805
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it down to Medford?

806
01:05:27,495 --> 01:05:30,575
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure, but it's worth calling and checking.

807
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:35,856
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you don't have data from Medford, they can at least tell you if they can give it to you.

808
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,757
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some areas that are small enough that

809
01:05:39,256 --> 01:05:43,600
[SPEAKER_17]: either N isn't, they're not measuring enough kids for things to be statistically significant.

810
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:56,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet this isn't one of those areas, but it may be one of those areas where for some questions you have few enough people responding that you might be able to identify them so they aggregate the data with another area.

811
01:05:56,651 --> 01:06:00,174
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know about this one, but you can find out more.

812
01:06:02,203 --> 01:06:05,464
[SPEAKER_11]: The study was conducted in 2004 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

813
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:07,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but the stuff you got from DPH?

814
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:10,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a subsidiary of the National Institutes of Health.

815
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yes.

816
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:14,288
[SPEAKER_11]: That was in Representative D'Souza's press release.

817
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:18,229
[SPEAKER_11]: The stuff that I got from DPH was from the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services.

818
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:19,110
[SPEAKER_11]: That was their fact sheet.

819
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:24,649
[SPEAKER_11]: The annual report provides information on adolescent admissions to substance abuse treatment services.

820
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:24,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

821
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:25,329
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

822
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:33,253
[SPEAKER_11]: The admission data presented here reported to the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services Management Information System in FY12 by licensed providers.

823
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:34,193
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.

824
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:38,455
[SPEAKER_17]: They probably also have stuff from the YHS that they can give you if that's something that's useful.

825
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,336
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's great.

826
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:43,897
[SPEAKER_17]: But really, a lot of it is going to depend on how they worded the question.

827
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:49,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, saying that those kids aren't from Medford, I think that's probably a little bit idealistic.

828
01:06:50,404 --> 01:06:53,926
[SPEAKER_17]: But is it exactly 1 in 30 in Medford?

829
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:55,127
[SPEAKER_17]: No, of course, that's an average.

830
01:06:55,687 --> 01:06:58,109
[SPEAKER_17]: But can you find out a little more about what it is?

831
01:06:58,129 --> 01:07:00,230
[SPEAKER_17]: It's probably going to be a bigger number than you want it to be.

832
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:14,559
[SPEAKER_17]: That having been said, what I actually came up here to say is that I am in favor of, obviously, doing everything possible to address

833
01:07:16,942 --> 01:07:30,460
[SPEAKER_17]: the opioid epidemic, it's a huge deal, but I would like, so I am not speaking out against this bill, what I am speaking out in favor of is going to some of the other folks that it impacts directly.

834
01:07:30,932 --> 01:07:37,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Kids with disabilities who have chronic pain are not going to be getting up in front of you and talking to you about their experiences.

835
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:40,034
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't vote.

836
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:42,655
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not telling you what they experience.

837
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:50,297
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that different people have, particularly people with chronic pain, have different drugs that they respond to.

838
01:07:50,777 --> 01:07:53,638
[SPEAKER_17]: Not all drugs are exactly the same or work on every person.

839
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:58,179
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're talking about a person with chronic pain, they may be at increased risk for suicide.

840
01:08:00,522 --> 01:08:04,704
[SPEAKER_17]: They may, they certainly are at increased risk for lower quality of life.

841
01:08:05,645 --> 01:08:20,412
[SPEAKER_17]: What I am concerned about is that there are children out there who have disabilities and chronic conditions or even acute conditions that are in extreme pain and they need all the tools available possible to be able to function, to be able to get an education.

842
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:24,360
[SPEAKER_17]: to be able to have the best possible quality of life.

843
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,002
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, those kids are not necessarily going to be up here talking about their lives.

844
01:08:29,062 --> 01:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_17]: What I ask that you do before you go all out on this bill, which may be a decent bill, is that you talk to the disability community.

845
01:08:37,506 --> 01:08:44,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the people that wind up being impacted in a lot of ways that aren't always looked at by these bills that talk about

846
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:51,533
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, what you can do, like who can prescribe, like how many opioids can be prescribed and such.

847
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:59,738
[SPEAKER_17]: The people who are in chronic pain suddenly have a much harder time getting treatment to keep their pain under control.

848
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:10,243
[SPEAKER_17]: And that makes it difficult for folks to, in the case of adults, to hold down jobs, to have decent quality of life, or to control other major health issues.

849
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:31,672
[SPEAKER_17]: My request is that you talk to the disability community, that you talk to, say, the Federation for Children with Special Needs, that you talk to parents of kids with chronic pain due to some sort of disability or health condition, that you talk to maybe

850
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:36,553
[SPEAKER_17]: kids going through cancer treatment, that sort of thing.

851
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:47,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Because while I am 100% in favor of addressing the opioid epidemic, I'm really scared when it happens on the backs of my community.

852
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:49,418
[SPEAKER_17]: That really freaks me out a lot.

853
01:09:50,059 --> 01:09:57,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know people who are having a harder time controlling the pain that they deal with every single day.

854
01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:02,620
[SPEAKER_17]: because of some of the things that are being done with the best possible intentions.

855
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:19,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do ask that while you are researching this bill, which is done with the best possible intentions and hopefully will do really awesome things, that you talk to some of the people who are being impacted by it as unintentionally, like as collateral.

856
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:22,657
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want my people to be collateral damage here.

857
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:25,280
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you very much.

858
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,180
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that.

859
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:26,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

860
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:34,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

861
01:10:35,269 --> 01:10:36,430
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

862
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:38,152
[SPEAKER_19]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

863
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:40,694
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to speak in favor of this measure.

864
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:48,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Since 2012, the number of heroin-related deaths in this country have gone up three times.

865
01:10:48,882 --> 01:10:50,184
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a three-fold increase.

866
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:56,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Massachusetts has a pretty serious heroin problem, and unfortunately,

867
01:10:57,147 --> 01:11:04,650
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford's problem has a 20% higher incident rate of heroin use and abuse than Massachusetts, which is a frightening statistic.

868
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:08,332
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's excellent that we're beginning to get some more attention on this.

869
01:11:08,792 --> 01:11:12,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Oxycontin works on the same pathway as heroin.

870
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:19,897
[SPEAKER_19]: So what happens is people get started on Oxy via a back injury or knee injury.

871
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:27,119
[SPEAKER_19]: something like that, and then before you know it, they find themselves cut off from their pain medication that they are now addicted to.

872
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:37,323
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen it as a teacher, and my wife, who is a rehabilitation doctor, she sees it all the time, people having injuries as a result of OxyContin.

873
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,024
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's excellent work, and please keep it up.

874
01:11:40,064 --> 01:11:40,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

875
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:43,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

876
01:11:43,826 --> 01:11:45,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

877
01:11:45,626 --> 01:11:45,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

878
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:49,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick Tomazuk, 29, Garfield Ave.

879
01:11:50,834 --> 01:11:52,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about Oxycontin.

880
01:11:52,295 --> 01:12:00,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oxycontin, you know, instead of beating the people that are taking it, you have to put a stronger law for the dealers.

881
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:09,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Oxycontin can't be a safe drug because nowadays there's OC on the pills and there's OP on the pills.

882
01:12:11,525 --> 01:12:12,906
[SPEAKER_06]: OP is a time release.

883
01:12:14,147 --> 01:12:16,128
[SPEAKER_06]: OC is what they're crushing the snort.

884
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thing of it is, if a kid needs a prescription for Oxycontin, he should be able to get it by the time of release.

885
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So he doesn't get high.

886
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:36,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have to make stronger laws for the dealers, because they're peddling the stuff that they snort.

887
01:12:39,512 --> 01:12:47,054
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at these kids' prescriptions, I'll bet you 10 to 1 that they're at the time of release.

888
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:52,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Oxycontin, not the straight deal like these drug dealers get.

889
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:58,496
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bringing it in from Mexico, Canada, and everywhere else.

890
01:12:59,497 --> 01:13:02,340
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people have been busted with a ton of Oxycontin?

891
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always been the old seed, not the OP.

892
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to get after the drug dealers.

893
01:13:08,605 --> 01:13:11,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to pass stronger laws.

894
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Put them suckers away for life.

895
01:13:16,894 --> 01:13:19,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put them in there where you can sit and watch TV all day long.

896
01:13:22,276 --> 01:13:27,538
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing of it is, we have to stiffen up our laws, not beat the people that have chronic pain.

897
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And then again, it's these parents have to watch.

898
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:38,181
[SPEAKER_06]: When they get prescriptions for OxyContin, they don't leave it laying around because it'll start to disappear.

899
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Make them responsible for it.

900
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:48,776
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we can pass all the laws we want, you know, as far as not prescribing this, not prescribing that.

901
01:13:49,336 --> 01:13:50,716
[SPEAKER_06]: These doctors are prescribing it.

902
01:13:50,756 --> 01:13:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been to school for eight years.

903
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:56,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to tell them that, well, you don't know what the hell you're talking about now.

904
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:00,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Get after these drug dealers.

905
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:02,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them a good boot in the behindy.

906
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:06,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Pain is no fun.

907
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:09,702
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fun.

908
01:14:10,642 --> 01:14:11,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

909
01:14:11,683 --> 01:14:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

910
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:15,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Camuso.

911
01:14:15,338 --> 01:14:16,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

912
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:26,922
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, if Councilor Knight and the President would allow me just to give a brief update of the Middlesex District Attorney Opiate Task Force that I was appointed to.

913
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:27,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Just real quick.

914
01:14:29,723 --> 01:14:35,625
[SPEAKER_16]: The task force is really getting into this epidemic.

915
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:42,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to give a quick background, it's leaders that Middlesex District Attorney Marion Ryan has put together of

916
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:47,027
[SPEAKER_16]: It's law enforcement, health care providers, doctors, nurses.

917
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:55,190
[SPEAKER_16]: The two lead hospitals are Hallmark Health and the Leahy Clinic's conglomerate out of Burlington, policy makers and elected officials.

918
01:14:57,371 --> 01:15:04,174
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the key doctors that brings a lot of the science and the statistics to it is Dr. O'Connor out of Middlesex Recovery.

919
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:08,136
[SPEAKER_16]: He has quite a very, very interesting story.

920
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:13,098
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's bringing the science behind addiction so that people can understand it.

921
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:22,516
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the big pieces is the task force is working on the stigma, the stigma that people that are addicted to drugs are given.

922
01:15:22,956 --> 01:15:30,481
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately, it's easy to forget that they're human beings that are dealing with issues.

923
01:15:30,981 --> 01:15:32,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's being worked on.

924
01:15:33,063 --> 01:15:38,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Two big things that I found very interesting, dentists, dentist officers and

925
01:15:40,843 --> 01:15:43,565
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the other one that's back here, where they do the root canals?

926
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Oral surgeons.

927
01:15:47,328 --> 01:15:53,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Oral surgeons, yeah, and endodontists are a major area where people get these pills.

928
01:15:54,473 --> 01:16:00,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Second thing that I would never even think of, the Middlesex DA's office is working with the realtors in the area.

929
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:01,878
[SPEAKER_16]: You have open houses on Sundays.

930
01:16:02,138 --> 01:16:04,680
[SPEAKER_16]: People come through the house looking at the house, oh, beautiful home.

931
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,363
[SPEAKER_16]: They go into the bathroom, they open up the medicine cabinet, Oxycontin sitting there.

932
01:16:10,307 --> 01:16:12,728
[SPEAKER_16]: These are things that you'd never think about.

933
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:16,528
[SPEAKER_16]: So the education piece is getting out there.

934
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:18,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Hallmark Health has been a leader.

935
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:21,489
[SPEAKER_16]: They're doing a study right now on back pain.

936
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:29,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone that goes into the emergency room with back pain, the most that they can be prescribed is 72 hours worth of pain medication.

937
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:37,973
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it's up to them to go to their primary care and actually get good follow up on the source of their pain and everything else.

938
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:40,760
[SPEAKER_16]: What else?

939
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:44,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Middlesex district attorney is working with the legislature.

940
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:46,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Representative Donato is on this as well.

941
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:48,983
[SPEAKER_16]: With Senator Lewis out of Winchester.

942
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:53,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Middlesex DA has a bill right now to limit to 72 hours supply.

943
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:56,986
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bill that's going to be heard this legislative session, 72 hours supply of

944
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:05,268
[SPEAKER_16]: opiate pain medication out of the emergency rooms, once again, until you see your specialist.

945
01:17:05,809 --> 01:17:08,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's real good.

946
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:13,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Just this last meeting, addicts that are in recovery were brought in and talked about it.

947
01:17:13,993 --> 01:17:14,894
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was young mothers.

948
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:21,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Young mothers, you would never in a million years think that these people were addicted to heroin or other opiates.

949
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:25,120
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just amazing hearing their stories.

950
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:29,242
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's educating the people in that room that can make a change.

951
01:17:31,057 --> 01:17:32,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

952
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:41,921
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone else has any specific questions regarding that task force, please feel free to ask me and at least we'll put you in touch with someone that can answer other specific questions.

953
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:47,803
[SPEAKER_16]: But the Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, really is taking a leadership role on this in the county.

954
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:49,204
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the second of two task force.

955
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:54,186
[SPEAKER_16]: The other one is in Northern Middlesex County, which is Lowell and Bill Ricker and up near that area.

956
01:17:54,626 --> 01:18:00,008
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is something that I'm honored to serve on because

957
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:17,733
[SPEAKER_16]: working collectively, if we can work collectively as elected officials in this room and with the DA's office, with Representative Donato and Senator Jalen and the other representatives, and get the right data into the hands of the people that can make a difference up on Beacon Hill.

958
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:21,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Governor Baker just came out with his bill.

959
01:18:21,595 --> 01:18:23,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Very impressive, some of the stuff in his bill.

960
01:18:24,077 --> 01:18:30,000
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is something, and it's nonpartisan, because addiction does not discriminate.

961
01:18:30,485 --> 01:18:32,066
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no Democrat next to an addict.

962
01:18:32,086 --> 01:18:34,566
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no Republican next to an addict.

963
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:37,467
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't discriminate.

964
01:18:37,948 --> 01:18:53,013
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's a work in progress, but one day at a time, hopefully you can get people the data to make these decisions and the laws change that need to be changed.

965
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:55,393
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're doing what we can on the ground floor.

966
01:18:55,413 --> 01:18:56,814
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to thank my council colleagues.

967
01:18:57,235 --> 01:19:03,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Because this is one issue, one issue that we stood tall on, each and every member of this Medford City Council.

968
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:04,918
[SPEAKER_16]: We hit it head on collectively.

969
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:09,900
[SPEAKER_16]: We sent a strong message to the mayor that it's something that's going on in our community and we all work together.

970
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:12,301
[SPEAKER_16]: And we all should be proud of that.

971
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:14,362
[SPEAKER_16]: So basically, that's it, Mr. President.

972
01:19:14,622 --> 01:19:16,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Constable Rousseau.

973
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,371
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor Knight, did you need to?

974
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:19,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

975
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:30,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in closing, I have here before me a paper written by Nora Vaklau, a medical doctor who appeared before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Mr. President.

976
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:37,905
[SPEAKER_11]: She's also associated with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and that's an affiliate of the National Institutes of Health.

977
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:45,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And what she says is, based on her studies, is that prescription opioids are one of the three main broad categories of medication that present abuse liability.

978
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:48,295
[SPEAKER_11]: and there are several factors that contribute to this.

979
01:19:49,416 --> 01:20:01,066
[SPEAKER_11]: They include drastic increases in the number of prescriptions written and dispensed, the greater social acceptability for using medications for different purposes, and aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies, Mr. President.

980
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:08,993
[SPEAKER_11]: These factors together have helped create a broad environmental availability of prescription medications and, in general, opioids in particular.

981
01:20:10,575 --> 01:20:12,917
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the most alarming

982
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:24,553
[SPEAKER_11]: result that I saw here was in 2012, over 5% of the United States population aged 12 years or older have used opioid pain relievers non-medically.

983
01:20:24,693 --> 01:20:28,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Children as young as 12 years old, fifth and sixth graders, Mr. President.

984
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:40,460
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that although I understand the corollary in between those that are using the drug in its appropriate form, we're seeing a lot of diversion.

985
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:56,122
[SPEAKER_11]: We must recognize and consider, as Dr. Vauclau said, the impact of opioid abuse on health and mortality, but also preserve the fundamental role played by prescription opioid pain relievers in healing and reducing human suffering.

986
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:59,185
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to strike the right balance, Mr. President.

987
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:01,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, I don't see how

988
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:09,588
[SPEAKER_11]: prescribing oxycontin to children 11, 12, and 13 years old is sending the right message to anybody, Mr. President.

989
01:21:09,629 --> 01:21:12,531
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank my council colleagues for entertaining me this evening.

990
01:21:12,571 --> 01:21:17,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I usually don't go on this long, and I do certainly appreciate all your support.

991
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:23,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that you join with me in voting in the affirmative for this resolution, Mr. President, because I do feel as though it will make a difference.

992
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Councilor Camuso could have been more right.

993
01:21:26,227 --> 01:21:26,927
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about one.

994
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:30,110
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can save one life, then we've done a good thing and we're doing our job.

995
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:33,012
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a discussion that we need to keep on the forefront.

996
01:21:33,552 --> 01:21:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we're doing a good job as a council working together to ensure that Medford is a place where people that are suffering from addiction and seeking treatment services have resources.

997
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:47,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is just another step in helping combat.

998
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,525
[SPEAKER_11]: the opiate crisis here in Medford and Massachusetts and in the region.

999
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:53,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to my colleagues.

1000
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:54,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd move for approval on the paper.

1001
01:21:54,588 --> 01:21:55,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion approved by Councilor Knight.

1002
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Sir, did you want to speak on this matter, please?

1003
01:21:58,972 --> 01:22:00,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1004
01:22:00,593 --> 01:22:00,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

1005
01:22:01,634 --> 01:22:02,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1006
01:22:02,754 --> 01:22:03,835
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Ronald Paone.

1007
01:22:03,855 --> 01:22:11,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I live on Winthrop Street in Medford and I was sitting at home when I was watching this and this discussion is very, very pertinent to this.

1008
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:12,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

1009
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:14,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really adamant about this situation.

1010
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Came to the council a few weeks ago about a situation.

1011
01:22:18,582 --> 01:22:24,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you ever heard the term gateway, but what we were talking about, what you people are talking about tonight is a gateway.

1012
01:22:25,306 --> 01:22:27,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gateway to the next level.

1013
01:22:27,707 --> 01:22:28,708
[SPEAKER_05]: A gentleman touched on it.

1014
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:31,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a heroin problem in this city.

1015
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:33,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not the only problem.

1016
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:39,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just one of those things that I feel very strongly about.

1017
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:42,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree, statistically, yeah, one in 30.

1018
01:22:43,885 --> 01:22:47,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, I've been in recovery for almost 28 years, and I'll break my hand any day.

1019
01:22:47,688 --> 01:22:48,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't care.

1020
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:51,290
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm trying to say here is this.

1021
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I came into recovery, I was actively addicted to certain things.

1022
01:22:57,814 --> 01:23:01,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, they didn't give that 1 to 30 statistic.

1023
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot less than that.

1024
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's increasingly getting worse because it's easy to get your hands on it.

1025
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody touched on the dealers.

1026
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:09,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody touched on the kids.

1027
01:23:10,243 --> 01:23:11,844
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot easier.

1028
01:23:12,471 --> 01:23:15,933
[SPEAKER_05]: to get an opiate and a sex pack.

1029
01:23:16,013 --> 01:23:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little nervous when I speak in public.

1030
01:23:17,974 --> 01:23:19,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really a big public speaker.

1031
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:25,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the problems with this whole thing is that, yeah, do not take away from the American Disabilities Act.

1032
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:33,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm disabled myself, not in a term, but mentally, from all the drugs that I did over the years.

1033
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:34,924
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that's an effect.

1034
01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:37,046
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unreversible.

1035
01:23:37,706 --> 01:23:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a daily day that I got to just

1036
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:40,820
[SPEAKER_05]: function.

1037
01:23:41,160 --> 01:24:02,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically what I'm trying to say is like if this law gets passed, yeah, there's some good points and some bad points, but it just, it's really hard for me to see, um, not to see us moving forward with this because like, listen, we got a drug problem in the city and it's bad and it's in my face 24 seven and I'm watching it.

1038
01:24:02,847 --> 01:24:04,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of it is, yes, opioid use.

1039
01:24:04,968 --> 01:24:08,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other is the street drugs that are going on, you know?

1040
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:10,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in my family.

1041
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:12,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very difficult for me to watch this, you know?

1042
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:21,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this is going to help to, like, maybe put a little Band-Aid on this situation personally, I say, please, go for it.

1043
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:25,313
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not going to help, then you guys are going to go in the other direction.

1044
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't see how

1045
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,550
[SPEAKER_05]: He cannot vote yes for this.

1046
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:33,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, taking into consideration with the American Disabilities Act, I understand.

1047
01:24:34,332 --> 01:24:43,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I had cancer, I would hope, and I was a young kid, I would hope that if I was in enough pain that I could be able to get something like that.

1048
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I'm not in that situation.

1049
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:49,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's a tough shot all around.

1050
01:24:50,156 --> 01:24:51,017
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I want to say.

1051
01:24:51,037 --> 01:24:53,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Sean, thank you very much for your testimony on this important matter.

1052
01:24:54,598 --> 01:24:56,198
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

1053
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:02,722
[SPEAKER_14]: As seconded by Councilor Camuso, if I could just add from the chair, thank you, Councilor, for this.

1054
01:25:03,722 --> 01:25:10,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I just came back last week from a national convention of American Funeral Directors Association.

1055
01:25:10,964 --> 01:25:20,347
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there's one thing that all my colleagues were talking about is just this, and that we've all grown weary and sad and tired.

1056
01:25:21,752 --> 01:25:29,397
[SPEAKER_13]: week after week of having to walk families to graves to bury their children from this sickness.

1057
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:30,458
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for this measure.

1058
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:33,040
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1059
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Move for a call of the yeas and nays, Mr. President.

1060
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:36,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry?

1061
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:36,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

1062
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:37,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote, please.

1063
01:25:37,843 --> 01:25:38,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote.

1064
01:25:39,445 --> 01:25:42,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Mr. Mr. Clerk, please.

1065
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:45,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuccio?

1066
01:25:45,609 --> 01:25:45,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1067
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello?

1068
01:25:48,211 --> 01:25:48,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1069
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:49,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1070
01:25:49,452 --> 01:25:49,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1071
01:25:50,203 --> 01:25:51,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-President Lungo-Koehn?

1072
01:25:51,284 --> 01:25:51,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1073
01:25:52,184 --> 01:25:52,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1074
01:25:52,824 --> 01:25:53,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1075
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:53,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

1076
01:25:54,005 --> 01:25:54,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1077
01:25:55,285 --> 01:25:56,126
[SPEAKER_14]: President Dello Russo?

1078
01:25:56,206 --> 01:25:56,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1079
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:59,607
[SPEAKER_14]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the measure passes.

1080
01:25:59,727 --> 01:26:00,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1081
01:26:02,129 --> 01:26:05,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1082
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:13,634
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-721, petition by Robert Cappucci Jr., 71 Evans Street, Medford, Mass., to speak to the council on the Community Preservation Act.

1083
01:26:15,205 --> 01:26:15,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, sir.

1084
01:26:15,945 --> 01:26:17,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1085
01:26:17,687 --> 01:26:18,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

1086
01:26:18,547 --> 01:26:19,628
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1087
01:26:19,768 --> 01:26:22,250
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

1088
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,651
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to speak more.

1089
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:30,015
[SPEAKER_24]: I know this was brought up a couple weeks ago, and a group came in and addressed the pros.

1090
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:32,917
[SPEAKER_24]: And I even spoke up a little bit that night.

1091
01:26:33,357 --> 01:26:36,539
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's just — as a taxpayer, there's just some more concerns.

1092
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:44,845
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm not here to argue for or against passing this measure, to just discuss it a little more after having spoken to some fellow residents.

1093
01:26:45,421 --> 01:26:46,241
[SPEAKER_24]: and taxpayers.

1094
01:26:47,442 --> 01:26:57,628
[SPEAKER_24]: The fruits of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, and what it wishes to achieve, I don't see anybody being against that.

1095
01:26:58,728 --> 01:27:13,997
[SPEAKER_24]: Infrastructure repairs, building repairs, as we see here, the police department that should probably be condemned, fire station repairs, street and roads, cleaner, more open space environments, we are all for that.

1096
01:27:15,612 --> 01:27:29,158
[SPEAKER_24]: But there are just some concerns that have come up, wondering if, and I'm not arguing for or against it, just wondering if the CPA is the right way to go, and the voters will decide that next Tuesday.

1097
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:39,082
[SPEAKER_24]: But just looking into it, the card that came out yesterday, the mailer, I don't know if you received it,

1098
01:27:40,696 --> 01:27:48,122
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that it says, which is just a general statement, that the state will match it.

1099
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:52,245
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't give any percentage on what it would match.

1100
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:56,069
[SPEAKER_24]: At first we heard 100%, then 30%.

1101
01:27:56,509 --> 01:28:00,813
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the last official report from the state of Massachusetts says it's only going to match 18%.

1102
01:28:01,453 --> 01:28:06,337
[SPEAKER_24]: The proponents for this argued a couple weeks ago

1103
01:28:07,923 --> 01:28:11,405
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be a small increase to property taxes, $54.

1104
01:28:12,466 --> 01:28:19,350
[SPEAKER_24]: Depending on your land value, for some people that's upwards of a 40% increase.

1105
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:31,237
[SPEAKER_24]: When it gets to the business side of it, when I was looking this up earlier tonight, a place called Redstone and Stoneham, just for an example, the land, because this 100K cap

1106
01:28:32,743 --> 01:28:42,885
[SPEAKER_24]: which is a little bit insignificant if you're in a higher tax rate, like Redstone is, like perhaps our Super Stop and Shop is, or the Meadow Glen Mall, or other industrial parks here in Medford.

1107
01:28:45,365 --> 01:28:48,986
[SPEAKER_24]: The Redstone, for example, was assessed at something like $34,200,000.

1108
01:28:49,086 --> 01:28:50,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Their tax increase was significant.

1109
01:28:50,746 --> 01:28:51,066
[SPEAKER_24]: It was $5,700.

1110
01:28:51,106 --> 01:28:53,627
[SPEAKER_24]: And that gets passed on to the consumer.

1111
01:29:02,564 --> 01:29:09,087
[SPEAKER_24]: just for people to understand what we might be getting into here and locked into it for five years.

1112
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:25,155
[SPEAKER_24]: There are also alternatives to this that people have been discussing that might be a better way to go.

1113
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:31,138
[SPEAKER_24]: In discussing this earlier today with a proponent

1114
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:46,934
[SPEAKER_24]: for the CPA, I made some suggestions as what might be an alternate route, and the person said it was a Band-Aid that doesn't provide a steady funding stream.

1115
01:29:48,495 --> 01:29:53,659
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, what a lot of the people in Medford are saying is we have seen

1116
01:29:54,792 --> 01:30:08,865
[SPEAKER_24]: A property tax increase every year for 28 years, excise taxes, sales taxes that have gone up, income taxes, meals taxes, death taxes, taxes for businesses, and everything else.

1117
01:30:10,246 --> 01:30:17,532
[SPEAKER_24]: For a proponent to tell me that we need a steady funding stream, I say it already exists.

1118
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:18,153
[SPEAKER_24]: We have.

1119
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:22,522
[SPEAKER_24]: a surplus between two different accounts are in Medford of almost $15 million.

1120
01:30:22,822 --> 01:30:29,425
[SPEAKER_24]: We're talking about a steady stream that's about 10 miles wide, 20 miles deep, and longer than the Mississippi River.

1121
01:30:30,205 --> 01:30:35,988
[SPEAKER_24]: We have the funds to do what the CPA is asking to do.

1122
01:30:36,508 --> 01:30:47,793
[SPEAKER_24]: In my humble opinion, and just as an observance, what Medford could be doing as an alternative is, a few weeks ago, I went around Medford and I took a few pictures

1123
01:30:48,364 --> 01:30:58,631
[SPEAKER_24]: There's, from the end of Salem Street near the Fellsway, all the way up to Forest Street, there's over 20 storefronts closed down, some of them boarded up.

1124
01:30:59,811 --> 01:31:04,214
[SPEAKER_24]: A tax cut incentive to bring businesses in here would be the route to go.

1125
01:31:04,915 --> 01:31:09,578
[SPEAKER_24]: A property tax, either neutrality or cut, would be the way to go.

1126
01:31:10,018 --> 01:31:15,982
[SPEAKER_24]: We attract more people to move to Medford, Mr. President, and more businesses to come into Medford.

1127
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:19,303
[SPEAKER_24]: What are one of the other proposals by the CPA?

1128
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:20,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Affordable housing?

1129
01:31:21,544 --> 01:31:22,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's get people jobs.

1130
01:31:23,086 --> 01:31:28,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's attract businesses and people to move here by offering tax-cutting incentives.

1131
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:44,140
[SPEAKER_24]: With that added business growth and business venture and people working at a lot of these empty storefronts, they can afford on their own without having to rely on government and higher tax incentives.

1132
01:31:45,357 --> 01:31:52,659
[SPEAKER_24]: to be able to afford their own houses with personal responsibility and self-dignity of doing it for themselves.

1133
01:31:53,840 --> 01:32:06,743
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just very much like to urge our city council and everybody watching, make your own decision, either for or against it, next Tuesday on voting on ballot question one.

1134
01:32:07,323 --> 01:32:10,224
[SPEAKER_24]: And other cities and towns have

1135
01:32:11,182 --> 01:32:15,085
[SPEAKER_24]: accepted it, about 154, I think it is, in Massachusetts.

1136
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,566
[SPEAKER_24]: And there are pros and cons to it.

1137
01:32:17,986 --> 01:32:29,274
[SPEAKER_24]: And some towns have already started, at least one, I think it's the town of Northampton, have started to try to repeal it after passing it.

1138
01:32:30,194 --> 01:32:35,017
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would come from city council initiative, should it pass next Tuesday.

1139
01:32:35,618 --> 01:32:38,200
[SPEAKER_24]: And if it don't, then it's not a concern.

1140
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:44,891
[SPEAKER_24]: They call this state, Taxachusetts, for a reason.

1141
01:32:45,411 --> 01:33:00,613
[SPEAKER_24]: And to continually raise our taxes, to argue for infrastructure repairs when we're already paying taxes ad infinitum, and we're not getting those necessary repairs now.

1142
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:03,394
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we've driven through Medford.

1143
01:33:03,474 --> 01:33:06,194
[SPEAKER_24]: We know the conditions of the streets, the roads, the parks.

1144
01:33:06,554 --> 01:33:07,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Another thing, open spaces.

1145
01:33:09,395 --> 01:33:10,335
[SPEAKER_24]: We have Hormel Park.

1146
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:11,749
[SPEAKER_24]: We have part of the sheepfold.

1147
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:14,611
[SPEAKER_24]: We have, what, 26 parks in Medford?

1148
01:33:14,931 --> 01:33:16,572
[SPEAKER_24]: We already have a lot of open spaces.

1149
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:20,896
[SPEAKER_24]: We already have a lot of money to make these infrastructure repairs.

1150
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:35,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Just those surpluses alone, I mean, I understand that some of the surpluses can't be touched, but maybe a new ballot initiative to maybe change that law could happen to appropriate the funds that we need.

1151
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:39,630
[SPEAKER_24]: In closing, I would just like to say,

1152
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:41,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for the time.

1153
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:49,917
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not arguing either for or against us, just bringing up some ideas for people to ponder, for you good people to ponder as well, because you'll be voting next Tuesday, too.

1154
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:52,819
[SPEAKER_24]: I thank you for your time, and good luck to you all.

1155
01:33:53,059 --> 01:33:53,379
[SPEAKER_24]: Good night.

1156
01:33:53,599 --> 01:33:54,700
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1157
01:33:56,462 --> 01:33:58,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

1158
01:33:59,124 --> 01:34:00,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1159
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:01,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1160
01:34:01,105 --> 01:34:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, I'd like to thank Rachel for all of her comments, and I hope that she keeps coming to these meetings.

1161
01:34:05,326 --> 01:34:06,567
[SPEAKER_00]: because she had some great insights.

1162
01:34:06,767 --> 01:34:09,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, Rachel.

1163
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:16,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm against this bill or whatever it is, this initiative.

1164
01:34:16,795 --> 01:34:20,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is because these are nice things to have.

1165
01:34:21,099 --> 01:34:25,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need money, hard cash money, for a lot of these projects.

1166
01:34:25,603 --> 01:34:30,687
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harness the people of the city to do a lot of these cleanups.

1167
01:34:31,593 --> 01:34:34,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get the guys to volunteer on the weekend to do these things.

1168
01:34:35,016 --> 01:34:40,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you need some money for the equipment to clean up weeded areas or whatever.

1169
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,581
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what you need hard cash for?

1170
01:34:42,601 --> 01:34:44,362
[SPEAKER_00]: A police station.

1171
01:34:44,903 --> 01:34:46,224
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, I know.

1172
01:34:46,824 --> 01:34:49,466
[SPEAKER_00]: It's police station, police station, police station.

1173
01:34:49,546 --> 01:34:50,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about the library?

1174
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:51,908
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the $15,000 for the library bathrooms?

1175
01:34:53,942 --> 01:35:01,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We have infrastructure problems that we need to raise our taxes for and that are going to be forced on us regardless.

1176
01:35:01,364 --> 01:35:02,645
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an override.

1177
01:35:02,985 --> 01:35:04,905
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prop two and a half override.

1178
01:35:05,185 --> 01:35:07,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a different way of doing it.

1179
01:35:07,546 --> 01:35:09,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already have hidden taxes.

1180
01:35:09,647 --> 01:35:15,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to let you know, we have the hidden tax through the community access monies, whatever peg monies you want to call them.

1181
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:20,290
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the hidden tax monies in the police department where we get a 15% kickback for every

1182
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:24,292
[SPEAKER_00]: detail hour, we have these hidden monies.

1183
01:35:25,232 --> 01:35:25,993
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already taxed.

1184
01:35:26,593 --> 01:35:27,474
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already taxed.

1185
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:29,356
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to sit down.

1186
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:33,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to harness the energy of the city for all of these extra projects.

1187
01:35:33,739 --> 01:35:41,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, I know, I'm so, I know, you get tired of hearing me say the same thing, and I get tired of saying it, to be honest with you.

1188
01:35:41,565 --> 01:35:42,746
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need a new police station.

1189
01:35:42,766 --> 01:35:43,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We need hard cash for that.

1190
01:35:44,487 --> 01:35:49,411
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use volunteer work to put in a foundation for the police department.

1191
01:35:49,788 --> 01:35:50,408
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.

1192
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:55,232
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to buy a bigger lot, and that needs hard cash, because we're one-third.

1193
01:35:55,612 --> 01:36:00,055
[SPEAKER_00]: The police station is on a footing that is one-third smaller than it's supposed to be.

1194
01:36:00,775 --> 01:36:06,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And until we get that, you're going to have to get sick and tired of hearing me, because I'm just going to have to say it over and over until it gets done.

1195
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:08,380
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate your patience.

1196
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:10,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the council's patience.

1197
01:36:10,481 --> 01:36:15,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the people behind the rail can afford the $56 increase, but a lot of people can't.

1198
01:36:15,865 --> 01:36:17,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to have a tax override,

1199
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:25,715
[SPEAKER_00]: a two-and-a-half tax override, which is what this is, then let's make it count for something like the library, the Chevalier, which I went to the Bee Gees.

1200
01:36:25,756 --> 01:36:26,476
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fantastic.

1201
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:30,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see a $50,000 banner in front of the place.

1202
01:36:31,019 --> 01:36:31,580
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call that?

1203
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:32,440
[SPEAKER_00]: The banner?

1204
01:36:33,141 --> 01:36:33,601
[SPEAKER_00]: The marquee.

1205
01:36:33,661 --> 01:36:35,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the $50,000 marquee in the front of it.

1206
01:36:36,103 --> 01:36:36,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.

1207
01:36:36,824 --> 01:36:37,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against these things.

1208
01:36:38,385 --> 01:36:41,267
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a two-and-a-half override.

1209
01:36:41,607 --> 01:36:43,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that has common sense knows that.

1210
01:36:43,749 --> 01:36:43,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1211
01:36:49,121 --> 01:36:49,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1212
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:51,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1213
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:52,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, Mr. President.

1214
01:36:52,443 --> 01:36:55,965
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is John Sterola, 20 Metcalf Street.

1215
01:36:57,246 --> 01:37:00,388
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank you for permitting me to speak here tonight.

1216
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:07,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to say definitely that I do have a position on this, and I can't say it plainly enough.

1217
01:37:08,593 --> 01:37:17,118
[SPEAKER_20]: I urge all the people of Medford to vote no on question one, because this is really a boondoggle.

1218
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:19,874
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a report here.

1219
01:37:20,495 --> 01:37:27,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think any of you Councilors are aware of this, but I wish you would if you are.

1220
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:33,028
[SPEAKER_20]: But the report says here that the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act.

1221
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:37,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Section 22, Mr. President.

1222
01:37:37,252 --> 01:37:40,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilors and folks, section 22 can no longer be debated.

1223
01:37:45,855 --> 01:37:46,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1224
01:37:47,576 --> 01:37:51,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.

1225
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:57,022
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion is, uh, section 22 has been invoked that ends debate on the matter.

1226
01:37:59,464 --> 01:37:59,864
[SPEAKER_20]: We're

1227
01:38:11,787 --> 01:38:12,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Section 22.

1228
01:38:17,069 --> 01:38:17,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1229
01:38:17,509 --> 01:38:18,489
[SPEAKER_11]: So the paper's out of order.

1230
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:23,390
[SPEAKER_11]: It can't be brought back full for 90 days pursuant to our city council rules that we adopted.

1231
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,810
[SPEAKER_17]: I withdraw.

1232
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I withdraw section 22, Mr. President.

1233
01:38:27,932 --> 01:38:30,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor has withdrawn the motion.

1234
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:56,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, well, anyway, uh, this is a report and it says that the CPA community preservation, by the way, we're all for community preservation, but I'm definitely against the way the act carries it out.

1235
01:38:56,823 --> 01:38:57,764
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a number of things going.

1236
01:38:57,784 --> 01:39:09,550
[SPEAKER_20]: The report says here that the community preservation act has resulted in the transfer of tens of millions of dollars from residents of the state's poor cities and towns

1237
01:39:10,145 --> 01:39:17,571
[SPEAKER_20]: to its wealthiest communities, according to a new study published by Harvard University Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston.

1238
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:23,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, are you aware of that, that tens of millions of dollars have been transferred from the poorest cities and towns to the wealthiest?

1239
01:39:25,216 --> 01:39:27,138
[SPEAKER_20]: Was any council here aware of that?

1240
01:39:29,059 --> 01:39:29,659
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess not.

1241
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:29,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1242
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:32,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you did know that.

1243
01:39:32,241 --> 01:39:34,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Doctor, you can address your remarks to the chair, please.

1244
01:39:35,564 --> 01:39:36,565
[SPEAKER_20]: I beg your pardon, sir?

1245
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:39,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Please address your remarks to the chair.

1246
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:39,827
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, to the chair.

1247
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:56,237
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, then it goes on to say here that between 2001 and 2006, residents of Boston paid $11 million in fees that fund state matching grants to the CPA program.

1248
01:39:56,997 --> 01:40:00,639
[SPEAKER_20]: But the city did not receive any money from the program.

1249
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, this business of saying matching is really a half truth.

1250
01:40:04,702 --> 01:40:06,563
[SPEAKER_20]: The word matching really means to equal.

1251
01:40:07,304 --> 01:40:09,605
[SPEAKER_20]: And the state contribution does not equal

1252
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,056
[SPEAKER_20]: what the cities and towns are paying, and that's what's gonna happen to Medford.

1253
01:40:13,617 --> 01:40:16,899
[SPEAKER_20]: We are not gonna get an equal amount as to what we're contributing.

1254
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:31,109
[SPEAKER_20]: And it goes on to say, similarly, while residents of both Springfield and Worcester likely generated more than $3 million in CPA fees, by the way, the fees come from transactions on real estate, and they're constant for everybody.

1255
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:38,315
[SPEAKER_20]: But you might make that contribution, a city and town like Medford, but not get any money back at all.

1256
01:40:39,895 --> 01:40:47,717
[SPEAKER_20]: And so poor cities like Brockton, Lowell, and Lynn are estimated to have generated more than $2 million in fees.

1257
01:40:48,497 --> 01:40:51,478
[SPEAKER_20]: None of those communities received any of the state funds.

1258
01:40:52,018 --> 01:40:52,838
[SPEAKER_20]: So here's what we're doing.

1259
01:40:52,858 --> 01:40:58,400
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I urge the people of Medford to vote no on question two, because you're going to contribute money.

1260
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Your taxes are going to be increased.

1261
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:03,181
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a tax on a tax.

1262
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:07,962
[SPEAKER_20]: In contrast, now let's give you a contrast of a rich city like Cambridge.

1263
01:41:08,622 --> 01:41:18,526
[SPEAKER_20]: which generated an estimated $1.6 million in fees, it has received more than $27 million from the Commonwealth.

1264
01:41:18,826 --> 01:41:21,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, here's a city that gave only $1 million and got $27 million.

1265
01:41:23,348 --> 01:41:25,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Where is the matching in that?

1266
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:26,209
[SPEAKER_20]: Where is the equity in that?

1267
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:26,970
[SPEAKER_20]: There is none.

1268
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:31,011
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is the point I want to bring up.

1269
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:36,774
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, at the great debate, the proponents for

1270
01:41:39,854 --> 01:41:44,155
[SPEAKER_20]: The Community Preservation Act distributed these flyers.

1271
01:41:45,415 --> 01:41:51,457
[SPEAKER_20]: And the flyers distributed by the proponents of Chevalier on that night, that was the night of the mayor's debate.

1272
01:41:52,737 --> 01:41:56,218
[SPEAKER_20]: And the flyer is filled with half-truths.

1273
01:41:57,098 --> 01:42:00,279
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we are seeking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

1274
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:06,600
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, when you present a half-truth to the people, this is not giving them the truth at all.

1275
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,741
[SPEAKER_20]: The CPA, it says, imposes

1276
01:42:10,912 --> 01:42:17,394
[SPEAKER_20]: a 1.5% surtax after a $100,000 exemption on home assessment.

1277
01:42:18,234 --> 01:42:27,616
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that $100,000 exemption is just a come on to tell the people, hey, we're giving you something before we take the money from you.

1278
01:42:28,216 --> 01:42:30,977
[SPEAKER_20]: But actually, the 1.5%, and why did they select 1.5%?

1279
01:42:31,017 --> 01:42:34,738
[SPEAKER_20]: They could select anywhere from less than 1% to 3%.

1280
01:42:35,318 --> 01:42:35,618
[SPEAKER_20]: But that 1.5%

1281
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:44,311
[SPEAKER_20]: could be only 1% if there were no exemption.

1282
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:47,313
[SPEAKER_20]: So you could have no exemption at all, and we pay less.

1283
01:42:47,373 --> 01:42:51,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead of paying, say, $56 on average, we're paying only $46.

1284
01:42:51,255 --> 01:43:05,543
[SPEAKER_20]: The state's contribution to a match, therefore, is less than half true, because the state, in the year 2014, contributed only 31% of the match.

1285
01:43:06,243 --> 01:43:07,564
[SPEAKER_20]: So they don't match at all.

1286
01:43:10,715 --> 01:43:16,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Then it says the money is dedicated to parks, et cetera, and does not go into the general budget.

1287
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:22,058
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we all know that money is fungible, which means that it's exchangeable.

1288
01:43:22,078 --> 01:43:24,259
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what happens to our money in the budget.

1289
01:43:24,939 --> 01:43:32,101
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we have money which is really dedicated to the parks and to affordable housing, et cetera.

1290
01:43:32,841 --> 01:43:37,342
[SPEAKER_20]: But that money can be replaced by money from the budget

1291
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:41,711
[SPEAKER_20]: And the money from the, from the contribution will go into the budget.

1292
01:43:42,252 --> 01:43:43,132
[SPEAKER_20]: It is exchangeable.

1293
01:43:43,192 --> 01:43:44,472
[SPEAKER_20]: So even that's a half truth.

1294
01:43:44,532 --> 01:43:47,914
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have a budget already spending on those needs.

1295
01:43:48,174 --> 01:44:00,338
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know whether or not you remember as so, but when we presented the budget, there was money allocated already for these four topics.

1296
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:02,019
[SPEAKER_20]: So

1297
01:44:03,233 --> 01:44:06,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Then it goes on to say that the tax can be canceled in five years.

1298
01:44:07,395 --> 01:44:08,055
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true.

1299
01:44:09,315 --> 01:44:10,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Half of it is true.

1300
01:44:10,156 --> 01:44:19,559
[SPEAKER_20]: But the other half is that in order to reverse it, you have to do the reverse of the way it was put on the ballot.

1301
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:24,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is that you need 1,700 signatures again to put it on the ballot.

1302
01:44:25,662 --> 01:44:26,482
[SPEAKER_20]: And though 1.5% is the same,

1303
01:44:29,724 --> 01:44:32,845
[SPEAKER_20]: The total amount paid, by the way, each year will not be the same.

1304
01:44:32,865 --> 01:44:33,445
[SPEAKER_20]: It will not be $56.

1305
01:44:33,605 --> 01:44:37,946
[SPEAKER_20]: It will increase with the tax levy.

1306
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:42,468
[SPEAKER_20]: As the tax levy goes up, 1.5% of a higher tax levy is more than $56.

1307
01:44:42,588 --> 01:44:47,889
[SPEAKER_20]: It will go from $56 to $60, from $60 to $65, $65 to $70.

1308
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:51,430
[SPEAKER_20]: So that at the end of the five years, it will no longer be $56.

1309
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:54,511
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's another half-truth.

1310
01:44:54,571 --> 01:44:56,612
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not telling you the whole truth in that respect.

1311
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:09,003
[SPEAKER_20]: And now they all go on to say that CPA has been adopted by 158 communities, but 158 communities is not even half of the 351 communities.

1312
01:45:09,763 --> 01:45:13,324
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is after 15 years when it was enacted.

1313
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:18,105
[SPEAKER_20]: So that more than half of the communities are not enacting it.

1314
01:45:19,145 --> 01:45:26,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And they have good reason not to, because money will be transferred from their taxpayers and given to richer cities and towns.

1315
01:45:28,567 --> 01:45:32,768
[SPEAKER_20]: So they also says there are nine members on the City Community Preservation Committee.

1316
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:35,889
[SPEAKER_20]: This is our city committee.

1317
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:40,449
[SPEAKER_20]: And five of those, by the way, will be selected by the mayor.

1318
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:45,751
[SPEAKER_20]: So once again, the people who are paying the taxes have no say in how the money is distributed.

1319
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:50,392
[SPEAKER_20]: And four others are appointed by city ordinance, but approved by the city council.

1320
01:45:50,932 --> 01:45:54,432
[SPEAKER_20]: So the citizens do not determine where and how much money will be spent.

1321
01:45:55,413 --> 01:45:57,233
[SPEAKER_20]: The council must get final approval.

1322
01:45:58,915 --> 01:46:03,997
[SPEAKER_20]: So, the project is still controlled by the political... You have one more minute to speak, Doctor.

1323
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:05,378
[SPEAKER_20]: I beg your pardon?

1324
01:46:05,398 --> 01:46:07,139
[SPEAKER_14]: You have one more minute to speak.

1325
01:46:07,519 --> 01:46:08,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll end before that time.

1326
01:46:09,059 --> 01:46:12,521
[SPEAKER_20]: So, the project is still controlled by the political process.

1327
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:13,942
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not controlled by the people.

1328
01:46:14,002 --> 01:46:25,307
[SPEAKER_20]: The taxes are paid by the people, but they have no say in how this is passed on to open spaces, to parks, to affordable housing, et cetera.

1329
01:46:26,207 --> 01:46:27,508
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1330
01:46:27,808 --> 01:46:28,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1331
01:46:32,102 --> 01:46:34,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1332
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:36,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, I'm Bruce Kulik, 168 Grove Street.

1333
01:46:37,646 --> 01:46:45,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And initially we were told that we would not be able to campaign here for or against, but that seems to have been violated by many.

1334
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:50,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I am for the CPA.

1335
01:46:50,897 --> 01:46:56,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm one of the people who have helped to gather the signatures to get it onto the ballot, and I feel very passionately about it.

1336
01:46:58,333 --> 01:47:07,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, there have been a number of innuendos that really are not accurate, the biggest being the one talking about money being transferred.

1337
01:47:08,402 --> 01:47:24,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you have a problem with the money being transferred from poorer communities to the richer communities, that should be taken up at the state level, because it was set up to provide a general fund in which cities and towns that passed the CPA would actually receive these funds.

1338
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:31,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So those communities that aren't receiving any of these funds are communities that have not passed the CPA.

1339
01:47:32,252 --> 01:47:40,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So for us to receive money from this general fund in the state, and this is extra money that comes into Medford.

1340
01:47:40,216 --> 01:47:43,398
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not money that is on your tax bill.

1341
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:49,382
[SPEAKER_08]: This is money that we have already paid, and we're just sending it away because we don't have the CPA here.

1342
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:50,802
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very important.

1343
01:47:51,343 --> 01:47:55,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So the CPA is something that if we pass, we do get the matching funds.

1344
01:47:57,537 --> 01:47:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: The previous speaker was correct.

1345
01:47:59,257 --> 01:48:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2014, I'm sorry.

1346
01:48:03,339 --> 01:48:03,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1347
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:09,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have the floor or does Mr. Pranta have the floor?

1348
01:48:09,581 --> 01:48:10,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information.

1349
01:48:10,282 --> 01:48:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1350
01:48:10,622 --> 01:48:15,484
[SPEAKER_07]: When you talked about matching funds being matching, can you explain?

1351
01:48:15,884 --> 01:48:16,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speaking to that right now.

1352
01:48:17,285 --> 01:48:19,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking to that concern right now.

1353
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,606
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to talk about the percentages?

1354
01:48:21,986 --> 01:48:23,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speaking to that exactly right now.

1355
01:48:23,827 --> 01:48:24,327
[SPEAKER_07]: The percentage.

1356
01:48:24,528 --> 01:48:24,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1357
01:48:26,549 --> 01:48:28,854
[SPEAKER_08]: What I was saying is that in 2014, the state match was 31%.

1358
01:48:29,015 --> 01:48:29,837
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2013, it was 52%.

1359
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,831
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know exactly what that amount is.

1360
01:48:38,411 --> 01:48:39,411
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely true.

1361
01:48:39,872 --> 01:48:42,072
[SPEAKER_08]: In future years, the percentage could be less.

1362
01:48:43,013 --> 01:48:51,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I did recently read, however, in the Boston Globe that there is a move afoot to provide additional funding into the CPA at the state level.

1363
01:48:51,396 --> 01:48:52,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a great idea.

1364
01:48:53,076 --> 01:48:54,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know whether that's going to happen.

1365
01:48:54,957 --> 01:49:00,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But nonetheless, what will happen is we will not get any of that money if we do not have the CPA.

1366
01:49:01,779 --> 01:49:07,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It was disclosed at the meeting that we had, and I don't know if you were there or not, at a Committee of the Whole meeting this year, and the state has already acknowledged it's 18%.

1367
01:49:07,882 --> 01:49:10,683
[SPEAKER_07]: It went from 31% down to 18%.

1368
01:49:11,263 --> 01:49:13,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's providing that they can balance the budget for this year.

1369
01:49:14,324 --> 01:49:15,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's 18% coming back.

1370
01:49:16,605 --> 01:49:22,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city will be paying, the taxpayers will be paying, if they vote for this, 1.5% on that.

1371
01:49:22,627 --> 01:49:24,188
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a complete match.

1372
01:49:24,268 --> 01:49:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only going to get 18% back.

1373
01:49:26,428 --> 01:49:28,009
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what needs to be clarified.

1374
01:49:28,481 --> 01:49:31,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for that point of information, Councilor Penta.

1375
01:49:32,223 --> 01:49:33,203
[SPEAKER_08]: You may continue, sir.

1376
01:49:33,683 --> 01:49:34,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly.

1377
01:49:34,343 --> 01:49:45,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm making an investment of some sort and my stockbroker tells me that I'm going to get 18 percent on that investment, I don't know about you, but I'm going to make that investment.

1378
01:49:46,808 --> 01:49:47,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Eighteen percent.

1379
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:49,570
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get that kind of return on anything now.

1380
01:49:51,932 --> 01:49:53,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we allow the man to speak, Councilor?

1381
01:49:53,473 --> 01:49:58,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that, but the fact of the matter is, I think it needs to be understood and clarified.

1382
01:49:58,874 --> 01:50:00,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not investing stocks here.

1383
01:50:00,975 --> 01:50:05,437
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about taxpayers' money, and this is not a complete match with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1384
01:50:05,457 --> 01:50:08,598
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it doesn't matter whether it's taxpayers' money or whether it's your own investment.

1385
01:50:08,738 --> 01:50:14,380
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at the arithmetic, you're putting a certain amount of money out there, and you're getting an 18% return on it.

1386
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:21,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that seems to me like that's the kind of thing exactly that we ought to be doing and embracing to see how we can get more money here.

1387
01:50:21,835 --> 01:50:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's other factors here that need to be clarified, because in addition to claiming that this is against the communities that are not so wealthy, it's because these other communities have had the wherewithal to pass the Community Preservation Act.

1388
01:50:37,161 --> 01:50:40,442
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they're reaping the benefits more quickly than we are.

1389
01:50:41,102 --> 01:50:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple items that really need to be pointed out here, and let me just look at my notes to say.

1390
01:50:49,186 --> 01:50:56,512
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a mention about infrastructure and it was implied that the infrastructure would go to things like fixing potholes or streets or that sort of thing.

1391
01:50:57,133 --> 01:51:01,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But in fact, there's a strong limit to what the CPA funds will permit.

1392
01:51:02,137 --> 01:51:10,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We have historic preservation and kind of ironic how one of the concerns was the bathrooms at the library.

1393
01:51:11,815 --> 01:51:14,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my recollection that that building is a historic building.

1394
01:51:14,536 --> 01:51:23,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you might not think of it as historic because it doesn't have fantastic architecture, but, you know, it's an artifact of the 60s or whenever it was built.

1395
01:51:24,393 --> 01:51:25,614
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a historic building.

1396
01:51:25,834 --> 01:51:26,835
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be restored.

1397
01:51:27,256 --> 01:51:30,198
[SPEAKER_08]: That could include making those bathrooms fully accessible.

1398
01:51:30,579 --> 01:51:32,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It could include many things in that regard.

1399
01:51:33,001 --> 01:51:37,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of ironic that people are saying, well, maybe we should put the money towards that.

1400
01:51:37,385 --> 01:51:40,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here is an avenue that will put the money towards that.

1401
01:51:41,328 --> 01:51:45,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly, the police station, maybe that's not quite so historic.

1402
01:51:45,632 --> 01:51:50,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably, in order to get that built, it would need to be raised and rebuilt.

1403
01:51:51,477 --> 01:51:52,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that ought to be done.

1404
01:51:52,538 --> 01:51:54,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that our police station currently is a disgrace.

1405
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:03,085
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we put money towards that, then we're not going to have any money to go to the items that are earmarked by the CPA.

1406
01:52:03,545 --> 01:52:07,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So other people were saying we have alternatives, a tax cut.

1407
01:52:08,128 --> 01:52:10,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that'll sure give us the money that we need.

1408
01:52:11,331 --> 01:52:11,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And jobs?

1409
01:52:12,852 --> 01:52:15,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it'd be great if we can encourage people to have jobs.

1410
01:52:17,211 --> 01:52:22,340
[SPEAKER_08]: the earmark on the money has to go to the items that are on the CPA.

1411
01:52:23,902 --> 01:52:25,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, there was a comment made that

1412
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:30,885
[SPEAKER_08]: If your property is worth a lot of money, you're going to end up paying a lot more.

1413
01:52:30,945 --> 01:52:32,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1414
01:52:32,626 --> 01:52:34,727
[SPEAKER_08]: That's generally how property taxes work.

1415
01:52:35,367 --> 01:52:42,691
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're making a lot more money, if your property is worth a lot more money, then people are going to have to pay more money on the commercial end.

1416
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:47,473
[SPEAKER_08]: But the biggest impact people are concerned about is residences.

1417
01:52:48,154 --> 01:52:51,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a couple things that I do want to point out here.

1418
01:52:52,856 --> 01:52:54,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, for example,

1419
01:52:55,637 --> 01:53:05,540
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to the $100,000 initial exemption from your property, there are exemptions for low income and for low and moderate income seniors.

1420
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:14,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I took a look at the numbers that are low income and low and moderate income for seniors, and I was kind of shocked by that.

1421
01:53:14,963 --> 01:53:21,424
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, these are not numbers that if you were in the middle of Kansas, people would say are low or low and moderate income.

1422
01:53:22,485 --> 01:53:23,105
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking here.

1423
01:53:23,632 --> 01:53:29,696
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, if you've got a household size of one, and you're a senior, which incidentally is 60 plus.

1424
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:35,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not gonna figure out who is 60 plus behind the rail here.

1425
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be shortly, but not yet.

1426
01:53:39,681 --> 01:53:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: In any event, 68,950, that's almost $69,000 a year.

1427
01:53:48,573 --> 01:53:49,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's income.

1428
01:53:49,573 --> 01:53:51,394
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not include net worth.

1429
01:53:51,754 --> 01:53:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not include your investments.

1430
01:53:55,315 --> 01:53:57,756
[SPEAKER_08]: $69,000 for a household size of one for a senior.

1431
01:53:58,357 --> 01:54:02,638
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to have a household size of two, that's $78,800, nearly $79,000.

1432
01:54:03,498 --> 01:54:12,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can apply then to have an abatement, significant abatement, on the CPA for that matter.

1433
01:54:12,782 --> 01:54:15,143
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we can say pretty easily that

1434
01:54:16,607 --> 01:54:24,794
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a senior and you have low or moderate income, you're not going to be paying, and it's not going to be costing you anything with regard to the CPA.

1435
01:54:25,455 --> 01:54:34,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly, the low income maximum, well, those numbers are lower, of course, but there's still $55,000 for a household of one, $55,000.

1436
01:54:35,084 --> 01:54:40,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's considered to be the low income maximum if you're making underneath that.

1437
01:54:41,857 --> 01:54:46,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do these numbers, and we came up with some averages of what people will be paying.

1438
01:54:47,201 --> 01:54:49,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll recite them again, because I think these are accurate.

1439
01:54:50,183 --> 01:54:55,366
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first year, and you're right, as your property taxes go up, the amount's going to go up.

1440
01:54:55,386 --> 01:54:56,827
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be paying that.

1441
01:54:57,367 --> 01:54:58,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Costs are going up.

1442
01:54:58,508 --> 01:55:06,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most people think that's only reasonable, that as costs go up, you should expect to be paying more taxes as a result.

1443
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:08,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So if your assessed value is $300,000 on your property,

1444
01:55:11,258 --> 01:55:14,079
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to have an approximate income of $35.

1445
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know, what is that?

1446
01:55:17,461 --> 01:55:23,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Three cases of beer, a couple bottles of decent wine, go out to dinner at McDonald's.

1447
01:55:23,063 --> 01:55:24,764
[SPEAKER_08]: $400,000, $53 a year.

1448
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:24,764
$500,000, $70.

1449
01:55:24,824 --> 01:55:25,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, it is going to go up.

1450
01:55:25,904 --> 01:55:29,646
[SPEAKER_08]: The more your property is worth, the more you're going to end up having to pay.

1451
01:55:39,358 --> 01:55:42,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have just a few other points here regarding it.

1452
01:55:43,842 --> 01:55:52,229
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a talk about the excise tax, the other taxes, the so-called tax excuse that's not being used for any of these facilities.

1453
01:55:52,269 --> 01:55:54,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's partly because they've not been earmarked to it.

1454
01:55:54,991 --> 01:56:03,158
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have, I think the one area that we probably do a decent job of here in the city, we do have open space with recreation.

1455
01:56:03,618 --> 01:56:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: City council has earmarked money for that.

1456
01:56:06,262 --> 01:56:08,403
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's other areas that we could really use the money.

1457
01:56:08,824 --> 01:56:14,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you guys have trouble coming up with the money, figuring out where it is, approving the budgets, et cetera, to do that.

1458
01:56:15,147 --> 01:56:18,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Things like- Mr. Citizen, you have one more moment.

1459
01:56:18,189 --> 01:56:18,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1460
01:56:18,929 --> 01:56:19,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

1461
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:22,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Things like paths along the Mystic River.

1462
01:56:23,132 --> 01:56:28,015
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something which is developing a lot of momentum right now and could be funded through this.

1463
01:56:28,675 --> 01:56:29,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Things like the Royal House.

1464
01:56:30,676 --> 01:56:33,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the churches around here, I've been told, need new roofs.

1465
01:56:33,918 --> 01:56:38,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are probably historic buildings, and those are the kinds of things they could apply.

1466
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:56,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to bring it back again, once the committees, which consist of five people that are not directly appointed by the mayor, they are mandated to be with particular commissions that the city already has, and then the other four, optionally, can be selected by ordinance.

1467
01:56:57,132 --> 01:56:58,933
[SPEAKER_08]: that you folks will be presenting.

1468
01:56:59,033 --> 01:57:03,917
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be coming up with the ordinance that has who is on that committee.

1469
01:57:04,398 --> 01:57:10,822
[SPEAKER_08]: That committee only makes recommendations that then need to come back to the city council, just like any other appropriation does.

1470
01:57:11,403 --> 01:57:13,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So the mechanism is really the same.

1471
01:57:13,865 --> 01:57:15,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a way of funding specific things.

1472
01:57:15,886 --> 01:57:19,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something which I think the city of Medford should really consider and vote yes on.

1473
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:20,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1474
01:57:26,230 --> 01:57:26,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1475
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:28,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record again.

1476
01:57:29,392 --> 01:57:30,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1477
01:57:30,592 --> 01:57:31,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to make it quick.

1478
01:57:31,973 --> 01:57:37,616
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is a value of the city, then let's do a whole two and a half override for it.

1479
01:57:38,016 --> 01:57:46,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having a special fund that we have less control over, put it in the general fund and have a committee or a party that advocates for this.

1480
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:49,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it makes it, it makes it.

1481
01:57:49,522 --> 01:57:50,382
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, it doesn't.

1482
01:57:50,762 --> 01:57:53,704
[SPEAKER_00]: But just put it in the general fund so that it's all above board.

1483
01:57:54,537 --> 01:57:55,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying it's not above board.

1484
01:57:55,818 --> 01:57:56,979
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded incorrect.

1485
01:57:57,019 --> 01:57:57,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded bad.

1486
01:57:58,039 --> 01:58:01,581
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a specific issue.

1487
01:58:02,021 --> 01:58:03,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a smaller group of people.

1488
01:58:04,242 --> 01:58:07,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just say, do a 2 and 1 half override.

1489
01:58:07,965 --> 01:58:13,648
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's that popular and the whole community wants it, then it'll get done under a 2 and 1 half override.

1490
01:58:13,688 --> 01:58:14,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1491
01:58:14,728 --> 01:58:15,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chief.

1492
01:58:16,789 --> 01:58:17,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1493
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:19,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1494
01:58:19,471 --> 01:58:19,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

1495
01:58:19,891 --> 01:58:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Villione.

1496
01:58:22,372 --> 01:58:23,273
[SPEAKER_02]: 59 Garfield Avenue.

1497
01:58:24,429 --> 01:58:25,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford, Massachusetts.

1498
01:58:26,109 --> 01:58:27,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, City Council.

1499
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:31,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I met the people from the CPA outside a couple of weeks ago.

1500
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:32,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very nice.

1501
01:58:33,471 --> 01:58:38,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But an election means you, the voter, get to evaluate what's on the ballot.

1502
01:58:40,252 --> 01:58:41,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to be told what to do.

1503
01:58:42,172 --> 01:58:43,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to evaluate it.

1504
01:58:43,913 --> 01:58:51,614
[SPEAKER_02]: In a perfect world where people get data without having to file public records requests, we would know where the water and sewer money goes.

1505
01:58:52,801 --> 01:58:57,724
[SPEAKER_02]: public access money goes, where the free money account, where the money is, and the general fund.

1506
01:58:58,584 --> 01:59:10,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think, given the past history, we should have another tax thrown at us, because it sounds great, CPA sounds wonderful, but I don't even know where my access money is.

1507
01:59:11,071 --> 01:59:13,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just don't want to throw more money to the wind.

1508
01:59:13,413 --> 01:59:13,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1509
01:59:25,461 --> 01:59:25,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1510
01:59:26,061 --> 01:59:28,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1511
01:59:28,682 --> 01:59:31,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Name is Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Avenue.

1512
01:59:33,064 --> 01:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like we're talking about tax and tax and tax.

1513
01:59:37,766 --> 01:59:46,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody stop and realize that these, we have a lot of old folks in the city that can't afford even a 1% tax increase.

1514
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:50,375
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get a cost of living increase every year.

1515
01:59:51,355 --> 01:59:52,636
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on Social Security.

1516
01:59:52,916 --> 01:59:54,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fixed income.

1517
01:59:55,197 --> 01:59:55,918
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they going to eat?

1518
01:59:56,018 --> 01:59:56,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog food?

1519
01:59:56,598 --> 01:59:57,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Cat food?

1520
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what the government's pushing for them to do?

1521
02:00:01,781 --> 02:00:03,722
[SPEAKER_06]: These people can't afford a tax increase.

1522
02:00:04,702 --> 02:00:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fixed income.

1523
02:00:06,063 --> 02:00:07,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get a raise every year.

1524
02:00:10,045 --> 02:00:12,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we beating them until we drive them out of their homes?

1525
02:00:14,047 --> 02:00:14,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we're doing?

1526
02:00:16,915 --> 02:00:18,496
[SPEAKER_06]: We ought to be ashamed of ourselves.

1527
02:00:19,477 --> 02:00:20,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Raising the taxes.

1528
02:00:21,939 --> 02:00:24,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Senior citizens shouldn't have to pay taxes.

1529
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones that made this country what it is.

1530
02:00:28,943 --> 02:00:30,064
[SPEAKER_06]: They fought in the wars.

1531
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:36,769
[SPEAKER_06]: They busted their hump building the railroads and everything else, and now we're taxing them out of their homes.

1532
02:00:39,611 --> 02:00:42,533
[SPEAKER_06]: They're eating substandard food because they can't afford good food.

1533
02:00:44,474 --> 02:00:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to hit them with another tax.

1534
02:00:47,006 --> 02:00:49,508
[SPEAKER_06]: How far can we push you until we push you out of your house?

1535
02:00:50,389 --> 02:00:51,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't afford it.

1536
02:00:52,892 --> 02:00:58,217
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them are going to make a decision, either pay their taxes or pay for that prescription at the drugstore.

1537
02:01:00,259 --> 02:01:02,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like these pharmaceutical companies are killing them.

1538
02:01:04,183 --> 02:01:06,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Pills and everything else is going up by 400%.

1539
02:01:08,567 --> 02:01:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's our government to stop this price gouging?

1540
02:01:14,383 --> 02:01:16,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, we're talking about taxes.

1541
02:01:16,064 --> 02:01:17,645
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to drive them right out of their homes.

1542
02:01:17,665 --> 02:01:22,587
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be homeless, like the rest of them in Boston when they closed Long Island.

1543
02:01:24,568 --> 02:01:28,470
[SPEAKER_06]: They took all those Vietnam vets and threw them out, and they were out there in the streets.

1544
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:30,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your service.

1545
02:01:31,431 --> 02:01:32,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

1546
02:01:32,292 --> 02:01:33,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Go live in the street.

1547
02:01:34,873 --> 02:01:35,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Panhandle.

1548
02:01:36,754 --> 02:01:38,695
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where all these old people are going to end up.

1549
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:42,251
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to stop this.

1550
02:01:42,271 --> 02:01:45,913
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to start looking out for your senior citizens that built this country.

1551
02:01:47,915 --> 02:01:48,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1552
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:50,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1553
02:01:53,959 --> 02:01:54,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Doctor?

1554
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:56,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1555
02:01:56,901 --> 02:02:04,266
[SPEAKER_20]: I merely want to clarify what the former speaker said about commissions and said they were not appointed by the mayor.

1556
02:02:04,306 --> 02:02:10,670
[SPEAKER_20]: But all of our commissions, you can correct me if I'm not speaking correctly myself,

1557
02:02:11,485 --> 02:02:13,566
[SPEAKER_20]: All of our commissions have been appointed by the mayor.

1558
02:02:19,229 --> 02:02:20,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce Kulik, 168 Grove Street.

1559
02:02:21,189 --> 02:02:27,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And to the gentleman who just spoke, I did say that the appointments were not directly by the mayor.

1560
02:02:28,313 --> 02:02:30,534
[SPEAKER_08]: The commissions themselves vote amongst their members.

1561
02:02:31,874 --> 02:02:39,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do believe that the members would have been appointed by the mayor, but it is not a direct appointment to the CPA commission.

1562
02:02:39,478 --> 02:02:39,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally,

1563
02:02:41,363 --> 02:02:42,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to reiterate here.

1564
02:02:43,564 --> 02:02:43,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do.

1565
02:02:44,225 --> 02:02:56,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I pointed out that there are exemptions for the CPA to precisely address the gentleman who was concerned about our seniors and veterans and so forth being thrown out on the street.

1566
02:02:57,072 --> 02:03:02,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's not what's going to happen as a result of passing the CPA.

1567
02:03:04,757 --> 02:03:10,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, if the household size is one, a senior who is 60 or older

1568
02:03:11,753 --> 02:03:16,876
[SPEAKER_08]: who is making under 68, 950 can file for an exemption.

1569
02:03:18,277 --> 02:03:21,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do have to take a little bit of action, they need to file for the exemption.

1570
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:32,226
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not a low income person who is living on Social Security alone who is then going to have to pay this additional 1.5 surtax.

1571
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:38,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And the number goes up, as I said, with a household size of four, you're up to almost $100,000.

1572
02:03:39,302 --> 02:03:40,002
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 98,500.

1573
02:03:40,842 --> 02:03:48,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And frankly, I don't consider 98,500 to be really much of a low income.

1574
02:03:48,425 --> 02:03:51,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about you folks, but maybe I'm living in a different world.

1575
02:03:52,546 --> 02:04:00,189
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to clarify those and reiterate those numbers so that people knew that this was not going to throw seniors out into the street as a result.

1576
02:04:00,309 --> 02:04:00,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1577
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:02,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1578
02:04:03,003 --> 02:04:05,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, please state your name and address again for the record.

1579
02:04:05,725 --> 02:04:07,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1580
02:04:07,647 --> 02:04:08,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:04:08,788 --> 02:04:09,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll be very brief.

1582
02:04:11,070 --> 02:04:28,166
[SPEAKER_24]: These tax increases from the CPA, and again, it's up to the people to decide on it one way or the other, but these tax increases are going to result in the very people that Mr. Kulicka talking about having to pay higher for goods and services.

1583
02:04:29,704 --> 02:04:30,925
[SPEAKER_24]: not rocket science.

1584
02:04:31,225 --> 02:04:34,927
[SPEAKER_24]: At least one of the Councilors behind here, two own their own businesses.

1585
02:04:35,307 --> 02:04:40,291
[SPEAKER_24]: As costs go up in one area, they have to be made up in another area.

1586
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:47,995
[SPEAKER_24]: So a local of shop XYZ, who owns a $30 million property, is now paying $5,700 more.

1587
02:04:48,315 --> 02:04:51,357
[SPEAKER_24]: The very people that this is designed to help, it's going to hurt.

1588
02:04:52,098 --> 02:04:52,558
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to hurt.

1589
02:04:52,959 --> 02:05:01,310
[SPEAKER_24]: because they're going to now be paying more for goods and services, or the four or five people that work in the back have now become three or four and jobs are going to be lost.

1590
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:09,421
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I advocated tax cuts as an incentive to bring businesses in here and create jobs and to bring

1591
02:05:09,868 --> 02:05:23,761
[SPEAKER_24]: price of goods down, because when there's more businesses, there's more competition, and competition brings down prices for the very people the gentleman from Garfield Abbey was talking about that are suffering, the fixed-income people.

1592
02:05:24,181 --> 02:05:27,424
[SPEAKER_24]: We really need to consider this one way or the other.

1593
02:05:27,724 --> 02:05:32,328
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, it's up to the people on Election Day next Tuesday, one week to go.

1594
02:05:33,269 --> 02:05:33,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1595
02:05:37,604 --> 02:05:38,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1596
02:05:38,185 --> 02:05:39,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1597
02:05:40,867 --> 02:05:42,849
[SPEAKER_14]: You're the husband of the teacher of the year.

1598
02:05:43,469 --> 02:05:43,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1599
02:05:43,930 --> 02:05:44,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to speak for her.

1600
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:46,092
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a master's degree.

1601
02:05:46,192 --> 02:05:46,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

1602
02:05:47,693 --> 02:05:50,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someday she can come up and get some sort of certificate.

1603
02:05:50,355 --> 02:05:51,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very kind of you.

1604
02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:52,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penton.

1605
02:05:52,637 --> 02:05:53,558
[SPEAKER_04]: No one expected that.

1606
02:05:53,598 --> 02:05:54,039
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know.

1607
02:05:54,439 --> 02:05:54,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.

1608
02:05:56,181 --> 02:06:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Andrew Paul Castagnetti, 23 Cushing street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1609
02:06:02,967 --> 02:06:04,168
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, I'd like to say,

1610
02:06:06,801 --> 02:06:11,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Mr. Starrella appreciates his right to speak under the First Amendment.

1611
02:06:11,483 --> 02:06:12,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1612
02:06:16,006 --> 02:06:20,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make this very brief, less than two and a half minutes.

1613
02:06:30,273 --> 02:06:32,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Camuso, can you hang around?

1614
02:06:33,855 --> 02:06:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I wait?

1615
02:06:36,757 --> 02:06:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he can't wait.

1616
02:06:39,719 --> 02:06:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a vote for Nixon myself, but I waited.

1617
02:06:42,681 --> 02:06:58,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to sound like a Republican, but what, another real estate tax?

1618
02:07:00,935 --> 02:07:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: This CPA, the 1.5% solution, the real estate tax, sounds like,

1619
02:07:07,045 --> 02:07:11,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it looks like a tax, smells like a tax, then it must be another tax.

1620
02:07:13,028 --> 02:07:17,231
[SPEAKER_04]: In effect, this is an override of Proposition 2 1⁄2.

1621
02:07:22,254 --> 02:07:24,915
[SPEAKER_04]: This is still to do with real estate taxes.

1622
02:07:27,717 --> 02:07:33,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying for years to get our Method homeowners a $400 a year on average

1623
02:07:35,698 --> 02:07:48,000
[SPEAKER_04]: real estate tax savings unsuccessfully through the Massachusetts law titled owner-occupied real estate tax exemption, as they do in Malden, Everett, and Somerville.

1624
02:07:49,080 --> 02:08:04,283
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, I even wrote a letter in the method transcript published on October 15, 2015, asking for all politicians to respond in writing to the method transcript asking whether

1625
02:08:04,693 --> 02:08:09,636
[SPEAKER_04]: They are for or against this 20% real estate tax exemption.

1626
02:08:12,478 --> 02:08:23,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Thus far, as we speak tonight, October 27th, the only response was verbal from Councilor Penta and we thank him.

1627
02:08:25,465 --> 02:08:32,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, my question, this question was titled when I submitted it to the

1628
02:08:34,187 --> 02:08:38,950
[SPEAKER_04]: the debate committee, October, the day before the deadline, mind you.

1629
02:08:39,811 --> 02:08:41,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was titled, Please Answer My Question.

1630
02:08:42,352 --> 02:08:45,234
[SPEAKER_04]: It should have been asked after great debate, but it was not.

1631
02:08:49,177 --> 02:09:02,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll get all the 18 replies in this Thursday's method transcript, hopefully before the next election and a week from tonight.

1632
02:09:05,575 --> 02:09:05,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1633
02:09:06,595 --> 02:09:07,576
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can I say?

1634
02:09:07,876 --> 02:09:14,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you would like to take this opportunity to communicate your responses now.

1635
02:09:15,879 --> 02:09:16,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1636
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:21,701
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would like, Councilor Dello Russo or any other Councilor.

1637
02:09:29,765 --> 02:09:33,106
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn to receive and place on file.

1638
02:09:33,146 --> 02:09:34,006
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

1639
02:09:34,287 --> 02:09:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your silence.

1640
02:09:35,545 --> 02:09:35,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1641
02:09:36,326 --> 02:09:37,226
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

1642
02:09:39,208 --> 02:09:52,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Under suspension offered by Councilors Camuso and Penta, be it resolved that the name of Frederick Lasky be sent to the upcoming committee of the whole for consideration of the city council appointment to the garden commission.

1643
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:54,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1644
02:09:55,542 --> 02:09:57,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1645
02:09:57,223 --> 02:09:59,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, as we're all aware,

1646
02:10:00,603 --> 02:10:14,050
[SPEAKER_16]: About a month, month and a half ago, I think it was, the city council, upon the recommendation of the mayor, enacted an ordinance to establish a new garden commission here in the city of Medford.

1647
02:10:14,991 --> 02:10:28,297
[SPEAKER_16]: As I did support that, and then it became law, and at this point the mayor has appointed his two individuals to become members or commissioners of the garden commission.

1648
02:10:30,634 --> 02:10:39,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Upon him appointing his people, Amanda Bowen, very, very active in the gardening club, reached out to city councilors.

1649
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:44,526
[SPEAKER_16]: And at this point, we have a committee of the whole in the upcoming weeks, I'm assuming?

1650
02:10:44,566 --> 02:10:44,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1651
02:10:45,627 --> 02:10:58,797
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, I would like to bring the name of Frederick Lasky forward with Councilor Penta for the commissioner that is appointed by the Medford City Council.

1652
02:11:00,243 --> 02:11:03,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Lasky has done an outstanding job down at Riverbend Park.

1653
02:11:05,347 --> 02:11:12,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Many a Saturday mornings when I'm down there for either soccer or T-ball with my son, we see Mr. Lasky in the garden.

1654
02:11:12,893 --> 02:11:15,795
[SPEAKER_16]: He does a great job.

1655
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:17,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I approached Mr. Lasky and asked him if he'd be interested.

1656
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:20,641
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think he'd be a wonderful addition.

1657
02:11:20,681 --> 02:11:22,382
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know his commitment to this community.

1658
02:11:22,822 --> 02:11:27,485
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not going to find anyone, uh, that's more well respected than, um, direct Alaska.

1659
02:11:27,865 --> 02:11:38,131
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, I would like to respectfully put his name, uh, before the subcommittee, um, sorry, before the committee of the whole for the city council appointment on the motion of council.

1660
02:11:38,311 --> 02:11:41,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So to move that name to the committee of the whole to consideration, I hope you'll, uh,

1661
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:49,973
[SPEAKER_14]: and join on Mr. Lasky that he should, according to custom, send to the Committee of the Whole a copy of his curriculum detail.

1662
02:11:50,714 --> 02:11:52,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much on that motion.

1663
02:11:52,254 --> 02:11:53,034
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1664
02:11:53,474 --> 02:11:56,095

1668
02:12:05,958 --> 02:12:06,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1669
02:12:07,519 --> 02:12:08,699
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1670
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:11,100
[SPEAKER_23]: Over the weekend, we were down

1671
02:12:11,928 --> 02:12:14,170
[SPEAKER_23]: on the Fells Way for the O'Brien brothers' dedication.

1672
02:12:14,811 --> 02:12:24,980
[SPEAKER_23]: While we were down there, it was brought to my attention that Michael Mobilio's sign, which had been there for some time, has all faded and weathered.

1673
02:12:25,501 --> 02:12:30,565
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could ask the DPW to replace that sign in memory of Michael, I would appreciate it.

1674
02:12:30,806 --> 02:12:32,707
[SPEAKER_23]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

[SPEAKER_14]: This is offered by Councilor Camuso.

1683
02:12:46,582 --> 02:12:57,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford Community, the Medford City Council congratulate Councilor Caraviello for being inducted as the president of the Medford Kiwanis.

1684
02:12:58,344 --> 02:13:03,746
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello is the first president of that organization to serve a second term.

1685
02:13:04,186 --> 02:13:05,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso.

1686
02:13:05,757 --> 02:13:06,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1687
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:12,079
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to congratulate the distinguished gentleman to my right.

1688
02:13:12,859 --> 02:13:13,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1689
02:13:13,299 --> 02:13:23,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello, this is the first time in the Medford-Kiwanis history that the same gentleman or lady was elected president for two times.

1690
02:13:24,541 --> 02:13:26,302
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to congratulate you.

1691
02:13:26,822 --> 02:13:27,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1692
02:13:27,242 --> 02:13:30,163
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also celebrated my 20th year at Kiwanis.

1693
02:13:32,215 --> 02:13:33,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's our 90th birthday.

1694
02:13:34,597 --> 02:13:38,620
[SPEAKER_15]: And as the council just stated, 20 years of the Kiwanis, it's your 90th birthday?

1695
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:42,503
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Kiwanis' 90th birthday this year also.

1696
02:13:42,663 --> 02:13:44,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it's the Kiwanis' 90th birthday.

1697
02:13:44,604 --> 02:13:48,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy birthday Medford Kiwanis and congratulations President Carafiello.

1698
02:13:48,427 --> 02:13:53,351
[SPEAKER_16]: And last but not least, I want to thank him and his committee for putting on a great Taste of Italy.

1699
02:13:53,371 --> 02:13:58,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Because as I stayed home with my son that evening, my wife had a fabulous time at the Taste of Italy.

1700
02:13:59,978 --> 02:14:00,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1701
02:14:00,338 --> 02:14:03,839
[SPEAKER_16]: With Adam and you and the rest of them, the rest of the councilors.

1702
02:14:03,939 --> 02:14:04,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1703
02:14:04,439 --> 02:14:06,759
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1704
02:14:08,059 --> 02:14:11,220
[SPEAKER_22]: So like to congratulate my colleague for being a two time.

1705
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:14,581
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1706
02:14:14,781 --> 02:14:16,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that, maybe that did come out right.

1707
02:14:16,281 --> 02:14:16,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

1708
02:14:17,221 --> 02:14:19,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1709
02:14:20,002 --> 02:14:22,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion for approval.

1710
02:14:22,162 --> 02:14:23,522
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

1711
02:14:23,922 --> 02:14:24,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

1712
02:14:24,582 --> 02:14:27,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, also offered by councilor Camuso.

1713
02:14:28,191 --> 02:14:34,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Albert C. Webb, who passed away recently.

1714
02:14:35,842 --> 02:14:40,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Webb is the father of Chris Webb and his wife, Sherry Cutler Webb.

1715
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:43,954
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could stand for a moment of silence, please.

1716
02:14:58,482 --> 02:15:09,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Solicitor provide an opinion as to whether the City has adopted Mass General Law, Chapter 60A, Section 9.

1717
02:15:10,027 --> 02:15:10,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1718
02:15:12,042 --> 02:15:13,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1719
02:15:13,363 --> 02:15:21,767
[SPEAKER_11]: This piece of legislation, Chapter 60A, Section 9, is relative to excise tax for National Guardsmen who are deployed out of state.

1720
02:15:22,027 --> 02:15:29,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And it provides a waiver to National Guardsmen whose vehicle sits in their driveway as they're overseas or out of state defending our country, Mr. President.

1721
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:32,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it would make sense for us to take a look into this issue.

1722
02:15:32,472 --> 02:15:39,155
[SPEAKER_11]: If the city hasn't adopted it and the solicitor comes back with that opinion, I will be moving for the council to support that initiative.

1723
02:15:40,026 --> 02:15:49,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it makes sense for us to provide servicemen and women who are deployed overseas defending our freedoms and liberties a tax incentive with their cassettes in their driveway, not driving up and down our roads, Mr. President.

1724
02:15:49,451 --> 02:15:56,254
[SPEAKER_11]: So I bring forward this resolution to get an opinion from the solicitor, and if we haven't adopted it at a later date, we can bring this matter up.

1725
02:15:56,975 --> 02:15:57,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1726
02:15:57,335 --> 02:15:58,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll motion with Councilor Knight.

1727
02:15:58,816 --> 02:15:59,476
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1728
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:01,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penter, I'm sorry.

1729
02:16:02,658 --> 02:16:04,559
[SPEAKER_14]: And Camuso wants to talk too.

1730
02:16:04,599 --> 02:16:05,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Not on this particular.

1731
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:06,980
[SPEAKER_16]: I do support this wholeheartedly.

1732
02:16:08,057 --> 02:16:08,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1733
02:16:08,577 --> 02:16:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Penta?

1734
02:16:09,418 --> 02:16:13,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you need to explain National Guardsmen because we have all kinds of branches of the service.

1735
02:16:14,062 --> 02:16:16,904
[SPEAKER_07]: These people that are in reserves, these active duty people or what?

1736
02:16:17,085 --> 02:16:18,285
[SPEAKER_07]: They would be reservists that are deployed.

1737
02:16:18,786 --> 02:16:19,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Say it again?

1738
02:16:19,266 --> 02:16:20,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Reservists that are deployed.

1739
02:16:24,351 --> 02:16:25,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't the National Guard all reservists?

1740
02:16:26,432 --> 02:16:28,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me?

1741
02:16:28,214 --> 02:16:28,994
[SPEAKER_16]: The National Guard.

1742
02:16:30,616 --> 02:16:32,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Active duty is not the National Guard.

1743
02:16:32,137 --> 02:16:35,480
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be the Army, Marines, the Air Force.

1744
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:37,971
[SPEAKER_14]: on the motion of approval.

1745
02:16:39,172 --> 02:16:39,932
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1746
02:16:39,952 --> 02:16:40,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1747
02:16:40,072 --> 02:16:41,393
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1748
02:16:42,234 --> 02:16:42,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Carries.

1749
02:16:42,574 --> 02:16:43,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

1750
02:16:44,035 --> 02:16:47,277
[SPEAKER_16]: The records of the- Mr. President- Councilor Tommaso.

1751
02:16:47,897 --> 02:16:53,081
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, I'd just like to say a few words before we close this evening.

1752
02:16:54,362 --> 02:17:02,567
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to wish everyone well next week as I'm sitting at home, watching TV, enjoying my next Tuesday evening.

1753
02:17:04,729 --> 02:17:05,970
[SPEAKER_16]: This has been a great election year.

1754
02:17:06,968 --> 02:17:10,070
[SPEAKER_16]: This, and I'm not gonna make it political at all, I'd just like to say a few words.

1755
02:17:10,710 --> 02:17:12,471
[SPEAKER_16]: This has been a fun election year.

1756
02:17:12,531 --> 02:17:15,852
[SPEAKER_16]: You look at it, there hasn't been an election for mayor in this community for 28 years.

1757
02:17:16,313 --> 02:17:21,235
[SPEAKER_16]: When Marilyn Perica and Michael McGlynn went head to head in an election.

1758
02:17:21,675 --> 02:17:32,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Next Tuesday, you have three races, and everyone should get out and vote, because it's your school committee, it's your city council, and it's your mayor.

1759
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:35,282
[SPEAKER_16]: This is unprecedented here in the city of Medford for 28 years.

1760
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:41,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are two candidates for the chief executive position in this community.

1761
02:17:41,701 --> 02:17:48,263
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to wish them two, as well as everyone else that's named, appears on the ballot next week, well in their endeavors.

1762
02:17:48,383 --> 02:17:50,703
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not going to miss it that much.

1763
02:17:51,183 --> 02:17:54,864
[SPEAKER_16]: So best of luck to all of you and the people at home that are on the ballot as well.

1764
02:17:55,524 --> 02:17:56,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, counsel.

1765
02:17:57,685 --> 02:17:58,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1766
02:17:58,745 --> 02:17:59,325
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll have.

1767
02:18:01,537 --> 02:18:06,442
[SPEAKER_14]: The records of the October 20th, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

1768
02:18:06,823 --> 02:18:10,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks, how would you find those records, please?

1769
02:18:10,706 --> 02:18:14,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Review the records, Mr. President, and I pay to be in order to move approval.
