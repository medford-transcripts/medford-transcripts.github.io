1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:08,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think be voting to adjourn a meeting, because you need a majority of the folks to adjourn.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:11,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I live on the train tracks.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the end of the meeting, people are tired.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:26,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, one of the things that has happened in open meeting law is that failures to properly adjourn a meeting, there's plenty of open meeting law violations around that.

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:35,453
[SPEAKER_04]: like whole town councils, the annual meetings, they have to come back together to vote to end the meetings, really dumb.

6
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:39,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanna make sure that the ending of the meeting is fully crystal clear.

7
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:55,566
[SPEAKER_04]: The only squishy thing here is that the beginning of the meeting, whoever's taking the role does have to have like a voting member, non-voting member on the piece of paper or the document they're doing.

8
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: so that they can make sure there's a quorum of voting members to begin the meeting.

9
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very doable.

10
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:06,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little more complicated than I think I'd imagined.

11
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have anything else other than this.

12
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,534
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's stuff people think needs to be added or changed, let me know.

13
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:44,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one thing, I was just looking through our approved resolution to see if it was in there that the placeholder that you have around communications being directed to the chair, and I did not find it there, so I don't, it must exist somewhere in the ether, but I think the answer there is, you know,

14
00:01:47,912 --> 00:02:12,561
[SPEAKER_01]: media requests for communication or comment regarding the SBC will be directed like via me so that the committee knows that if they get a press like request that if the request is about like speaking about what's happening on the committee that that should come to me so that I can work with the right people to make sure that that whatever we say is appropriate.

15
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also wondering whether I think public participation.

16
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like, I would personally like to see us adopt the same roles that we have for school committee around like

17
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:36,079
[SPEAKER_01]: you can speak one time on a matter for up to three minutes.

18
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some specific language there in our rules document.

19
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:53,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you all feel about that in terms of like, you know, I don't think we're gonna see a lot of public participation in this like phase, but I think at some point we will, you know, when we're making like feasibility decisions.

20
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious, like, can we sort of agree now, like what that looks like?

21
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just trying to pull up our rules document to grab.

22
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:03,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I already got it, John.

23
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:07,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have it.

24
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:08,960
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

25
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:14,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that has to be the answer, but I think it is actually already documented.

26
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:23,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should work from it and say that that's sort of what we're proposing.

27
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:33,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda.

28
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,535
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important because when we don't do that, we sort of bump into open meeting law issues.

29
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:43,198
[SPEAKER_01]: The chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak.

30
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,102
[SPEAKER_01]: The chair will announce the time limit prior to the public comment period at every meeting.

31
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:55,987
[SPEAKER_01]: The public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing or by email or by emailing them to the superintendent.

32
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:57,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I would maybe say the chair.

33
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:07,221
[SPEAKER_01]: written comments will be forwarded to all members of the school committee.

34
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:17,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm wondering, do we set up an auto forward situation?

35
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:20,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that we'll have a general email box.

36
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:30,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, again, and what we can do is set up like an auto forward so that if something is coming into that box, it is being distributed to everybody.

37
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:39,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So I changed the chair to actually be the SBC email.

38
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:41,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

39
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:45,528
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

40
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:09,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't think we need that last sentence.

41
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:10,399
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

42
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts about that from a public participation perspective?

43
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:24,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like it.

44
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:26,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I've read that language before, so.

45
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you want to take out email.

46
00:05:43,737 --> 00:05:45,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, or by mailing.

47
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that seems like if you were sending it via post.

48
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Where am I looking at?

49
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:56,184
[SPEAKER_03]: The public will also be required for your cursors.

50
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Writing either by email or by mailing.

51
00:05:58,965 --> 00:05:59,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

52
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:12,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, because I guess I guess what the school can be to be a mailing address or how do you three get if someone wants to mail?

53
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:19,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm fine with just email.

54
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

55
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:20,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

56
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, comments and writing by email to the SBC.

57
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay.

58
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll replace that with the name of the actual email address once we have one.

59
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:36,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would just say via auto forwarding.

60
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:01,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

61
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I muted?

62
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,379
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not muted.

63
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I go back to number three?

64
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

65
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:17,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And ask a non-elected official question.

66
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:18,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

67
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:46,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I have three elected officials, and Jenny, when you called, rolled, you say member, I noted at our meeting, we address superintendent, we address, obviously, out of decorum, Jenny as chair, mayor, what is the proper, what should members of the SBC be urged to address

68
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:50,596
[SPEAKER_03]: by the fellow members of the committee.

69
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have thoughts on that.

70
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, well, Robert's Rules of Order does say that.

71
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the most common mistakes about understanding Robert's Rules of Order is that literally all of the rules can just be changed on the fly by the chair.

72
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:21,319
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a set of rules of which can be completely thrown out the window at the blink of an eye, which, you know, if you haven't thrown them out the window, then we should be following them.

73
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:35,033
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, my personal opinions on this is that for subcommittees and, you know, I don't think we'll have committees at the whole kind of a thing for this particular, for the school building committee, but, you know,

74
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:43,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally prefer first names and just the collegiality that we'll have in a small group.

75
00:08:44,824 --> 00:09:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think in a large group, when there's no public present and we're not making a big decision, you know, we're working through documents and, you know, I just, I tend to prefer more collegial, you know, collegial is not the right word, but, you know.

76
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:03,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Informal.

77
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Informal, thank you.

78
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:10,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, you know, we are being recorded and broadcast.

79
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:27,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very much open to always using, you know, the proper, you know, member, all the party member team, you know, I mean, we don't, there's a lot of benefits to both in my opinion.

80
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:32,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sometimes depends on who the folks are.

81
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:35,608
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're actually, who is the rest of the committee?

82
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:46,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, like if we don't have any kind of significant personality conflicts in the school building committee, I'll just, I don't know how else to describe it.

83
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:54,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody gets along with everybody, nobody's interrupting anybody, you know, being less formal seems real easy.

84
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:59,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If the chair has to wrangle the group,

85
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:20,547
[SPEAKER_04]: on a regular basis, then that becomes more, it becomes less, you know, Paul, stop talking is much less, you know, doesn't sound great compared to, you know, remember or so your time is up or, and I feel like we don't know that stuff yet.

86
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all over the place, but that's just my thoughts.

87
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:41,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like that, I would propose that we write in here a rule that says like, we are residents and neighbors here in Medford.

88
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:54,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, we will address each other based like on a first name basis, unless otherwise requested by a member of the committee.

89
00:10:56,613 --> 00:11:00,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want me to call you Mr. Rousseau, I'm happy to do that.

90
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:04,317
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think my strong preference is people call me Jenny.

91
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:12,922
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all friends and neighbors here trying to work hard to get something done.

92
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:19,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want people to feel like they're a part of a team instead of part of a body of elected people.

93
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not, right?

94
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,227
[SPEAKER_01]: We're appointed.

95
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:30,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, that seems like, you know, maybe it'll work till it doesn't.

96
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,516
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know what you guys think of that.

97
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it works for me because it also then while we there is hierarchy in the committee, because obviously we have a chair, but it's for me, as you were just saying, where we're not elected, where have been appointed.

98
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:11,174
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the idea of trying to find trust amongst the committee seems to be on a more informal basis than a formality.

99
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:14,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my opinion.

100
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Tracy, I hate to ask you to repeat that.

101
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:20,156
[SPEAKER_04]: The train was going by and I disconnected.

102
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:43,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I was supporting what Jenny was saying, meaning that while we're not elected official and we are appointed, it seems like in order to establish a level of trust in the get-go, while there is hierarchy as we do have a chair, and there is obviously

103
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: non-voting members on the committee.

104
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me, and I love the way Jenny started out, we are residents and neighbors working on behalf of the committee to do this hard work.

105
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.

106
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:02,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron, how do you feel about that?

107
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:05,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I also agree.

108
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's going to be it is a long process and I think that the more that we I think feels equals as much as possible that allows for a certain sense of like.

109
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:34,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I think community strength, I think I prefer just because I think having certain titles for people is understandable and we want to show a certain amount of respect, but I also think that we want to operate as if we're one body and not where there's like a hierarchy where certain people's voices or votes are going to be have far more influence than another and others.

110
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,109
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, so I also agree.

111
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:45,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's better to try to be as impartial in our communication as possible while also being respectful to people's titles and things like that.

112
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:45,611
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

113
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great.

114
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, well, I think it was while Tracy was speaking, I realized there might be two exceptions I just wrote in there.

115
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you all think on that.

116
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's fine.

117
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,433
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't like that, they can tell us.

118
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct, right.

119
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:02,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

120
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:12,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy, the other question I had for you is like, I'm gonna make an assumption that you don't know what Robert's rules of order are.

121
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:15,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you do.

122
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:26,782
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what would be helpful here is to like, I don't know, like what are like the most important rules

123
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:35,873
[SPEAKER_01]: can we write them down so that people aren't like, where do I even find what that means to be able to agree to it?

124
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I think in my mind, giving them a cheat sheet is good, but even in words, to me, one rule is that voting happens,

125
00:14:57,415 --> 00:15:14,939
[SPEAKER_01]: on the committee when there is a motion to do something and a second and possibly debate on that subject.

126
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:25,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we maybe don't need to get into like, you know, if there's too many motions on the floor, you know, you gotta stop and like dispatch of things.

127
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think we need to go there.

128
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:41,327
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think saying like, when we have to take a vote, somebody makes a motion, somebody makes a second, we have conversation and then we vote.

129
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And under the open meeting law,

130
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:53,868
[SPEAKER_01]: voice votes are loud, which means everybody, when everybody is in person, right?

131
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:58,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can just say all those in favor, aye, all those opposed, no.

132
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:02,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as there's no question, that's fine.

133
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:05,517
[SPEAKER_01]: But

134
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,033
[SPEAKER_01]: at any time, any member can simply request a roll call vote.

135
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that's an important structure for people to understand.

136
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:21,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're going to not call 25 people, like a 25 person roll every single time.

137
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody feels strongly that they need to know where people stand, that that's a possibility.

138
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:50,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing about voting that I sort of am wondering about is like, do we call only voting members in the role or are we trying to like also record the sort of opinion of non-voting members?

139
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:54,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great question.

140
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:59,123
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as a non-voting member, I actually,

141
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:09,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't personally feel like I need to make my vote known how I would vote if I had been a voting member.

142
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:23,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the reason I don't feel that way is that when there is, as in the item just above it, when there's debate, I mean, it's pretty uncommon that people are going to be speaking on a topic and nobody knows how they actually were gonna vote.

143
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:38,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, in my mind, the role of the non-voting members is like, if I'm going to have any influence, it's going to be in what I have to say so that the voting members may choose to vote a different way or vote the way I want.

144
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:45,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really feel the need for us to record all the non-voting members' opinions.

145
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:51,252
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously, when we go to the full committee, there can be a different opinion.

146
00:17:55,593 --> 00:18:20,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, maybe another thing about motions that would be important to say is like any member may suggest an amendment to a motion and maybe we just say, and the chair will guide the group through the proper way to accept or reject that amendment.

147
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:35,424
[SPEAKER_01]: so that like, I don't need you all to know how to do that, but if that happens, I will handle it and we will like work through it and go from there.

148
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:47,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like looking through my trustee Roberts rules of order book here to see what else we're missing.

149
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how long it is.

150
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You're missing a lot, but that's because it's ridiculous.

151
00:18:54,918 --> 00:19:05,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, one other thing that I was just reading about is like, you know, there are typically like limits to like how often you can speak.

152
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:13,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So Robert's rule says you can speak twice on a topic for, well, where'd it go?

153
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:17,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

154
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:22,595
[SPEAKER_01]: You may speak and debate twice on any debatable motion.

155
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:28,081
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same day, each time you may speak for up to 10 minutes.

156
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,403
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what Robert's Rules of Order says.

157
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:44,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I would propose that we amend that to be commiserate with what we're allowing the public to do in an event that things are out of hand, right?

158
00:19:49,818 --> 00:20:15,044
[SPEAKER_01]: just so that people understand that like once we get to the point where like we'll have discussion and that's one thing once we get to the point where we're going to take a motion and vote like there is like diminishing there is sometimes sometimes diminishing return on like everybody talking exhaustively why they think the way they think when really like we just need to take the boat and let the boat go right so

159
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:24,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that becomes a problem when things are contentious, but maybe that's a good place to start.

160
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:37,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I put this one in here, Jenny G. It's actually something we frequently have even in school committee.

161
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:50,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, it's always new members that are confused by this, but once the voting has begun, there is no motions allowed, no amendments, no conversation of any sort.

162
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:56,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can vote no and then, you know,

163
00:20:56,527 --> 00:21:05,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Then talk about it or make a different motion, but it's just a constant problem even with a small group of seven so I do worry about a large group.

164
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:09,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, being like I got one more thing after we started to take the role.

165
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:25,101
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that Robert's Rules of Order talks a lot about is like how to reconsider something if you feel like the group has made a mistake.

166
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, do we maybe just put something in there?

167
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:42,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if a member of the committee believes a mistake was made and would like to discuss a completed motion further,

168
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:50,570
[SPEAKER_01]: they simply need to alert the chair and the chair will like assist through that process.

169
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:53,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

170
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

171
00:21:56,576 --> 00:22:05,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, except I do think it's important to include the most important caveat there is the only members that may actually do that are those that voted for the thing.

172
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:08,842
[SPEAKER_04]: No, in the winning thing.

173
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So if a motion was on the floor and it passes, the only members that may in fact redo this are those that voted for it.

174
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:23,047
[SPEAKER_04]: If it fails, the only members that may do that are the members that voted for it against it.

175
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:29,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's a fair and important point because otherwise you're just going to recycle.

176
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

177
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:51,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we have any, um, like when it comes to like meeting, meeting minutes and like accurate minutes being taken, you know, these are all going to be recorded and we'd understand that.

178
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: But have we decided if we're going to, like how we're going to go about having them running down, like who's going to be doing that?

179
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:06,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are required to publish and approve minutes for every meeting.

180
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:17,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is still some conversation happening about who will be responsible for that.

181
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:26,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something I need to get with the superintendent on to make sure that we have an answer to that.

182
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:51,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing that we might want to mention is like, if we're going to take the agenda out of order, that we need to make an official motion to suspend the rules and take the agenda out of order.

183
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:57,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really because that's a choice that we're making that

184
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:02,363
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts like how the public can participate in that conversation.

185
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:13,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were wait, if you knew that it was like the last agenda item, and we took it first, like you may miss it completely and not be able to talk about the things that you wanted to talk about.

186
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think when it comes to making sure that we're appropriately hearing from the public, we want to make sure that we're

187
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:29,920
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we just want to make sure that we are not doing that haphazardly, let's put it that way.

188
00:24:48,769 --> 00:25:01,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I've reached the end of my Roberts Rules of Order book, and I feel like if we can like work through these, we're probably gonna be okay most of the time.

189
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:05,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that, Paul?

190
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:07,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I do agree with that, yes.

191
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:12,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I say one too many times, these are living documents.

192
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,420
[SPEAKER_04]: We literally can change them on the fly in our meeting with a majority vote.

193
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect is not a thing.

194
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:26,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say that.

195
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question of the three of you?

196
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

197
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:34,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Often in my role as chair of nonprofit organizations,

198
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:45,456
[SPEAKER_03]: have my, the secretary put a lot of the items that are non-controversial on a consent agenda and we vote the consent agenda all at once.

199
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that typically happens in school committee or open meeting laws, et cetera?

200
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:58,143
[SPEAKER_03]: As you were talking about agenda and voting, that just popped in my head, Jenny.

201
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:00,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do that.

202
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:09,732
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that with certain items, usually like the minutes and things like that.

203
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:31,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we need to just say something like the chair will create an agenda and may elect to use a consent agenda to approve non-controversial items in an effort to ensure the meeting moves along.

204
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that we should move that number five, that we should move that up.

205
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:17,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe number six, because those are like, if you only take a couple things away, those are good things to take away and maybe put them right after number two.

206
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what else are we missing?

207
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:02,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than one page, but still seems pretty brief.

208
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:03,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

209
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:09,405
[SPEAKER_04]: The school committee rules can be bound in a book.

210
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:17,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

211
00:28:18,105 --> 00:28:18,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?

212
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,466
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come back if there is something else that we forget.

213
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:40,110
[SPEAKER_01]: The other topic for us to talk about that we haven't talked about yet is like, if we are thinking about the committee, what kind of onboarding activities and information do we want to make sure the committee has at their disposal?

214
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

215
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:56,532
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to, you know, the three things I put on the agenda are tours, exemplar documents, and any additional training that people feel like they need, and anything else.

216
00:28:56,632 --> 00:29:02,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some questions that I had more to think through.

217
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had like less of an answer about that.

218
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:14,055
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that is like maybe worth talking about as a group here as well.

219
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:38,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I thought about this and, you know, one of the things that I struggle with a bit is, well, first of all, we're sort of onboarding as we go right now.

220
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody is a current member.

221
00:29:42,602 --> 00:30:08,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, we might be able to just like, I'm sure we have a list of things we could say we should have on that list, but it feels more like it should be just a living document as we like, somebody, as we are doing meetings and we're like, oh, you know, if somebody knew, if somebody was just thinking and paying attention to like, a new person coming in today without this information, they're coming in in a month, I should say, without this information,

222
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they really need it.

223
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the onboarding of like, this is our set of rules that we just approved.

224
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, you know, this is the chair.

225
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,541
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the superintendent.

226
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:21,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's everybody's names.

227
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our email addresses.

228
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:30,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are basic things for a checklist, which I think we should draft, of course.

229
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But then

230
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:40,349
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about making sure that they're effective and then they could be coming in in year four of this project for crying out loud.

231
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel like that needs to be a living document.

232
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:57,733
[SPEAKER_04]: When we finish all of eligibility and somebody starts two months into the next phase, we may wanna like flush things off that list rather than saying, here's your 7,000 pages to read now that you're a new member.

233
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:02,474
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my thoughts.

234
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:13,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you thinking that we can, we would put that checklist right in here?

235
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:16,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you thinking like we're going to assign somebody to do that and bring it back?

236
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't, um, I would rather just refer to it from here and have it be someplace else.

237
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:34,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, cause I mean, you know, who would maintain it?

238
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

239
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:46,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We certainly can start one now and have a list of, you know, the things that are going to stay the same throughout the entire process.

240
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:57,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Payroll, you know, like the kind of thing you did if you were joining a company, then you sit at your new desk and you have no idea what ends up, even though you've got your account now.

241
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:07,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

242
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:20,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess me, I guess the chair, right?

243
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:22,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

244
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:23,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but, but.

245
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:24,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like that.

246
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:25,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can, you know,

247
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:47,299
[SPEAKER_04]: meet as needed when we realize, hey, you know, this is no longer what the current list looks like.

248
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.

249
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:09,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it seemed like one of the first things we need to do is what we did last week is have an onboarding of open meeting laws.

250
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:10,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

251
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:12,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

252
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:17,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see my?

253
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can.

254
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,780
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know when I do that.

255
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have OML.

256
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Roberts.

257
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just going to say that.

258
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,588
[SPEAKER_04]: SPC rules.

259
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

260
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Issue an email address.

261
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:39,916
[SPEAKER_04]: SBA process overview.

262
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Issue email address.

263
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Add to distribution list.

264
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:53,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny, you know the deal.

265
00:33:54,457 --> 00:34:15,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny, going back to MSBA process overview, the posting that you shared on Facebook or wherever you laid it out, where we are, it seems a good history lesson of how we got to this point now, and that might be part of that overview.

266
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, agree.

267
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:24,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, you know, at some point soon, we'll have a website where all of this stuff can live.

268
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:33,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really could be just a matter of somebody from this team, like sitting and onboarding somebody and like walking them through those steps, right?

269
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's all there, it gets pretty easy to be able to do that.

270
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:39,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

271
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:40,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

272
00:34:48,271 --> 00:35:05,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about a press release every time we add a new member.

273
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hopefully that doesn't happen often, but I do think.

274
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:10,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think we really want to do that.

275
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,973
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some like big changes, but.

276
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:27,107
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that part of my onboarding for staff at my job, I work at Harvard, and Harvard is known for acronyms.

277
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:46,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder, in school committee world, are there acronyms that we need to make sure that everyone knows about, or understands, or an acronym cheat sheet, or something like that, so when people are using short term

278
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,291
[SPEAKER_03]: in reference to something people know what they're actually talking about.

279
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, absolutely.

280
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:13,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that,

281
00:36:15,899 --> 00:36:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking about coming from this meeting and going to the full membership, I think my preference is that we actually, this is what we send them.

282
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:30,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that the checklist isn't, they don't approve the checklist.

283
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:41,079
[SPEAKER_04]: We want their feedback if they have ideas for more things, but it should just be such a living document that just changes on the fly as anybody and everybody thinks, oh, well, what about that?

284
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than it being a policy that we have to vote on.

285
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with that.

286
00:36:49,415 --> 00:37:04,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can certainly also, you know, if we're not gonna vote on this one, I'm not gonna vote obviously, but like, if this is not something we're sending to them for approval, then I can work on this list and making it look like something useful offline.

287
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if we have anything else to add to this thing.

288
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:18,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

289
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:19,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything else.

290
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:22,155
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you all think?

291
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:28,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the brevity, personally.

292
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,241
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too much to wrap your head around.

293
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:39,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we take the chair may limit to two minutes?

294
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:41,688
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the public comment.

295
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to keep that.

296
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:43,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the public comment.

297
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the members thing.

298
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's down below.

299
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

300
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:50,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

301
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:50,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You scrolled up.

302
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:54,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, up, down, whatever it is.

303
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:55,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five.

304
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:56,525
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think.

305
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:58,165
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

306
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,587
[SPEAKER_03]: F. Is that what you're talking about?

307
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

308
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:02,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

309
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:03,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that was it.

310
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:04,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, right.

311
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:04,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

312
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:09,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

313
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we've got something good here.

314
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:13,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I will

315
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:17,877
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even though I assume that we all will make a vote emotion and vote for this.

316
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:24,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go through real quick and just even after the meeting and just make sure we don't have any typos or anything.

317
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:25,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

318
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.

319
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:31,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we do we have any thoughts about.

320
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:40,870
[SPEAKER_01]: exemplar documents or districts that we think people should pay attention to?

321
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:56,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a question we can ask the whole group, but I don't want the list to be so big and so long that it's like, I don't have time to sort of go through and find all those documents for all those folks, but it might make some sense for us to make

322
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:03,542
[SPEAKER_01]: connections with like Arlington, for example, they're like in the thick of their program.

323
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:14,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe even like Arlington, Somerville, Stoneham, Winchester, I don't know.

324
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:20,916
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty, has done a pretty good job, I think, at keeping their like website, for example, really up to date, I think really detailed.

325
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:22,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Stoneham you said?

326
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:23,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Belmont.

327
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:25,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Belmont, okay.

328
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

329
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:30,353
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time, sorry.

330
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:31,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoneham.

331
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:33,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Arlington.

332
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:35,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Arlington.

333
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:37,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Somerville.

334
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:43,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting as I looked around, I have very little time left.

335
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:43,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Winchester.

336
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:44,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Winchester.

337
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the appeal of Winchester, they've been done for a bit.

338
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:50,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

339
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:52,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But they,

340
00:39:55,405 --> 00:40:00,106
[SPEAKER_01]: started, I think, with something that looked like Medford High, so sort of interesting.

341
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:03,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looked better before.

342
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:09,509
[SPEAKER_01]: But like they, you know, they renovated in place, I guess, as it were, so.

343
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah, they did.

344
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:20,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other question is, is there a Volk district that

345
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:23,432
[SPEAKER_01]: is succeeding.

346
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:29,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the places that are having some trouble right now.

347
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:36,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a VOC district in the area that is sort of succeeding through the process that might be interesting?

348
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

349
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was.

350
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:47,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we just write vocational question and we can open that up to conversation.

351
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Mohawk, did they do one?

352
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:55,973
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not it though.

353
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

354
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, members of the committee may have some other ideas, but it would be nice for us to like, go off and, you know, identify who these districts are and sort of accumulate some links to like their relevant documents and that kind of thing.

355
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:19,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

356
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:21,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

357
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:37,869
[SPEAKER_03]: When you list any vocational schools, are there any other schools like Curtis Tufts that we want to be, that has integrated there into a high school?

358
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville.

359
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:40,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville did, okay.

360
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:41,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

361
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:52,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my subcommittee on that will be reviewing that, I forget, is it next week maybe, the week after?

362
00:41:52,091 --> 00:42:01,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they did do that and, I don't know, I have too many meetings, I can't find it.

363
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not tomorrow, I hope, no.

364
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:10,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is also a question as a non-school committee.

365
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:35,042
[SPEAKER_03]: not necessarily on-boarding but I guess as you list these exemplar school committee building committees are there other areas in the school committee psyche that non people that are you know are there are there places to go in terms of reading making sure you're

366
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: following them on Facebook or something like that, that to be in the know of what's happening across the district or in Massachusetts in terms of school committee related issues that pertain to buildings?

367
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So MSBA has a Facebook page.

368
00:42:56,221 --> 00:43:03,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could like list that and we could also

369
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

370
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:07,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

371
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:08,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

372
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

373
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

374
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:10,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

375
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:11,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

376
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

377
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

378
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:13,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

379
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:14,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

380
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

381
00:43:16,183 --> 00:43:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

382
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:20,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

383
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

384
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

385
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:23,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

386
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:24,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

387
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

388
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

389
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

390
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

391
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:28,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

392
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:29,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

393
00:43:29,592 --> 00:43:30,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

394
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:31,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point.

395
00:43:31,273 --> 00:43:32,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point.

396
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:33,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point.

397
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:36,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I do wish they were a little stricter once you weren't a school committee member, but that's.

398
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:45,457
[SPEAKER_01]: had some former school committee members wreaking havoc but um yeah okay.

399
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:51,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those would be like the two big things and then certainly like if there's something that seems relevant, we can share.

400
00:43:54,798 --> 00:44:04,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of school committee, Jenny, you will let this committee know, A, obviously, if something is coming before the school committee.

401
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But are there times when you think it'll be worthwhile that some members or all the committee is present or has some showing at a school committee meeting?

402
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:20,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

403
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:28,645
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of do our best to let you know when there's topics that are relevant.

404
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:39,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's one, you know, I think on the 20th, we'll have a meeting where we'll be talking about, the school committee will be talking about potential expansion of vocational programming.

405
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:47,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be of interest for people to listen in on, albeit not required for you to be there.

406
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:58,303
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there probably are some big gate style meetings that folks who are able to join would be helpful.

407
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:00,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can certainly let people know that.

408
00:45:04,464 --> 00:45:05,185
[SPEAKER_01]: as it happens.

409
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:11,614
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say attendance is not mandatory to those things.

410
00:45:47,504 --> 00:45:48,044
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

411
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:01,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we done an hour in advance?

412
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:14,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, going back to the onboarding should we make any reference to cadence some meetings or or how often giving people the meeting schedule that probably be really helpful.

413
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:16,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

414
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:25,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

415
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:33,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the actual act of deciding, I mean, of selecting an additional member is not going to be in here.

416
00:46:33,653 --> 00:46:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's also not going to be, there's not going to be one path.

417
00:46:40,155 --> 00:46:44,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Jenny spoke about it in our last meeting.

418
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:50,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that is all left to the chair via the resolution.

419
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:51,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

420
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:53,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, like if we lose,

421
00:46:55,868 --> 00:47:08,352
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some kind of specific kind of engineer, and we have another specific, that same kind of engineer in the queue of people who applied, then, you know, the chair will probably want to replace them with that person.

422
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:13,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to formulate, be formulaic about that stuff.

423
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:15,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so.

424
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:26,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously that, you know, when the chair's asking somebody if they want to take a seat, you know, the meeting schedule will be important so that they can stay with the meetings.

425
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:28,154
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

426
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:30,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

427
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:46,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not a voting member, but I'll just, I mean, actually there's two school committee members here.

428
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:48,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to tell you all how to make a motion.

429
00:47:50,509 --> 00:48:04,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a motion to approve these rules and onboarding checklist to the SBC?

430
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:05,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

431
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:08,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a second?

432
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded by Member Olapade.

433
00:48:14,337 --> 00:48:15,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So roll call.

435

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, Aaron.

437
00:48:23,662 --> 00:48:25,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my, Tracy Keene.

438
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be a hard habit to break, Jenny.

439
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:30,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

440
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:32,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

441
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:35,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny and myself, Jenny Graham, yes.

442
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:38,533

443
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:41,795
[SPEAKER_01]: We will report this out to the full committee next week.

444
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:44,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

445
00:48:45,978 --> 00:48:46,398
