[SPEAKER_12]: This is for community development and planning.

5
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:55,703
[SPEAKER_12]: The action plan contains the proposed use of community development block grant funds for the program year, which extends from July 1st, 2024 through June 30th, 2025.

6
00:00:57,044 --> 00:00:58,724
[SPEAKER_12]: CDBG is a program of the U.S.

7
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:01,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Department of Housing and Urban Development that began in 1974.

8
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:06,747
[SPEAKER_12]: Fiscal 2025 will be the city of Medford's program year 50 of CDBG funding.

9
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:08,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy 50th birthday to CDBG.

10
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And Councilor Collins has joined us as well.

11
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,111
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, I will turn over to our CDBG manager,

12
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:17,428
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll see.

13
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, we're presenting the figures for the coming year and the proposed use of funds.

16
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:31,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, we actually got the final figures a couple of hours ago from HUD.

17
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:32,998
[SPEAKER_03]: They were expected to come out tomorrow.

18
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:37,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the figures in the plan that I had provided you were estimated funds.

19
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,623
[SPEAKER_03]: But the actual allocation for us, fortunately, is a little bit higher than the original estimate.

20
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So the total actual allocation that we're going to get is $1 million

21
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:48,387
[SPEAKER_03]: $384,050 from HUD.

22
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:58,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So our cut for this year, it's still a reduction from the present year, but it's only a 2.8 reduction versus the 12% that we had been anticipating.

23
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:06,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Just if I could ask, do you know what that's going to bring us to for the public services funding?

24
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:07,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

25
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:13,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had projected $187,922 for public services, and the actual will be $207,607.50.

26
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an increase of $19,685.50.

27
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:16,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

28
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

29
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else you want to say before we hear from some of our applicants?

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,671
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

31
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've, yeah, we've invited our applicants to participate tonight.

32
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:37,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to start with Megan Fidler-Carey from the schools to talk about their afterschool program.

33
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

34
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,742
[SPEAKER_12]: We recognize Megan Fidler-Carey.

35
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:41,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Megan.

36
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:43,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, thank you, thank you, Laurel.

37
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the opportunity.

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,826
[SPEAKER_11]: As always, we've been the fortunate recipient of this grant for several years and we put it to very good use in my opinion.

39
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:58,330
[SPEAKER_11]: My title is the Director of Family and Community Engagement for Medford Public Schools.

40
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the departments I oversee is the before and after school program.

41
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:05,155
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a tuition funded program.

42
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:10,800
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not provide free before and after school care for families, but we do provide

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,341
[SPEAKER_11]: the care and we do offer financial assistance to families who need it.

44
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:26,343
[SPEAKER_11]: So we use the income verification forms that are provided through the CDBG application process and we determine need based on that.

45
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:32,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that, families can get up to 70% discount on their before or after school tuition.

46
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:44,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So we use these funds, we request the full amount of the $10,000, which I understand, you know, has been depends on how much the state gives us or the federal gives us.

47
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:56,466
[SPEAKER_11]: But we request $10,000 to contribute towards our scholarship program, which this year and last year is upwards of $45,000 in financial assistance that we have been able to give to families.

48
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:04,068
[SPEAKER_11]: because we realize that like many families won't be able to keep their job if they can't afford child care.

49
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:08,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to make sure that as many families in the Medford Public Schools have access as possible.

50
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:16,312
[SPEAKER_11]: The afterschool programs are in the four elementary schools and we offer every family the opportunity to apply for financial assistance.

51
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:22,894
[SPEAKER_11]: We just give a blanket application along with when we request their, you know, emergency contact details, for example.

52
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:24,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a really

53
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:32,420
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really, it's a private way to talk to families about their need, addressing their need.

54
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:42,106
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also offer it if we, if families kind of confide in us that they're having financial struggles in any way, we remind them that financial assistance is available.

55
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:45,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're really grateful to CDBG that this funding exists.

56
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And we think that's a great way to use it.

57
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:51,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Megan.

58
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions for Megan, for members of the council?

59
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:03,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, we will go to our next applicant, which is the Welcome Project.

60
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Sarah Lodgen, if you could give us a summary of your request.

61
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, hi, thank you for having me.

62
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the director of multilingual programs at the welcome project.

63
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:29,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a nonprofit organization that's been operating since 1987 in Somerville, but we work with immigrant populations in Medford and other cities around really anybody who can make it to us and have been doing so.

64
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:35,013
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of education and advocacy work for the last 40 something years, 30 something years.

65
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:39,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're requesting CBG funding for the 1st time from Medford.

66
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:49,197
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been receiving funding from Somerville for several years, but with changing demographics of where immigrants are living in our area, we have seen a really.

67
00:05:49,777 --> 00:06:00,824
[SPEAKER_10]: sharp uptick in the amount of constituents of ours that are living in medford now as opposed to somerville which was more typical in the past so this funding would specifically be for.

68
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:11,650
[SPEAKER_10]: English for speakers of other languages program called the english for parents program or pp we've actually been running this for the last seven years in somerville but we expanded into medford

69
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:30,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a year and a half ago, and have been running this program in collaboration with Medford public schools, although we haven't received funding from the schools or the city before, which is why we're here requesting that the English for parents program is specifically designed for immigrant parents with children in Medford public schools of any age.

70
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:37,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's an English for Speakers of Other Languages program, as I said, so they learn English in two different classes.

71
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,398
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a morning class and an evening class.

72
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:48,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're learning English with a focus on helping them navigate the school system and understand who to go to if their child needs help academically or socially or

73
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:59,229
[SPEAKER_10]: if there's like any issue that comes up and they might not understand like how the school system works and how to best really support their child through their children's education.

74
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:09,797
[SPEAKER_10]: So this does a lot to kind of teach about the public school system as well as teaching English to parents, which also then in turn will help their children as

75
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:24,049
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, studies show that parents who are more involved in child's education, which you're more able to do when you speak English at a higher level and understand the school system, that means that, you know, children are typically more successful with fewer dropout rates when they're older as well.

76
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:32,136
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's really our goal to have immigrant parents in Medford really take more of an active role in their child's

77
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,118
[SPEAKER_10]: educational development and have the skills to be able to do that.

78
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I mentioned, we've been running the program for the last year and a half.

79
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:46,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And our previous funding, which was from a private foundation, has run its course of like a three year grant that we had.

80
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're hoping to be able to continue the program.

81
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:53,670
[SPEAKER_10]: We've enrolled about 75 immigrant parents as students each semester.

82
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're really having a pretty large reach in this.

83
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's that's pretty much it.

84
00:07:59,194 --> 00:07:59,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

85
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:02,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

86
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any questions for the applicant from the Welcome Project?

87
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:12,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, Laurel, I do have a question.

88
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:18,758
[SPEAKER_12]: For the folks who did not receive, who requested money but were not recommended, are we expecting them to make a case for themselves?

89
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,482
[SPEAKER_03]: They were invited to participate if they wanted to, but I don't believe that we have anybody attending from those organizations right now.

90
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:26,123
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, great.

91
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have anyone from Community Family?

92
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have Stacy.

93
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:31,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

94
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll recognize Stacey.

95
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:36,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Stacey, welcome.

96
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:42,047
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could tell us a little bit about your application request for CDBG funds for the community family.

97
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, good evening, councilors and city officials.

98
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for all your previous support.

99
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,833
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am the brand new executive director of community family.

100
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:58,077
[SPEAKER_15]: We operate the state's first dementia certified center in Medford.

101
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:01,300
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an adult day health center for older adults.

102
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:12,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Not specifically all older adults, because as sadly to report, there are some younger folks that are showing early onset dementia or cognitive abilities.

103
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:18,371
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're very appreciative of the CDBG funding because it allows us to gap

104
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:33,377
[SPEAKER_15]: the start dates for folks that may not have long-term care insurance policies, may not be eligible for MassHealth, and we use the funding to provide scholarships for folks to start in our Medford Center.

105
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,538
[SPEAKER_15]: It's located at 121 Washington Street.

106
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you're familiar with the old train station.

107
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,042
[SPEAKER_15]: community family has been in business since 1978.

108
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,044
[SPEAKER_15]: We purchased it from the city.

109
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:53,331
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have to tell you, we operate a great program and it's nice to see that we're able to take care of Medford's older citizens.

110
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:57,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I welcome you to come visit us anytime and check out the facility.

111
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just appreciate this offer.

112
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

113
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

114
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions for community family?

115
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Stacey, I just wanted to say thank you.

116
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:19,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, as a Medford public school student, volunteer in community service at the Buddy Cohalen Center and Alzheimer's has affected my family.

117
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,946
[SPEAKER_12]: So really appreciate it.

118
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:23,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

119
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:24,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

120
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:25,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

121
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:27,449
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

122
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Next, we will go to Megan Transport, LLC.

123
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:34,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Right behind you, Laurel.

124
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,370
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, I can just grab the mic.

125
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I can sit right here.

126
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:42,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I was raised in Medford, live in Medford.

141
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Our business is based in Medford.

142
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:19,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So really, McGinn Transport likes to, or we strive to work to serve our community.

143
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:35,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are here today trying to request an extension of these grants that we've been receiving in order to support senior transportation needs in Medford.

144
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:46,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Every single person currently registered for our service is low to medium income, so 100% of our participants are ridership.

145
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:49,244
[SPEAKER_09]: 75% of them are low or very low income.

146
00:11:51,269 --> 00:12:00,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Our program fulfills the objectives of CDBG, especially in three ways, improved access to health care, enhanced food security and financial relief.

147
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:05,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Many low income seniors struggle to access medical care due to transportation barriers.

148
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:12,843
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times, you know, it's like a last minute, like a last minute MRI and they need to go in the next two days and they don't have

149
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:16,704
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't book a transportation service that might take a week or two to book.

150
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really demand responsive.

151
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:23,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Non-emergency demand responsive is our most important core.

152
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:32,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we also provide our second most important issue that we're tackling is providing

153
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:51,711
[SPEAKER_09]: affordable and nutritious food options to our seniors by traveling with the seniors to Market Basket or certain areas that they prefer to buy groceries from because it will make their dollar stretch farther.

154
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:57,595
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are applying this grant to extend what we've been working on.

155
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:04,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been hearing such a positive feedback from our community, both through Pam Kelly at the Senior Center,

156
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,100
[SPEAKER_09]: through our friends at the Medford Housing Authority.

157
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone is very excited and really thankful for our program.

158
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:18,042
[SPEAKER_09]: It really has done a lot to support the seniors of our community.

159
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:24,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for supporting us in the past, and we look forward to working together in the future.

160
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:25,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

161
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:26,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

162
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

163
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:27,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?

164
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry, Vice President Collins.

165
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for being here.

166
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:43,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I always appreciate hearing the rundown of the services that you provide in the community for our excellent partners at the Council on Aging and the MIJ.

167
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that this funding would mostly go towards supporting your existing services through the first quarter of FY25.

168
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering... The first quarter, you said?

169
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:59,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just that the CDBG funding would enable continued service through the first quarter of FY25, or would it be year-round?

170
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:23,293
[SPEAKER_09]: well because of the limited funding um we were speaking to laurel about this and we're also uh justin Councilor justin's not in person here today but we have a transportation brainstorming group with laurel and alicia um to try to see how we can continue to fund projects like this in the future but as of right now we do know that we

171
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:27,196
[SPEAKER_09]: we don't have, we won't have full access to the money that we requested.

172
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:34,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We are trying to see how we can supplement that, you know, so it can fulfill us through the end of or, you know, July 2025.

173
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:42,012
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at different avenues right now with Alicia and Laurel and our transportation brainstorming group.

174
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:49,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but we want to fund this as, you know, as long as we can, because every appointment is just so important.

175
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, every meeting that we take our seniors to, it's all like necessary.

176
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,398
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all essential stuff.

177
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,439
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like, I'm going to go see my friend or something.

178
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,440
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all really need this transportation.

179
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And they always tell us like, you know, I would have skipped this really important MRI or CT scan.

180
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:08,324
[SPEAKER_09]: If I didn't have anyone to take me, I just kind of ignore it.

181
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:13,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're looking to use whatever funds we can get to try to fund this for as long as possible.

182
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:17,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And then supplement, we're looking at more stuff to supplement it through the second half of the year.

183
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you, that's helpful.

184
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:26,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that a lot of minds in this room, including Councilor Tsenghap and working on those ongoing conversations about kind of filling out the transit network.

185
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, yeah.

186
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:37,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of reimagining for the Councilors who don't know, we've been talking about reimagining what transportation in Medford is going to look like past this year, especially since CDBG funding is

187
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,492
[SPEAKER_09]: slowly dwindling and it is, you know, federal funding, so that tends to happen.

188
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:55,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been in the talks, so we're hoping to maintain this program for as long as we can and looking at different creative ways to problem-solve the financial kind of, you know, funding at that end of it.

189
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:56,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

190
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

191
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we're eager to support that extension.

192
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

193
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:03,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

194
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:05,563
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

195
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:07,324
[SPEAKER_12]: We will go to our next

196
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:16,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Applicant the Medford Council on Aging will go to Pam Kelly and give us a description of your request, please.

197
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, everybody.

198
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Council on Aging is looking to extend the CDBG grant again this year for many programs that we offer that are not funded through other financial means.

199
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,787
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, we have a handy person maintenance program.

200
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:45,830
[SPEAKER_07]: The gentleman goes out to people's homes who need to be able to stay in their homes with safety.

201
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,731
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, changing light bulbs,

202
00:16:50,431 --> 00:17:01,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Also changing out any smoke detectors, batteries, tightening handrails, helping with doors, anything that's going to make their life easier while they're staying in home.

203
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So the handy person is only covered under the CDBG grant.

204
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:16,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, recreational transportation, which allows us to offer discounted trips, day trips for our seniors to have social events.

205
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:25,330
[SPEAKER_07]: If we didn't have this funding, we wouldn't be able to offer our day trips at a discounted rate for many of our Medford seniors.

206
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:31,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Our social worker has been able to have an extended time working with us.

207
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:40,522
[SPEAKER_07]: She is part-time and this fund helps her to outreach to more homebound Medford seniors so she's able to get to them.

208
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,337
[SPEAKER_07]: for those who cannot come to our office.

209
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:59,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And as well as our Mystic Valley Elder Services Title III match, that grant affords many Medford senior population with Meals on Wheels, with in-home care, and other funding services.

210
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:10,939
[SPEAKER_07]: This match through the CDBG and our municipal grant, not grant, our municipal budget is quite a help for us to keep that service going.

211
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:27,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, our volunteer outreach coordinator does many things each and every month, so this provides her with an additional funding to keep her part-time salary going as well.

212
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We look to

213
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:34,814
[SPEAKER_07]: continue reaching out to the demographics.

214
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:41,719
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, we have a very large senior population with over 12,766 seniors.

215
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: So this just helps us continue with what we do at the Council on Aging.

216
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Director Kelly.

217
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:55,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions for Director Kelly and the Council on Aging?

218
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, thank you, Pam.

219
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:08,249
[SPEAKER_12]: We will go next to Mystic Valley YMCA, Mystic Community Market.

220
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Debbie Amaral available.

221
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:12,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Wonderful.

222
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:13,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Debbie.

223
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.

224
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:20,859
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, thank you for all your support that you've given to us in many different ways.

225
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry for my lighting at my house.

226
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,146
[SPEAKER_06]: but I truly appreciate all of you.

227
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:36,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Our CDBG is being used to support operations at the Mystic Community Market located at 291 Mystic Ave.

228
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:45,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have been serving from Medford through CDBG 5,000 individuals.

229
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the low,

230
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And moderate very low, low and moderate income individuals but that's not all Medford individuals if people are aren't confirmed I don't want to share income.

231
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even more individuals from Medford that we do serve.

232
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,322
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's still more to be served.

233
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:15,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Recent data shows that one in five individuals in Medford is, are food insecure and so that there's much more to be done.

234
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:22,685
[SPEAKER_06]: We also, we presently deliver to about 80 seniors or homebound individuals.

235
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:23,646
[SPEAKER_06]: We

236
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:37,169
[SPEAKER_06]: bring food twice a week, twice a month to the senior center and includes proteins and fresh vegetables and the seniors pack bags there and distribute for us.

237
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:38,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Pam.

238
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:45,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We also will offer Lyft rides and Uber rides to individuals who can't get a ride to come to us.

239
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:52,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people don't realize that we have that service available, but especially at the high school,

240
00:20:54,221 --> 00:21:06,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We find it easier for people who don't have a ride for their family, sometimes to do that rather than trying to carry their bags on public transportation so we can make that available.

241
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:16,116
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also have the in-person shopping that the person can come in and pick what they need.

242
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:34,961
[SPEAKER_06]: We also support the food policy council for the city of Medford, not only through the resiliency hub funds that the city has, but we've also written for the local food council grant through the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture.

243
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:39,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been trying to support food security work throughout Medford.

244
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to do that.

245
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:42,946
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very proud of the work we do.

246
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And we thank the city for the support.

247
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:53,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're always looking for how we can do more and make sure that services are available to all Medford residents.

248
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:57,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Debbie.

249
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:02,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions for our Mystic Valley YMCA Mystic Community Market applicant?

250
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:10,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, next we'll go to SCM Community Transportation.

251
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:13,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have John Keegan here in person.

252
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:15,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

253
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, folks.

254
00:22:17,456 --> 00:22:18,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm John Keegan.

255
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:22,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the executive director at SCM, aka door-to-door.

256
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:32,564
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been providing senior transportation for just over 40 years, primarily to medical appointments and also food shopping.

257
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We're grateful to have our friends at McGann.

258
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, the demographic is increasing.

259
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: We could never serve everybody that needs support out there.

260
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:52,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Also to Laurel and Alicia for the group that's recently come together to talk about the future of transportation.

261
00:22:52,295 --> 00:23:01,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a conversation that we have to have and to look for ways to collaborate, to do whatever we can to figure a way to deal with that.

262
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:07,605
[SPEAKER_08]: We provide approximately 3,000 rides per year.

263
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:13,990
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a couple other things, adult day health programs, put those on under CDBG.

264
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,031
[SPEAKER_08]: We mostly serve seniors.

265
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:26,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We also serve some folks with disabilities, sometimes both, a mix of things.

266
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:38,716
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a free service, although I never know how long I can maintain that concept, but we've been able to do it for quite a long time, so we keep our fingers crossed.

267
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:43,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else did I want to tell you about?

268
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:59,106
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of shopping, we sort of divide the city up into quadrants, and we take people from different quadrants on different days to different shopping locations.

269
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:05,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We make sure we hit Market Basket and a couple other places that people want to go.

270
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:13,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Our drivers help people with five bags, and we try to keep them to five bags.

271
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,532
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not always possible.

272
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:20,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a service that people really appreciate.

273
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:28,617
[SPEAKER_08]: As you all know, the ability to get to medical appointments and to get food are just key to people having a decent

274
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:35,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Seniors in particular having a good quality of life allows them to participate more in the community.

275
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:41,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So we sort of see ourselves as having that as an ancillary benefit of what we do.

276
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,293
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't think that we just drive the clunky vans around and get people places.

277
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,958
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been doing it, I think I said, for 40 years.

278
00:24:52,618 --> 00:25:00,264
[SPEAKER_08]: The M in SCM means MedFed, so we were originally formed by the three cities back in 1983.

279
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:09,350
[SPEAKER_08]: They came together to say we need to do more for senior transportation, and that's how SCM was formed.

280
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:13,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll stop there and see if you want to ask more questions.

281
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:15,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you so much.

282
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:18,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any questions for SCM Transportation?

283
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:27,874
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, okay, seeing none, we will go next to the West Bedford Community Center.

284
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:33,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I'm not currently seeing anybody from them online.

285
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can move on to the others and see if perhaps they join.

286
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:39,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

287
00:25:39,158 --> 00:25:43,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So next would be ABCD and we have NEFI participating from them.

288
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:49,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and if we could just before we go there, could you explain the difference between the CDBG and the CDBG-CB?

289
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

290
00:25:50,771 --> 00:25:58,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2020, we received a separate grant from CDBG, which was the CV coronavirus funding.

291
00:25:59,797 --> 00:26:03,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is a separate grant, separate pot of money.

292
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a small portion of that remaining.

293
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's intended to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus.

294
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:24,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these programs are good programs to fit into that box, because while we're largely past the pandemic at this point, there are still ongoing impacts, particularly for housing.

295
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:29,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there is still a tieback on these housing programs to the impacts of the virus.

296
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:31,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

297
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

298
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:35,152
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, we'll go to ABCD first.

299
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:37,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

300
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,224
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Nefi Dahoo.

301
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the director of ABCD's Housing Department.

302
00:26:43,426 --> 00:26:54,552
[SPEAKER_04]: ABCD's Housing Department provides a variety of housing counseling services, mobile homeless outreach services, as well as rental and utility services to residents of Boston, Malden, Medford, and Everett.

303
00:26:55,313 --> 00:27:00,856
[SPEAKER_04]: In years past, we have received Medford CDBG funding to support our mobile homeless outreach efforts.

304
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:12,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So we operate a van that goes out into three communities, one of them being Medford, and provides services to folks at risk of homelessness or folks that are homeless.

305
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So providing assistance with applying for shelter, receiving hygiene kits, food, water, things like that.

306
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:27,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, when I joined the department in May of last year, we received CDBG-CV funding to support

307
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,727
[SPEAKER_04]: our housing counseling services, as well as our rental and utility assistance programming, and that's what we are requesting support for this year.

308
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:50,380
[SPEAKER_04]: In response to COVID, the pandemic, in 2020, ABCD established an ongoing rental and utility assistance program that has become a vital effort for the department, and so we appreciate your consideration to support that program.

309
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

310
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions for ABCD?

311
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:55,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one, Mr. President.

312
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:56,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

313
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:56,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

314
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:57,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your...

315
00:28:00,285 --> 00:28:00,745
[SPEAKER_01]: description.

316
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: The question I have is something that comes up every year.

317
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:17,891
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Action Boston Community Development, the ABCD program, I think we had a problem, if you remember, that focused on making sure that this money was spent in Medford.

318
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:22,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if you could just make sure that that happens, to approve this money.

319
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:27,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in the past, they weren't very clear that if it was going to Boston, if it was going to other communities, but

320
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:39,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston and other communities have different avenues, and I think this is, you know, when we talk about Medford, we just want to be clear that this money is earmarked for Medford residents and Medford concerns.

321
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:40,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

322
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

323
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:47,208
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may speak to that, CDBG funding may only be used to serve Medford residents.

324
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So this funding for ABCD through CDBG will only serve Medford residents.

325
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:54,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the clarification.

326
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:54,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

327
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:55,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Laurel.

328
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:57,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions?

329
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:01,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

330
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,589
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will go next to Housing Families.

331
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:07,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Jaina from Housing Families.

332
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, Jaina.

333
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:11,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.

334
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:11,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

335
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:12,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.

336
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so appreciative of the support in the past and hoping to look to the future and continue to collaborate and work together moving forward.

337
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to be there with you in person tonight.

338
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I have picked up some kind of respiratory virus, so I'm staying well away, keeping everyone safe.

339
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:34,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about housing families in general.

340
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: We offer a variety of services, all really geared to the prevention of homelessness.

341
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have family and individual shelter.

342
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We have winter warming centers.

343
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We have homelessness outreach.

344
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:49,832
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a community resource hub.

345
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:53,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We have clinical mental health and youth programming.

346
00:29:53,674 --> 00:30:00,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have the homelessness prevention and legal services, which is the project that I am here to discuss.

347
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So our program started in 1991.

348
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the only legal services entity located in the Tri-Cities.

349
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:14,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We offer brief advice, referrals, advocacy, and representation.

350
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:18,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I think of it as a continuum, so all along that line.

351
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:29,039
[SPEAKER_05]: of from a very early on issue or question that someone might have, such as my landlord might sell next year all the way through to the constables coming tomorrow to move me out.

352
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And even sometimes beyond that, where we have families that are experiencing homelessness.

353
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:45,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So we work all along that and we put together legal services and homelessness prevention tools to be as effective as possible in preventing or ending homelessness.

354
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:51,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is about it for me.

355
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:53,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We were very successful last year in Medford.

356
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: We exceeded our goal by the number of people that we wanted to serve by quite a bit.

357
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:07,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a good success in achieving some raft awards for Medford residents.

358
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:14,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And like ABCD, all of our services that are paid for through CDBG would be for Medford residents.

359
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:16,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dana.

360
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:19,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you just share what your goal was and what you exceeded it by?

361
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,046
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be just helpful.

362
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:21,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

363
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:25,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So our goal is 155 individuals and we serve 200.

364
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:26,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

365
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

366
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

367
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions for housing families?

368
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Collins.

369
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:37,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

370
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a question, just a comment.

371
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:42,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for myself and many other councilors and city staff members.

372
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:49,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we hear month in and month out how meaningful it is to have these service providers operating in our community.

373
00:31:49,917 --> 00:32:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of interesting to talk about this topic and many others in sort of a numerical way, but you know that blowing past that 155 community members goal into 200, you know, 200 people served and supported and coached and housed.

374
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: is so meaningful when you think about that on the basis of individual people, individual households.

375
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:19,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So no question, just thank you for the good work that you do on behalf of our community and working to fill and expand our supportive safety net here in Medford.

376
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:22,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

377
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:27,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions for housing families?

378
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:33,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, we can jump back to West Medford Community Center.

379
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:35,813
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that anyone's popped on.

380
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:39,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I'm not seeing anybody from the community center on right now.

381
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you be able to share their

382
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:47,324
[SPEAKER_12]: information, or is there another thing that you guys would like to do for this process?

383
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, certainly, you know, I can read a bit from the summary.

384
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,647
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a program that we do currently fund.

385
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:58,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this would be continuing funding for their elder services program.

386
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:05,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say that they provide opportunities for Medford elders, need for diversity inclusion,

387
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:17,205
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement, community conversation and celebration through consistent and complementary social, educational, arts and cultural events and activities, allowing participants to grow and learn from one another.

388
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:25,173
[SPEAKER_03]: These events bring an awareness of the value of the senior to younger generations as well as the whole of Medford.

389
00:33:26,094 --> 00:33:47,624
[SPEAKER_03]: The program is directed by Terry Carter and is supported by many collaborations in and around Medford, including City of Medford Public Health Nurse, Jillian Hertig, who has partnered with them to provide COVID vaccines, flu vaccine clinics, blood pressure clinics, and relevant presentations on health prevention topics.

390
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystic Valley Elder Services provides weekly healthy nutritious meals and educational materials around making healthy meal choices.

391
00:33:56,092 --> 00:34:04,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Melrose Wakefield Hospital provides additional blood pressure clinics, relevant health education materials and activities to the program monthly as well as 20 grocery bags per month.

392
00:34:07,403 --> 00:34:17,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Brookline Bank provides experts and assists in locating experts around financial health, like estate planning, home equity, money management, and cybersecurity.

393
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:24,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's essentially a summary of the various programs that they are providing to seniors through the community center.

394
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:25,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

395
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:25,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Laurel.

396
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:28,677
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

397
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:31,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we've heard from everybody on the list.

398
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:37,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anybody who has any further questions, or is there any member of the public who would like to comment at this time?

399
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:41,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I have Councilor Tseng.

400
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:46,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to thank everyone for coming in today and presenting their projects.

401
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:49,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not easy to come before the city council.

402
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:58,097
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these projects we have heard before, but we also have new folks here, and I wanted to welcome everyone to the city council.

403
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:01,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're not as scary as we might seem.

404
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,565
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's what they're saying.

405
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:13,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions, discussion, comments by members of the public?

406
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:19,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, we'll go to member of the public, Eileen Lerner.

407
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

408
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:31,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Eileen, I'm asking you to unmute.

409
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:43,629
[SPEAKER_12]: There should be a button popping up on your screen that will ask you to unmute.

410
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she just raised her hand though, so.

411
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:34,207
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like we're having some technical difficulties.

412
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:38,251
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be another chance to comment at the public hearing.

413
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:41,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, Laurel, if you want to go through what the rest of the process is here.

414
00:36:44,053 --> 00:37:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've just received these updated figures will be going back to review Director Hunt and Mayor and I and other staff will go back to review our allocation of funds, both for the public services and the other projects in the annual action plan will be back before you next Tuesday, May 14th for the formal hearing to approve the annual action plan, which then gets submitted to HUD for approval.

415
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:13,997
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a public hearing at our May 14th meeting.

416
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:14,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

417
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the final will go to, but then that will be our last role in the process.

418
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:20,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

419
00:37:20,423 --> 00:37:24,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the plan is also currently open for public comment.

420
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:25,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It was published as of May 1st.

421
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,930
[SPEAKER_03]: That public comment period will close on May 31st.

422
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So our plan is to submit the plan on, that is a Friday.

423
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll submit the plan the following Monday, June 3rd.

424
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:36,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

425
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:37,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anything else?

426
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:39,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that public comments tend to be a good thing.

427
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:45,500
[SPEAKER_12]: In this sense, for the CDBG program, I know we've definitely solicited them in the past.

428
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:49,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you just say a little bit more about how folks can make their comments?

429
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:51,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

430
00:37:51,361 --> 00:38:00,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can submit them to our office through the OCD at Medford-MA.gov email address.

431
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:05,504
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also welcome to call our office, 781-393-2480.

432
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:08,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Just double checking I have everything right.

433
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,766
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have any comments that they want to convey to me individually.

434
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:14,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

435
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:15,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much.

436
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions from members of the council?

437
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to refer this out to the regular meeting?

438
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:26,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Council Vice President Collins.

439
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:27,518
[SPEAKER_02]: There certainly is.

440
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:31,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thank you so much for coming for us, providing this update, this information.

441
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to hear that the change made to the overall allocation after this meeting will be in the positive direction.

442
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,806
[SPEAKER_02]: But always appreciate these overviews.

443
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great chance to just revisit all of the good work that is being done in the community by CDBG grantees.

444
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would motion to report the paper out favorably.

445
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:51,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to report the paper out of committee and adjourn.

446
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:52,396

00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,419
