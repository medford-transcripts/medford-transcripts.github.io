00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:39,250
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford, and I am John Petrella.

2
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:48,596
And the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:58,823
But before I introduce today's guests, I want to just take a moment, extend an invitation to any member of the Medford City Council

4
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:16,793
any member of the Method School Committee who is a candidate for reelection or to any new candidate running for office in Method to appear on the show Method Happenings where you can share your positions on the current issues facing the city.

5
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:21,817
You can reach us at Method Happenings, 02155 at gmail.com.

6
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:22,637
It's that simple.

7
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:31,934
methodhappenings02155 at gmail.com.

8
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,635
And thank you for that.

9
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:42,339
Today, I wanna welcome our special guest, Patrick Lurken, who is a candidate for our Meffitt City Council.

10
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,120
Patrick, thanks for joining us on the show.

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,122
And we're gonna get right into the questions, all right?

12
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:51,823
Right into it.

13
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,537
The first question, Patrick, we're going to get right into the zoning.

14
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,059
A lot of talk about zoning in Method these days.

15
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,742
How would you deal with it?

16
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:09,406
And I'm going to give you these three specific areas we'd like for you to answer today.

17
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:18,194
The first one is generating community support for zoning that will create affordable housing.

18
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,051
So this isn't a brilliant answer.

19
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,372
It's a simple answer.

20
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:33,298
It's just something that we have to get right, which is getting people the information that they need in as simple as terms and as compelling of terms as possible.

21
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:38,121
So that means the way that I see it, showing them a map of this is what the city looks like.

22
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,464
This is what we're proposing, highlighting the areas of where we're planning to

23
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:50,725
put additional housing, and then saying, this is how it affects your life, and this is why these areas are optimal.

24
00:02:51,466 --> 00:03:05,908
We've looked at other areas, and I think it's really important to justify to people that we didn't just pick these areas out of a hat, or we didn't pick these areas because someone in government or in the periphery of government had some connection to that area.

25
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:09,909
It's really well thought out, and I think that if we

26
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:17,936
There's this paradox that exists of if you want to get this better information out to people, but you Already can't get it out to people.

27
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:20,198
How do you how do you let them know about it to begin with?

28
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:32,226
And I think that really communicating with Through this channel through Medford happenings and also got to know Medford are two big Opportunities that we have right now to really get it out to people.

29
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:33,547
Thank you for that.

30
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:39,712
That's what we're trying to do get information out There's been talk and I'll ask you this

31
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:51,715
like let's call it part B of the same question, what will you do to create, I guess I'm gonna call it an advisory council on zoning and also on the affordable housing?

32
00:03:53,516 --> 00:04:08,346
Yes, I think that we need to find the influencers within Medford, the people within different districts, the people within certain knowledge categories, because they're not always the people in the titled positions, first of all.

33
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:16,336
This is something that I was thinking about previously when I was working on a media project a couple years ago called the Medford Community Network.

34
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:22,144
We were trying to basically think, how do you identify these key stakeholders who are very knowledgeable?

35
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:23,486
And I think

36
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:41,006
If you put the word out, once again, I'm probably going to repeat this a lot, through these new channels, through this one, through God I Know Medford, hey, All Point Bulletin, we're looking for people, if you know a lot about this, if you care a lot about this, we need you to be the representative

37
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,368
so to speak, for your area of the city.

38
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:52,169
And when it comes to holding them to that, I think we have to set a regular meeting among those people.

39
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,610
And I don't know, there needs to be a leader of some kind.

40
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,531
So I don't know if the leader is going to be chosen among them or exactly how that would look, but yeah.

41
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,691
But you need a good group of people.

42
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:05,452
You need some talented people, experienced people.

43
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,992
That's basically what you're saying.

44
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,973
And to communicate it out so the public knows what's going on.

45
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,159
I don't mean to interrupt, but that's a big part of the problem, I think.

46
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,219
It's just not out there.

47
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,680
People don't know what's going on.

48
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:37,608
Yeah, and I think that people who are more casually, people who want to be more civically involved in the city are dissuaded because of the just general tenor intention of politics right now, where they're observing, whether you realize it or not, they're observing other people who are putting themselves out there.

49
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,790
And when those people get piled on, they go, okay, no thanks.

50
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:41,818
Right.

51
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:42,338
Yeah.

52
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,018
No, you're right.

53
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,719
Yeah.

54
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,179
Absolutely right.

55
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:46,500
Okay.

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:06:00,804
And the last part of this three part question, you know, we're trying to attract public and private investments to support affordable housing and method, not an easy thing to do.

57
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:04,405
What's your thoughts on that?

58
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:26,023
On the public side of it, I think that if we put together a, when I say we, I have to decide exactly, think more about exactly who the we is, but putting together a coherent proposal, couple of pages that could be handed over to housing and urban development at the state level.

59
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:29,646
Like if we're trying to get state funds for something like this, we have to,

60
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:39,830
We have to, I think, show that we want to work with Massachusetts, but we're not going to get bullied and pushed around for state-level needs.

61
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:47,854
Because one of the questions that exists right now is, OK, yes, there's some grant money out there, but what are the strings attached to it?

62
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:52,575
And I have an announcement coming over the speaker.

63
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,216
Give me one second.

64
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:53,956
That's OK.

65
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,033
We can't hear it on this end.

66
00:06:58,414 --> 00:06:59,194
You can't hear it on that end.

67
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,057
Okay.

68
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:11,970
So, so basically, you know, the question is what strings are attached to the, to the grant money and I think that a lot of people feel that.

69
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:20,694
sometimes the things that are being pushed in Medford, is it really in Medford's best interest or is it the best interest of other entities like the Massachusetts government?

70
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:27,377
So I think if we sort of meet them at the table with our counter-proposal, then that's a step in the right direction for public funding.

71
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:29,898
When it comes to private funding,

72
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:49,088
I think maybe working with the business community in Medford, partly the Chamber of Commerce, partly other maybe individual business entities, and Bruce Patterson, my campaign manager, actually introduced me to something that worked in Chinatown, where they wanted to put in

73
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:56,028
some businesses and then there was the local said, well, if you're gonna put in these businesses, you're gonna put in this housing as well.

74
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:58,309
And then there was pushback and then they said, no, we mean it.

75
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,910
And then the businesses acquiesced and there was funding for the housing.

76
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,710
So those are two leverage points, I think.

77
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,992
So people communicate with each other, they negotiate, they mediate, boom, it gets, yeah.

78
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,613
All right, so let's go on to the next question.

79
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:18,573
Many citizens,

80
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,019
This was under the chair of Milton McDonald.

81
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:36,489
And they did, they worked diligently, let me get that correct, for two years to bring forward a revised city charter.

82
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:39,651
So this is going to be another one of those three pointers.

83
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:45,155
What do you feel about, how do you feel about the committee's work product on the charter?

84
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:52,934
Well, a while back, probably a month and a half ago, I read through the entire document and I'm a big fan of it.

85
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,336
I think that they did a great job.

86
00:08:55,757 --> 00:09:02,383
When I previously ran, I wasn't as familiar with their work and I was a little bit concerned, okay, how is this being done?

87
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,205
Is there gonna be politics baked into it?

88
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:12,151
But it's a really, I think it's a significant leg up on our current charter and I don't see any,

89
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,073
you know, politics baked into it.

90
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,733
So I think they did a really good job.

91
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:21,375
Particularly, I'm a huge fan of the word-based representation.

92
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,556
There's two other aspects as well that I really like.

93
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:26,617
Yeah, a lot of people like that.

94
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:33,539
So as a whole, you believe it'll help the city or is this going to create problems as a whole?

95
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,849
As a whole, I certainly believe it will help the city.

96
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,611
I would definitely encourage people to vote in favor of it.

97
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,573
And I'm actually going to make a little video about that.

98
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:46,555
But the word based representation is a huge step in the right direction.

99
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:50,118
When I was talking about the answer to your previous question,

100
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:54,586
Right about kind of community liaisons in these different areas.

101
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:55,187
Right.

102
00:09:56,008 --> 00:10:02,615
Should the charter pass in November, there's going to be a period of 2 years before it goes into effect.

103
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:09,743
And so I think that ultimately having this word based representation is going to be a huge step in the right direction for making sure.

104
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,624
broadly every area of the city is represented.

105
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:24,006
The second thing that I really like is that built into the charter is a review every 10 years, which I think is absolutely necessary so that this current situation doesn't happen again.

106
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:37,469
And then the third thing is it forces, there's wording in the charter that forces the mayor and the city council to address budget much earlier in the year rather than waiting until the June deadline.

107
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,050
They have to address it earlier.

108
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,512
We need that in my opinion.

109
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,915
So, basically, I mean, there are sections of sections.

110
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:53,643
You would consider, you know, maybe removing adding or modifying and it's in there that it can be done.

111
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,243
Correct.

112
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,805
I mean, you're going to be able to.

113
00:10:57,345 --> 00:11:01,486
I think the way I read it is you're going to be able to make some adjustments as we go.

114
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,626
Is that correct?

115
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:03,227
Correct.

116
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:07,508
There's a, you know, there's a amendment process that's laid out.

117
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:20,571
It's just like with the constitution, you wouldn't want a document that is so easy to change that anyone could just get all the time, but you want to have a built in adjustment process that adapts to the times.

118
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:22,571
All right.

119
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,172
Great, great answers.

120
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,338
Thank you for answering those.

121
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,559
We're gonna move on again here.

122
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,680
Let's focus on Method.

123
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,401
We need more revenue services, that's it, sources.

124
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,681
We definitely need more revenue sources.

125
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:49,683
So what programs would you institute, basically to grow Method's tax base?

126
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:50,943
What can be done?

127
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:55,038
Well, I'd really like to focus on commercial revenue.

128
00:11:55,058 --> 00:12:01,479
I don't think I'm saying anything new there, but I do think that we need to get the zoning process right.

129
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:09,122
We've been focused on residential with the zoning, but the commercial aspect of it, I think we have to create incentive packages for businesses.

130
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:15,624
Talking to somebody recently, I have a weekly Colleen's event every Wednesday.

131
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:22,547
And there was a gentleman who was talking to me, he's a contractor and he's done work in Malden.

132
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:27,249
And he says, Medford and Malden are night and day when it comes to the ease of getting stuff done.

133
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,629
And I asked him more about that.

134
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:35,512
And he just said that they basically just create a package for you where they say, this is what you need, these five things or whatever.

135
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,053
And once you get that done, it's a breeze.

136
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,235
once the contractors get that done.

137
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:56,534
So I think that not only making it clear what people have to do, and this is across basically everything in our government, we just have to have clearer processes for people because I really feel like we don't have some of this stuff written down and we're just going on the fly a lot of the time.

138
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,918
And if that's not the case, then where are the processes, you know?

139
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,779
So I think we have to be clear with our processes.

140
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:11,867
The second thing for the businesses is just create a better package of incentives that draw them in, like maybe quicker utilities hookups for their businesses.

141
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:25,451
maybe having a storefront, what do I want to call this, like a storefront beautification grant or something like that, maybe having expedited permitting.

142
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:33,752
There's a lot of options that you could bundle together and make it enticing to be commercially vested in Medford.

143
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,558
More inviting to business owners.

144
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:40,558
More inviting to business owners.

145
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:44,180
And we get more tax base off of business.

146
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:50,563
So we're gonna, what you're talking about is basically making it less complicated.

147
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:51,383
Right.

148
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:52,944
And yeah, okay.

149
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:59,587
You're gonna notice this is essentially a common answer or a common factor across a lot of money.

150
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,328
Yep, yep, yep.

151
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,269
So, you know, as part of that,

152
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:17,150
I guess, do you have any specific solutions, I guess, to better manage city expenses?

153
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:21,132
Anything you can throw in there, you think?

154
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,373
Are city expenses being managed properly?

155
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:27,174
What can we do?

156
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:31,275
It's a little bit of a black box to me.

157
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:36,177
So I'm digging into this myself right now to get a better sense of it.

158
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:50,035
I do think that the what I previously mentioned with the charter is a big step in the right direction where it forces management earlier in the year and in a more transparent and simple manner.

159
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:55,257
Probably, you know, I don't know that our city has that.

160
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:58,839
We have a very strained budget, but we probably need a second

161
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:21,925
paid person somewhere to to address it and I know that putting out money for anything is seen as really during these lean times is seen as really drastic or is that really necessary but that this is something that is an absolutely critical area that you know it would it would ease up tension in all these other areas the way that I see it.

162
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,720
No, I think you're correct.

163
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,787
I think it's an accurate statement that sometimes you do, you need to spend that money.

164
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:31,948
Yeah.

165
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:38,175
And I'll add that I think that possibly, I just said this the other day, I was doing an interview with the Tufts Daily.

166
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:55,029
I think that, and people might get squeamish about this, but I think that the relationships between Tufts and Medford and Medford and the Chevalier need to be revisited, not in a way that scares away Tufts or the Chevalier, because they're wonderful assets to our community.

167
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:04,518
But, you know, with Tufts, for example, there's the pilot program and there's these town and gown services that Medford receives in place of taxes.

168
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:17,989
And maybe it can't be monetary, the compensation, but maybe the compensation or the arrangement between Tufts and Medford, who have both grown significantly since the original arrangement.

169
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:29,186
negotiated where attention and these in-kind resources get shifted from one area to another area that's really, really within the city's needs right now.

170
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:34,971
And I think that there's potential exciting room for negotiation there.

171
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,193
And then same with Chevalier, where Chevalier has a big network.

172
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:46,600
And if we can work with the Chamber of Commerce and with Tufts to, or I'm sorry, with the Chevalier to tap into that network and say, hey, how can we

173
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:55,356
you know, use you to maybe optimize the Medford Square development process or something like that.

174
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:56,177
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,417
No, it makes sense, Patrick.

176
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:58,078
Good answer.

177
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:06,123
You know, the next city council, as I'm sure you are aware, and hopefully you're going to be part of that next city council.

178
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:07,944
I think you'd be a great councilman.

179
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:15,749
Anyhow, it's going to be faced with voting to support or not support

180
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:22,547
I mean, let's be honest, two significant overrides or debt exclusions.

181
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,848
One's going to be for a fire station.

182
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:33,470
And the second is going to be to support a new high school, the high school.

183
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,191
So these are tough questions I'm asking.

184
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:46,413
But the first question, do you support or oppose either or both of these initiatives?

185
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,603
And I know it's a tough question because we're not really sure.

186
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,426
Is it going to be an override at that exclusion?

187
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:56,190
But I mean, the bottom line, you know, what do you think?

188
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,333
So I won't bury the lead.

189
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:02,037
I view overrides in general as financial duct tape.

190
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:03,018
And I.

191
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,066
I support the underlying initiatives.

192
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:10,008
I do think there needs to be a new fire station.

193
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:13,150
And I know we're well on the way with the proposal and the development.

194
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,711
So I suppose I support that.

195
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:22,275
And I remember seeing that the sanitation and the fire station was quite a mess.

196
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:26,398
And just in general, it's been a long time coming.

197
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,959
The fire tower was taken down.

198
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,040
There was nothing put back up.

199
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,541
The police got a new station.

200
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,062
It's time, I believe, for the firemen to get there.

201
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:50,073
The underlying project I support when it comes to the high school I lean towards Renovation, I don't think that it's in our capacity being these lean times right now To support a full high school as much as it would be great to do that.

202
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:58,078
I previously mentioned based on Rick Orlando's Previous interview on this show back in the 90s.

203
00:18:58,118 --> 00:18:59,579
We got a huge reimbursement.

204
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:02,201
We really wouldn't get anywhere near that these days so

205
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,863
But I would like to see the range of options.

206
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:18,774
I would like to see the best case proposal for a complete do-over for a completely new school, for strategic renovations, and then basically for doing nothing.

207
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,075
And I'd like to compare them.

208
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:28,402
So back to the override aspect, I do think that when it comes to overrides, I would like to see the case laid out for people.

209
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:33,240
why the override is the only option, if that really is the only option.

210
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,948
I'm not saying there aren't cases that an override might be effectively the only option, but you really have to lay out that case.

211
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,935
When it comes to city finances, you either tackle the revenue side or the expenses side or both.

212
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:50,340
And with revenues, you pretty much have commercial revenues and that's...

213
00:19:50,800 --> 00:20:04,394
up and in zoning you have bonds that you can issue and you have tax overrides primarily and and then you have grants and with the with the recent grant cuts you know at the federal level and in the state level you know rippling down

214
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:16,213
If you're going to make the case that an override is necessary, I want to see complementary efforts in the other areas to either increase the revenues or decrease the expenses.

215
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,714
I want to see what else you're doing.

216
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:26,621
Because what you're doing with overrides is you're basically targeting a specific group that is highly vested and really can't do anything.

217
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:32,626
You're basically just, I've said it before, you're basically like a towel squeezing equity out of people's.

218
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:33,127
Right.

219
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:34,007
No, I know.

220
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:34,248
Yeah.

221
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:44,476
So I really want to see the public case made, if someone's going to be advocating for an override, that other things are being done.

222
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:48,560
And even then, I would be very hesitant to support overrides.

223
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:52,524
You know, I want to thank you, because it's a tough question.

224
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:57,048
And you were very honest in the way you answered that.

225
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:58,789
And we appreciate that on the show.

226
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:00,350
I think that's important.

227
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,451
So I want to thank you.

228
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:05,168
You actually answered, you know, two questions.

229
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,048
Oh, nice.

230
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,511
Question on that all in one.

231
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,492
So that was great.

232
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:10,853
I like that.

233
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:11,513
But yeah.

234
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,215
Oh, I mean, that's a great answer.

235
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,397
And I think it's important.

236
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:27,068
You know, anyone that's running for council, the honesty part of it, the getting the information out, you know, and I mean, you're giving us good answers.

237
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:38,302
you know, whether people are gonna be with you or not with you, but at least it's honest, it's upfront, and... When you're honest and upfront, the rest is in your hands.

238
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:40,563
You just go, the rest, you know, is fake.

239
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,585
Yeah, they're good answers, Patrick.

240
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:43,485
They're good answers.

241
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,447
It's what, I think it's what people are looking to hear, you know?

242
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:50,089
You know, there's good in the answers.

243
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,953
There's some, you know, stuff I think people are gonna wow, you know, but honesty, I love that.

244
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:03,389
All right, so we'll go to the next question I have, which is just a sort of general question.

245
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:16,323
Are there any other important issues, concerns, you know, you see facing method, you know, maybe that we haven't covered today or in your last show, you appeared on the

246
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:20,515
on the show prior and with some great answers.

247
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,337
You know, you're thoughtful in your answers, you know.

248
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:34,384
So is there anything else you can think of we haven't covered as far as issues, or do you see any problems developing, you know, in the near future, future?

249
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:39,488
And how would you approach, if you could come up with any, you know, how do you approach solving them, Patrick?

250
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,377
Sure, so a couple come to mind.

251
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:48,922
And this is the one that always is at the tip of everyone's tongue, is the state of the streets in the city.

252
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:57,468
And I think that's partly, once again, an aspect of getting the current plans out there to people so that they can actually see.

253
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,951
Because some people think that there's actually nothing being done at all.

254
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:09,538
And I stumbled upon, months ago, when I scoured the city website, there's actually a city-wide heat map of all of the streets that

255
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:17,535
that indicate by degree of severity the prioritization of the different streets when it comes to getting them fixed, and the sidewalks.

256
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:26,739
So I think even just putting that out there, it's one of those situations where a lot of people, in the absence of information, they tend to grow more irritated.

257
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,602
So that allays some people's, right there, that allays, okay, at least there's a plan, you know?

258
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:36,044
And then the second part of that is getting the finances and the communications right.

259
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:42,027
So that ties into the other, you know, getting the communication simple, getting the finances tied to other sources.

260
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:45,049
So I digress on that particular topic.

261
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,051
The other areas to me are

262
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:56,443
Arts and culture, I think that there's a consolidation, or I know that there's a consolidation happening right now in the arts and culture space.

263
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,044
I think that's actually a very good thing.

264
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:02,590
Because arts and culture is more decentralized by nature.

265
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,754
It's sort of the seedbed of creativity.

266
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,837
You don't want it to be too top-down controlled.

267
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:14,679
but it's actually good that some of these entities are coming together and they can coordinate resources and projects better.

268
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:26,202
I would love to see the arts and culture community tied into more civic projects that are put into murals that are more relevant to Medford and Medford history, I would say.

269
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,344
Yeah, phenomenal.

270
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,826
And that's not, you know, Medford has a rich history.

271
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:34,069
It has Italian and Irish and Jewish and black.

272
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,713
And now we have Brazilian and we have, you know, Tufts area hillside.

273
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:39,715
And there's just so many you could have.

274
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:49,124
I think that would be a huge part of of neighborhood integration and neighborhood identity is sort of and I'm hoping that can be tied into the.

275
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:54,089
you the new charter if it passes and charter represent word based representation.

276
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:03,038
And then the third thing is I would love to see better relations with, um, with public safety officers.

277
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:07,262
And I think that the national night out was a huge step in that direction.

278
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:10,646
I was I was actually just talking with

279
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:14,407
in tandem with the public safety officers, with veterans as well.

280
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:18,328
I was just at a veterans meeting this morning at the senior center.

281
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:23,489
And one of the things that's up for conversation is the American Legion, the future of the American Legion.

282
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:29,410
Could it be a separate, could the veterans affairs office in the city hall be in a separate building?

283
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,971
And could it be actually at the American Legion?

284
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:39,913
And could that be a hub of other things as well, like a community food bank and offices related to other things, a bulletin?

285
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:47,696
So I think that that would be, this is less urgent than some of the other matters.

286
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:49,417
No, but still, it's nice.

287
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:50,257
That sounds good.

288
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:51,278
It really does.

289
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,299
I like that.

290
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,340
I like that a lot, Patrick.

291
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,401
That sounds great.

292
00:25:59,042 --> 00:25:59,322
All right.

293
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,163
So I got last question.

294
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:07,165
You know, I think I'm pretty sure you got this one down the last question, you know.

295
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,287
What's coming up for you, Patrick Lurken?

296
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:17,351
And if someone wants to get in touch with you, you know, how do they go about doing it, Patrick?

297
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:18,992
And I know you're working hard.

298
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:22,373
People see you all over the city.

299
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:27,096
You're out there talking and people like what they're hearing.

300
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:32,759
So if they want to get in touch, they want to help you out, whatever it is, what's going on with Patrick?

301
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:37,526
Well, six week, five week sprint, basically.

302
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:40,690
That's what's going on and probably diminished sleep.

303
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,357
But I am in the midst of revamping my website right now.

304
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:50,381
I requested from people all over my life.

305
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:52,283
Going back a while.

306
00:26:52,764 --> 00:27:01,573
I'm talking I requested testimonials from them basically character references saying you know me from from some aspect Maybe you were a roommate.

307
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:02,855
Maybe you were a client.

308
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:10,242
Maybe you were a manager, but I have a like 45 testimonials that I'm gonna be posting out saying hey

309
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:20,936
Because you can hear it from me, but I can you know, I can say hearing it from others really matters So that's that's coming out got a fundraiser coming up on October 9th.

310
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:26,223
That's gonna be at Bertucci's I should I should clarify that once I confirm with them.

311
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:27,164
It's going to be a British

312
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,957
Yes, and outside of that, you're just going to see me everywhere.

313
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:37,978
You're going to see me at events.

314
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:39,360
You're going to see me canvassing.

315
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,626
I'm getting really strategic with, okay, where did I miss at the preliminary?

316
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:43,786
What?

317
00:27:44,126 --> 00:28:08,537
Cuz cuz general generally before the preliminary throughout the last three or four months I was just trying to hit broadly everywhere in the city I was going to registered voters, but now I have to be very specific as you know trying to shore up my my support So that's that's basically what's going on with me and where you'll find me everywhere and when it comes to contacting me

318
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:15,474
My email is clerkin4medford at gmail.com.

319
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:19,736
My website is clerkin4medford.com.

320
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:23,977
And then you can also contact me on my social media.

321
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:32,519
I'm on Instagram and Facebook, both of which are clerkin4medford, whether it's the number four or the word F-O-R.

322
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,159
You'll find me.

323
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:34,939
Yeah, they'll figure it out.

324
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,760
So basically, clerkin4medford.

325
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,139
Pretty much.

326
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:41,241
Just across, just search that, you'll find me.

327
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:42,202
Yeah.

328
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:47,665
The last thing I just want to say to people is, um, so I've been in Medford for eight years.

329
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:50,226
I ran three years or two years ago.

330
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:54,909
And so I have more name recognition, but it's still an uphill battle with name recognition.

331
00:28:54,989 --> 00:29:02,653
So if you like my ideas, I'm not tied to a large organization and I don't have the multi-generational name recognition that some people have.

332
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:06,255
So if you like my ideas, if you know someone who wants a sign,

333
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:09,197
If you could donate, it goes a long way.

334
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:15,941
Even just spreading the word to people that I'm running, it all adds up at the end on November 4th.

335
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:18,223
So you can contact me.

336
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:19,143
You can let me know.

337
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:20,464
I really appreciate it.

338
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:23,106
I'll end it by saying you're a great candidate.

339
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,447
You're a good person.

340
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:26,868
You're a wonderful person.

341
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:30,430
You're working hard.

342
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,412
And I personally, myself, my opinion,

343
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:34,697
Absolutely.

344
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:36,238
You got my vote.

345
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:42,480
And I think you're going to be a really, I think you're going to be a great city council, a Method City Councilor.

346
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,560
And I think Method needs people like you.

347
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,681
There's a lot of work to do.

348
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:52,082
And I, for one, I'm confident that you can do it.

349
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:53,083
I really am.

350
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,623
So thank you, Patrick, for joining us again.

351
00:29:57,984 --> 00:29:59,565
So that's it for the show.

352
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:10,468
I want to thank you, you know, first for joining us on the show and second for being a candidate for the Meffitt City Council.

353
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:22,371
And before we close, I want to let you know we are looking, we're looking for some Meffitt residents to appear on Meffitt Happenings on a future show.

354
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:30,013
And what we're looking for is people to share their views on what they expect, what they're looking for,

355
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,565
from the members of the next city council.

356
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:37,106
I think it would make for a great show.

357
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:43,870
And, you know, Bruce, Paul, and some of the other people that helped with this show think it's a great idea.

358
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:48,492
You know, get some feedback from the people that are actually doing the voting.

359
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,514
And, you know, I'm going to be voting for you guys come November.

360
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:58,758
So if you're interested in doing something like that, please, once again, contact us.

361
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:04,782
Method Happenings, 02155 at gmail.com.

362
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:06,183
It's pretty simple.

363
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:08,105
I'll say it one more time.

364
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:12,908
Method Happenings, 02155 at gmail.com.

365
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:18,492
So I want to thank everyone who has been watching the show and thank you for your feedback.

366
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,075
And I'm not even going to say negative feedback because it's been all positive.

367
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:22,736
It's been great.

368
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:23,456
We're happy.

369
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:24,377
I can't, you know,

370
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:25,756
I can't believe it.

371
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,878
Not that we don't deserve a little negative feedback, but it's been all good.

372
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:42,107
I want to remind everyone you'll be able to see replays of this show on our really, I'm talking fantastic website, methodhappenings.com.

00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,489
