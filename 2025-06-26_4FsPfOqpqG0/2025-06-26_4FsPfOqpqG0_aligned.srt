00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:01,719
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:11,343
Welcome to the Q and a with the planning department and City Council on the neighborhood residential zoning and the urban residential zoning.

3
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:12,503
Thanks for bearing with us.

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,804
I know there have been some good conversations happening outside.

5
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:15,864
Um,

6
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:29,409
We're going to tonight have a presentation and introduction from the director of planning, development and sustainability, Alicia Hunt and our zoning consultant, Emily Ennis.

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:31,930
And then we're going to move to a Q&A.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,751
We also have a planner, Danielle Evans, and Paolo Ramos Martinez from Ennis Associates.

9
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:42,733
They are out in the rotunda with a number of large maps.

10
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:55,605
And those are maps that folks can put post-it notes on with their comments and also have some discussions if they have kind of want to have a longer conversation with Paula and Danielle in the rotunda.

11
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:02,512
So with that, thank you for being here and we're going to get started with Director Hunt.

12
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:03,673
Recording in progress.

13
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:05,365
Good evening.

14
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:05,986
Thank you.

15
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:07,967
Yes, I'm Alicia Hunt.

16
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,089
I'm the director of planning, development, and sustainability for the city.

17
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:16,752
And so my office has been working jointly with the city council on this zoning effort.

18
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:24,137
And our consultant, Emily, will actually speak a little bit more about the big picture and all.

19
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,719
But we started with a comprehensive plan.

20
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,240
We have been doing a lot of different zoning.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,423
This evening, we're here to talk about residential zoning, residential zones.

22
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:56,882
Um, there are lots of different chunks happening Um, but I do just sort of wanna i'm gonna say it again Um because a few other people floated in is that we have a presentation And then we're gonna do some q a and this isn't like public comment where you get two minutes and you're done We actually want to answer your questions and have some level of conversation but if you really want to have a deep conversation or speak to

23
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:58,463
that you can point to and find your house on.

24
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:01,505
And they can get into more detail, and then we'll invite you to also leave, um, post it notes on those out there as well.

25
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:03,326
Um so at any point you can choose that you prefer to be be talking to them.

26
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,127
And then we'll also invite you to speak with Paula or Danielle out in the hallway.

27
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:13,212
And you can do that at any time you choose to because they have maps that you can point to and find your house on, and they can get into more detail.

28
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,553
And then we'll invite you to also

29
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:29,244
And so Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates is the planning consultant that we have hired along with her team.

30
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:36,672
And we have a legal firm, Jonathan Silverstein, as well, who has been working with us on this zoning.

31
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:41,056
And I'm going to turn it over to Emily because I'm going to say otherwise everything that she's planning to say.

32
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:42,537
Fair enough.

33
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:43,258
Thank you so much.

34
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:46,761
Good evening, everyone in the room and good evening, everyone online.

35
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:48,723
Very nice to see you all here.

36
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,785
I'm going to just take a moment to share my screen.

37
00:02:51,766 --> 00:03:03,216
I'm going to walk you through the presentation that kind of gives you the big picture of what we've been doing and why we're here and then focuses you down onto the topic for tonight, which is the residential neighborhoods.

38
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,578
So we've done the introductions.

39
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:11,660
I'm going to talk a little bit about the comprehensive plan and show you some of the analysis work that we did.

40
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:28,107
Actually, it's last year now, but that fed into our discussions about the residential districts and then take you on kind of a district by district exposition or explanation of what we're recommending as this draft.

41
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:30,788
I do want to stress that this is very much a draft right now.

42
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,669
The reason that we're having a public meeting

43
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:36,132
sponsored by the city council is we really want your input.

44
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:46,280
So, I think of this as we've been working with the planning and permitting committee we've come up with sort of what we think is the framework for this, we want to check in with the public and see what they think.

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,564
And that's why your questions your comments your thoughts today are so important.

46
00:03:50,944 --> 00:04:04,032
But also, again, if you have anything specific make sure that you look at the maps and detail because even with the screen up here instead of back here it can sometimes be a little bit more difficult to see so feel free to go back and forth.

47
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,974
So we've introduced ourselves.

48
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:11,537
So this is a multi year process the city council started with a

49
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:15,419
recodification project that started back in 2020.

50
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,401
Recodification is really going through the existing zoning.

51
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,663
Are there errors or typos?

52
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:25,605
Are there best practices that haven't been incorporated?

53
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:35,370
So the legal firm that was working with the city at the time went through that process, but it doesn't really talk about what should change in terms of new things.

54
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,711
So the comprehensive plan

55
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:44,717
was the next step in the comprehensive plan looks at the city wide from about a 50,000 level view is how we always talk about it.

56
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,262
And it looks to say the next 10 to 15 years of what should happen in the city.

57
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:55,467
What are the policy changes, what's the direction that the community wants to go through.

58
00:04:56,607 --> 00:05:00,491
Where do they want to be in 10 to 15 or even sometimes looking out beyond that.

59
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:07,295
And one of the first steps after a comprehensive planning process is to realign the zoning with a comprehensive plan.

60
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,136
So that's what we've been working on.

61
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:16,240
We started last year, actually roughly this time, roughly in March, to look at that.

62
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,941
The first thing was the city had already made some tweaks.

63
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:22,403
So we did some urgent edits, we called it.

64
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:28,347
There were some unintended consequences, where the recodifications changed something that wasn't meant to be changed.

65
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,208
So we cleaned that up, and editing errors.

66
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:36,589
And then starting after June of last year, starting in July, we really started focusing on those next steps.

67
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,370
So we've done the Mystic Avenue.

68
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,311
We, of course, had the conversations about Salem Street.

69
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:47,412
We added the green score to address sustainability and concerns about climate change.

70
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,192
Those have all been passed.

71
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:57,474
And now we're in a process of looking tonight with you at the neighborhoods and then looking forward to the commercial district.

72
00:05:57,534 --> 00:06:00,275
So these are some of the things that came out of the comprehensive plan.

73
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:12,049
the different, and I'm assuming, yes, I'm assuming that's all clear, the different goals that came out of the comprehensive plan so that we're keeping these in mind as we move forward.

74
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,956
So, climate resilience, access for all, housing, and economic development.

75
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,678
This is your current zoning map.

76
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,720
This is what we're looking at at changing piece by piece.

77
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:41,872
It is the kind of the broad brushstrokes that many communities use where large areas were zoned for one thing but it doesn't necessarily take into account the different characteristics of the neighborhoods of the commercial areas, the squares, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

78
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:51,638
or what we've called quarters which are those longer streets that touch the neighborhoods but frequently have a lot more commercial or institutional along them.

79
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:57,241
So, this was the future land use map that came out of the comprehensive plan.

80
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:06,547
It talked about quarters centers and squares and neighborhoods and you can see that there were these sort of big blobs of color that identified them.

81
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:13,519
And part of our strategy has been to look more and more closely at the different areas of Medford to try and figure out the zoning.

82
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:23,988
So when we look at the residential districts today on the maps, you're going to see some areas in white and that's because there are these areas that are in color on this map.

83
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,988
Now, these are the mixed use districts.

84
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:41,234
So Mystic Avenue, Salem Street, Medford Square and West Medford, the institutional area, some of the other quarters in there, Wellington, these are all areas that have a mix of uses.

85
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,315
They're both commercial and residential.

86
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,216
We've talked about some of them already.

87
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,257
We're continuing to talk about them right now.

88
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:52,700
In fact, Paola met with the planning and permitting committee last night to talk about Medford Square.

89
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,942
But for today, we're going to focus on residential.

90
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:59,104
And we did a lot of analysis last summer.

91
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:03,226
I'm going to show a few of the maps today on this presentation.

92
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,308
They're all on the city's website.

93
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,690
And some of them are printed out in large scale in the hall.

94
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,471
So feel free to go and look at them.

95
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:15,998
One of the things that we looked at were the types of residential dwellings that exist now.

96
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:19,844
A lot of single family, that's that light lavender on there.

97
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:26,012
Quite a bit of two families, condo conversions, quite a bit of three family.

98
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:30,135
And then we broke it down into sort of different scales of housing.

99
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:48,485
So we had four to eight units and nine plus units We also had a few in the bright pink where you had more than one house from or more than one residential building, uh per parcel So that started to give us an idea of what was what's what's here now So, how do we react to that?

100
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:49,426
How do we think about?

101
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:59,835
Um, maybe some of these are non-conforming, which means that the existing residential buildings aren't actually matching the current zoning.

102
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:11,926
We find that's very common in New England, because in most places, zoning didn't come in until the 1920s, or, you know, one town I'm working with, their first zoning bylaw was 1967.

103
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,130
And if you think of how long development has been happening in New England,

104
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,934
The fact that zoning came in so late meant that you're going to have a lot of neighborhoods that don't match the zoning.

105
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,135
So that's one of the first things we think of.

106
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:29,138
And there are implications if your house or your lot doesn't match the zoning.

107
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:39,385
What that means is that you may have to go, say you want to put a porch on the front of your house, and you're too close to the street.

108
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,787
You're within what's called the front yard setback.

109
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,089
Well, in order to do that, if you're non-conforming, you don't meet the requirements.

110
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,470
You have to go to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

111
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,391
You have to request a variance.

112
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,993
Makes it a lot more time-consuming and expensive to do that.

113
00:09:54,093 --> 00:10:00,636
So one of the first things we try to see is, are there areas where we can reduce the number of non-conformities?

114
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,478
We can reduce the burden on households for doing that.

115
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:15,947
Um, we also took a look at those those existing conditions so lot sizes is where a lot where a lot larger in Medford where are they smaller in Medford what might that mean.

116
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:24,515
How does that relate to the current zoning we found of course that there are a lot of lots that are much smaller than than the zoning currently allows for.

117
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:31,459
We looked at frontage that's the length of the lot along the street, and what does it mean.

118
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:46,807
You know, when the frontage is shorter is smaller than what's required by zoning well you're non conforming but it also starts to let us know as a lot sizes do because your frontage is a component of that dimension.

119
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:53,792
that there may be areas of Medford where the lot sizes, the frontages aren't matching up with the zoning.

120
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:55,494
And we want to think about what that means.

121
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,915
Height is another thing.

122
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:07,603
Height is a frequent conversation in communities because when you're walking down a street, you generally notice what the front setback is.

123
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:10,205
That's the distance between the building and the street.

124
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,327
And you generally notice what the height is.

125
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:13,348
Is it shading you?

126
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,149
Is it allowing sun in?

127
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,490
Do you feel that it's too tall?

128
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,390
Is it too short?

129
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,814
So we did an analysis of the existing heights, and all of these are based on the assessor's data.

130
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:35,941
The board of assessors collects data for each parcel, and then we can put this into a geographic information system, or GIS, and do these calculations and show you what it looks like.

131
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,563
And in fact, this height map is outside, so you can have a look at it.

132
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:43,104
We also looked at the historical inventory.

133
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:59,008
This is MACRIS, which is the Massachusetts Historical Commission, has an online database and an online what's called GIS layer of all of the assets, all the inventory properties throughout Massachusetts.

134
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:09,151
And we took those layers and overlaid them on Medford to see where are the historic areas, what does it mean to think about those historic areas, what does it mean to preserve

135
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:25,722
those historic buildings and is there a way that through zoning, zoning is certainly not the only tool, it's not even necessarily the best tool for historic preservation, but we can do some things within the zoning to create incentives for historic preservation, so we wanted to think about that.

136
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,324
And then also the transit system, right?

137
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:33,186
We want to think about where people live in relationship to their ability to move around.

138
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,687
Are they near a bus line?

139
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,048
Are they near a commuter rail?

140
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:37,708
Are they near a T-stop?

141
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:40,030
And what does that mean for locating people?

142
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,032
When we think about housing, we think about where is it in relation to transit?

143
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,953
Where is it in relation to jobs?

144
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,854
Where is it in relation to goods and services?

145
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:55,655
How easy is it for somebody to get from where they live to the things that they need or the things that they want?

146
00:12:55,735 --> 00:13:01,056
And of course, for a place like Medford, we also want to think about how close is it to recreation, right?

147
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:03,336
You have so many recreational assets as well.

148
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,977
So there are far more maps than that, and those are all online.

149
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:12,558
But I wanted to introduce you to some of the bigger categories that we think about and why we're thinking about them.

150
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:19,221
some of the considerations when we were starting to zoom down just into the residential districts.

151
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:24,063
So I mentioned the proximity, the ability to access transit.

152
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:30,545
This map came from the comprehensive plan and it's proximity to higher densities of job areas.

153
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:35,507
So the stronger the pink on this, the more jobs are in that area.

154
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:41,690
So we wanted to think about, again, co-locating housing near jobs is really important.

155
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:52,354
You saw the lot size map already, what you can't see on the screen but you could see if you went outside or if you went to the maps online and looked at them.

156
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:59,597
There's a lot of topographical changes in Medford and that's important to think about in terms of access.

157
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:03,318
for pedestrians for bicyclists for vehicles as well.

158
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:07,819
There's some parts of Medford where there are narrow streets.

159
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:15,082
There's also a lot of Medford where there are private ways rather than public ways I'm going to show you a map of that or draft map of that next.

160
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:20,004
And then we wanted to think about, as I mentioned already, the existing residential types.

161
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:23,005
We also wanted to think about transitions.

162
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,206
So we mentioned Medford Square, for example.

163
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:27,527
We had the meeting last night.

164
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,147
We're talking about different height levels.

165
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:38,291
If you're in Medford Square, what is it like, what does it feel like to walk or drive from Medford Square to the residential neighborhoods?

166
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:40,292
How do you transition in height?

167
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,853
How do you transition in other characteristics?

168
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:46,198
from there to the residential neighborhoods.

169
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:54,390
So one of the things that we were thinking about is those transitions and what does that mean for zoning as well and for the dimensional standards and zoning.

170
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,776
So I mentioned the private ways.

171
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:03,320
This map is a map of the private ways, or at least it was a draft map of the private ways at the time that this was here.

172
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,403
And those green lines on here are the private ways.

173
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:08,623
So there's quite a few.

174
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:23,193
So in thinking about access to land, where is it publicly owned access and where is it privately owned access just feeds into the many different characteristics that we're thinking about.

175
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:29,528
So in these proposed residential districts, this is what it looks like if you put them all together.

176
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:40,752
So we've got a new Neighborhood Residential 1 district, Neighborhood Residential 2, Neighborhood Residential 3, Urban Residential 1, and Urban Residential 2.

177
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:46,014
And in all of the maps that you're going to see going forward, we're going to break them down so they pop out a little bit more.

178
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:50,799
If you're a land use planner, you'd be questioning our use of color here.

179
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,703
But when you have all of these as residential only, they should all be yellow.

180
00:15:55,243 --> 00:16:00,169
There's only a finite number of yellows that work together on a single map and are still readable.

181
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:06,195
So we heard loud and clear that it was less readable to others than it could have been.

182
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,557
So we've got these changes.

183
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:22,643
So neighborhood residential one is the lightest yellow in here, it is a single unit dwelling historic conversion or accessory dwelling unit so many of you may have heard that there is a new state law about accessory dwelling units.

184
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:29,268
we are working with the city to update their current zoning ordinance on accessory dwelling units.

185
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:35,052
So I'm just going to mention that they are allowed in all of these districts, but we're still going back and forth on the tax.

186
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:39,215
So we don't have the specifics for you available today.

187
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:52,300
So looking at the numbers, as you go up in numbers, so neighborhood residential one, two, three, you are also going up in the types of housing that are allowed and the number of units per parcel that are allowed.

188
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,924
So neighborhood residential two is single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, historic conversion, and ADU.

189
00:17:00,044 --> 00:17:04,467
And this is a good time to talk about the differences in historic conversion.

190
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:07,668
among the different districts here.

191
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:19,950
So what we've tried to do in order to create an incentive to preserve historic houses is to allow one more unit for the historic conversion that is allowed in the underlying district.

192
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,851
So neighborhood residential one, which allows single unit dwellings.

193
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:28,312
If you want to convert a historic building, you can go up to two units in it.

194
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:36,493
neighborhood residential two, which allows single and two unit dwellings, you can go have a historic conversion of two to three units.

195
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:53,997
And what that does is it just gives a little bit more of an incentive in each district to preserve those historic buildings without say, allowing single unit only in neighborhood residential one, and six units in a historic conversion, you're always just one unit more.

196
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:58,322
There are other ways to do that but that's what we're proposing for discussion today.

197
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:10,056
Neighborhood residential three, you can have a single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, three unit dwelling, townhouse, historic conversion of two to four units so that's that one unit more, and ADU.

198
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:23,322
Urban residential one, we're starting to increase the density slightly by going everything that you can do in neighborhood residential three, except single unit dwellings.

199
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:32,627
So it's two unit, townhouse, three unit, historic conversion, two to five units, and what we're calling multiplex, which is four to six units.

200
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,649
We're allowing ADUs for one, two, and three unit dwellings.

201
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,311
So this is a little bit more permissive than the state law.

202
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:59,281
urban residential to townhouse three unit dwelling multiplex three to six units, multiple unit dwelling of greater than six units but limited to three stories, and then the ad use, and from there we've heard some questions already.

203
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,882
about why aren't we going higher perhaps for urban residential too.

204
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:11,604
At that point, you're starting to butt up against the corridors and the squares and those other districts.

205
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:24,127
And so the idea is now you're going to have that transition upwards to what's allowed on, for example, Mystic Avenue, where you can have significantly more height, but some of these residential neighborhoods are butting up.

206
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:25,947
So we're thinking of that transition.

207
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:37,267
where urban residential 2 is really sort of the highest limit for the residential only neighborhoods, and at that point you're going into a mixed-use district after that, and the rules are slightly different.

208
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:47,222
That is not true everywhere because of the complexity of the terrain and the development patterns in Medford, but that's the general concept.

209
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:52,103
This map here shows you where each of the districts is.

210
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:57,504
That's the black outline and the code on it.

211
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:00,225
So NR2 is Neighborhood Residential 2, for example.

212
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:04,527
And it shows you the underlying existing residential types.

213
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,608
We also have that map out here, because I realize it's a little bit difficult to see on here.

214
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:13,690
But what you can do is look and say, OK, this is the proposed boundary for this type of district.

215
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,652
And these are the existing unit types that are underneath that proposed boundary.

216
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:26,515
And again, we tried to think about what was existing in each area.

217
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:30,924
and then the goals that I mentioned earlier for what else.

218
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:38,424
So I'm gonna start and just break it down district by district to make it a little bit easier to see without all the other colors.

219
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,664
So this is neighborhood residential one.

220
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:49,546
For those of you online might be able to see the topography a little bit better, but there's a lot of hilliness up in this area.

221
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,707
The roads are a little bit more narrow, the access isn't as easy.

222
00:20:55,627 --> 00:21:01,528
So these are really limited to the single unit dwellings and the ADUs, also the historic conversions.

223
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,771
There's quite a lot of smaller parcels in this area as well.

224
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,592
And these are the building types that we're talking about.

225
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:20,700
So just so people can see kind of the form of the buildings, the one unit, the one to two unit, obviously with an accessory dwelling unit, you can have that within the building, but you can also have it as a detached unit.

226
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,043
So you can see it in the back on the site, that's showing a detached ADU.

227
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:31,798
This is NR2, so we've traversed out of the hillier area.

228
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:35,740
These are a little bit smaller, or a little bit larger lots in some cases.

229
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:40,823
So single unit dwelling, two unit dwelling, historic conversion, and ADU.

230
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:47,347
And these are the building types that you see here, fairly similar except for allowing the two unit dwellings.

231
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:57,296
We also see the two unit dwellings could either be side by side, or they could be stacked one on top of each other both of those exist in our areas.

232
00:21:58,687 --> 00:21:59,908
In our three, yes.

233
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:02,990
Can you define ADU?

234
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,592
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I'd said, I apologize for that.

235
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:13,037
I am constantly getting yelled at in my office for using acronyms, so I've just done the same thing to you.

236
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:27,987
Accessory dwelling unit, or ADU, that allows you to have a smaller unit, say you own a single unit, single family home, it allows you to have a smaller unit within that home.

237
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:30,348
it is limited by size.

238
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:42,256
Some communities used to have them, they used to call them in-law apartments, and you had to take down the in-law apartment when it was no longer needed, you had to take out down the division.

239
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:52,783
Under state law, a protected accessory dwelling unit, which is the new state law, is limited to 900 square feet or half of the

240
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:57,607
Um, half of the square footage of the building, whichever is smaller.

241
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,889
So it is a much smaller unit.

242
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:09,377
It doesn't rise to the level of, say, a two-unit dwelling where you would have two units that could be of equal size, for example.

243
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:17,964
The idea of an accessory is that you need the principal dwelling unit, and then you're allowed, because you have the principal dwelling unit, to have the smaller unit with it.

244
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:25,167
There's all sorts of rules about that under state law and as I said, we're in the process of updating that so you will hear from us again on it.

245
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,529
But that is the full definition.

246
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:42,795
So they are allowed to neighborhood residential three, which you see on the screen now you can see that this is a larger district again, fairly responsive to what's there now but we're very interested in hearing your thoughts on the boundaries.

247
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:44,797
And then these are the buildings.

248
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:55,707
So again, the one unit, the two unit dwelling, the three unit dwelling, same thing, a three unit could be side by side, like the townhouse that you see in the lower left corner there.

249
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:59,051
It could be stacked like our traditional three deckers.

250
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:04,756
There are also three unit buildings out there that look like single family homes, but they've got three units.

251
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:06,037
There would be a different,

252
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:13,521
arrangement of doorways and entries at that point, historic conversion and the accessory dwelling unit.

253
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:32,431
In our urban one or you are one is the the green that are down here in these different areas and again when you go back to the main map and you kind of see how the transition points happen, you'll you'll see the the different districts around it but you can start to see that urban one you are one is

254
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,652
closer to the transit stations.

255
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,293
We've really started to move in.

256
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:43,517
All of the transit stations have these walking radii around them, so they've moved in.

257
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:51,802
Now, we have heard questions again about topography and existing conditions on the ground, and we're delighted to get more comments about those today.

258
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:59,026
But really as you're moving into the the two urban residential districts a lot of that is about where they are located near transit.

259
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:10,213
You can see these and you can see the introduction of the multiplex units again just those four to six units that that smaller scale because they're limited in unit, unit size.

260
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:21,142
And then finally the you are to see these within the transit areas, but because don't forget there's also mixed use coming into the transit areas that's going to be talked about later.

261
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:27,968
You also see them clustered closer to some of the more major roads.

262
00:25:28,448 --> 00:25:33,613
Again, this is quite responsive to what's going on the ground and in certain respects we look quite closely at that.

263
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:46,909
And then you can see here they get the slightly from the multiplex they get slightly larger to that residential building, but again limited to three stories and height and we took a hard look at the existing heights in the area.

264
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,385
So I would just want to wrap up this discussion by letting you know the continued places to be heard during this.

265
00:25:56,405 --> 00:26:00,868
We've been working with the Planning and Permitting Committee, and of course, those are public meetings.

266
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,171
And people are welcome to come to those.

267
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:06,232
So that is sponsored.

268
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:10,955
The Planning and Permitting Committee is a subset of the City Council.

269
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:17,560
So in that, we have been presenting new topics, talking with them about the new topics, going back and forth on that.

270
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:28,525
and then they refer the topics to the Community Development Board, which eventually has a vote on the topic to refer it back to City Council.

271
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:33,707
They can make modifications at that point, and then City Council has a final vote on the topic.

272
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,908
So all of these are public meetings.

273
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:41,351
You can see these are the dates that we've been talking up until now.

274
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:59,043
And then really diving into our next meeting for example on a new topic is West Bedford Square on April 9, we have been adding the CDB meetings here so the April 2 should be the residential districts and obviously we are meeting in advance.

275
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:14,952
of the community development board meeting and that is because we would love to take any input if there's any changes that you know we hear from you there's some recommendations from changes we can take those to the community development board and say you have this from city council

276
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:29,140
We're recommending these changes and then there's another public discussion about that and that's why I want to stress Very much that what you're seeing today is a draft because we can take that input and change it We are looking at an april date for discussing the squares.

277
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,461
We have not yet set that date.

278
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:41,047
We're juggling calendars and the availability of space But that will be there and then we plan to have a may and a june date for some of the other topics which we will announce

279
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:51,612
And then finally where can I get more information everything we do as being put up on the city's web page they have been completely revamped their zoning web page.

280
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,933
We're hoping it's easier to find that information.

281
00:27:55,254 --> 00:28:00,036
If you can't to do please let let everyone know and we'll see what we can do to

282
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,316
make that work.

283
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,157
And then we're going to go to Q&A.

284
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:07,739
But just again, the reminder on the maps, there's also some comment cards out there.

285
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:15,282
If you have very detailed questions or comments that you want to give us, we invite you not just to say them in the room, but to write them down for us.

286
00:28:15,382 --> 00:28:18,663
We all read through those and take those very seriously.

287
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:20,724
So thank you for being here tonight.

288
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:24,025
I'm going to turn it back over for questions and comments.

289
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:26,907
question that I wanted you to answer first.

290
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:27,307
Okay.

291
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:36,193
So actually, I'm going to take the privilege of actually asking the first question because I was asked this in my office and I realized that I was not confident of the answer.

292
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,153
Okay.

293
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:38,815
Historic conversions.

294
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:42,197
Can you just talk to us, what makes a building eligible for that?

295
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:46,460
Does it have to be designated as a historic building to be eligible?

296
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:52,583
And this is of course a draft, so we can change the answer, but what is the answer right now?

297
00:28:53,564 --> 00:29:02,371
Yeah, I'm trying to remember, I think it's 75 years was the standard that we took, but that is modifiable by community by community.

298
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:19,192
Generally, and in when you're thinking about historic preservation at 75 years or more, I've seen that as being for example, a state zoning standard for demolition delay, but certainly if there's a desire to have a different number we can we can look at that.

299
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:20,734
I think some.

300
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:26,298
Communities have also thought about it in terms of the types of houses.

301
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:35,905
We work throughout New England and we'll get to some communities where they have these, especially some rural ones where they've got those long, big rambling farmhouses.

302
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:43,350
And so, you know, you could also talk about it as a type of historic building that you want to preserve that's important to the community.

303
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,171
I believe it's 75 years now.

304
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:50,595
Okay, thank you.

305
00:29:51,865 --> 00:30:17,241
Um, so what we want to do is that we do have people online and we have people in the room And we need to use the mic so the people online can hear us and frankly because the sound in this room is not great So we appreciate it if people use the lot the mic, um, if people don't mind standing to use the mic in the room Um, and then kit you're gonna just facilitate this and go back and forth or if there are questions online as well people can raise their hands and

306
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:34,438
For people online, you don't have the ability to chat to everybody, but if for some reason you're having specific trouble raising your hand or you can't unmute, you can send me your question and then I can read it out loud if that is a technical problem.

307
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,662
But they can't chat to everybody.

308
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,541
So we want.

309
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,361
Is there anything else?

310
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,943
Do we have other questions or comments from us first?

311
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:48,266
I just wanted to say one one more thing, which is what I don't think I properly introduced Vice President Collins.

312
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,347
So apologies for that.

313
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:58,152
Um, and who is chair of the planning permitting committee and has really been doing so amazing work, especially on the outreach as of late.

314
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:13,893
And one other thing that I think is important in grounding that we've had in a lot of these zoning conversations that I think is good to just add is changing the zoning doesn't mean that anyone who owns a piece of property has to change anything about their property.

315
00:31:14,594 --> 00:31:27,284
So if we change the zoning to something else and you have a single family home on a lot and suddenly you move from a SF2 district to an NR3 district, you don't have to change anything about your property.

316
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:30,924
you want to keep your single family home, you can keep your single family home.

317
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:40,185
Um and because of this quirk of most of the zoning having passed after most of the buildings in the city were built.

318
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:46,926
Um what would happen is that your home would become a non conforming structure or a non conforming use.

319
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:50,607
And what that means in our zoning is actually that that's

320
00:31:57,568 --> 00:32:12,374
that may also be a pre-existing non-conforming use, to maintain that use or maintain that structure, it doesn't mean that if you have a single family in a district that suddenly has allowed three families that you have to change anything about your home.

321
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:14,555
So I think that's really important to understand too.

322
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:16,556
This is not a mandate.

323
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:19,398
on anyone to do anything to their property.

324
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:25,822
It is simply changing what private property owners are allowed to do with their private property.

325
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:33,948
And I just think that's something that sometimes isn't included in these conversations that I think is important to talk about.

326
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:36,029
So I just wanted to say that before we get started.

327
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:36,790
Thank you.

328
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:41,893
Questions?

329
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,174
Yeah, we can move to Q&A.

330
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:45,856
We have this here and raise your hand on Zoom and we'll alternate.

331
00:32:48,307 --> 00:33:08,319
Hi, my name is Laurel Ruma I live at 149 Burgett Avenue, and I was probably most disturbed to see that our small neighborhood, which is what I'm going to call lower hillside so Boston Avenue to George Street, basically now has a bullseye on it as a urban, you are one now to be rezoned.

332
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:17,917
And it's unfortunate because that word urban takes out the most important word that we all love, Medford, and live in this neighborhood for, which is neighborhood.

333
00:33:18,657 --> 00:33:27,762
And the fact that the lots in this neighborhood are very small, 3,000 square feet or less.

334
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:29,382
There's maybe a handful that are more than that.

335
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:39,027
means that when you live next to one of those lots, like we do, then your neighbor can put up a unit, six units.

336
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:42,488
And I understand that this is a reason because of the Green Line going in.

337
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,049
Do I ever understand that?

338
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:53,913
And this is one of those things where we had said for years, which is when the Green Line comes to Medford, it's going to bring all of this great things, lots of opportunities for citizens and residents.

339
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,675
But the toughest thing is that it's also going to

340
00:33:57,295 --> 00:34:00,162
put more demand on our very specific neighborhood.

341
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:01,986
And this is now what we're seeing.

342
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,590
This is the more demand part of it.

343
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:21,805
and changing that small neighborhood, again, from the back of Boston Avenue, Suburban Ave, out to George Street-ish, in that kind of corridor, and then making everything else around it, NR1, puts a lot more pressure on this center bullseye.

344
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:28,549
And the MBTA will tell you itself that folks walk a half a mile to get to the Green Line.

345
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:42,034
the way I look at this in a more equitable fashion is what is this half mile radius around all of the T stations, including the commuter train in West Medford.

346
00:34:42,972 --> 00:35:05,449
To think that Wellington has the same zoning with her 15 story high rises and everything else as our neighborhood, which is small and has maybe 200 houses at most in the very narrow streets that fire trucks can't get down because there's parking on both sides, as well as Ball Square, which has what, maybe five, six, eight story buildings.

347
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:20,698
That's where it's painful for us to see this kind of conversion and push to even UR2 to make it even more dense when we know the streets can't handle it, streets can't handle it now.

348
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,644
As a neighborhood, largely for changing the zoning, we want more people to live in Medford.

349
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,206
We want more people to live in our neighborhood.

350
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,867
We also want to keep it a neighborhood.

351
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:35,770
So how do we balance these two things and reduce that bullseye

352
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,212
on our very dense, very small neighborhood.

353
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:44,895
And I guess my main question is, what is the lot size rules?

354
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:52,280
And what precludes developers from buying lots side by side and tearing down and building what they need to build?

355
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,042
You know you're not sharing your screen, right?

356
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:01,004
I know I'm not sharing my screen.

357
00:36:01,044 --> 00:36:02,204
I was not meaning to share my screen.

358
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:03,445
Thank you very much.

359
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:09,129
I remember comments on the same neighborhood from when we first presented this.

360
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:15,013
I'm really hoping that on your way out, you stop by the map and draw the delineation because I think when we're there- I've written letters.

361
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,033
I feel like that's plenty.

362
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:16,794
Okay, beautiful.

363
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:21,497
I think when we were listening to it the first time, we weren't quite sure exactly where you wanted.

364
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,978
We wanted to make sure we got it right.

365
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:24,519
So thank you for bringing that up.

366
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:49,813
I did the thing that I'm not currently sharing, because I'm just going to say it is the height limits for each of these districts, which I realized I did not tell you I showed you the buildings and the heights but let me tell you that the proposed height limit for NR1 and NR2 is two and a half stories, and for NR3, UR1 and UR2 is three stories, there's a maximum height of three stories on there.

367
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,754
So I did want to make that clear.

368
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:56,735
I also do want to make clear, again, the units per lot.

369
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:02,117
Under state law, accessory dwelling units are not counted in density.

370
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,818
So take that out.

371
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:09,539
But non-ADU units, principal dwelling units, in R1, it's one unit.

372
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,580
In R2, it's up to two units maximum.

373
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,081
In R3, it would be three units maximum.

374
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:17,502
you are one six units maximum.

375
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:25,747
And then you are to again, there's no maximum on that one type, but it's still limited to three stories.

376
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:30,170
So just so everybody knows that I apologize for not getting that earlier.

377
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:37,915
In terms of parcel assembly, I mean, parcel assembly is available now to any developer who wants to buy parcels.

378
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:44,339
We are looking at a smaller lot area square footage because for in most cases,

379
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:49,303
the lot area we're trying to be responsive to what's there now based on our analysis.

380
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:58,932
But again, that's why we're here today is to hear are we is there an unintended consequence of the analysis that we've done so appreciate you bringing those comments forward.

381
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:22,240
Yeah, I think the most unintended consequence is that that neighborhood is surrounded by property that's owned by Tufts University, and that is not taken into account here, which neighborhood has been asking for for a very long time is to create an institutional boundary to keep the limit of where Tufts can expand out of the neighborhood, and as well as the Upper Hillside as well.

382
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:25,483
So, you know, there's absolutely, in a future,

383
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:44,273
What I see, and I'm not saying, I guess this is just what it would be, which is many stages of grief, but Tufts would be the primary institution that would buy up Burgett Avenue and then just turn it into the dwellings that they need it to be, whether it's housing or if it's, well, I guess it would be housing.

384
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:57,537
Um, so I guess that's always the possibility, but I just find it really frustrating when the city's largest landholder is not being held accountable in any of these zoning discussions.

385
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:10,182
And when our particular neighborhood has a 10 story building at the end of it, the two 10 story dorms going in on Boston Ave across from it, it really starts to limit the

386
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:14,744
Houses that are in this neighborhood are one and two-story buildings, right?

387
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:18,766
So our building, our house is a 1920s, small 1920.

388
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:23,088
So we are technically historically protected, whatever that means, which is nothing.

389
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:27,451
And then you would have a six-story house next to it, right?

390
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:31,213
And then you have these larger houses built, buildings built by Tufts.

391
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:33,193
surrounding everything.

392
00:39:33,513 --> 00:39:40,995
So unlike Wellington, where you have a diversity possibility of different buildings, different heights, different uses, just a different place to be.

393
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:44,236
I mean, Wellington's exciting because anything is possible.

394
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:47,617
There's very little that's possible in our bullseye.

395
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:52,979
It's Tufts University or our tiny little what is now a neighborhood.

396
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,601
So that's the unintended consequence for us, which is really just reiterating that Tufts has to be part of this conversation.

397
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:07,005
and they have to be somehow bounded so the rest of the neighborhoods don't feel this pain.

398
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:12,629
And I guess my other thought is, if you're going to make this tiny little bullseye, you are one or two.

399
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:22,275
Expanding that out to the entire neighborhood that benefits from the Green Line extension, which is half a mile radius at the very least, is more fair.

400
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:24,017
Thank you.

401
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:29,957
Emily, just on the map, is the light gray the half?

402
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,698
Is that a quarter mile radius?

403
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:33,259
I think it's a quarter and a half.

404
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,219
Okay, and then the half mile goes out further.

405
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,021
Yeah, we are definitely talking about Tufts and institutional zoning.

406
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:42,623
It is something that we're taking up in April, I believe.

407
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:51,247
And we want to put in the Tufts institutional zone and whatever power is in our disposal to control Tufts, which is

408
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:55,609
we probably there's more that we can do, but it is also limited.

409
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:04,134
And I think we've had some honest discussions on the planning permitting committee around.

410
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,716
Should this be an NR3 like the rest of everything?

411
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,177
Should it be a UR1?

412
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:15,081
We've definitely heard some comments around the NR3 instead of the UR1 because a lot of the

413
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:19,303
existing condition is very similar to the neighborhood outside of it.

414
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:27,570
And then we've heard the flip side, which is if you're within the quarter mile radius of like one of our only three rapid transit stations, what should you do around density there?

415
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:39,059
So I think, you know, hearing more of those comments, maybe pulling back the you are one to a smaller piece of that area might make sense.

416
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:41,080
Maybe going to NR3 would make sense.

417
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,223
I'm interested to hear what the Community Development Board

418
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:47,400
input through public input is on that as well.

419
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:50,710
But in terms of comparison to Wellington,

420
00:41:52,866 --> 00:41:58,969
The area immediately around the Wellington station for transit is going to be part of a special district where it's going to be.

421
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:06,953
It already is part of an overlay district that has high density and likely is going to have mixed use district with very high density.

422
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:14,297
So we are intending that the Wellington T station, certainly the quarter mile radius and into the half mile radius.

423
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:21,279
would look much denser than the UR1 district around the Medford-Tufts station.

424
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,019
And that's because of what's there now.

425
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,801
We have two hands on Zoom.

426
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:29,721
Do you want to go to Andrew?

427
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:33,102
Let's go to Andrew in the back of the podium and then go to the next person on Zoom.

428
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:36,323
Okay, Andrew in request to unmute.

429
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,390
Hi there.

430
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,391
Andrew Van Horn, Medford resident.

431
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,712
Thanks for taking my question.

432
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,732
Two quick questions.

433
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:46,713
I'm not sure if you've addressed either of these, so if you have, I apologize.

434
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:54,136
How many total units or have you considered how many total units this could add citywide?

435
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:59,639
Additionally, are there any affordable housing requirements built into the plan?

436
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,637
They've just assigned that to me, Andrew, thank you very much for the question.

437
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:18,103
So, we have not done a build out analysis, and there's a couple of reasons.

438
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:28,492
But one is when you're looking at something like this, whether or not a unit is built is up to the property owner right so if you're living

439
00:43:29,212 --> 00:43:42,156
in a single unit dwelling say and you've just been changed to neighborhood residential to and now you can have a two unit dwelling, maybe your existing zoning district and allow that to unit dwelling before but now it's an option.

440
00:43:42,776 --> 00:43:55,300
You as the property owner have the right to exercise that option and that's that's what President Council President bears alluded to earlier is that nobody's forced to make a change and so to.

441
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,684
have some sort of accurate assessment of how many units could change over time.

442
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:14,511
It would be a snapshot picture with a lot of additional factors that don't go into a build-out analysis of that type.

443
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:24,476
So for example, not only do you have to factor in whether or not somebody chooses to change their property, but you also have to think about, well, what are the economic conditions now?

444
00:44:24,716 --> 00:44:28,759
So what are the things that go into whether or not something is built?

445
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:31,400
So it's, first of all, do I exercise that option?

446
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:33,001
Can I get the financing?

447
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:36,843
Can I get the materials?

448
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:40,486
Certainly, for example, during the pandemic, we saw the shoot up in

449
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:53,421
construction prices and the commodities prices and in many ways that inflationary environment has not changed much, interest rates are higher, labor is difficult to get.

450
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:58,648
So it's not that development's not done, it's just it's hard to say

451
00:45:00,538 --> 00:45:07,643
we could maybe make this calculation, but it wouldn't necessarily have any meaning so I think that's part of it.

452
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:21,113
Second part of the question, or affordable housing Yes, so on this, the city does have affordable housing or it's also called inclusionary zoning requirements.

453
00:45:22,013 --> 00:45:46,341
that apply citywide we haven't added additional ones on this for the, the mixed use areas there is there are some incentive, what we call incentive zoning, where there is additional height in exchange for public benefits and that includes some choices around affordable housing that has not currently been applied to, to these districts.

454
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,842
So, but interested obviously any comments on that.

455
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:55,708
Yeah, and I would just add on inclusionary zoning right now the city's inclusionary zoning kicks it into 10 units.

456
00:45:55,788 --> 00:45:56,569
Yeah, building.

457
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:06,989
trying to get the funding to do the nexus study to update our affordable housing linkage fees and the inclusionary zoning ordinance.

458
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:22,202
One barrier that we have now is that the Supreme Court has said that things like linkage fees and potentially inclusionary zoning can be defined as illegal takings by the government, essentially requiring

459
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:26,079
financial taking from a private property owner.

460
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:36,208
So in order for our linkage fees and our inclusionary zoning to be legally defensible and unchallengeable, we have to do market analysis to determine what the market can bear.

461
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:41,133
And if we say you have to have 50% affordable in order to build this thing on your property,

462
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:44,876
that's been added to the zoning ordinance.

463
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:50,719
The landowner can challenge that call that a taking and then basically just what our inclusionary zoning ordinance would become invalid.

464
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,682
They may not have to build any affordable housing at all, so it's another barrier that's

465
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,326
we're not going to be able to do that.

466
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:09,312
But um, we are hoping at least my hope is that we can do an analysis and maybe reduce the place at which the units start.

467
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,335
Um so maybe take that down from a 10 unit to a six unit.

468
00:47:13,976 --> 00:47:19,720
Another thing that we can update with our inclusionary zoning, and this is part of the ongoing part of this larger project.

469
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,441
Um is to include

470
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:29,087
that.

471
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:50,283
Essentially that if the number of required units ended up being 7.5 or let's say .5, for example, for a very like a six unit development instead of either just getting one or no affordable units, the developer would pay a cash payment into our affordable housing trust fund, and that could be used to support affordable housing at another private location.

472
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:53,565
So those are some of the things we're looking at.

473
00:47:53,686 --> 00:47:57,408
But the inclusionary, uh, is a discussion we're having.

474
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:58,129
I think in May.

475
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:13,851
And so as it stands now, as your regulations stand now, it would only apply in the urban residential too, where you could have more than six units, but it would not apply in the others because they're below six or six or below units, so they don't meet the 10 unit threshold.

476
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,531
Another option we could look at is

477
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:18,132
we're starting to see that.

478
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:20,733
In the mixed use quarters and squares.

479
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,694
We developed this incentive zoning program.

480
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:26,596
So if someone adds affordable units, they can build another story.

481
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:28,156
I don't know if we want to do that.

482
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:30,117
There may be in the you are too.

483
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,558
We want to add an incentive zoning so you could go to a fourth story.

484
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:39,541
But I think we're starting, you know, you're balancing a lot of concerns there, so we didn't

485
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:47,983
I can't hardly stand this.

486
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:49,123
Hi, y'all.

487
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:54,345
I still have some PTSD from Tufts.

488
00:48:55,206 --> 00:48:57,467
I'm Laurie Krieger, 124 Brookings Street.

489
00:48:58,307 --> 00:49:04,590
And my first question, when you talk about affordable housing, is that defined as rentals or is that defined as for purchase?

490
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:07,531
And then I'll tell the story.

491
00:49:07,851 --> 00:49:12,274
So why don't I am so affordable housing could be rental or purchase.

492
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:22,299
To be clear, it's a restriction that goes on the deed, and it talks about the income that the person must have in order to get that.

493
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:27,242
And then the so there's both an income level for the person who is getting the unit.

494
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:31,005
The unit has to be lotteried off because we require it to be.

495
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:33,087
There are a lot of state regulations around.

496
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:36,511
We call these deed restricted affordable units.

497
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:38,653
It doesn't mean that they're just cheap.

498
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:40,594
It means there are restrictions on it.

499
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:42,496
So you must be under a certain income.

500
00:49:43,337 --> 00:50:02,574
and then the rent or the sale price is set through formulas that are governed by the state and if you're in a deed restricted affordable unit and you are renting then in order for them to raise your rent they actually have to go through a process with the city every year where we

501
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:13,142
Approve the rent increases and there are certain parameters like we have to approve a certain amount, but we Can't like we don't let them go over a certain right.

502
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:25,650
So like there are parameters that we have to work within Um, so it could be either and if you purchase a deed restricted affordable unit Um, there are restrictions on the resale of that too.

503
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:29,093
So those can be kind of controversial because it

504
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,317
it limits how much you can make when you sell that.

505
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:39,042
But if you live there for a long time, you're never paying rent to anybody.

506
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:39,863
You own it.

507
00:50:40,344 --> 00:50:41,084
Okay.

508
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:49,173
Now I have a story to tell you, and I'm hoping that... I haven't been following along because I got exhausted with the Tufts thing, and now here I am, I'm back.

509
00:50:50,573 --> 00:51:00,337
And so I'm from a household that had a single mom for family, and by the time I was 30, I lived in 20 different residences.

510
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:02,457
So that was really important.

511
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:06,299
I lived in, I finally landed rent control in Cambridge.

512
00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:10,201
and got to stay there a few years, and then they voted out rent control.

513
00:51:10,562 --> 00:51:16,987
And I couldn't afford Cambridge, I couldn't afford Somerville, and I could afford Brookings Street in Medford.

514
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:18,388
What a blessing.

515
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:21,130
It was affordable for us then, barely, right?

516
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,511
So we could buy a house.

517
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:24,032
We never even knew we could buy a house.

518
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:27,595
So it's the first house I've ever lived in that was owned by someone in my family.

519
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,997
My mom's come from another country.

520
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:37,239
So what's really important to me is when we bought the house, this is what I want to really, really share with you, a couple things.

521
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:41,940
We could just barely afford buying the house 27 years ago.

522
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:56,445
But because we bought the house and eventually refinanced the house and stuff like that, it stabilized the income, which stabilized my life, which allowed me to get really better jobs again and again until, like I couldn't even afford to buy my own house now.

523
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:59,386
But that stabilization was huge.

524
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:13,271
And so when I look around me and I see all these developments that are happening, either for homes or for luxury apartments or whatever, it seems to be like a 28% to 30% vacancy rate, or just buildings that have been built that are just empty.

525
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:21,594
For me, I developed my family wealth now because we had a stable, what I still call rent, right?

526
00:52:21,694 --> 00:52:22,734
Even though we own the house.

527
00:52:22,774 --> 00:52:31,817
So whatever you can do to allow people to get in at the rate they can afford, but allow them to develop and accrue wealth so that they can give it to their children.

528
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:37,256
or whoever's next in the family line, because that's what creates community also.

529
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:42,378
We just did a wonderful thing in our community because we were stable and we were a neighborhood.

530
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:57,007
And if these buildings, new buildings are built, there are developers come in, Tufts comes in and builds six family places, and they're all rental, how do we create the community that still supports this city of Medford in a viable, bright,

531
00:52:57,987 --> 00:53:02,271
engaged way, like we're phenomenal neighborhood, so please love us good.

532
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:08,417
The other thing that I wanted to think about, so really worry about vacancies and worry generational wealth.

533
00:53:08,457 --> 00:53:12,740
Let's help people build generational wealth however we can and create neighborhoods.

534
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:16,124
The other thing that's really important, it's really strange.

535
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:22,030
When I bought the house, the building department, it said it was built in 1927.

536
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:28,257
And that sounds right, because everything on Charnwood is historic commuter bungalows.

537
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:30,999
And they have historical information about them.

538
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,421
When I pulled the permit,

539
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:39,143
12 years later, 15 years later, to reside the house, it said 1944 was when my house was built.

540
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:45,285
So something was changed in the paperwork that I had nothing to do with, and I never argued with it because I never had a need to.

541
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:50,766
Now, in terms of what's historical or what's not historical, that might be important.

542
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:56,688
And one thing that's really strange, I don't know why it was changed, and it looks like more than just my home was changed to 1944.

543
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:00,350
That was well into World War II.

544
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,694
I don't think they were building a lot of houses well into World War II.

545
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,978
And I don't know how to do anything with that.

546
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:12,043
But please be mindful that these old documents may not be quite correct.

547
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:15,007
And please be mindful that is a historic neighborhood.

548
00:54:15,688 --> 00:54:16,028
Thank you.

549
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:26,803
Thank you, Laurie, and we can definitely on the side work with the assessor just to try to figure out what changed on your paperwork.

550
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:31,285
And I'm sure that the historical commission might have some documentation as well.

551
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:34,807
And we could bring that to the assessor just to change it, change it back or get it right.

552
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:41,033
either way you'd fall under the, I guess we wrote it as 70, but we, I think we meant 75.

553
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:45,617
Right now, the historical ordinance for demolition delay is 75 years.

554
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:48,761
I think we wanted the historical conversion to match that.

555
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:53,465
So that might just be, so you're good either way, but, and quite frankly, most

556
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:57,670
one, two, and three family housing in the city was built before 1950.

557
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:02,514
So it would fall under the, it falls under demo delay.

558
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:13,666
If there's a historical commission, if someone wanted to demolish a property that age, not saying that you would want to do that, but that's one of the reasons that we wanted to match those.

559
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:15,447
I think

560
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:26,644
A couple things that you said really brought out some of the points as to why we're trying to do what we're trying to do, and some of it is difficult, and I think that's just something we've been trying to acknowledge throughout the process.

561
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:28,004
Change is never easy.

562
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:39,267
The first thing is, I appreciate you saying it, you know, one of the things that I've heard that I've really liked, because I think it makes a really important point, is that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is rent control for homeowners.

563
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:47,798
And that's why, you know, it provides you that stability where you don't have to worry about being priced out and constantly moving.

564
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:59,582
And that's why I think it's important to note that zoning is one piece of a number of strategies that we're trying to either employ because we have the power to or get the state to give us the power to employ.

565
00:56:00,362 --> 00:56:09,044
Um, this is the one that's about we control zoning so we can control what legally can be built on property, essentially the supply question.

566
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:14,086
Um, you know, another piece of the housing cost issue is that demand.

567
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:18,207
There's a lot more people want to live in Medford than we have houses for.

568
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:20,668
So that's why the prices are skyrocketing so quickly.

569
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:20,728
Um,

570
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:35,632
And one of the other things that we try to do to answer that is right subsidizing the price so section eight, or the raft assistance program at the state level so that's like trying to subsidize the price doesn't really solve the problem but it does help some people.

571
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:44,620
The flip side of that is like a rent stabilization or rent control where you say you the price can only go up this far, but it also doesn't solve the long term problem, which is

572
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:47,823
more people want to live here than we have houses for.

573
00:56:49,705 --> 00:57:02,116
So I think what we're trying to do here is say, 30 years ago, when you were moving from Cambridge and Somerville was not affordable, but Menford was, that radius has expanded, right?

574
00:57:02,176 --> 00:57:04,458
That radius, you could say goes out to 95, maybe 495 now.

575
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:20,805
And the question is, how do we have more units that people can either rent or buy in Medford where we can try to keep the price reasonable and try to keep the prices stable for as long as we can?

576
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:24,067
Yeah, and people like my parents, we couldn't buy the house.

577
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,847
My parents couldn't buy the house that they live in today.

578
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:29,288
They only bought it 30 years ago because it was the price that it was then.

579
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:31,809
I can't buy a house in the city right now.

580
00:57:34,014 --> 00:57:36,014
And I think that's true of a lot of people.

581
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:41,456
We are a 55% homeowner, 45% renter city, and a lot of people who rent want to stay.

582
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:47,137
And just in the discussions, we're having folks around Salem Street.

583
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:50,537
I got an email from someone who lives right off of Salem Street who says, I've lived here for five years.

584
00:57:51,158 --> 00:57:51,878
They're selling my house.

585
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,618
I have to move to outside of Waltham.

586
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,479
The back end of Waltham out by 95.

587
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:58,619
But I'd love to stay in Medford.

588
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,640
And really, what we're trying to do, and this is a piece of that strategy, is

589
00:58:03,844 --> 00:58:11,386
how can we get more units in the city so that people can afford to live here?

590
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:18,128
If some of them are for sale, essentially, I think someone had a great analogy.

591
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:24,690
If we do nothing, if we just status quo, we have the number of units we have and we don't do anything, the prices are just gonna keep going up.

592
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:42,107
and if you own you're going to be okay because well maybe not but most people are going to be okay if they can afford to pay their mortgage and their taxes right um but new people aren't going to be able to move here and a lot of people are eventually going to have to end up selling for some reason um retirement or

593
00:58:42,888 --> 00:58:43,548
or something else.

594
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:45,689
And the prices are just going to keep going up.

595
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:58,634
So we're not going to have the generational wealth opportunities, we're not going to have the ability for the children of people who live here now to try to buy another unit in the city unless they somehow are, you know, making 200 or $300,000 a year, which most people don't.

596
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:06,102
Um, and one of the other pieces of that question is also just household size.

597
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:08,763
The average household size is declining.

598
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:21,169
So if you have a lot of larger homes where you may have had a family of four, a family of six, that is now just one or two people, um, you, you know, you need

599
00:59:21,954 --> 00:59:29,141
you would essentially need to have three, like a triple-decker on that property to have just the same density that you had maybe 30 years ago or 40 years ago.

600
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:34,085
So that's why we believe that the densification here is important.

601
00:59:34,566 --> 00:59:44,294
It helps create not just this deed-restricted affordable housing, which has legal limits and you can't force people to build more of it than the market can bear,

602
00:59:45,275 --> 00:59:59,846
But to try to build more housing so that existing housing stock maybe goes down in price, so that we can try to better match supply and demand with the conditions that we face today.

603
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:01,607
Thank you, Ted.

604
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:07,411
The two things, the generational wealth is so important, especially for Hispanic kids like us, right?

605
01:00:07,511 --> 01:00:12,795
And then the other thing is that developers don't end up

606
01:00:13,935 --> 01:00:15,516
for someone who's building a job.

607
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:18,858
I've seen that in campus, it's a little bit more.

608
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:21,119
And I think that's another reason.

609
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:29,104
Right now, what we're seeing is that the land is so valuable that someone can build a giant single family home and leave it empty for years and still make a profit.

610
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:33,266
Even if the bed was in six units.

611
01:00:33,827 --> 01:00:37,949
And I think the bet we're trying to say is if we can get them to build

612
01:00:39,987 --> 01:00:51,170
smaller units, more affordable units, not just these luxury units, by allowing more density in the same place than exists now, it could help reduce the vacancy.

613
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:54,130
Part of the problem is we can't control what they do.

614
01:00:55,490 --> 01:01:01,992
But we're trying to change the, essentially adjust the market balance here to be more a priority of what actual people need.

615
01:01:03,332 --> 01:01:06,734
and less of these things that people can't afford.

616
01:01:06,754 --> 01:01:13,937
But there's a regional question, and even if we did all of this tomorrow, I don't think we're gonna solve the whole problem, but I think we're moving in the right direction.

617
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:15,998
And I'll just add to that.

618
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:20,140
It's a powerful story that you gave, and thank you for that.

619
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,201
Zoning is an imperfect tool for some of these problems.

620
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:30,104
So it can get you so far, it can require the subsidized affordable housing.

621
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:46,157
Under certain circumstances, it can create that affordability or allow for the possibility of that affordable by design those smaller units on smaller lots or multiple units on smaller lots.

622
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,698
Zoning doesn't speak to ownership.

623
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:53,361
It's a comment I get quite a lot is, oh, can you zone for condominiums?

624
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:54,821
Can you zone for rental?

625
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:58,023
You can't do that through zoning.

626
01:01:58,103 --> 01:02:00,444
You can zone for different types of houses.

627
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:10,370
I like to think of the, if you think of somebody in their entire lifespan, they grow up, they get into the working world, they have education.

628
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:24,799
different stages of their life, they may have families of various size, they may downsize from that, however they do that, there's a need to have a diversity of housing types to address people at all stages of their life cycle.

629
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:34,546
So one of the things that zoning can do is create the conditions by being permissive about allowing for that diversity of housing types.

630
01:02:34,946 --> 01:02:37,248
But it can't force them to be built.

631
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,390
And I think that's something to remember.

632
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:43,993
I've had people get very frustrated because, well, we changed the zoning two years ago.

633
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:45,234
Why hasn't this been built?

634
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,037
It's because zoning doesn't require it to be built.

635
01:02:49,118 --> 01:02:50,699
It just gives the options.

636
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:51,860
It gives the permissions.

637
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,122
It puts the limitations on things.

638
01:02:54,182 --> 01:02:58,325
And what we're trying to do is get those conditions right for going forward.

639
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,002
I do want to note that we've been here an hour and 20 minutes and we've taken three questions.

640
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:06,383
So we may need to keep our answers a little shorter.

641
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,286
It's not about the questions, it's about the answers.

642
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:15,908
So why don't we go to the CF online.

643
01:03:15,928 --> 01:03:18,129
Hello, my name is Christian.

644
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,051
I'm at 386 Bellsway West.

645
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:28,190
Just a couple of questions.

646
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:37,098
Do we know when this process is expected to go into like the final approval?

647
01:03:38,139 --> 01:03:51,112
And then assuming that it does go into effect, what would be the process for converting from one type to another type, like to add a unit or something like that?

648
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:55,906
I can answer that, and I'll try to be brief.

649
01:03:58,966 --> 01:04:04,508
There's going to be a Community Development Board public hearing on April 2nd.

650
01:04:05,828 --> 01:04:09,889
They may conclude their hearing at that meeting, and they may extend it to their next meeting.

651
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,690
Once that's reported out, it would come back to the City Council for a public hearing.

652
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:18,191
The earliest we would consider that would be April 16th.

653
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:19,552
It may be extended beyond that.

654
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:24,864
and that city council public hearing would be the final approval.

655
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:29,905
So at the earliest, it would be April 16th after the upcoming two public hearings.

656
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:34,706
And in terms of if there is new zoning, how would you build something under it?

657
01:04:35,186 --> 01:04:43,528
You would go to the building department and you would request a building permit and they will tell you whether or not your permit meets the conditions of the zoning.

658
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:50,390
And if not, then there might be another process that you might have to go through like a special permit or something else.

659
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:52,107
Thank you.

660
01:04:56,202 --> 01:04:57,062
Back to the podium.

661
01:04:57,303 --> 01:05:00,324
Hi, I'm Cecilia Karlowitz, 41 Burbank Road.

662
01:05:01,424 --> 01:05:03,865
First, just want to say thanks for doing all this.

663
01:05:04,005 --> 01:05:06,986
Really appreciate all the work that's gone into this, the thoughtfulness.

664
01:05:07,886 --> 01:05:11,107
My husband and I moved to Medford less than a year ago.

665
01:05:11,127 --> 01:05:16,209
We specifically chose Medford for its diversity, its proximity to the city.

666
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:22,011
And I was thrilled, first and foremost, for the ADU state law.

667
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:32,795
I would love someday to turn my two-car garage that's just full of junk right now into an ADU and have my parents come live and ultimately have multi-generational living together in our single-family house.

668
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:33,435
That's the dream.

669
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,056
I know it can be realized here in Medford.

670
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:35,656
Thank you.

671
01:05:35,676 --> 01:05:42,378
I mostly want to ask about, what was the term that you used?

672
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,860
The percentage of the lot sizes that can be taken up.

673
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,621
with these changes in zoning.

674
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:50,282
And maybe that's not part of this.

675
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:59,647
Maybe the setbacks and percentage of the lots that a building can occupy is already in stone and is not going to change.

676
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:05,090
But something I really like about walking around my neighborhood is the amount of green space.

677
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:12,194
And so I would hate, I don't mind if the house next to me is, you know,

678
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,292
I would mind a little bit.

679
01:06:15,273 --> 01:06:29,564
In the interest of growth and sharing our land with those who also want to live here, I wouldn't mind if it was turned into a two-unit dwelling, but I would mind if it took up 90% of the lot.

680
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:33,227
I currently live in a zone that would be up-zoned to NR2.

681
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:41,298
I've pulled up my table of dimensional standards.

682
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:55,208
So we're currently looking at building coverage maximums of 50% for all the neighborhood residential and 60% for the urban residential again it's draft.

683
01:06:55,668 --> 01:06:57,569
We also think green space is important.

684
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:16,262
There is a pervious surface requirement of 30% for the neighborhood residential 25% for the urban residential, and there's an open space minimum requirement of 20% of the lot for neighborhood residential and 15% for urban residential.

685
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:21,265
So, so, you know, open to hearing some more thoughts on that.

686
01:07:21,345 --> 01:07:23,426
We agree that having.

687
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:34,760
having the units having more space between them having that green space and certainly with the city's priorities for addressing climate change and sustainability that's important.

688
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:41,548
These would obviously change if these were the mixed use areas change a little bit more, depending on that for example.

689
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:50,380
Mystic Avenue is much more coverage, but they also have to do other things in order to offset that.

690
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:53,624
Is this online somewhere that I can dig into a little bit more?

691
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:55,607
I apologize, I came up and asked the question.

692
01:07:57,389 --> 01:07:58,689
I can check.

693
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,570
If it's not, Kit or I will request it to be.

694
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:06,191
And I can tell you that the short URL is medfordma.org slash zoning.

695
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:07,811
So I'm on that like every day.

696
01:08:08,232 --> 01:08:14,573
And I would like to, I think when you do your math, it's confusing to people who don't know what these words all mean.

697
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:20,374
Can you explain how the building coverage max can be 50% but the open space minimum is 20%?

698
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:21,675
Why isn't that 50%?

699
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:23,655
Right, exactly.

700
01:08:23,715 --> 01:08:25,336
So then we've got the pervious surface.

701
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:26,336
So pervious surface.

702
01:08:27,516 --> 01:08:27,816
Thank you.

703
01:08:28,277 --> 01:08:33,501
I love the fact that Alicia is calling me out on this because we rattle these terms off all the time and we don't think about it.

704
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:36,583
Pervious means that water can soak through it.

705
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:48,211
So generally when you get a paved area, so for say parking, it's asphalt, the water runs off, it creates flooding either in the street or sometimes on a neighbor's property.

706
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:49,432
We don't want to allow that.

707
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:59,637
So if you think of a lot and you've sat across the setbacks and you get a building envelope, that's the area in which a building can be built.

708
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:09,682
So you take the total lot, 50% of it, no more than 50% of it can be the building, but you still have to have driveway, parking, and all of that.

709
01:09:09,722 --> 01:09:18,426
So the pervious surface, there's a restriction on how much can be impervious with water runoff.

710
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:21,288
and how much can be pervious with the water soaking in.

711
01:09:21,728 --> 01:09:29,334
And then the open space is a minimum requirement, so you can't go below 20% rather than a maximum requirement.

712
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:32,876
So we would love it if you have more open space, but you at least can't go below 20% on that.

713
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:34,237
Got it.

714
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:39,642
OK, yeah, I would love more transparency or just like easier access to that information.

715
01:09:39,662 --> 01:09:45,366
I think that that will, I don't know, alleviate some fears maybe a little bit.

716
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:57,956
I tend to think that what it feels like when you walk around in, again, in residential areas where it's single family zoned currently, the green space matters more than how many people are actually living in that building.

717
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:00,418
So thank you very much for the answer.

718
01:10:00,438 --> 01:10:00,838
Appreciate it.

719
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:01,339
Thanks.

720
01:10:03,296 --> 01:10:05,738
You will go to Louise on Zoom.

721
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,123
You got it.

722
01:10:10,383 --> 01:10:12,145
Hi, this is Mark Davidson.

723
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:17,450
This is my wife's computer, 63 West Street.

724
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:24,797
I know we had a discussion last night about ADUs, although I'm interested in hearing that

725
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:42,323
Emily had brought up a number of ADU issues, and Council President Beyers also talked about the fact that there are so many single-family homes that have only two occupants.

726
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:53,086
Historically, they'd been larger families, and the schematics that were shown earlier in this meeting showed

727
01:10:53,886 --> 01:11:06,503
detached ADUs or first floor ADUs, and there hasn't, as far as I know, been a lot of discussion yet on second and third floor ADUs.

728
01:11:09,568 --> 01:11:10,509
I understand that that

729
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:15,031
There's egress issues associated with that.

730
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:32,336
But I'd like to see if there are some changes in the works for accommodating ADUs that are within the building on the second or third floor of some of the older homes in Medford.

731
01:11:32,356 --> 01:11:34,997
I appreciate your comments on that.

732
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:35,917
Thanks.

733
01:11:38,983 --> 01:11:53,173
Thank you very much for your comments, if we if the diagrams in any way, sought to risk, or look like they were restricting the position of at us within the existing building I apologize that was not the intent.

734
01:11:53,553 --> 01:11:59,117
We're just showing those sort of wire framed out to say that there was a principal building and you could have a detached.

735
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:07,883
As far as I remember from what we've worked on, there's no restrictions on where the AD you would be within that existing dwelling.

736
01:12:08,043 --> 01:12:17,651
So, I hope that alleviates the concerns as I said we're looking forward to bringing the full draft in later but no there's no there's no restriction that I know of on those at this point.

737
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:19,392
Yeah, one thing.

738
01:12:19,652 --> 01:12:27,438
So one thing that's changing and it's partly because of the state law right now from the recodification and attached at you can be done by right.

739
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:30,555
but a detached 80 requires a special permit.

740
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,597
This will move both to a buy right status, which is one change.

741
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:39,999
One thing we do need to look at when you mentioned egress is I think we actually have talked about building code.

742
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:48,622
It may require a second form of egress, but this is where it differs from a second principal unit on the same lot.

743
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:50,563
I don't think it needs a second

744
01:12:51,563 --> 01:12:55,325
I don't think you have to have two separate doors outside of the building.

745
01:12:55,345 --> 01:13:00,107
I'm not 100% sure on that, but I think that might be a building code thing, not a zoning thing.

746
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:02,027
And we're going to, we could look at that.

747
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:07,890
And that's the state building code that we function under.

748
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:11,480
Yeah.

749
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,521
Okay, Cheryl.

750
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:18,065
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, home of the Density Without the Transit.

751
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:21,547
So, and much more is coming to us thanks to this zoning.

752
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:36,959
The neighborhood residential one, based on what the city council and the consultants have said they are interested in, the neighborhood one zone shouldn't exist if you want to add more density, especially since these areas will change so much more slowly than the neighborhood three.

753
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:38,139
zones.

754
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:44,161
So there's really no need to preserve a zone that only allows single families for decades to come.

755
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:52,462
If density is good for the community, then why are the densest areas allowing the most density on the smallest lots of only 3K?

756
01:13:52,943 --> 01:14:06,406
While those with lots 40% larger or more will have very low density and are being zoned to maintain the least density with 5,000 square foot minimum by allowing only single family homes with the state required ADU.

757
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:12,892
Those areas should take more density to give those of us already dense some breathing room.

758
01:14:13,352 --> 01:14:15,414
We, too, have neighborhood character.

759
01:14:15,795 --> 01:14:17,496
We, too, would like to be considered.

760
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:29,789
It is not logical to say that it's because you can't add housing or parking when you're saying you can put three family homes on 3K lots with parking.

761
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:54,273
there should be a minimum two family allowed on every residential lot in the city, and the ADU, as you said, does not count towards that, especially since some of those lots limited to one or two units are within the transit circles, while Glenwood may one day get a bus that will take us to the areas with transit and remain less dense than us while also enjoying that transit.

762
01:14:55,368 --> 01:15:04,196
With the exception of the one ring of UR1 near Tufts, we find ourselves more or equally dense to those with easy transit access.

763
01:15:04,937 --> 01:15:20,851
In addition to the 140 lot Salem Street corridor that just passed, Glenwood has a very predatory flipper in our neighborhood who is making so much money in our neighborhood alone that he opened a storefront on Salem Street.

764
01:15:21,712 --> 01:15:31,903
so he doesn't have to travel far to go to work, along with owning four other Salem Street parcels where he can now build six floors on his slightly over 3,000 square foot lots.

765
01:15:32,884 --> 01:15:34,706
So we will see lots of change.

766
01:15:34,966 --> 01:15:38,470
It will not take decades for our area to be transformed.

767
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,891
This is a guarantee.

768
01:15:40,572 --> 01:15:46,594
So we hope that perhaps the neighborhoods where this will happen much more slowly can at least take some of the weight.

769
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:52,796
Please acknowledge that we are a neighborhood, that we do have character, that we do live here, that we like to breathe.

770
01:15:52,976 --> 01:15:53,836
We like oxygen.

771
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:55,117
We like trees.

772
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,258
So maybe you could have considered that.

773
01:15:58,398 --> 01:16:09,942
But I realize this is already passed the Community Development Board, and after the treatment that Salem Street Corridor got, with the suggestions being wiped away with a single motion by Matt Lemming, my neighborhood is not holding out much hope.

774
01:16:10,563 --> 01:16:17,666
We are very disheartened that we are being dismissed in favor of pushing your density in our area and not others.

775
01:16:18,226 --> 01:16:18,526
Thank you.

776
01:16:28,195 --> 01:16:31,376
Thank you very much for your comments on the neighborhood one district.

777
01:16:32,336 --> 01:16:41,818
That's the first time I think in this group that we've heard the idea of adding more density to that so obviously we'll take that into consideration with the others.

778
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:53,241
And then as you say the Salem has already passed but I will just note that as we are going through all of the districts so we're taking them geographically and also topically.

779
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:59,306
One of the things that we've talked about at the city with the city is that as we finish up all of the districts.

780
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:11,457
We do need to go back and see if there are any changes that need to be made we've learned we're learning as we touch each new geography, we're learning more and so there will be a kind of cleanup at the end.

781
01:17:12,017 --> 01:17:16,420
And so some of the things that we've looked at in the past may change.

782
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:26,107
It's one of the reasons that I'm hoping those of you who are here in the room and maybe those of you who are online can email to the planning and planning department.

783
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:39,597
If there's any specific neighborhoods or anything specific parcels, where you see for the neighborhood boundaries and then later we will get to the mixed use where we've shown it one way and it should be another please do let us know what's very important.

784
01:17:39,757 --> 01:17:41,018
Thank you again for your comments.

785
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:53,176
Yeah, I just want to add to, um, that when we talk about this citywide rezoning, we are talking about densification in all districts and all neighborhoods.

786
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,642
I certainly could be amenable to the argument that the NR one district should be an NR two district.

787
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,383
I'm not against that.

788
01:18:01,483 --> 01:18:15,331
I think where we came in with this proposal was looking at existing structures, what's already there, the number of private ways, topography, and, you know, the NR one lot size.

789
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:17,572
I mean, so we're reducing lot size minimums.

790
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:19,773
Excuse me, excuse me, thank you.

791
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:26,917
we're reducing lot size minimums, we are reducing setbacks, we're increasing maximum coverage even in the NR1.

792
01:18:27,017 --> 01:18:33,140
There are lots up there, right now in the SF1, it's a 7,000 lot size minimum.

793
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,983
So that's the most, that is the biggest lot size minimum in the whole city.

794
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:43,986
So the NR1 does increase density in those NR1 districts.

795
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:45,947
Yes, it does.

796
01:18:46,407 --> 01:18:47,609
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

797
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:49,231
They said this is a conversation.

798
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:51,013
So I'm just gonna finish it.

799
01:18:51,033 --> 01:18:55,699
So if I interrupt you, so you can correct me and you're if you could just let me finish.

800
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:56,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

801
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,741
I thought this was community input.

802
01:18:57,841 --> 01:18:58,602
I think it is.

803
01:18:58,682 --> 01:19:00,424
Is it a conversation or community input?

804
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:01,306
Or is it yell at me day?

805
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:02,687
I'm not yelling at you.

806
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:03,909
I'm speaking into a microphone.

807
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:12,671
Is it interrupt me time because I let you have your piece I'd like to have my piece increasing density in the nr one zone because it's still only allowing the same amount of housing.

808
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:20,353
The lots are not going to be parsed, it will be the exact same amount of housing, because it's 5000 square foot minimum.

809
01:19:20,613 --> 01:19:28,115
So if they have a 7000 square foot lot they can still only put a single family home in the nr three and maybe this is confusing for you.

810
01:19:28,475 --> 01:19:57,902
in the nr3 you only need a 3 000 square foot lot to put three families currently you need more than that to put a single and even more than that to put a two so we're going down to three we have lots of 3 000 square foot lots there will be lots of density added to our area which you saw in the map that showed the current conditions because nelson has been buying lots and doubling the housing on them and selling them for a million plus each so please

811
01:19:58,482 --> 01:20:05,588
can I finish please be honest when you speak if you can be honest that would be great because I can go toe to toe with you on the zoning because I've read it.

812
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:06,749
I've read it.

813
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,531
Yeah, I've read it.

814
01:20:08,551 --> 01:20:10,753
So we're trying to have a discussion conversation.

815
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:16,098
I don't think throwing around accusations of dishonesty and interrupting me is going to help us to do that.

816
01:20:18,038 --> 01:20:19,579
So you can't counter anything that I've said.

817
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:21,760
Well, I already was, but you interrupted me, so.

818
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,122
No, you just said there'll be single family homes on 5,000 square foot lots.

819
01:20:25,222 --> 01:20:26,003
All right.

820
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:27,043
You know, if it's not worth it.

821
01:20:27,063 --> 01:20:27,864
He's not answering.

822
01:20:28,064 --> 01:20:31,446
If anyone else wants to discuss this issue with me, I'm happy to discuss it with you.

823
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:36,188
If anyone wants to ask a reasonable question and have a dialogue with me, I'm happy to have it, but.

824
01:20:38,089 --> 01:20:39,310
I'm not sure what you're.

825
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:43,152
I'd like to start off by saying that she didn't know much.

826
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:47,595
The four units in war,

827
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:50,178
Yeah, I'm not disputing that.

828
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:52,259
I'm not.

829
01:20:53,240 --> 01:21:00,546
My point being, if I could finish my point, was that this plan is about increasing density in every part of the city.

830
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:03,848
Every district proposed generally does that.

831
01:21:03,988 --> 01:21:09,613
And if you look at the existing conditions map, that is one of the reasons that districts were drawn the way they were drawn.

832
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:10,333
Thank you.

833
01:21:14,256 --> 01:21:16,959
It reduces lot size minimums, reduces setbacks.

834
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:26,847
So one of the things that we need to look at and the kind of feedback that is very useful is what do people think of the ones that are proposed?

835
01:21:27,788 --> 01:21:33,894
We're looking at so part of the NR1 zone right now has 7,000 square feet minimums and some has 5,000.

836
01:21:35,295 --> 01:21:37,997
The current proposal on the table is 5,000.

837
01:21:38,878 --> 01:21:47,625
If you and others would like to respectfully propose suggestions, like you'd like to see it be a smaller, like 4,000 or 3,000, we're happy to hear that.

838
01:21:47,706 --> 01:21:58,194
It is extraordinarily hard to hear accusations when we're trying to, we'd love your suggestions and we'd like to know how it impacts you in your neighborhood.

839
01:21:58,655 --> 01:21:59,776
We'd love to hear that.

840
01:21:59,836 --> 01:22:00,957
That is very helpful.

841
01:22:02,332 --> 01:22:05,255
So I would like to move on to the next person.

842
01:22:05,615 --> 01:22:08,057
So we do have one more online.

843
01:22:08,438 --> 01:22:13,903
Hi, this is Chris.

844
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:16,085
I got also on my wife's zoom.

845
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:21,169
I just had a follow up question from a few questions back where.

846
01:22:22,191 --> 01:22:28,133
You guys mentioned that the earliest possible would be for approval was, I believe, April 16th.

847
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:39,778
So does that mean that my neighbor or developer on April 17th can go and get a permit and then start building as soon as the permit's approved?

848
01:22:42,205 --> 01:22:44,907
So I'll actually offer some clarifications.

849
01:22:45,147 --> 01:22:46,949
Zoning is very interesting.

850
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:53,773
And actually, sorry, I have a mild correction, but the city council public hearing is advertised for April 29th.

851
01:22:54,014 --> 01:22:57,536
So the earliest is April 29th, that it could be passed.

852
01:22:57,736 --> 01:22:59,498
It can't be passed before then.

853
01:22:59,938 --> 01:23:02,780
And it may or may not, like they could choose to table it.

854
01:23:03,801 --> 01:23:06,303
The way zoning works is that

855
01:23:07,203 --> 01:23:16,917
Usually, people are afraid that people will hear that we're discussing a zoning change, and usually the first time they'll hear about it is when it's publicly advertised.

856
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:23,126
And so then they'll try and slip something in and get a building permit before the zoning is actually changed.

857
01:23:23,966 --> 01:23:36,074
So the law is actually designed to prevent that, which actually means that the zoning is retroactive to the date that it is first advertised to prevent this sort of like slipping things in.

858
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:40,336
So what it actually means, so this hasn't been, so this has been advertised.

859
01:23:40,977 --> 01:23:49,642
So the date that this has been advertised, if it is passed the way it was advertised, is the date that they can apply for building permits.

860
01:23:50,843 --> 01:24:04,874
there's a weird limbo window between it's been advertised but not passed and the building department is going to do their best to not approve any building permits during that window because they don't actually know what will exactly be passed.

861
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:15,123
But you could apply right now under this new zoning code, but what I'm saying is you wouldn't get your permit until the permit, the code is passed.

862
01:24:16,003 --> 01:24:39,826
And then presumably if what was advertised changes as a result of this meeting or the Community Development Board hearing, or indeed the city council's approval, a developer who has filed that permit runs the risk of the rules actually changing on them right because we could reduce the lot size minimum or increase it for that matter and their permit would therefore not be valid.

863
01:24:40,426 --> 01:24:40,607
Right.

864
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:42,728
just checking.

865
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:45,472
Sorry, it's that's very technical in the weeds.

866
01:24:45,653 --> 01:24:48,117
Should we go to the sorry, I took your job.

867
01:24:48,157 --> 01:24:49,038
I can't help myself.

868
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:53,204
Hi, I'm Judy Weinstock at 144 Burgett.

869
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:56,045
Thank you for this meeting.

870
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,286
It's really appreciated.

871
01:24:58,047 --> 01:24:59,027
So just a couple of things.

872
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,329
And some of you have already heard from me on this.

873
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:05,111
I'm in what would become a UR1, I think.

874
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:12,936
And I stand with Laurel in terms of it hadn't actually occurred to me around the idea of expanding the UR1.

875
01:25:15,438 --> 01:25:22,646
in an effort to not drive so much potential developer activity to one very small area.

876
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:24,568
Interesting idea.

877
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:35,740
But I will say that I feel fairly certain that density, which I will tell you is a word I don't actually like because it's completely undefined, it is not a quantitative

878
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,562
measure, it is a qualitative measure.

879
01:25:39,262 --> 01:25:46,965
One day, maybe you'll measure it, but you're not measuring it now, and you can't predict what it will be as a result of these changes.

880
01:25:48,965 --> 01:26:03,190
I will say that the UR1, I think the part of it that bothers me living in that, as opposed to an NR3, is the idea of developers coming in and buying multiple lots and then erecting buildings, which actually

881
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:16,224
does drive up the cost because developers will pay more for lots than an average buyer will because they know there's good money in it if they can sell six lots on what had otherwise been a two-family home.

882
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:18,745
And they will make a lot of money at it.

883
01:26:18,785 --> 01:26:21,886
So I would caution you are one at all

884
01:26:22,706 --> 01:26:29,709
In neighborhoods where my lot size is 4,000 square feet, most of my neighbors, it's 4,000 square feet or less.

885
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:42,175
So I think that the multiplex idea is the one that actually disturbs me the most in the UR1 classification, because it's the one that invites developers in.

886
01:26:42,735 --> 01:26:47,137
And it's the one that will actually drive up cost in the neighborhood overall.

887
01:26:47,157 --> 01:26:49,038
I'm not talking about per unit pricing.

888
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:51,419
I'm talking about overall land pricing.

889
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:54,382
right, which drives housing prices.

890
01:26:55,103 --> 01:26:56,044
So that's number one.

891
01:26:56,145 --> 01:27:04,796
I would implore you to really consider you either, I guess you either expand UR1 and take out the option of four to six multiplex, which you could do.

892
01:27:05,257 --> 01:27:08,341
And maybe that just is then defined as an NR3.

893
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:09,242
I don't know.

894
01:27:10,203 --> 01:27:22,789
Yeah, but I do think that will be the developer driven activity in any of the neighborhoods that are designated as URs, because developers will come in and they will, they'll do that work really efficiently.

895
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:34,054
The other thing that I would like to do is ask if perhaps it's Alicia, I'm not sure, can define what can be done in a single family home like mine,

896
01:27:35,057 --> 01:27:42,263
that actually is considered historic, but may actually fall down someday, even though it's designated as historic.

897
01:27:42,344 --> 01:27:44,545
Even historic homes sometimes need to be destroyed.

898
01:27:46,307 --> 01:27:49,150
What will an individual homeowner still be able to do?

899
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:57,157
I have asked this question at another meeting where I felt like maybe I totally misunderstood the exclusion of new family

900
01:27:57,777 --> 01:27:59,400
single family home builds.

901
01:28:00,262 --> 01:28:08,679
So I think that I heard, maybe I'm wrong, that if there's an empty lot or an empty home that gets

902
01:28:09,808 --> 01:28:37,054
bought an entirely empty lot, that you wouldn't permit single family homes on that lot under UR1, but that if I wanted to raise my house, which by the way, I don't, if I wanted to raise it because it's decrepit and falling apart, hasn't burned to the ground, no catastrophic flooding, would I be able to rebuild a single family home on my lot?

903
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,574
since I currently own it.

904
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:51,643
So I think those are my two clarifications that I need on what the single family home exclusion means under UR1 and also would argue that multiplexes are going to do exactly the opposite of what you hope.

905
01:28:53,637 --> 01:28:54,137
Well, thank you.

906
01:28:54,157 --> 01:28:57,600
We appreciate the thoughts on the multiplex.

907
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:00,543
It's really helpful to hear the concerns with that.

908
01:29:02,264 --> 01:29:12,012
So the idea is that there are uses, and when you have a use, if that use is an existing use, you can continue that use.

909
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:27,194
you could take and I have to tell you in our experience in the city of Medford, we've not dealt with this in residential before, but we see it very not infrequently for like, uh, storefronts and businesses like that, right?

910
01:29:27,635 --> 01:29:29,155
That it's a use.

911
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:36,996
It's not allowed at that location, but it exists and somebody else comes in and wants to continue that use at that location, and that is allowed.

912
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,677
So right so you can sell your single family house.

913
01:29:40,017 --> 01:29:41,917
You can renovate your single family house.

914
01:29:42,537 --> 01:29:45,900
And if you want to tear it down and put it back, you can.

915
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:53,847
But if you tear it down and leave the property vacant for two or more years, then you have lost the right to do that.

916
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:59,832
So it's this continuous use and having it not be

917
01:30:01,512 --> 01:30:06,719
that there was a lot of controversy over the word abandoned, but abandoned is literally in our zoning.

918
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,865
And that is when you don't use it for multiple years.

919
01:30:11,185 --> 01:30:16,333
So if that house was vacant for many years, we might then actually have an argument over it.

920
01:30:17,214 --> 01:30:21,738
And the example we were using is a gas station that was vacant for 10 years.

921
01:30:22,138 --> 01:30:25,381
And they said, well, I still have the right because the gas station still exists.

922
01:30:25,401 --> 01:30:28,324
And we said, no, you've let that use lapse.

923
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:38,073
So there would be an argument that if the single family house was allowed to stand vacant for two or more years, that it would lose the use and the protection.

924
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:40,347
What if I sold it to Mike?

925
01:30:40,627 --> 01:30:48,389
He could do it, but as long as you didn't have this vacancy for more than two years, where the under construction doesn't count, right?

926
01:30:48,849 --> 01:30:52,230
So you have the house, the property.

927
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:53,150
You move out.

928
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:59,032
It takes him a year to pull his building permit and start construction in two years to finish.

929
01:30:59,452 --> 01:31:00,212
That's fine.

930
01:31:00,432 --> 01:31:03,373
It was the year before he pulled the building permit.

931
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:13,737
And once he had it there are I will say though i'm not an expert on building permit rules There are limits to how long they're good for and I can't speak to that off the top of my head.

932
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:29,445
Um, they do eventually Hit limits and you have to say like here's why it's taking so long and I need to I need extensions You know, we've literally seen people pull a building permit and then do nothing for years That's that's not okay.

933
01:31:29,605 --> 01:31:31,786
Those those expire there rules around that but

934
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:43,561
I think that's a lot of good clarity about what single family homeowners will still be permitted to do under certain circumstances that aren't just catastrophic circumstances.

935
01:31:43,681 --> 01:31:46,324
And I think just to add to it, we also have something

936
01:31:47,192 --> 01:31:59,002
let's say we did a UR1, but you wanted to expand your single family, that's now a pre-existing non-conforming use and structure, then you can go up to 150% of the status that it was before.

937
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:05,066
So you could still even add an addition to a single family, even under the UR1, but there would be some limitations.

938
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:12,532
Thank you.

939
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:14,214
Ren Bean on Zoom.

940
01:32:16,775 --> 01:32:19,299
Yeah, hi, uh, run being 37 Woodrow Avenue.

941
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:25,267
Um, I just, uh, wanted to, uh, attempt to, uh,

942
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:37,339
agree with some things I heard earlier, which I was a little surprised with, and add to the idea that I think the NR1 lot minimum should come down to 4,000.

943
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:47,005
To me, it doesn't seem particularly logical that zoning would allow buildings with more units on a smaller parcel.

944
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,847
I think if that's big enough for two, it should be big enough for one.

945
01:32:49,867 --> 01:32:52,489
I don't see any reason to pose that restriction.

946
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,230
personally.

947
01:32:54,590 --> 01:33:00,973
And I think there even could be an argument for just kind of anything that's NR1, just make it NR2.

948
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:17,041
I think the city may get more mileage out of allowing lots that are currently single families to become double family units, whether that's two-decker or split in a kind of a different configuration, non-historical conversion.

949
01:33:19,723 --> 01:33:22,847
It's just given the number of lots that fall under that category.

950
01:33:22,907 --> 01:33:28,055
I heard the thing about topography and narrow roads, but I'll tell you, I live in an area that is a lot of

951
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,584
two family units, single family units, a couple mixed in.

952
01:33:34,044 --> 01:33:40,626
It's that little slice that's going to be an NR3 on the west side of 93 there near Medford Square.

953
01:33:41,066 --> 01:33:49,629
And the vibe of the neighborhood is not that different than the rest of Lawrence Estates, which is going to be left as NR1 on the northern part.

954
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:51,950
I just don't see any real

955
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,430
reason for that.

956
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:59,572
Like some people may feel strongly that they want to preserve neighborhood character, but I would say come walk around the neighborhoods with two family units.

957
01:33:59,612 --> 01:34:01,072
They really don't feel that different.

958
01:34:01,692 --> 01:34:06,334
And that may add more to our housing stock over the broad swath of land that it covers.

959
01:34:07,594 --> 01:34:18,417
You know, I hear the piece about narrow streets, but like most of the units that are there have driveways and curb parking that could accommodate even the parking minimums that we have, which

960
01:34:19,857 --> 01:34:20,798
even if left in place.

961
01:34:21,298 --> 01:34:33,062
I think the city could probably absorb that personally, but at the very least, I think the very large lots on the north side of West Medford that are being left as NR1 should definitely be NR2.

962
01:34:34,482 --> 01:34:36,503
They have plenty of space.

963
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:38,984
I happen to agree with that comment particularly.

964
01:34:39,364 --> 01:34:41,785
It may not be as near transit, but

965
01:34:42,905 --> 01:34:45,806
You know, we certainly want to encourage transit-oriented development.

966
01:34:45,827 --> 01:34:50,969
The reality is a lot of the pressures in the housing market are commuters to Boston, and that's just not really going to change anytime soon.

967
01:34:51,349 --> 01:34:55,371
So we may as well allow the build to occur where the market will drive it.

968
01:34:56,412 --> 01:35:01,474
And I agree with the general sentiment that that will help us closely match supply with demand.

969
01:35:02,055 --> 01:35:08,258
And one last question for the single-family owners that end up getting zoned into a unit.

970
01:35:09,438 --> 01:35:13,159
a zoning where a single family is now non-conforming use.

971
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:32,624
I think I understood the answer where if you wanted to basically tear down and rebuild the same structure that you have, but if someone were to pull a permit for an addition, let's say they wanted to add another bedroom or something to make space for grandparents or something that want to live in the house, it's not an accessory dwelling unit.

972
01:35:32,884 --> 01:35:38,245
Would they have to go through the Zoning Board of Appeals now and should the city consider maybe adding

973
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:44,972
some kind of grandfather clause for those people, you know, to skip that part of the process, because that can be cumbersome.

974
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:51,880
And I don't imagine the ZBA really, they'd probably stamp them all if I had to guess, you know, but that's going to clog up the works potentially.

975
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,402
So that's just a thought.

976
01:35:53,662 --> 01:35:54,043
Thank you very much.

977
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:02,404
Thank you very much for your comments on on the nr one and your thoughts around that really appreciate.

978
01:36:03,545 --> 01:36:07,408
Again, this is exactly the sort of input that we're looking for is these comments and questions.

979
01:36:07,948 --> 01:36:19,616
I am delighted to say that the city already has some language around non conforming single and two family residential structures and I thought it might come up so I've got it in front of me it's section

980
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:47,144
94-5.5 and it says that non-conforming, there's a lot of it, but the one I'm going to read to you now is non-conforming single and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the building commissioner, so not the Zoning Board of Appeals, that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the non-conforming nature of said structure,

981
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:51,967
and adds not more than 100% to its gross floor area.

982
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:56,890
And then there's a definition of what those permissible changes are.

983
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:07,277
And then language that basically says that the building commissioner says you don't meet those conditions, then it would have to go to the Board of Appeals.

984
01:37:07,437 --> 01:37:10,079
So there is already some language in there.

985
01:37:10,519 --> 01:37:13,041
We've talked about whether or not that gets

986
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:18,335
expanded maybe to a three family unit as well.

987
01:37:18,736 --> 01:37:21,945
But for the moment, there is that provision in there now.

988
01:37:25,552 --> 01:37:30,014
for those online, I just dropped a link to that ordinance in there.

989
01:37:30,454 --> 01:37:52,063
And I did actually just want to comment that when people have a chance to see these maps again that have the existing conditions, what most people in Medford don't realize that if you walk up Forest Street from Medford Square away from Medford Square towards the rotary, most of those buildings on your right are at least two family houses, if not more dense than that.

990
01:37:52,563 --> 01:37:55,724
and the ones on your left are almost all single-family houses.

991
01:37:56,024 --> 01:37:58,485
But as you walk up that street, you don't realize that.

992
01:37:58,805 --> 01:38:04,708
And I just think that's really an interesting perspective for people to think about, and the map will really show you that.

993
01:38:07,469 --> 01:38:08,569
We go to the next question.

994
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:10,010
There's a gentleman at the podium.

995
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:12,311
Hi, my name is Mike Korzynski.

996
01:38:12,371 --> 01:38:15,772
I'm at 149 Burgdorf in Medford, and I am

997
01:38:16,753 --> 01:38:21,576
What will is potentially to be the, you are one district by the green line stop.

998
01:38:22,216 --> 01:38:32,922
I guess my comment is tonight that I know, you know, this is probably a major zoning like this seems to maybe happen once or twice an hour, maybe three times in a lifetime.

999
01:38:32,942 --> 01:38:36,444
And this is maybe the first major rezoning in Medford in 30 years.

1000
01:38:37,905 --> 01:38:47,671
And I think when I see that and this idea that zoning isn't perfect, where we're trying, I believe you're in good faith trying to get it right, but I know that's difficult to do.

1001
01:38:48,768 --> 01:38:56,111
And when I look at the 2020 recalification and the errors that were introduced some minor errors introduced there that you didn't try to correct in 2023.

1002
01:38:56,431 --> 01:39:01,513
And I think you know it's never going to be perfect and so it should always be more permissive rather than less permissive.

1003
01:39:02,013 --> 01:39:10,917
And so I think like these are the idea of these districts like the you are one where you're not going to allow a single family home is by right is concerning to me, because

1004
01:39:12,345 --> 01:39:23,129
frankly, from dealing with the OCD office through multiple projects with Tufts, you know, I lost a lot of faith in Tufts as a developer, but I also lost a lot of faith in the city.

1005
01:39:23,669 --> 01:39:30,932
And I don't want to, I don't want to deal with having to come back and ask for a correction in the zoning later or anything like that.

1006
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:32,353
I just want to be able to

1007
01:39:34,131 --> 01:39:35,172
live by right right.

1008
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:44,120
So I think more permissive permissive zoning more permissive building options and all our districts are better for, you know, future homeowners in Medford as well.

1009
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:53,649
And so I just I would urge you guys for at least, whether it be to, you know, quality and our three or allow single family and

1010
01:39:55,019 --> 01:39:55,740
You are one.

1011
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:03,185
I'm not sure I care, but I think just taking away, having that by right is a detriment to an area I live in.

1012
01:40:03,385 --> 01:40:07,227
And I just hope you do consider that.

1013
01:40:07,388 --> 01:40:07,648
Thanks.

1014
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:10,530
Great, thank you.

1015
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,070
Thank you.

1016
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,831
Thank you very much.

1017
01:40:14,332 --> 01:40:17,535
Okay, so there's another on Zoom, Sharon.

1018
01:40:18,956 --> 01:40:19,736
Sharon Diesso.

1019
01:40:20,337 --> 01:40:21,397
Somebody knows her name.

1020
01:40:21,597 --> 01:40:22,018
There you go.

1021
01:40:26,195 --> 01:40:26,755
Did you get it?

1022
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:27,756
Did I get it?

1023
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:29,617
We'll do it at the same time.

1024
01:40:29,697 --> 01:40:35,280
It's when they unmute and you mute.

1025
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,301
That happened too many times.

1026
01:40:38,142 --> 01:40:39,923
Sharon, we're requesting that you unmute.

1027
01:40:40,483 --> 01:40:41,303
Sharon Diesso.

1028
01:40:48,806 --> 01:40:50,888
Sharon, we'll ask one more time and then we'll come back to you.

1029
01:40:50,908 --> 01:40:53,329
We're pressing the ask unmute button.

1030
01:40:53,369 --> 01:40:56,632
There should be a pop up on your screen that says unmute.

1031
01:40:57,272 --> 01:41:00,535
And then when you click that, you will be able to hear you.

1032
01:41:05,647 --> 01:41:07,289
We're going to come back to you, Sharon.

1033
01:41:07,309 --> 01:41:09,351
So we'll go to Andrew McRobert on Zoom.

1034
01:41:09,491 --> 01:41:10,672
Andrew, name and address.

1035
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:11,693
Oh, sorry.

1036
01:41:12,434 --> 01:41:13,015
Wrong meeting.

1037
01:41:13,035 --> 01:41:19,721
You don't actually have to give your names and address, but it is helpful for us to understand where in the city you live.

1038
01:41:20,202 --> 01:41:22,444
And often we just know that when you say the address.

1039
01:41:22,524 --> 01:41:25,567
It's amazing when you realize a new instinct.

1040
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,911
Hi, I'm Andrew.

1041
01:41:28,931 --> 01:41:31,553
I live on Kenmere Road in Glenwood.

1042
01:41:31,953 --> 01:41:33,013
My question is two parts.

1043
01:41:33,354 --> 01:41:41,439
First of all, what is the process of, for example, a convenience store opening up in a neighborhood residential district?

1044
01:41:41,919 --> 01:41:43,060
And second,

1045
01:41:43,880 --> 01:42:08,438
does it make sense to incorporate mx1 zones or some other zoning that makes can make those things by right and to certain corners that are are high traffic in those areas and to give a little context of where this question is coming from um so glenwood is an r3 under these uh this proposal uh yeah has a lot of tightly packed two and three family homes that would be well served in that that are well served by

1046
01:42:08,978 --> 01:42:17,482
corner stores and cafes that aren't necessarily as far as Salem Street for some of us closer on the Wellington side of Glenwood.

1047
01:42:18,462 --> 01:42:23,624
Some that come to mind are on the corner of Central and Spring, which is near Morrison Park.

1048
01:42:23,784 --> 01:42:31,407
We have Classic Cafe on one corner and on the opposite corner there's another commercial building with a couple of businesses there.

1049
01:42:33,648 --> 01:42:36,389
I think classic cafe is mixed use.

1050
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:44,451
If I look at it right, it looks like a house with a cafe connected to it.

1051
01:42:44,871 --> 01:42:46,952
Another one that comes to mind is Magoon and Spring.

1052
01:42:48,032 --> 01:42:54,974
There's Neighborhood Kitchen, Spring Street, Supret there, a great little neighborhood convenience store.

1053
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:12,414
would love to have more of those things accessible close to, you know, within walking distance without having to necessarily go north to Salem or south to Wellington.

1054
01:43:12,434 --> 01:43:14,657
And yeah, that's it.

1055
01:43:16,959 --> 01:43:19,361
So I'm practically grabbing the mic.

1056
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:33,690
Thank you for asking that question and Spring Street and McComb Street is actually one of the ones I looked at as an example of what I'm about to talk to you about in the comprehensive plan and so one of the things that we are

1057
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:48,140
discussing and bringing forward I think later in the commercial areas discussion is this idea of the neighborhood hubs exactly what you're talking about existing commercial that neighborhoods are relying on.

1058
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:53,764
We're trying to figure out exactly how to continue to those allow those.

1059
01:43:55,025 --> 01:44:02,750
Is it just the areas that exist now is it a combination of different street types when they cross at intersections.

1060
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:19,721
What should the rules be around those we wanted to make sure that we talked about the neighborhood districts first, and also about the commercial areas or the mixed use areas next and then that comes in at the end of it so we absolutely have not forgotten about those smaller

1061
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:21,582
neighborhood level commercial.

1062
01:44:21,662 --> 01:44:24,104
I'm really glad you brought it up during this process.

1063
01:44:24,144 --> 01:44:28,046
So I would expect towards the end of April, maybe is about when we'd be talking about that.

1064
01:44:28,126 --> 01:44:28,707
So thank you.

1065
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:31,749
Okay, that's great to hear.

1066
01:44:31,769 --> 01:44:33,330
That's going to be under consideration.

1067
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:33,710
Thank you.

1068
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:39,165
I currently Campbell Hagerty 49 Elmont Street.

1069
01:44:40,006 --> 01:44:56,715
I'm here tonight because I just work completely against changing the current zoning to urban one or two, you are one you are two, which has already been started to be discussing to change our neighborhoods at the last commit Community Development Board meeting before we even had input.

1070
01:44:57,616 --> 01:44:58,917
And this is a constant.

1071
01:44:59,717 --> 01:45:06,000
thing that happens in the city is the boards and everyone are already making decisions before you listen to the community.

1072
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:24,949
So I'm here tonight to say, definitely not either one of those in the neighborhood, the Salem Street quarter is one of the densest sections of Medford, and we don't need or want any more density in my neighborhood, our neighborhood, and especially since the city hasn't done the work to show how that will affect us day to day.

1073
01:45:25,829 --> 01:45:26,650
We don't know.

1074
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:35,352
especially in the capital plan, which recommended shuttle studies, parking studies, infrastructure studies.

1075
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:39,053
Everyone keeps talking density, density, density.

1076
01:45:39,213 --> 01:45:41,314
That's going to fix the housing crisis.

1077
01:45:42,114 --> 01:45:43,354
It's not.

1078
01:45:44,295 --> 01:45:46,675
So that's all I have to say.

1079
01:45:48,256 --> 01:45:49,116
Thank you very much.

1080
01:45:53,777 --> 01:45:55,478
Sharon, we're going to try you again on Zoom.

1081
01:45:55,578 --> 01:45:56,738
We're asking that you unmute.

1082
01:45:58,817 --> 01:46:00,818
Kit has requested that you unmute.

1083
01:46:09,141 --> 01:46:09,962
We're going to try again.

1084
01:46:09,982 --> 01:46:13,683
You should see a pop up, and there should be a blue button that says unmute.

1085
01:46:15,644 --> 01:46:17,485
We can't make you unmute, sadly.

1086
01:46:17,505 --> 01:46:20,706
We can't.

1087
01:46:20,786 --> 01:46:24,688
Well, it would solve this problem.

1088
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:29,643
Maybe if she doesn't, we go back to the podium and then come back to her.

1089
01:46:29,803 --> 01:46:30,144
Yeah.

1090
01:46:30,164 --> 01:46:32,090
All right, Sharon, we're going to come back to you again.

1091
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,413
Go to the podium.

1092
01:46:35,912 --> 01:46:38,054
Thank you.

1093
01:46:38,554 --> 01:46:44,859
I just wanted to address the myths that neighborhood residential one does not increase density.

1094
01:46:45,079 --> 01:46:45,980
That's actually a myth.

1095
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:56,167
And the reason is that by state law, one could actually build one accessory dwelling unit in those slots that goes up to 900 square feet.

1096
01:46:57,508 --> 01:47:00,569
So 900 square feet is actually a two bedroom apartment.

1097
01:47:01,429 --> 01:47:12,471
And the way the zoning is being proposed in NR1, one could actually build a second ADU by special permit that goes up to 1,200 square feet.

1098
01:47:12,891 --> 01:47:20,973
So if we add those of them together, that's 2,100 square feet, which is considerably bigger than the house that I live in, which will be in NR1.

1099
01:47:22,133 --> 01:47:37,168
And so we're effectively talking about potentially building a second dwelling, which would be two ADUs combined that is larger than a lot of the houses that are currently in NR1.

1100
01:47:37,248 --> 01:47:42,573
So that, to me, sounds like a pretty substantial increase in density in NR1.

1101
01:47:46,317 --> 01:48:03,551
What I wanted to also ask is whether the restrictions that one has in lots in terms of open space, permeability, et cetera, would apply to someone trying to build, for example, a 2,100 combined two ADUs.

1102
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:06,854
Is that correct?

1103
01:48:06,874 --> 01:48:13,280
Because I know that we touched upon that subject yesterday evening, and I was discussing with Paula outside.

1104
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:20,748
She was very helpful, but it wasn't completely clear, in particular, on the second local ADU whether this would apply.

1105
01:48:21,588 --> 01:48:25,412
So if we would like to discuss this later, that's totally fine.

1106
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:29,997
But I was just wondering whether that would be helpful to mention right now or not.

1107
01:48:30,621 --> 01:48:44,148
Yeah, I'm smiling because this is a discussion we've been having internally of, we got to ask another question of well what happens if somebody says the current houses at you and then we build another house behind it.

1108
01:48:44,628 --> 01:49:00,116
What happens if we make the at you bigger than the principal building and then is it really an accessory dwelling unit after all and obviously the state at you is limited in size, the special permit at you that local option could be limited in size.

1109
01:49:01,037 --> 01:49:16,718
We are, Alicia mentioned at the beginning that we are working with a lawyer on this and we've asked him several legal questions about ADUs so we haven't gotten those back yet, but I think that goes to some of this idea of

1110
01:49:17,299 --> 01:49:42,775
whether uh you know how you combine it again an accessory dwelling unit is supposed to be accessory to the principal dwelling unit right so if suddenly you're adding on too many then what is the actual accessory unit and then the other thing about the accessory dwelling unit it is supposed to be limited in size to be smaller than the principal dwelling unit so it's a good question i think we're still working out the details on those um and

1111
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:57,767
if you have a, does the city allow one ADU under the state law, the protected ADU, and a second by special permit or as a right or how they want to do that?

1112
01:49:57,967 --> 01:50:00,549
So we'll take that question into consideration.

1113
01:50:00,849 --> 01:50:03,331
I'm glad that you spoke to Paola as well.

1114
01:50:04,152 --> 01:50:06,493
Yeah, she was very helpful, definitely.

1115
01:50:06,873 --> 01:50:16,918
So to me, the fact that you can build like one up to 900 or half of the size of the house, which is smaller, and then the second one by special plan would be 1200.

1116
01:50:17,478 --> 01:50:24,161
I see that as a loophole to sort of build again, as I mentioned, those two combined would be considered bigger than my current house.

1117
01:50:24,541 --> 01:50:32,025
So I see as a loophole to basically add an extra unit to whichever larger, you know, maximum number of units are allowed in that district.

1118
01:50:32,905 --> 01:50:48,008
And someone mentioned yesterday that, you know, back when they were younger, they actually had the job and then they were renting, I believe it was a 300 square foot, very minimal sort of a studio because they worked all the time and then they were there just to sleep.

1119
01:50:48,468 --> 01:50:49,628
So they didn't need a lot of space.

1120
01:50:49,648 --> 01:50:53,669
And then we're renting that for $200 a month, which obviously, after inflation, wouldn't apply anymore.

1121
01:50:54,129 --> 01:51:00,171
But I think that's the kind of housing that would be very helpful to have, in addition to something much bigger, too.

1122
01:51:00,231 --> 01:51:03,912
But I'm saying a broad array of sizes.

1123
01:51:04,432 --> 01:51:16,134
And my concern is that, are we going to achieve that with the accessory dwelling units that now will turn into something that, as you mentioned, is not an accessory anymore?

1124
01:51:18,595 --> 01:51:29,124
I think we should keep in mind that we should try to have the larger, the most breadth possible in terms of, you know, very small dwellings and also, you know, big dwellings.

1125
01:51:30,105 --> 01:51:33,448
So we can sort of have possibilities for everyone.

1126
01:51:34,865 --> 01:51:39,727
And we were working in a couple of different communities, as you can imagine, on similar issues.

1127
01:51:39,847 --> 01:51:47,290
And one question that was raised at one point is, at what point does the accessory dwelling unit actually become a two-unit dwelling?

1128
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:51,712
And I think that's where the size restrictions and some of the other restrictions come in.

1129
01:51:51,732 --> 01:51:54,333
So you're saying this really is an accessory, as opposed to

1130
01:51:55,653 --> 01:51:57,774
you just have a two-unit dwelling.

1131
01:51:57,814 --> 01:52:02,476
This is the one I'm thinking of as a rural community where they already have two-unit dwellings as of right.

1132
01:52:02,896 --> 01:52:04,217
And so there's a difference there.

1133
01:52:04,597 --> 01:52:10,700
I think the other thing that starts to get confusing is in the state law, they talk about the ADUs don't contribute to the density.

1134
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:14,942
And the definition of density that's used at that point is either

1135
01:52:15,362 --> 01:52:20,484
dwelling units per acre, which is a common measure, or dwelling units per lot.

1136
01:52:20,624 --> 01:52:36,169
And so if we're thinking NR1 is one principal dwelling unit per lot, but then you have an ADU, yes, there's two dwelling units on the lot, but in terms of official density, when you have density regulations, it would be one dwelling unit per lot.

1137
01:52:36,209 --> 01:52:37,389
Again, getting into the weeds,

1138
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:38,890
I don't know if that's the right way to put it.

1139
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:49,155
But I hear what you're saying about how do we how do we establish the different size ranges for some of these units to give that that variety of housing that we were talking about earlier in this conversation?

1140
01:52:49,615 --> 01:52:49,796
Okay.

1141
01:52:49,816 --> 01:52:50,756
Thank you for clarification.

1142
01:52:51,777 --> 01:53:00,081
Regardless of what the definition is, I think you know if a lot of people are the 900 square feet, which again is a two bedroom apartment or 1200 square feet, which is a three

1143
01:53:03,763 --> 01:53:09,384
we can argue about the definition, but I would say that that does increase the density on the field that that one would fill.

1144
01:53:09,444 --> 01:53:10,385
Anyways, thanks so much.

1145
01:53:10,405 --> 01:53:10,985
That was very helpful.

1146
01:53:11,005 --> 01:53:12,745
I just wanted to add, unless you want to go first.

1147
01:53:12,785 --> 01:53:22,588
I was just going to give a quick that we are also, I talk regularly with developers who are looking to build bigger buildings, and I have, and they say, what is the city looking for?

1148
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:26,609
And we are actively encouraging them that we want smaller units,

1149
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:44,299
more units that are smaller is what we're looking for because we know there are a lot of people who have three and four and five people living in a three and four family or three and four bedroom apartment in a two-family house and we'd love to see them move into their own apartments

1150
01:53:45,119 --> 01:54:14,149
and allow that house that that apartment with four bedrooms to be freed up for an actual family that needs to rent and and to sort of make the balance that way we have a lot of larger units that exist in in the city so we do ask them every day for smaller units we ask around we've been pushing for more senior apartments things suited for seniors and for graduate students and postdocs and and people like that who might be looking for smaller units

1151
01:54:14,409 --> 01:54:15,449
that's great.

1152
01:54:15,609 --> 01:54:15,809
Right.

1153
01:54:15,929 --> 01:54:21,071
And that's when we in the people who are flipping individual houses don't come in and meet with me.

1154
01:54:21,251 --> 01:54:23,472
Even when I asked them to, they don't need to.

1155
01:54:23,832 --> 01:54:31,814
People who are building larger buildings need to go through things like site plan review, and they do need to meet with the city and they have to work with us.

1156
01:54:32,154 --> 01:54:34,755
So we have a lot of really productive conversations with them.

1157
01:54:35,996 --> 01:54:36,316
Thank you.

1158
01:54:37,276 --> 01:54:41,357
I for one am grateful for anyone who's living in the unit with more than two people in it.

1159
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:42,918
Because that's

1160
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:46,891
that we're going to have to make sure that we're helping the cause when we're we have such a unit shortage.

1161
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:47,411
Um.

1162
01:54:48,992 --> 01:54:54,794
And you actually just raised an important point that I think maybe we need to factor into the multiplex discussion, which is if we're going to allow them.

1163
01:54:55,614 --> 01:54:57,835
Do they end up qualifying under site plan review?

1164
01:54:57,895 --> 01:54:59,976
And then there's a higher threshold of regulation.

1165
01:55:00,136 --> 01:55:04,858
So you maybe wouldn't have them coming in and just going with through.

1166
01:55:04,918 --> 01:55:06,959
So just all of these different thoughts that we've

1167
01:55:13,828 --> 01:55:19,209
I would hope that that's subject to our open space and lot coverage requirements.

1168
01:55:19,409 --> 01:55:34,712
I don't know if the state mandated one can't be less permissive than the single family, but that would mean that on the lot you still could have a maximum lot coverage of 50% and that would include the principal and accessory structure.

1169
01:55:34,772 --> 01:55:36,412
So that I think is something important.

1170
01:55:37,313 --> 01:55:38,493
And then for me, the second

1171
01:55:40,812 --> 01:56:05,493
The question of the second ADU, how I envision it as a test case, and I think, you know, and I'm not necessarily saying that everyone else on the council or the community development board or in this process would agree with me, would be that you could have, say, like a 900 square foot attached ADU, and then say you had a pre-existing carriage house or structure, that maybe that would be something that would qualify under a special permit for some reason.

1172
01:56:05,913 --> 01:56:06,413
that we're trying to do.

1173
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:19,803
I don't think that's the intent, but I tend to agree with you that it would be a loophole if you could build a two unit 2100 square foot livable area structure behind your 1200 square foot house and call it an accessory unit, and I don't think that's the.

1174
01:56:20,424 --> 01:56:26,068
You know, intent of what we're trying to do so, making sure that we match the idea of a

1175
01:56:33,194 --> 01:56:40,019
it's something I definitely and I hope we could ask to maybe Jonathan about just making sure around the dimensional requirements as well.

1176
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:41,480
Thanks so much.

1177
01:56:41,921 --> 01:56:51,228
Right now, site plan review is required for six or more units, including conversion of existing dwelling to contain six or more units.

1178
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:55,271
So but that's a number that the city established at some point.

1179
01:56:55,632 --> 01:56:57,794
So any building that's gonna be six or more units

1180
01:56:58,494 --> 01:57:01,078
They have to go through something that's called site plan review.

1181
01:57:01,138 --> 01:57:03,681
I see some faces going like, what is that?

1182
01:57:03,761 --> 01:57:04,963
So I'm just going to explain.

1183
01:57:06,865 --> 01:57:08,928
It's where you have to come in front of.

1184
01:57:09,008 --> 01:57:12,653
It's a publicly advertised meeting, but it's not a public hearing.

1185
01:57:12,873 --> 01:57:13,874
It's a public meeting.

1186
01:57:14,635 --> 01:57:32,443
And you have to submit all kinds of information about the outside of your building, what is your trees and your permeable stuff, and how are you treating lighting, and what kind of paths and sidewalks and bicycle infrastructure and all of that, and architectural features.

1187
01:57:32,943 --> 01:57:42,627
And the CD board, this community development board, which tends to, it's a appointed board, we try to have planners, architects, engineers, transportation planners,

1188
01:57:43,147 --> 01:57:44,268
you're not allowed to build the building.

1189
01:57:44,288 --> 01:57:49,672
But they can say, Well, we'd really like to see you connect the sidewalk over here, and we'd really like to see that be grass, not turf.

1190
01:57:49,753 --> 01:57:51,594
And this is what we'd like.

1191
01:57:51,774 --> 01:57:53,375
And that's what we're trying to do.

1192
01:57:53,395 --> 01:57:55,017
We're trying to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1193
01:57:55,037 --> 01:57:57,879
We're trying to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1194
01:57:57,919 --> 01:58:00,041
We're trying to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1195
01:58:00,321 --> 01:58:02,443
We're trying to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1196
01:58:02,463 --> 01:58:04,585
We're trying to make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1197
01:58:05,385 --> 01:58:09,206
Most of the time, the developers work with us and come to some sort of agreement.

1198
01:58:09,527 --> 01:58:14,368
So if they say, no, we absolutely refuse, then it becomes a little bit difficult.

1199
01:58:14,448 --> 01:58:18,270
But most developers will sort of say, oh, OK, that makes sense.

1200
01:58:18,310 --> 01:58:21,631
Or they might say, I can't do that, but what if I did this?

1201
01:58:22,251 --> 01:58:24,632
And so it's sort of a negotiation with the board.

1202
01:58:25,192 --> 01:58:32,335
And we typically find that developers walk away saying, well, that was helpful, because I didn't know those things were important in the city of Medford.

1203
01:58:32,935 --> 01:58:42,997
and they thought of things that I didn't think about, and often we will have immediate neighbors come and speak about what they would like to see and how they would like things to connect.

1204
01:58:43,937 --> 01:58:49,638
So that is a process that's already built in, and that board meets twice a month with these hearings, so.

1205
01:58:50,559 --> 01:58:56,840
Yeah, and I just wanted to throw in, and I know we've said not long answers and this has been another long answer, but the

1206
01:58:58,003 --> 01:59:05,596
I think one of the things we're trying to balance here too is what is the threshold where more process is beneficial and what is the threshold where more process is harmful.

1207
01:59:05,997 --> 01:59:07,500
And I think like Judy and Mike raised.

1208
01:59:09,335 --> 01:59:20,879
if you take the single family out of the UR1, you might not be creating more process for a small property owner versus when you have a six unit threshold versus a five unit or a four unit threshold for site plan review.

1209
01:59:21,579 --> 01:59:25,760
At what point is that impacting what we would consider a small property owner versus a developer, right?

1210
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:33,083
And that's kind of another one of these, you know, spectrum where we're like hitting, nearing a threshold and like what

1211
01:59:33,801 --> 01:59:36,268
What is the definition that best fits?

1212
01:59:36,428 --> 01:59:40,339
And I think that's just some of the conversations and considerations that we're taking into account.

1213
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:50,031
All right, hello, William LaVar, Bedford Street.

1214
01:59:50,451 --> 01:59:53,692
I'll just echo quickly the NR1 in Northwest Bedford.

1215
01:59:54,032 --> 01:59:57,553
I really think that could go up to NR2, because indeed the lots are kind of big, I guess.

1216
01:59:58,513 --> 02:00:04,954
Another thing I want to say is just on this idea, if we want smaller units, I'm really very nervous about any per unit burden we have.

1217
02:00:05,335 --> 02:00:12,656
If you want more smaller units, then if you do the same building and divide it into fewer, bigger units, you don't have to do site plan review.

1218
02:00:12,676 --> 02:00:14,657
That's like an incentive to do more smaller, sorry.

1219
02:00:16,577 --> 02:00:19,079
fewer, bigger units in the same kind of building.

1220
02:00:19,099 --> 02:00:20,840
So that seems the opposite of what we want.

1221
02:00:21,561 --> 02:00:22,742
Maybe it shouldn't be units at all.

1222
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:27,965
Maybe it should be like square feet, or floors, or whatever, something other than units.

1223
02:00:28,445 --> 02:00:31,668
If you want lots of units, don't put extra process when they put lots of units.

1224
02:00:33,569 --> 02:00:35,170
If you want small units,

1225
02:00:37,124 --> 02:00:42,186
If you're worried about big projects by square footage, that's a different issue than big projects by number of units.

1226
02:00:44,526 --> 02:00:55,110
And with that, mainly I want to ask about, could we consider in some of these districts, especially the UR1 and UR2, going above just three stories?

1227
02:00:56,290 --> 02:01:02,412
I wonder, I suspect that most of the time that that's not going to work out for various reasons, not a pencil out.

1228
02:01:03,212 --> 02:01:10,315
But the few rare circumstance where it does pencil out, won't that very often be an elevator building?

1229
02:01:10,435 --> 02:01:15,557
And won't that help with accessibility, in addition to helping the housing shortage a little bit more?

1230
02:01:20,703 --> 02:01:23,724
As Gaston mentioned, you got a variety of sizes desirable.

1231
02:01:23,844 --> 02:01:26,005
It's like six units across four stories.

1232
02:01:26,826 --> 02:01:31,809
If you do all six units in four stories, probably going to have some variation in unit size, which is pretty cool, I think.

1233
02:01:34,910 --> 02:01:46,597
Basically, I'm interested to hear about how the zoning code interacts with the building code, both in good and bad ways when we talk about allowing four-story buildings, for example.

1234
02:01:47,717 --> 02:02:00,221
And am I right, or do I have, am I on the right track, that three-story buildings might lead, sorry, greater than three-story buildings might lead to more elevator buildings and help with accessibility?

1235
02:02:00,421 --> 02:02:02,422
I'm wondering, am I on the right track there?

1236
02:02:02,622 --> 02:02:02,922
Thank you.

1237
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,521
I will address part of the height.

1238
02:02:11,141 --> 02:02:15,803
So the height map should be outside of what the current heights are.

1239
02:02:16,183 --> 02:02:29,448
We were really looking at keeping the UR1 and UR2 to keep it that transitional piece from the neighborhood to the mixed use, keeping it pretty much to the three-story height that's already there.

1240
02:02:29,888 --> 02:02:31,989
You can get more units by more massing.

1241
02:02:32,529 --> 02:02:38,193
Obviously the building envelope that I mentioned earlier, the setbacks, the percentages would keep that down somewhat.

1242
02:02:38,234 --> 02:02:40,175
So it sets that balance of control.

1243
02:02:40,655 --> 02:02:45,659
Our thought was that as you got into the mixed use districts, that's where you see the height transitioning up.

1244
02:02:46,039 --> 02:02:58,889
And that means if you're going from a two and a half story in the neighborhood districts to a three story in the urban districts, the urban residential districts, to four or more in the mixed use districts, then you get to have that transitional height.

1245
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:02,371
There are building code implications for height.

1246
02:03:02,471 --> 02:03:07,592
I'm not even going to pretend to know the detailed level of that.

1247
02:03:07,652 --> 02:03:11,133
But I do know that it comes into effect as you transition heights.

1248
02:03:12,013 --> 02:03:19,114
Elevators, other access, sprinkler, which is also for not just building height, but number of units in it.

1249
02:03:20,495 --> 02:03:23,315
And of course, construction style.

1250
02:03:23,335 --> 02:03:26,836
At a certain point, you can't do stick built anymore.

1251
02:03:26,876 --> 02:03:28,797
You have to move to concrete and steel.

1252
02:03:30,157 --> 02:03:47,847
believe that's above six but I'm not positive so don't quote me on that so certainly what you can do under zoning is sometimes constrained by the building code and vice versa and it is an it's an important thing to know if you're going to develop the property, so we've sometimes run into some surprising conflicts.

1253
02:03:49,053 --> 02:04:01,537
Yeah, I think one of them is the, I can never remember exactly the thing, but the single stairwell versus the double stairwell where, because you can't, you can basically, you can't have apartments with a cross breeze anymore because of the building code.

1254
02:04:01,837 --> 02:04:04,198
But I think that state building code, and I don't think there's really anything.

1255
02:04:04,218 --> 02:04:05,398
Right, that state building code.

1256
02:04:05,418 --> 02:04:11,280
So it's possible that could change, the zoning could outlast, you know, whatever the current building code is.

1257
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,821
That's possible.

1258
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:13,681
Yeah, totally.

1259
02:04:15,241 --> 02:04:17,162
But no, and you know, it makes me think,

1260
02:04:19,364 --> 02:04:26,363
The more that we're having the conversations, the more I wonder if we need to add one more step of gradient or if we need to shift everything up.

1261
02:04:27,497 --> 02:04:52,411
And you know i'd be interested again in the discussion with the community development board Like should there be an nr4 or if we end up getting rid of nr, you know Does nr2 become nr1, you know i'm just saying if we end up getting rid of nr1 and then that down shifts But then should there be a ur1 2 and 3 and then maybe in the one you allow the single family And so it just a little bit changes the scope of what we're talking about.

1262
02:04:52,431 --> 02:04:52,471
Um

1263
02:04:53,712 --> 02:05:04,561
But I'm just wondering if we got the gradient a little too constrained, and either need to shift upshifted or add another step somewhere to better meet what some of the comments we're hearing.

1264
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:13,368
I'll say one more thing and that is that when it comes to the restricting that just to that sort of MX type of districts, I don't think we're having any, you know,

1265
02:05:15,089 --> 02:05:19,472
The word is eluding me, but we don't have a district that looks like a big area of MX, right?

1266
02:05:19,592 --> 02:05:26,758
It's just like little, I don't think we have like full blocks or we have like five blocks of, you know, a two, a four by four block or something of MX.

1267
02:05:26,778 --> 02:05:28,279
We're talking about pretty small areas.

1268
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:34,083
So that's, that's, you know, that means that overall the city, we don't have any big blob of where you could have more than other than.

1269
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:40,102
we don't have a big area, you know, you know, it's only little bits and pieces to get at.

1270
02:05:40,442 --> 02:05:57,289
And I think just like I think we're going to hit this rubber is going to beat the road, especially on the Main Street, Medford Street corridor, where you do have the mixed use, but maybe it would make sense to have a you are three with an incentive zone because you might want to have four story all residential facing the main corridor.

1271
02:05:57,949 --> 02:06:01,131
And so I think that's something we maybe want to think about too.

1272
02:06:01,731 --> 02:06:03,392
Or maybe it's four to six.

1273
02:06:03,432 --> 02:06:03,732
I don't know.

1274
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:07,426
Well, and just to add to that, we have gradations in the mixed use, right?

1275
02:06:07,446 --> 02:06:09,228
There's a mix one, a mix two, a mix three.

1276
02:06:09,288 --> 02:06:14,753
So now we have a neighborhood one, two, three, a UR one and two, a mix one, two, three.

1277
02:06:15,413 --> 02:06:16,895
Should there be a UR three?

1278
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:18,336
And how do we do that?

1279
02:06:18,716 --> 02:06:22,079
As you say, maybe what we're calling neighborhood one now.

1280
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:28,545
if we hear more testimony that that should become NR2, then we rejigger the districts a little bit.

1281
02:06:28,645 --> 02:06:37,052
So yeah, I think there's absolutely options for rethinking, you know, what each one means and then where it's applied.

1282
02:06:37,092 --> 02:06:38,434
So which is why we're here tonight.

1283
02:06:38,634 --> 02:06:42,597
And maybe we don't get rid of all of NR1, a portion of NR1, but you added NR4.

1284
02:06:44,077 --> 02:06:47,701
And that could replace this UR1 in the burgadab area, right?

1285
02:06:47,781 --> 02:06:53,908
So maybe you would allow four, but you wouldn't allow the multiplex, and it meets more of that lot question.

1286
02:06:55,758 --> 02:06:56,098
Hi, guys.

1287
02:06:56,518 --> 02:06:57,359
My name is Anne Hegarty.

1288
02:06:57,519 --> 02:06:59,960
I live on Sagamore Park over in West Medford.

1289
02:07:01,161 --> 02:07:05,283
We bought our house in 1996, and we love the neighborhood.

1290
02:07:06,244 --> 02:07:08,005
It is a lot of single-family homes.

1291
02:07:08,405 --> 02:07:12,887
Our street is the park, which is between Grove Street and Sagamore Ave.

1292
02:07:13,247 --> 02:07:14,228
It's a small street.

1293
02:07:15,028 --> 02:07:20,531
And the proposal is for that particular area to become an NR3.

1294
02:07:22,292 --> 02:07:30,317
So currently, the square footage minimum is 7,000 square feet to make it a legal buildable lot.

1295
02:07:30,717 --> 02:07:31,478
It's going to drop down to 3,000.

1296
02:07:31,938 --> 02:07:47,087
So does that mean that if somebody has a 12,000 square foot lot, they sell their house, could a developer tear down that, break it up into four 3,000 square foot properties?

1297
02:07:48,648 --> 02:07:51,210
So I don't know if you've driven Grove Street

1298
02:07:52,050 --> 02:07:54,912
There's no street parking on Grove Street.

1299
02:07:56,132 --> 02:08:10,320
So several years ago, 2015, we had all the snow, and our emergency vehicles couldn't get down Sagamore Park because people were parked on both sides going to the commuter rail.

1300
02:08:11,141 --> 02:08:15,223
And so they put up signs, and now you have to have the permit.

1301
02:08:15,243 --> 02:08:21,587
If residents are going to be building upwards of four units in a conversion in that area,

1302
02:08:22,373 --> 02:08:28,318
on Grove and they don't have parking on the lot, where are they going to park?

1303
02:08:29,739 --> 02:08:43,409
Yeah, and that's one of the things that we're going to do a parking discussion specifically around the parking table and how it would apply to all the new zones in May.

1304
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:49,634
One of the things that I am really pushing that we include is that if

1305
02:08:51,932 --> 02:08:59,496
If you can't meet a certain parking minimum on a new construction that the units can't get parking permits for the street.

1306
02:09:00,317 --> 02:09:05,400
So essentially, it would be to say in this new construction, and it would, you know.

1307
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:15,520
there's where you're gonna have one off-street parking spot per unit, and you will not have access to permit parking on the public way.

1308
02:09:16,601 --> 02:09:24,444
And that's been effective in other communities where they've, they're essentially trying to say, you're 1,500 feet from the commuter rail.

1309
02:09:25,225 --> 02:09:35,670
We're trying to have this be people who, either a family with a single car or a carless family, and you can't park on the public way because that's not what this structure is designed for.

1310
02:09:36,257 --> 02:09:37,958
But realistically, you can't control for that.

1311
02:09:38,018 --> 02:09:44,521
And if they commute with their car, they're not going to have a problem during the week, it'll be on the weekend when they're loading up the side streets.

1312
02:09:45,402 --> 02:09:49,444
Yeah, I mean, I think that's a, you know, I think you can control for it by parking control, right?

1313
02:09:49,464 --> 02:09:54,527
I mean, if they're on the street, without a permit, they would be ticketed on the weekend ticket.

1314
02:09:54,547 --> 02:10:00,250
Currently in Medford, the parking permits are six days a week.

1315
02:10:01,733 --> 02:10:02,434
Oh, yes.

1316
02:10:03,054 --> 02:10:04,895
Yeah, it's six days a week on our street.

1317
02:10:06,577 --> 02:10:07,057
So what?

1318
02:10:07,237 --> 02:10:09,078
So I'm on the traffic commission.

1319
02:10:09,138 --> 02:10:17,905
So what I we have been learning is that in Medford, every single street that has had parking except for let's not let's set aside the green green line zone.

1320
02:10:18,385 --> 02:10:43,974
which is brand new zone every single street that has residential permit parking has come to the traffic commission over the last 70 years and requested permit parking and put in front of them these are the hours we would like permit parking and these are the days of the week that we would like it and so there is a huge variety out there but they all limit monday through friday most of them limit saturday some of them limit sundays

1321
02:10:44,754 --> 02:10:52,082
Um, there are, in fact, some streets right near here that only require permit parking from 8 to 8 a.m.

1322
02:10:52,162 --> 02:10:54,924
till noon Monday through Friday.

1323
02:10:54,945 --> 02:11:01,071
So those are very much clearly designed to prevent people from parking there and getting on the commuter rail.

1324
02:11:01,651 --> 02:11:09,573
which is fascinating to me as a planner and environmentalist who would like people to use the commuter rail while you're away at work.

1325
02:11:09,953 --> 02:11:11,973
We'd like them to park there and use the commuter rail.

1326
02:11:12,494 --> 02:11:15,574
That said, we have been trying to standardize.

1327
02:11:15,954 --> 02:11:26,877
So if a group comes in now and asks for their street to be permit parking, it is going to be six days a week, and it's going to be 24 hours during those six days.

1328
02:11:27,337 --> 02:11:30,898
What we're hoping to do is to move more and more of the city to the zones

1329
02:11:31,458 --> 02:11:49,068
so that you have this zone that your permit would work in the region where your house is, but not anywhere in the city, so that you could park on the side street near you or the cross street, because it's kind of all over the place right now.

1330
02:11:49,308 --> 02:11:49,568
Yeah.

1331
02:11:49,628 --> 02:11:54,971
I mean, one of our book club members is a nurse, and she's had her driveway partially blocked.

1332
02:11:55,031 --> 02:11:57,693
She can't get out because there's too many cars.

1333
02:11:58,873 --> 02:12:00,255
right next to her driveway.

1334
02:12:01,356 --> 02:12:02,477
So that's a concern.

1335
02:12:02,497 --> 02:12:13,189
I don't know if there's room to shift the edges of the NR3 designation for that area versus NR2, because to me, looking at the numbers, NR3 isn't

1336
02:12:14,610 --> 02:12:26,825
radically different in terms of the lot size requirements, the setbacks, the number of units within the building if you do a historic conversion from UR1s and UR2s.

1337
02:12:27,486 --> 02:12:30,329
It's going to change that neighborhood potentially.

1338
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:45,489
And we've walked across High Street with our dog into the other neighborhood and watched many properties be sold, torn down, multi-million dollar condos built up.

1339
02:12:46,190 --> 02:12:48,873
I'm afraid this is going to incent developers.

1340
02:12:49,454 --> 02:12:50,435
to do just that.

1341
02:12:51,415 --> 02:12:55,898
Medford's actually doing, I was curious, how are we doing with housing permits?

1342
02:12:55,938 --> 02:13:06,525
And so I went on to that Massachusetts Housing Partnership website, and I compared Arlington, Malden, Melrose, Medford, and Somerville.

1343
02:13:07,266 --> 02:13:10,147
And it's astonishing the difference for Medford.

1344
02:13:10,628 --> 02:13:13,790
We are rock stars right now in terms of compared to them.

1345
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:15,511
I'm like, what more work?

1346
02:13:17,863 --> 02:13:20,504
The site you're referring to is Residence City, right?

1347
02:13:20,524 --> 02:13:20,604
Yeah.

1348
02:13:21,204 --> 02:13:24,505
That's a very valuable site for people interested in.

1349
02:13:24,526 --> 02:13:27,046
And look at the other town.

1350
02:13:28,167 --> 02:13:28,427
Yeah.

1351
02:13:30,707 --> 02:13:31,968
Looks like it's mostly fixed.

1352
02:13:32,768 --> 02:13:35,889
It probably is, because the community is residential.

1353
02:13:36,289 --> 02:13:38,030
It's like residential density.

1354
02:13:46,694 --> 02:13:48,915
I'm sorry.

1355
02:13:58,700 --> 02:13:59,080
I'm sorry.

1356
02:14:07,762 --> 02:14:18,365
So I'm just showing Zach the charts and the rest of the folks here the charts about some of the data related to, and it's a great site.

1357
02:14:18,865 --> 02:14:21,246
I'm a data geek, so you guys know that.

1358
02:14:21,666 --> 02:14:26,808
It's called ResiDensity, so R-E-S-I Density.

1359
02:14:27,308 --> 02:14:30,529
And it's put out by the Massachusetts Housing Partnership.

1360
02:14:31,829 --> 02:14:35,592
a whole lot of data on there that you can see town by town.

1361
02:14:36,072 --> 02:14:42,296
If you're interested, and you clearly are because you're here, I highly recommend it to see what they have.

1362
02:14:42,356 --> 02:14:43,657
It's a fantastic site.

1363
02:14:43,938 --> 02:14:47,840
They have actually won awards for the amount of information they've put out.

1364
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:49,481
So it's very, very useful.

1365
02:14:49,501 --> 02:14:50,362
Thank you for bringing it up.

1366
02:14:50,462 --> 02:14:54,705
And compare other neighboring towns, because that's what we're looking at.

1367
02:14:54,965 --> 02:14:59,708
If somebody can't buy in Medford, then they might buy in Arlington, or Somerville,

1368
02:15:00,889 --> 02:15:02,329
Right now, it's expensive to buy anywhere.

1369
02:15:02,349 --> 02:15:11,892
And I just, I'm a little afraid of losing some of the character of our immediate neighborhood.

1370
02:15:12,752 --> 02:15:14,772
I'm sorry.

1371
02:15:15,012 --> 02:15:16,173
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1372
02:15:16,633 --> 02:15:17,433
Yeah.

1373
02:15:17,653 --> 02:15:28,916
And I think one of the things, I think, considerations that we made when we're talking about where are the lines in West Medford is how the lines were drawn in the 60s under the last zoning.

1374
02:15:28,936 --> 02:15:30,096
And it was,

1375
02:15:31,757 --> 02:15:47,627
to be, I'm not to malign anyone who was involved in the process if they are still around, but it was very clear that the African American, historically African American neighborhood was put as a GR, three unit district, and the mostly white neighborhood was single family.

1376
02:15:48,148 --> 02:15:51,270
And I think the question is, where do you draw the line now?

1377
02:15:52,050 --> 02:15:56,894
Do you keep the line because the existing condition of the existing housing reflects that?

1378
02:15:57,693 --> 02:15:59,574
poor decision or not?

1379
02:15:59,694 --> 02:16:00,895
Oh yeah, without a doubt.

1380
02:16:01,836 --> 02:16:03,557
I totally agree with you.

1381
02:16:04,038 --> 02:16:11,683
And that neighborhood, a lot of the people that we visit with when we're walking our dog, their kids are not able to stay.

1382
02:16:12,684 --> 02:16:13,825
And that's unfortunate.

1383
02:16:13,925 --> 02:16:15,866
So definitely, more is better.

1384
02:16:16,367 --> 02:16:24,312
And just because of the dynamic of Grove Street not having on-street parking, I'm just worried about

1385
02:16:25,553 --> 02:16:32,297
filling up our street again with cars, and then we get a big snow weekend, snow year, and emergency vehicles came.

1386
02:16:32,477 --> 02:16:40,661
And I completely, I think it's like a totally, I was just raising that point to be like, when we were looking at these lines in this neighborhood, it was like, well, we can just keep the same line.

1387
02:16:40,681 --> 02:16:45,624
But then what are we, what dynamics are we reproducing that we don't want to be reproducing?

1388
02:16:46,424 --> 02:16:48,606
But yeah, I think there's a lot of other considerations.

1389
02:16:50,226 --> 02:16:52,928
And I'm going to go to Emily, who probably will say what those are.

1390
02:16:54,982 --> 02:17:01,747
Actually, what I was going to do is encourage you to go and talk to Paola on your way out and just show her the exact street so we can look at it.

1391
02:17:02,128 --> 02:17:07,752
I will say that I think we've probably lost Alicia and everybody online to residency at this point.

1392
02:17:10,534 --> 02:17:12,156
Sorry, Alicia, for calling you out.

1393
02:17:12,656 --> 02:17:14,838
It's all I can do not to reach over myself.

1394
02:17:16,789 --> 02:17:18,530
It's a problem when you have data geeks, right?

1395
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:20,450
It's like, oh, there's stuff.

1396
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:24,232
My degree is in economics.

1397
02:17:24,392 --> 02:17:27,533
So again, this is why we're having this conversation.

1398
02:17:27,593 --> 02:17:31,855
We've heard from several neighborhoods around saying, hey, look, you need to look a little deeper.

1399
02:17:31,875 --> 02:17:33,896
We want you to consider these things.

1400
02:17:34,036 --> 02:17:38,837
I think my mind is turning a little bit on some of the other controls that we can put in.

1401
02:17:39,238 --> 02:17:41,839
Certainly the permitting process is one of those.

1402
02:17:42,199 --> 02:17:44,960
The idea of maybe some additional gradation of districts.

1403
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:52,046
Um, uh, so, you know paul and I and our our team back at the office We'll get together and talk about what we've heard tonight.

1404
02:17:52,346 --> 02:18:01,854
Um, i'm sure she's got more to share with me as well from what she's heard Uh, and then as I said, this is the opportunity to come back and even if we can't get everything

1405
02:18:02,635 --> 02:18:06,718
and I think one of the things that has changed by April 2nd is the ability to say to the CD board.

1406
02:18:06,778 --> 02:18:08,079
We heard a number of things.

1407
02:18:08,479 --> 02:18:10,041
These are what we're still considering.

1408
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:12,723
So you know, we appreciate everything we've heard.

1409
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:15,745
Yeah well, I really appreciate what you guys I mean, I'm just thinking to through.

1410
02:18:16,586 --> 02:18:17,807
My lot is about 8400 square feet.

1411
02:18:17,827 --> 02:18:20,629
Um but my house is, I think 1600 square feet of 1st and 2nd

1412
02:18:34,333 --> 02:18:34,673
house.

1413
02:18:35,073 --> 02:18:39,856
That's my size house on a lot that's much smaller.

1414
02:18:40,657 --> 02:18:43,999
But 100%, I hear what you're saying.

1415
02:18:44,099 --> 02:18:49,843
I think one of the things that we do have to remember is that there's the other dimensional standards, right?

1416
02:18:50,043 --> 02:19:02,531
So if you take your 3,000 square foot lot and you've put in the setbacks, you've put in the requirements for the minimum open space, the requirements for the maximum building coverage,

1417
02:19:03,491 --> 02:19:08,594
The need to park on site, the required amount of parking required.

1418
02:19:08,874 --> 02:19:09,614
Yeah, exactly.

1419
02:19:09,694 --> 02:19:15,417
And so that's where as you start to build all these things out that building envelope starts to shrink a little bit.

1420
02:19:16,038 --> 02:19:21,961
And then you've also got the height limitation in there that's really, you know, if you've got the building footprint and then the height takes you up.

1421
02:19:22,321 --> 02:19:24,502
the height limitation is on the volume.

1422
02:19:24,522 --> 02:19:30,825
So not every building can be built on a 3,000 square foot lot.

1423
02:19:31,005 --> 02:19:33,226
So I think that's something to remember.

1424
02:19:33,346 --> 02:19:47,573
It's particularly more important in some ways in the mixed use districts, where you're having to do not just residential parking, but commercial parking, that there is a, you know, all of these factors working together start to limit the size.

1425
02:19:48,033 --> 02:19:51,395
But I hear you on the size of, you know, okay, is it a single family house?

1426
02:19:51,455 --> 02:19:51,935
Is a single

1427
02:19:52,095 --> 02:19:53,456
unit house with an ADU.

1428
02:19:53,516 --> 02:19:55,979
It would be three stories, potentially.

1429
02:19:56,119 --> 02:19:59,321
Yes, if the NR3, that's right, exactly.

1430
02:19:59,702 --> 02:20:01,623
That's a big little house.

1431
02:20:02,364 --> 02:20:10,731
It is, but then it's okay, is it... And having multiples on a lot that used to be a yard.

1432
02:20:11,532 --> 02:20:26,329
So what we've talked about internally in our team and not just for this project but for others is starting to think about what's the ideal lot size for different types of housing or different types of buildings that's conversation that we're having now and is that like, is it.

1433
02:20:27,250 --> 02:20:29,692
you can do a house of this size and 4000.

1434
02:20:29,732 --> 02:20:32,793
You can do that and 20,000 square feet.

1435
02:20:32,853 --> 02:20:36,135
You can do well, you know, there's there's also a limitation of the upper end.

1436
02:20:36,335 --> 02:20:41,538
So so I appreciate the concerns that you're bringing forward and we'll certainly be talking about.

1437
02:20:41,578 --> 02:20:41,958
Thank you.

1438
02:20:42,058 --> 02:20:42,399
Thank you.

1439
02:20:42,419 --> 02:20:45,380
And I think and just I wanted to make two other points.

1440
02:20:46,121 --> 02:20:47,161
Um, one.

1441
02:20:48,577 --> 02:20:59,967
The lot sizes and the development patterns themselves are tied into these historical dynamics and it's like, how do we have an equitable arrangement across the city, where a big chunk of the city has 3000 square foot lots.

1442
02:21:00,048 --> 02:21:05,292
Yeah, and another chunk of the city has five to eight to 9000 square foot lots and it's like, so

1443
02:21:06,253 --> 02:21:09,437
if we just maintain everything based on the existing lot size and condition.

1444
02:21:09,557 --> 02:21:12,821
So I think we're trying to factor all that into somewhat of a balance.

1445
02:21:13,201 --> 02:21:15,184
And then I think, and I'm not saying you're saying we're not.

1446
02:21:15,424 --> 02:21:17,426
Yeah, no, I'm not.

1447
02:21:17,446 --> 02:21:18,227
7,000 has been generous.

1448
02:21:18,468 --> 02:21:18,728
Yeah.

1449
02:21:19,409 --> 02:21:21,631
Dropping it down, I think is understandable.

1450
02:21:21,952 --> 02:21:22,492
Yeah.

1451
02:21:22,773 --> 02:21:23,594
It's less than half.

1452
02:21:23,634 --> 02:21:23,814
Right.

1453
02:21:24,214 --> 02:21:39,441
And I think one of the issues here is when we're drawing lines, one parcel's on one side of the line and one parcel's on the other side of the line, and there's gonna be disparate treatment between those two parcels, and that's where the most tension is, right?

1454
02:21:39,581 --> 02:21:48,666
And you're close to a line, so the tension point feels a little harder than someone who's in the center of a district, where it's like everyone around me is being treated exactly the same.

1455
02:21:49,466 --> 02:21:53,328
And that's another, I mean, Somerville got rid of that by saying triple-deckers everywhere.

1456
02:21:54,576 --> 02:21:57,004
which I don't think is the approach that we're taking.

1457
02:21:57,064 --> 02:21:58,168
And you know the neighborhood well.

1458
02:22:00,542 --> 02:22:01,143
Exactly.

1459
02:22:02,003 --> 02:22:09,208
I'm going to look into this data more too, because the interesting thing is on the population chart on the next page, that doesn't have the uptick.

1460
02:22:09,248 --> 02:22:12,009
The unit has the uptick, but the population chart doesn't have the uptick.

1461
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:25,418
And is that then a vacancy question, or is it a decreasing average household side question, where it's the point is like, yes, we've added all these units, but because your average household size is one to two people- You're selling million dollar condos to a couple.

1462
02:22:25,978 --> 02:22:26,558
Exactly.

1463
02:22:26,658 --> 02:22:32,382
And so it's like we could build 10,000 units and we could build 1,000 units and have no impact, but maybe 10,000 units does.

1464
02:22:33,042 --> 02:22:36,644
And it's actually the same amount of people living in the same place.

1465
02:22:37,304 --> 02:22:41,147
And so that's, I think- Because that's the thing, you can't control for who buys.

1466
02:22:41,387 --> 02:22:41,567
Right.

1467
02:22:42,047 --> 02:22:53,509
And yeah, and I mean, that's the other interesting piece too, is in the developments that we're seeing come in, it's studio one and two family, and the average unit size is 800 to 900 square feet in those developments, right?

1468
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:59,971
That's the type of housing, so that's why most of the new build is in those five plus units buildings.

1469
02:23:00,071 --> 02:23:07,272
So it's, yeah, it's as a fellow economics major, a fascinating set of conditions and equations.

1470
02:23:07,432 --> 02:23:08,113
Yeah, excellent.

1471
02:23:08,193 --> 02:23:09,593
All right, thank you guys, I appreciate it.

1472
02:23:11,954 --> 02:23:13,614
Come on up to the mic.

1473
02:23:14,274 --> 02:23:15,455
So this is quick, I hope.

1474
02:23:16,215 --> 02:23:18,456
So Judith is wicked smart, so is Laurel.

1475
02:23:18,796 --> 02:23:32,280
So the things they said about multiplexes and about retaining single families in my neighborhood, I think that would be really huge, just because it will allow for a type of development that I hope is to scale, like really to scale and meaningful.

1476
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:35,281
Now, we just spent six months working on this Tufts deal, right?

1477
02:23:35,941 --> 02:23:37,762
And a lot of us have decided to,

1478
02:23:39,250 --> 02:23:42,812
to help with the tree canopy by planting trees in our backyards and stuff.

1479
02:23:43,053 --> 02:23:49,617
And if you change it to these larger buildings that are 50% of the lots of that, are we going to all plant trees?

1480
02:23:49,677 --> 02:23:51,618
We die, and everybody cuts down all the trees.

1481
02:23:51,678 --> 02:23:53,279
How do we deal with the environmental?

1482
02:23:53,560 --> 02:24:01,505
How do we deal with this creating a united, forward-looking experience around a proper, healthy environment with trees and such?

1483
02:24:04,566 --> 02:24:07,047
Yeah, that's a that's a great question and I think.

1484
02:24:07,988 --> 02:24:28,220
So, in the in the mixed use districts what we've been doing is we've been, we've got the green score right we were requiring certain things one of the things that we might think about is if we do the multiplex and higher as site plan review that we could also consider adding the green score for the multiplex, and that requires certain.

1485
02:24:30,541 --> 02:24:34,484
you know, there are certain measures that the, um.

1486
02:24:34,564 --> 02:24:37,427
The development is being environmentally responsible, right?

1487
02:24:37,527 --> 02:24:51,218
Is that the city is requiring developments of a certain size to address the environment we might consider in the residential neighborhoods, actually applying the green score to maybe a smaller size of building, not the single the

1488
02:24:57,523 --> 02:25:02,185
But maybe one up above that we can talk about that and that might address some of those because I agree.

1489
02:25:02,745 --> 02:25:08,588
One of the things that we heard when we started this process is great, you know, look at the comprehensive plan implement that.

1490
02:25:09,128 --> 02:25:20,273
But there was also the climate action adaptation plan that's very important to the residents of Medford and so we need to balance that as well and I think maybe looking at the green looking at the green score, and what's applied to.

1491
02:25:21,413 --> 02:25:22,254
Yeah, absolutely.

1492
02:25:22,294 --> 02:25:22,674
Thank you.

1493
02:25:22,734 --> 02:25:25,417
And the green score has a lot of different elements.

1494
02:25:25,477 --> 02:25:33,625
It's a complicated equation, but essentially to maximize those environmental benefits, I just want to take two of the things.

1495
02:25:33,665 --> 02:25:43,695
I think if we're looking at potentially a regradation of this NR1 to 3, UR1, UR2, to add a sixth grade or shift it around a little bit,

1496
02:25:44,876 --> 02:25:52,087
Something we could also consider is, let's say that instead of UR1, we create an NR4 where you have single family by right.

1497
02:25:53,288 --> 02:25:57,889
just for the neighborhood that you guys are in and talking about right now, since that's kind of been our reference point for it.

1498
02:25:58,309 --> 02:26:09,531
Let's say that was NR4 instead of UR1, so maybe it's four units would be allowed, but it's still the lot size and height of the NR3 district.

1499
02:26:09,871 --> 02:26:12,352
And I'm just hypothesizing right now.

1500
02:26:14,572 --> 02:26:18,873
You could then say that in this new UR2, which might be in another part of the city,

1501
02:26:19,793 --> 02:26:21,894
you could do the multiplex by special permit.

1502
02:26:21,974 --> 02:26:27,255
So that would be site plan review with the ability to turn it down for certain reasons instead of by right.

1503
02:26:27,636 --> 02:26:33,497
So there's some gradations within that shift where maybe we're adapting to what we're hearing and the conditions.

1504
02:26:34,738 --> 02:26:42,180
The other thing we're talking about, and eventually it will align with this process, is we've been working with Therese Medford and the Energy and Environment Committee

1505
02:26:43,025 --> 02:26:47,509
for many years on the tree ordinances, which it was one ordinance.

1506
02:26:47,569 --> 02:26:48,890
It's now three ordinances.

1507
02:26:50,191 --> 02:26:51,773
One of them is to create a tree committee.

1508
02:26:52,333 --> 02:26:56,256
One of them is about public trees, which are under a certain set of Massachusetts general law.

1509
02:26:56,276 --> 02:26:59,299
So that's the trees essentially under city control in the public way.

1510
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:09,608
And then there's a zoning piece of this process where we're looking at how to preserve and protect trees on private property, where essentially

1511
02:27:11,129 --> 02:27:28,553
other communities around us have implemented ordinances that say if you are removing mature trees, you have to replace them and you have to mitigate that in some way, either through a placement or by paying a cost or in the new site plan, having something there.

1512
02:27:28,893 --> 02:27:40,176
And that's even, it's on a spectrum based on the maturity of the tree, because obviously replacing a mature tree with one other tree doesn't address the canopy question in the same way.

1513
02:27:41,336 --> 02:27:47,978
It's been such devastation over the last many years, and we're all aching so hard to get something back in place.

1514
02:27:48,358 --> 02:27:54,360
Yeah, so that is one of the ordinances that's a project that we're... One of our... Hey, look at Kim.

1515
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:59,862
Our many projects that's... Yeah, Anna Callahan is leading on that project as well.

1516
02:28:00,062 --> 02:28:01,122
So, yes.

1517
02:28:06,294 --> 02:28:09,615
Sorry, I don't see anybody else online raising their hands.

1518
02:28:11,235 --> 02:28:13,336
I think we've had everybody here.

1519
02:28:13,796 --> 02:28:17,477
So please, those of you who are in the room, thank you so much for being in the room.

1520
02:28:17,537 --> 02:28:19,677
Please stop by and look at the maps on your way out.

1521
02:28:19,737 --> 02:28:22,438
We look forward to seeing you again at the next round.

1522
02:28:22,498 --> 02:28:25,999
Those of you who are online, thank you so much for joining us online.

1523
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:29,799
Really appreciate your time and attention and questions as well.

1524
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:34,040
So we'll be at the city board meeting on the second.

1525
02:28:34,641 --> 02:28:35,561
So thank you all.

1526
02:28:36,666 --> 02:28:37,353
Thank you.
