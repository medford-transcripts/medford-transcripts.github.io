1
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:18,968
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the meeting of the Community Preservation Committee at the Medford Media Center at the high school on

2
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:24,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Tuesday evening, what is the date?

3
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:25,465
[SPEAKER_00]: April 24th.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,027
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to call the meeting to order.

6
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:43,793
[SPEAKER_19]: We are going to be accepting presentations today for the first round of applications for Community Preservation Act funding.

7
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:49,956
[SPEAKER_19]: First we're going to just review and accept minutes from the previous meeting

8
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:56,061
[SPEAKER_19]: But then I would like to outline how this evening of presentations is going to work.

9
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:03,627
[SPEAKER_19]: In the meantime, before we get started, I would like to let everyone know that we are collecting written comment as well as verbal comment.

10
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:12,074
[SPEAKER_19]: So I invite you to put your signature on the posters that we've put on the door so that you can let us know if you're here.

11
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:19,396
[SPEAKER_19]: in support of or in opposition to any of the projects that are on the slate for this round of applications.

12
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:27,398
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've also provided some index cards that we'll invite you to leave written comments on if you'd prefer, rather than stepping up to the microphone.

13
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:35,279
[SPEAKER_19]: But with that, shall we review and accept the minutes?

14
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting.

15
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:44,952
[SPEAKER_19]: All in favor?

16
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:45,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

17
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:46,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

18
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:54,876
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we'd like to invite our first applicant to come to the microphone.

19
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,617
[SPEAKER_19]: That is going to be the Roberts School PTO.

20
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:07,262
[SPEAKER_19]: What we're asking everyone to do this evening is to give a very brief presentation, perhaps five minutes.

21
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:23,108
[SPEAKER_19]: All of the committee members have had the opportunity to review the application already, and we are hoping to respect everyone's time this evening to have question and answer and public comment and question and answer within

22
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:26,210
[SPEAKER_19]: a half an hour or less for each of the projects.

23
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,971
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to keep on a timeline.

24
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:40,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Mike Lewis, committee member, is going to help us to keep on a timeline this evening so that we can have everybody have all of the presentations by 9 o'clock this evening.

25
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,485
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that, I'll invite you to come up.

26
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

27
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm representing the Roberts PTO.

28
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,113
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in our application for the surfacing of our playground to be replaced.

29
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:18,782
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface of the playground was put in around 2003 when the school opened, and it was slated to last for eight to 10 years, so now it's past replacement.

30
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:25,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought the actual pictures if it's easier for the committee to look at, thanks.

31
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:32,224
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at a point where this is poor in place and they've been trying to patch, but this is what it looks like today.

32
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to 600 students play on this playground every day.

33
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:39,227
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the largest elementary school in the city.

34
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very well utilized.

35
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:51,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Just today on this beautiful day when I went to pick up my daughter, there were probably 30 to 40 younger siblings playing on the playground before dismissal and easily 200 after school.

36
00:03:52,032 --> 00:04:00,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a well-loved and utilized playground to the point that when I went to get my pictures, I could not find a day to take a picture where there wasn't a family playing there.

37
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just hoping to have the surfacing done.

38
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,179
[SPEAKER_00]: We made this application as lean as possible.

39
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,442
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't asked for anything other than the surfacing.

40
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:12,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The playground equipment was inspected and found to be

41
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:15,388
[SPEAKER_00]: fine and can continue to be used.

42
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,088
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't asked for a bench or a planting.

43
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:18,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only asked for the surfacing.

44
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,110
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked rubber interlocking tile, which needs to be professionally installed.

45
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,231
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we picked that is because it has zero maintenance requirements.

46
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:28,712
[SPEAKER_00]: So this won't happen again.

47
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,252
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't have the holes.

48
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,453
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be just like this.

49
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:34,874
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is damage to a tile, a tile can be replaced singly.

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll look like this for the next 15 years.

51
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,412
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a great product.

52
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely safe.

53
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to have a new playground.

54
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:49,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

55
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,418
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to see if any of the committee members have questions.

56
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,219
[SPEAKER_19]: If you do have a question, please use the mic.

57
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,781
[SPEAKER_19]: So indicate, if you're not close to the mic, indicate that you'd like to use the mic.

58
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:03,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes?

59
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheryl, I'm just curious.

60
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:12,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't picture this playground in my mind, but does only school people have access to it, or is it open to the public?

61
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,384
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open to the public outside of the school day.

62
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:23,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the school day, it's just the students, but outside of the school day, in the summer, on the weekends, at night, it's very well used.

63
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:28,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I make a comment on it?

64
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:35,511
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also well lit, so even late in the evenings, the whole community goes there, because it is the only lit park in the neighborhood.

65
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is lit.

66
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:42,634
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a community value as well as the spiritual inside it.

67
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:52,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the application.

68
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,280
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very complete, very thorough.

69
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,462
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple questions.

70
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:03,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned in the application that this request for repairs for this has gone back to when Mayor McGlynn was mayor.

71
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:11,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you never, you never got any traction obviously in the last, that's at least three years ago now, trying to obviously take a

72
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,526
[SPEAKER_06]: a project that is a need in the community and get it fixed.

73
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk a little bit about that just so I can understand the background?

74
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:23,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started trying to find funding for this project when my daughter was in kindergarten.

75
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:30,169
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter is now a fourth grader, so yay, we're hoping she's going to get that one more year at the school.

76
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that I could fundraise the money if I had wanted to, and our PTO was not in a position to raise $100,000 extra.

77
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,876
[SPEAKER_00]: We do provide a lot of funding for the school.

78
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,097
[SPEAKER_00]: We do enrichment nights.

79
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,945
[SPEAKER_00]: We're preparing for field day.

80
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,366
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy t-shirts for all the students.

81
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:50,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We have entertainment, snacks.

82
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,230
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the book fair.

83
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy books for the library, books for the teachers.

84
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,454
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy school supplies at the beginning of the year.

85
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:58,795
[SPEAKER_00]: We do in-school enrichment.

86
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,176
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay for buses for field trips.

87
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:01,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're around $25,000 in expenses a year.

88
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very dynamic and involved group that helps to raise these funds and we're very fortunate.

89
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:21,270
[SPEAKER_00]: But $100,000 we would be raising for the next probably 20 years because we still have to provide that core amount of funding every year.

90
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus you said you can't actually do the construction because the city has to do that, right?

91
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: For bidding purposes.

92
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,514
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it even if you wanted to.

93
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, this project has to go out to bid.

94
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:35,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I tried to make the application leaner by saying, oh, can we do the demo?

95
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:37,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was around $30,000 just for the demo.

96
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,003
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to talk to the playground company, and they said if we hired a landscaper, that would be half the cost.

97
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:56,470
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we took out some there, and they said by having it professionally done, it could decrease the amount of repair we have to do to the substructure when we take it out, but it has to be done by hand.

98
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,212
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be done with a machine, unfortunately.

99
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:06,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, unfortunately, because it's city land, we cannot just have volunteers go in there and tear it out and put it in.

100
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the intricacy of the installation, it has to be professionally done.

101
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:12,264
[SPEAKER_06]: My last question is about the schedule.

102
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like you have, it's extremely tight.

103
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:21,627
[SPEAKER_06]: If the city bidding process doesn't go smoothly, you might run out of time at the end of the summer potentially.

104
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you build this in September if you had to?

105
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:28,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it wouldn't be ideal or into the school year if you actually had to do that.

106
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond your control obviously.

107
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:50,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be in control, so I hope to leave this meeting and speak to the Building and Grounds Subcommittee and say, we really want to be on the ground the day after, if we make it through this round, the day after the City Council hears this, we want the bid to go out immediately and do it as quickly as possible.

108
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,844
[SPEAKER_00]: They told us it was five to ten days of construction.

109
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,265
[SPEAKER_00]: We would not want to do it in September, it would be very sad.

110
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,113
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really do want to have this done as soon as possible.

111
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:08,420
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another project where we're going to be painting the rainbow outside the school, so we want this to be a fabulous start to the school year.

112
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have a school committee member with me, Aaron DeBenedetto.

113
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,031
[SPEAKER_18]: A little shorter.

114
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:29,333
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot shorter.

115
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:34,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, so the school committee has been behind Cheryl in this process.

116
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,918
[SPEAKER_18]: We had talked about doing this.

117
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Cheryl took action.

118
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,941
[SPEAKER_18]: She just really was right on it.

119
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:44,345
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to set a precedent for all the other schools as well.

120
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:49,490
[SPEAKER_18]: And we want to see how this material holds up and does well and figure out ways to fund this.

121
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the school budget is only

122
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:58,116
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, so big, and we really are buying books and technology and other things.

123
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:03,179
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not that this isn't a priority for us, but this is a great way for us to get started.

124
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,822
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really am grateful for the opportunity.

125
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I am on the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.

126
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Mia Mastone is the head of that.

127
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:15,007
[SPEAKER_18]: She's very much in favor of this project and it moving forward.

128
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:20,689
[SPEAKER_18]: I think as a committee, I don't want to speak for the committee as a whole, but as a member, I know it's a priority for all of us.

129
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:27,731
[SPEAKER_18]: We would be thrilled to take this money and run with it and have it ready for the children in September.

130
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Director of Buildings and Ground, John McLaughlin,

131
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,253
[SPEAKER_18]: knows about it.

132
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:36,674
[SPEAKER_18]: He did the preliminary research on the products.

133
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,534
[SPEAKER_18]: This is his recommendation.

134
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:40,015
[SPEAKER_18]: He's on board.

135
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:41,975
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all behind it.

136
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:44,436
[SPEAKER_18]: The superintendent, I just met with him before I came in.

137
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:45,756
[SPEAKER_18]: He's like, go get that money.

138
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:51,718
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're just very hopeful, and I think this is a great first project for the CBA.

139
00:10:52,078 --> 00:11:01,240
[SPEAKER_18]: So that way, so many children, 600 children that go to the school, plus all the children in the neighborhood, you're affecting very many people with these dollars.

140
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,203
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's a great way to do it.

141
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I sell you yet?

142
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:06,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

143
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,247
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope so.

144
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other questions?

145
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:18,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to ask, how would you anticipate the city is going to be paying for future school yard improvements after this?

146
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:26,926
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna show them how great this works, and then we're gonna just take action and steps and make this as best a priority as we can.

147
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:45,877
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna be having a major transition in the school department with our superintendent and our administration, so seeing this beautiful new thing and how safe it is for the children, we need to move forward in that direction, and this is our first step.

148
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:46,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

149
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:48,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there was another question behind you.

150
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:48,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, my back.

151
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's actually two questions.

152
00:11:51,400 --> 00:12:03,087
[SPEAKER_22]: One is about, is it possible that when the current surface is removed that there might be additional work discovered in the sub-base, or is that

153
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't you come forward?

154
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:13,971
[SPEAKER_18]: She's the expert.

155
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:24,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So our estimate includes $10,000 in repair to the substrate so hopefully it'll be less but they said they did that on the high side so that we wouldn't have a surprise coming in.

156
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:32,306
[SPEAKER_22]: And none of the existing structures needs to be moved or damaged or anything else by this process?

157
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,928
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually said they can do it without removing any of the equipment, which is amazing.

158
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:40,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be down there watching them do it, because there's a lot of equipment there.

159
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to install the tiles one by one and cut each one to fit.

160
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a really custom product here.

161
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,796
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

162
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:53,717
[SPEAKER_22]: And my question is for the school committee member.

163
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:06,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Following up on what Roberta had just asked, could you just describe a little bit about the capital improvement plan for the school department in terms of the playgrounds?

164
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:20,786
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think one concern that we have, since we're just starting to fund, is that if one group comes and sees that we'll fund school playground improvements, what's to prevent all the other schools from coming and saying, you did this?

165
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:25,889
[SPEAKER_18]: This particular playground is a little different, because it's a community playground.

166
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:33,792
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the only lit playground in the area, so that really justifies this being a community project, and that benefits the school children as well.

167
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:41,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're looking for a community project for that neighborhood that also benefits the 600 children in the school community.

168
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So it does both.

169
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:51,140
[SPEAKER_18]: There's only eight hours that the school really takes use of this, and there's 24 hours in a day, so there's a lot of the community that can use it other than that.

170
00:13:52,300 --> 00:14:05,904
[SPEAKER_18]: As far as the capital improvement plan, I think that question would be best answered by Mayor Burke directly, because we're still working on those priorities, especially with the new superintendent coming.

171
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of those changes might come forward.

172
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:16,792
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have a grant application out as well within the community for improvements, especially at our high school building.

173
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:22,937
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are always working on improvement and capital improvements throughout the school districts.

174
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:27,721
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is a great opportunity not only to help the school, but also help the whole community in that area.

175
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,682
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

176
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:29,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

177
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:30,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else?

178
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:31,404
[SPEAKER_18]: No?

179
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:31,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

180
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,666
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

181
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:35,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other questions from the committee?

182
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Would anyone like to share comments, questions?

183
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:45,573
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

184
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:46,373
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

185
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

186
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:51,074
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd just like to remind everyone to sign in.

187
00:14:51,094 --> 00:14:52,254
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a sign-in sheet.

188
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:55,535
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you leave after a presentation, please make sure that you've signed in.

189
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,756
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you have any further comments, you can leave them for us in writing.

190
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:03,857
[SPEAKER_19]: So our next applicant.

191
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:04,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

192
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:05,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

193
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:07,358
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was just going to ask, how many applicants

194
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,841
[SPEAKER_19]: For tonight, we have three applicants with a total of five projects.

195
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:15,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the applicants have multiple projects.

196
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:18,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So after every project, we'll have the committee members ask questions for about 10 or 15 minutes.

197
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:19,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, if you're not on the agenda.

198
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:41,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so a public comment period we

199
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,932
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean general, not based on the applications, but just in general?

200
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what you're asking?

201
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, a presentation from the commercial sector.

202
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:55,258
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have an application before you right now.

203
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,100
[SPEAKER_15]: You still want to present something verbally.

204
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,741
[SPEAKER_15]: You said you could.

205
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:02,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would probably be at another meeting.

206
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,446
[SPEAKER_07]: This meeting today is just to go over those that have applications.

207
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:09,128
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I was told at the last meeting, at the GPW.

208
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,070
[SPEAKER_15]: So you never get a chance to speak.

209
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,492
[SPEAKER_15]: unless you're on this, you know, you have an application in front of you.

210
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,393
[SPEAKER_15]: So how does that work?

211
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've had a lot of meetings.

212
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:27,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this specific meeting and then the next one in two weeks is just for the presentations of the ones that have already submitted and pre-approved applications.

213
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:33,379
[SPEAKER_07]: You can certainly talk to Danielle anytime she has office hours in the mayor's office.

214
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:39,101
[SPEAKER_07]: She worked with all these groups, have talked and worked with Danielle to get a pre-application approved.

215
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,383
[SPEAKER_07]: an application approved and then to be honest.

216
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:44,645
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's never going to be a venue where you can just come up and speak on something?

217
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,508
[SPEAKER_19]: We have in the past had people come up and talk to us.

218
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:50,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been to world meetings and there's never an opportunity I've seen.

219
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,671
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always like this.

220
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,072
[SPEAKER_15]: It's structured in a way that

221
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,803
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have something to present, unless you have an application, you don't get a chance to speak.

222
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We usually have a public comment session at the end.

223
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the chair, can we go through the whole process if we have extra time?

224
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:07,529
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can allow the business community to get up and say a few words?

225
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's fine.

226
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:18,395
[SPEAKER_19]: If we can receive all of the applicants who are on the agenda, then we'd like to listen to give you some time at the end.

227
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

228
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:21,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for that suggestion.

229
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:27,001
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, the next applicant this evening is Medford Community Housing.

230
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:32,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

231
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,188
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little bit tight, but.

232
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:50,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, thank you for allowing us the opportunity to apply for funding from the Community Preservation Fund.

233
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:54,233
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford Community Housing.

234
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,374
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Susan Collins.

235
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:56,734
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm the executive director.

236
00:17:56,914 --> 00:18:02,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here with two of our board members, David Brosnan, our treasurer, and Henry Rappa, our president.

237
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

238
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:13,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford Community Housing was founded and operates for the purpose of making housing affordable, safe, and inclusive for all people who live and work in the city of Medford.

239
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:21,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Our goals are, number one, to promote the development, rehabilitation, and maintenance of affordable housing in Medford.

240
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:25,185
[SPEAKER_21]: with a special focus for limited and moderate income people.

241
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:30,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Number two, to encourage the development of a caring community in Medford.

242
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:39,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Number three, to maintain and enhance the cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of the Medford community.

243
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:49,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Number four, to take any other actions appropriate for the enhancement of the social and economic well-being of Medford community.

244
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:59,653
[SPEAKER_21]: We feel the production of these affordable housing units will assist the city to reach the mandate of 10% of the community's housing stock to be affordable.

245
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford, as this committee is aware, is at 7%.

246
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:13,040
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a two to seven year waiting list for housing vouchers with a housing authority for two and three bedroom units.

247
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:19,483
[SPEAKER_21]: We've worked with the city in assisting in the rehab and development of affordable housing

248
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,272
[SPEAKER_21]: in Medford over the last few years while growing in our capacity to produce more units.

249
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:36,735
[SPEAKER_21]: This funding will assist another subsidy for smaller projects like ours that don't have the ability to be given tax credits or state funding.

250
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:43,737
[SPEAKER_21]: New construction is limited in federal funding programs, for example, like community development block grants.

251
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:48,478
[SPEAKER_21]: We think this project aligns with the goals of the CPC

252
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:59,084
[SPEAKER_21]: Committee to preserve Medford's income and demographic diversity by sustaining and increasing Medford's supply of affordable housing for families, seniors, and individuals.

253
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:06,688
[SPEAKER_21]: It will facilitate investing affordable housing that will preserve and complement the character of existing neighborhoods.

254
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:11,711
[SPEAKER_21]: It will support low and moderate income housing, access to housing that they can afford.

255
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:22,373
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to turn it over to Henry and David, because they'll be answering questions along with myself.

256
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:22,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

257
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:30,076
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see from the screen here, we actually own this parcel of land.

258
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2016, we purchased this house and this lot.

259
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And this house currently has two affordable income families in it.

260
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal is to develop.

261
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:53,995
[SPEAKER_04]: up to three units on this parcel, where we already have site control and some preliminary zoning is already in process, some zoning checks and the like.

262
00:20:54,095 --> 00:21:02,817
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have control of the site, which puts us in an unusual position that we have some certainty as to what we can do going forward.

263
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:06,998
[SPEAKER_04]: The real issue is creation of affordable housing units.

264
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,019
[SPEAKER_04]: As everyone knows, it's a very important issue.

265
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the escalation of costs where they've been over the last

266
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:19,374
[SPEAKER_04]: four to five years, it's getting more and more difficult for people to stay in the community and be a part of the fabric.

267
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:24,458
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like about our type of product is people get to live part of a neighborhood.

268
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:37,669
[SPEAKER_04]: They get to live in a house type dwelling, and it gives them a chance to integrate into their neighborhood, which is a unique thing that we're able to offer to our affordable housing tenants.

269
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important too that we can offer two and three bedroom units.

270
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:51,640
[SPEAKER_04]: The 705 Fellsway West has a three-bedroom unit, which really allows families a chance to stay together and have an opportunity to live in Medford.

271
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:56,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an ultimate goal, so we're accomplishing a few things here.

272
00:21:56,342 --> 00:22:01,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only creating units, we're doing it on a site that we actually own.

273
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:08,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's a very big part of it, but financing becomes an issue, and that's where the need for CPC funds

274
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:22,544
[SPEAKER_04]: is an important cog in the wheel because that will help us to finalize other funding and put together other funding gaps because it's very competitive to get the necessary funding to do projects.

275
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:27,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you can see from the lot, it's a clean, undeveloped lot.

276
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:37,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we'd be building would be in pretty much, it would be very reasonable in relation to what's in the remainder of the neighborhood.

277
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of

278
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,901
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-family houses in the area.

279
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a built out area and this happens to be the only lot on the street that I can see that would meet that type of goal.

280
00:22:49,845 --> 00:22:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So does the board have any questions for us?

281
00:22:54,587 --> 00:22:55,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Would anyone like to start with questions?

282
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:06,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just, I had, and you may have answered it already, so it's a, it's not, you're not buying a house, you're, you've got land and you're gonna create brand new housing.

283
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:06,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

284
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,553
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually own the house next to it.

285
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:08,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

286
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we purchased the house next to it, and the deed is in your package, we purchased that in April of 2016 with the extra lot.

287
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:15,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

288
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:23,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that extra lot provides an opportunity to build something on it that would be able to create new units of affordable housing.

289
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:31,784
[SPEAKER_04]: within our mission of having multi-bedroom units to give people an opportunity to stay together as a family and be integrated into a neighborhood with a yard.

290
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:36,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some very important goals as part of the affordable housing thing.

291
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to have affordable housing, but we want to have affordable housing as well that targets the needs of families, which is so challenging with the price of rent only

292
00:23:47,392 --> 00:24:04,694
[SPEAKER_04]: two and three bedroom units, the rent is really driving so many people out and we have a unique opportunity to help some families get settled and that's an important part of owning the land and not having to chase down a parcel of land where the acquisition costs would be extremely high in today's market.

293
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:11,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have two applications in, one for $30,000 and one for $250,000.

294
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:15,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just parse out what the $30,000 would go to and what the $250,000 would go for?

295
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:16,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

296
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,130
[SPEAKER_04]: The $30,000 is for some of the

297
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: efforts that go into architectural plans, legal, that type of soft costs that go with any project.

298
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:33,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And the 250 is actual for costs in relation to some of the construction of foundations, site development.

299
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: In this instance, it's my understanding we can't get CDBG funds because it's new construction.

300
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:46,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Most, a lot of our deals will include a component where we get funding from the home consortium from CDBG.

301
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:51,366
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we finish it off with some funding from Century Bank most times.

302
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't get that type of CDBG funding in this instance because of the new construction and the rules.

303
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:10,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So funding from the CPC would fill that gap for us and allow us to be able to do the type of project that we normally do but with CDBG funds backing us.

304
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:16,197
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, in very simple terms, the $30,000 is to get the project off the ground.

305
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:22,312
[SPEAKER_23]: And the second application for $250,000 is to get the project in the ground.

306
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:27,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to piggyback off of that question.

307
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You have multiple funding sources listed here.

308
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just talk about those a little bit more?

309
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Have any of those been confirmed?

310
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,742
[SPEAKER_21]: I can walk through that.

311
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:37,823
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, please.

312
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:41,005
[SPEAKER_21]: So usually when we do projects, there's a layer of funding.

313
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:48,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're doing, if you have six units and under, that precludes you from state funding and from tax credits.

314
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,593
[SPEAKER_21]: So that leaves very few funding sources available.

315
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,654
[SPEAKER_21]: So we work with, Henry brought up the home consortium.

316
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,774
[SPEAKER_21]: So that comes through the home program.

317
00:25:57,794 --> 00:25:59,595
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a federally funded program.

318
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,915
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're usually our lead funder.

319
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:05,156
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we'll get a private loan grant.

320
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:10,737
[SPEAKER_21]: And then as Henry mentioned, there's federal funding through the community block grant funds.

321
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:15,198
[SPEAKER_21]: But because it's new construction, they do not allow funding for new construction.

322
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:18,619
[SPEAKER_21]: There is some slight utility work that you could get some funding for.

323
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,528
[SPEAKER_21]: but that's not going to be possible in this case.

324
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:28,029
[SPEAKER_21]: We have worked with the city over the last few years, and more recently they said they wanted new construction units.

325
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:35,951
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're trying to fall in line to what the city has wanted for development of affordable housing and the production of new units.

326
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:46,014
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why we've gone with taking this vacant parcel and utilizing it, which I think meets in the goals of the CPC committee as well as underutilized land.

327
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:51,893
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's kind of how the funding, and then we get private grants, as I mentioned.

328
00:26:53,215 --> 00:27:04,669
[SPEAKER_21]: So we don't have access, where larger projects have more access to funds through tax credits, through other state programs that currently have gone, that they're providing funding for.

329
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,082
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you select who goes in there?

330
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:15,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Say the units are done, do you go off the state wait list or do you have your own separate wait list?

331
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:25,034
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we're mandated to do through the home program, which is the federal program, which is the lead lender on this, would be that we have to go through a lottery process.

332
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:31,980
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, for these units to be counted on the state housing inventory list, we're also mandated by

333
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,945
[SPEAKER_21]: DHCD to go through a lottery process as well.

334
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:41,052
[SPEAKER_21]: You can do local preference, which we usually do on our project when we did the Felsway.

335
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:49,403
[SPEAKER_21]: We had local preference on one of the units, and so we do have a local, we have a Medford family that lives in that, in one of the units.

336
00:27:55,529 --> 00:28:01,152
[SPEAKER_06]: The total project costs, soft costs and hard costs, looks like about $1.1 million, right?

337
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:04,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a little more than $350,000 per unit.

338
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:11,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that consistent with what you're seeing in the marketplace these days for ground up new construction, including all the soft costs and design costs?

339
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:13,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's a really good question.

340
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:16,280
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things that's really important when we did the Felsway

341
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:22,601
[SPEAKER_21]: in our other projects as well, is what we're finding is there is no per square footage construction price anymore.

342
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,622
[SPEAKER_21]: It really depends on the bids that you secure.

343
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:38,204
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's been one of the things that when we started out and we did our first project on Boston Avenue, we got differences in pricing of $100,000 to $150,000 sway.

344
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,364
[SPEAKER_21]: So there is no set cost price.

345
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:44,705
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we've done is because we've done so many of these size projects,

346
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:49,263
[SPEAKER_21]: is we've kind of incorporated the cost and then increased the cost factor.

347
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:56,429
[SPEAKER_21]: But we feel that because we don't have the land acquisition, that actually those costs are brought down because we own the land.

348
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,850
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's a huge piece.

349
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:03,676
[SPEAKER_21]: As you all know, being in Medford vacant land is impossible to find to build on.

350
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:21,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you sought input from the City, from the Building Department, the Zoning Board of Appeals staff, or the Office of Community Development on what kind of zoning relief would be required for building on the site?

351
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to have David talk about the construction piece, and then Henry can talk about zoning, if that's all right.

352
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

353
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:28,363
[SPEAKER_23]: Henry.

354
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:32,485
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as zoning, I'm actually a lawyer and counsel to the board as well.

355
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:35,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done some preliminary work as part of this.

356
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And David and I did meet with one of the building inspectors last week.

357
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Fargo.

358
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Fargo.

359
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went in and met with someone from the Secretary for the Zoning Board.

360
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,813
[SPEAKER_23]: That was Dennis McDougall.

361
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:51,418
[SPEAKER_23]: the Secretary to the Board of Appeals.

362
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:56,599
[SPEAKER_04]: But looking at it, there do not seem to be any obstacles to getting zoning relief.

363
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: We are able to do this several different ways.

364
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of what the $30,000 is for, is to have consultants advise us to what is going to be the best way to do it.

365
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:14,183
[SPEAKER_04]: But clearly, where we own the land, have site control,

366
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:22,529
[SPEAKER_04]: and there are options, whether through special permit or variances, to be able to get the relief we need to construct.

367
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:30,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be consistent with the reliefs that have been granted by the zoning board.

368
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:40,684
[SPEAKER_04]: There seems to be a new trend to assisting relief, and our relief, if we in fact went the route of a special permit, it is a much lower standard than a variance standard.

369
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have to prove hardship.

370
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: A special permit, you just merely have to prove that it's not contrary to the neighborhood, which clearly this wouldn't be.

371
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,470
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be a benefit to the neighborhood.

372
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:55,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as that goes, we've met with them.

373
00:30:56,373 --> 00:31:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone over different variations, but ultimately, the necessity of the funds is to help make final decisions on that.

374
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:06,580
[SPEAKER_04]: But clearly, the number one aspect is we own the land.

375
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:20,897
[SPEAKER_04]: and there are options available, and having read the article in the Medford transcript, 13 out of 14 projects have been given relief, particularly when they have some facet of affordable housing.

376
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:22,399
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all affordable housing.

377
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:23,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a non-profit company.

378
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:30,027
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not out to make profit, we are out to help people in the Medford community have a place to live.

379
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: We also take whatever revenue that comes into our organization stays within our organization and helps fund other things we do with respect to advocacy of Medford.

380
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:42,779
[SPEAKER_04]: affordable housing.

381
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:48,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Any small profit we do get stays here to be used on other projects as we move forward.

382
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a growing organization.

383
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:54,169
[SPEAKER_04]: We've developed five or six units over the last five years.

384
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,973
[SPEAKER_04]: This certainly would be one that would be very happy to create new units.

385
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:05,700
[SPEAKER_04]: As Susan was saying, there has been talk from the Office of Community Development that they prefer creation rather than conversion.

386
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,867
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, what we had been doing is we've been buying underutilized properties that needed renovations and updating the properties.

387
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:17,631
[SPEAKER_04]: The acquisition costs have become incredibly high.

388
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:22,015
[SPEAKER_04]: As many of you know, a two-family can go for almost $950 to $1 million.

389
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking here saying if we can get

390
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:34,493
[SPEAKER_04]: $350,000 per unit, when it would cost us maybe $500,000 per unit to buy a two-family and have to renovate.

391
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, we're putting tenants in there.

392
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,176
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a non-profit.

393
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:42,279
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make sure that they have a decent living space.

394
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,864
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just move someone into a place that's not up to standards because we have inspections and the like.

395
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:50,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And our whole goal is to treat people with respect.

396
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: in need-blind eyes, and they need to have a property that's in good shape.

397
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:12,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, another benefit of this, with the 350 per unit, the difference is, is those are going to be energy efficient, they're going to be 2018 code, they're going to be set for many, many years without renovation.

398
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:17,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, the 350, while it sounds high at first blush, is a fairly

399
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,058
[SPEAKER_04]: benign costs.

400
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:21,680
[SPEAKER_04]: In this world, it's hard to believe that.

401
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:28,288
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the last ten years, what has happened with purchase prices and with construction costs is mind-boggling.

402
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:32,773
[SPEAKER_04]: But the essential element is there are routes for us to get the relief.

403
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:35,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done preliminary work in speaking to that.

404
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:39,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly there would be no barrier to doing it.

405
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,765
[SPEAKER_04]: The main barrier in this economy is finding a parcel of land where you can build and we have site control.

406
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:52,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is the one thing I stress to the board here, is that we have control of this parcel.

407
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not waiting for a purchase and sale or a lease.

408
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We have complete control.

409
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It is ours to do what we need to do with it.

410
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:02,249
[SPEAKER_21]: I also would like to follow up your last question.

411
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,330
[SPEAKER_21]: You talked about the city.

412
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:11,875
[SPEAKER_21]: When you do these kind of projects, because there's this layer of funding, someone requires you to open the first door.

413
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:23,182
[SPEAKER_21]: So all of the lenders are going back to your committee to say, this is a community project, it's community money, so they want to see that first door open for the other doors to open.

414
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,823
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's kind of standard policy.

415
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:42,976
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we do our other projects we have done, is the city has supported us with this community development block grant money that we have received, and then the home consortium follows suit, and then our private lender is always happy to lend us the money, but they want to be sure that the other funders are in line as well.

416
00:34:43,664 --> 00:35:06,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess my concern is just ensuring that the project that we fund is going to be feasible to be able to be completed with the funding that's available, you know, that you're able to obtain the necessary permits to be able to carry the project out and that the project works on the site that it's proposed on.

417
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:13,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, those are all valid points, but any projects that are being done, they all have to go through this kind of approval

418
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:26,409
[SPEAKER_21]: and spend, do the pre-development work, and then also work with the Board of Appeals because it's very hard to find projects that are fitting into that scope where you could go in and get the money and not have any variances done.

419
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:36,197
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's been predominant, as Henry brought up, of the variances that have been approved by the Board of Appeals, the projects that have been presented to them.

420
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:44,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, some of our requested relief would be limited to a special permit, which again, has that lower threshold.

421
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:52,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And there may be a parking variance, which again, is going to be a threshold that would not be hard for us to meet for a couple of reasons.

422
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,422
[SPEAKER_04]: A, we're affordable housing, so we have a lower number of parking spaces necessary.

423
00:35:57,442 --> 00:36:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep in mind, the land has a slight slope to it.

424
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:05,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only reason for a parking variance would be parking down this way, which everyone on the street does.

425
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,987
[SPEAKER_04]: but that requires a variance.

426
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But hardship is certainly there.

427
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardship is there because of the topography of the land.

428
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:24,780
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the main thing, having done this for 24 years, the main thing with variances, the main thing the board's going to look at is do you meet their criteria, and one of them is hardship from the topography of the land, and we have that.

429
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:35,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Has your organization done new development before, or have your projects been all... Yes, there's been new construction development.

430
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

431
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:39,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we've actually built a couple of houses.

432
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,088
[SPEAKER_23]: We've built one on Arlington Street.

433
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:44,251
[SPEAKER_23]: We've built one on, I believe it's Circuit Road.

434
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:45,573
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the other one.

435
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:47,134
[SPEAKER_23]: And those were...

436
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:54,594
[SPEAKER_23]: They were back in the 80s or 90s, I would believe.

437
00:36:55,394 --> 00:37:00,715
[SPEAKER_23]: And those are occupied now under deed restriction.

438
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:02,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And home ownership.

439
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,956
[SPEAKER_23]: And home ownership, yes, by two families.

440
00:37:08,036 --> 00:37:11,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, if I could just quickly cover this, the Medford transcript had an interesting article.

441
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:17,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It talked about 14 developments going before the Zoning Board of Appeals since 2009.

442
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,986
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were residential or mixed use projects containing some residential units.

443
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:25,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind ours is all residential units.

444
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:29,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those projects, 13 were approved.

445
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see a clear

446
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: told the zoning board to approve projects, as you investigate zoning, and no one has a, no one's clairvoyant, but the reality is you can often look from the facts and start to piece together how many variances you need and how much relief you need.

447
00:37:50,506 --> 00:38:01,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And clearly in ours, we don't need, the main issue is the special permit, which again, I have not seen a board deny a special permit in years, and then,

448
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:15,354
[SPEAKER_04]: a parking variance which would be very unusual to not get because they've granted them to several places in the neighborhood and the building inspector had confirmed that there have been a few in that neighborhood recently that have got parking variances to park elsewhere.

449
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:20,457
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's also on-street parking and we have the building next door so we could do an easement as well.

450
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:25,651
[SPEAKER_21]: It's nice owning the property next door because it gives us more flexibility.

451
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:30,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering that because obviously that gives you an opportunity to have maybe one less current practice.

452
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously you need to design it.

453
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:32,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

454
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hasn't happened yet.

455
00:38:34,341 --> 00:38:40,829
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it's our intention to get our best concept on paper and then to go forward with that, work with the neighbors.

456
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:52,266
[SPEAKER_23]: and work with the city, and minimize the impacts to everybody else, understanding that there has to be some degree of zoning relief.

457
00:38:53,846 --> 00:39:03,490
[SPEAKER_23]: Toward that end, I'd just like to acknowledge someone in the audience, Barry Byszynski of Blackstone Block Architects is here to provide us a little support tonight.

458
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:10,112
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have also consulted with a surveyor,

459
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:12,793
[SPEAKER_23]: who's familiar with the area.

460
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:20,515
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're at an early stage, but we think we have a good approach to this.

461
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:28,437
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, you can kind of look down the street here and see what happens, I suppose, when you don't have a good approach.

462
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:32,373
[SPEAKER_23]: blast a hole in the ground and figure out what to do later.

463
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:44,362
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd rather go in and try to get our ducks in a row early and do the thing that works well for everybody.

464
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:44,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

465
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,204
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a question on the other side.

466
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:54,050
[SPEAKER_02]: As an organization, how many properties do you currently manage and how many projects have you worked on since your inception?

467
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:13,179
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, we have sold two to first-time home buyers, and we have, I think, a total of... We have four units, and we did two other units, which was through a partnership with a local church in Medford, that we were the lead developer.

468
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:20,203
[SPEAKER_21]: We did the development, the project management, and the lottery process, and we were the project manager for it.

469
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:23,724
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've done six units in the last five years.

470
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:27,127
[SPEAKER_21]: And they've been smaller project units.

471
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:29,088
[SPEAKER_21]: So we've done rehab.

472
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:30,930
[SPEAKER_21]: We've done new construction.

473
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,993
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a seasoned structural engineer, which David is.

474
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,036
[SPEAKER_21]: We have someone that's in affordable housing on our board.

475
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:48,083
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been in project management, real estate development, federal housing, state housing, and lending for the last 30 plus years.

476
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:49,664
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we have a pretty good deck.

477
00:40:50,470 --> 00:41:01,807
[SPEAKER_21]: on housing development, financing, construction, and I think we can handle a project of this size.

478
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:02,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

479
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a timeline?

480
00:41:06,492 --> 00:41:08,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I know obviously it's very fluid.

481
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:10,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I have to ask.

482
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,756
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's a good question.

483
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:16,859
[SPEAKER_21]: We, I think we pulled this together very quickly.

484
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:19,080
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's also, this is our goal.

485
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,001
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what we do.

486
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,582
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what we want to provide.

487
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:23,783
[SPEAKER_21]: We're a strictly affordable housing developer.

488
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:25,304
[SPEAKER_21]: We do educational outreach.

489
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:27,686
[SPEAKER_21]: We put time in this.

490
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:30,347
[SPEAKER_21]: This is where I spend a majority of my time as well.

491
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:32,509
[SPEAKER_21]: If everything goes right,

492
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:42,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Board of Appeals sometimes, it can maybe take one or two meetings, but that's why we asked for the site development, because we do want to get on the ground and start from there.

493
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:50,433
[SPEAKER_21]: Getting the contractors lined up is not the issue so much as it is the timetable of all the upfront work that we're going through right now.

494
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,315
[SPEAKER_21]: So construction is roughly around 12 months.

495
00:41:54,992 --> 00:42:07,220
[SPEAKER_21]: So depending on the weather, because the way that this funding goes is, you know, we can't control what's going on, but we wanted to get a jump start before we get into winter months, just because it's easier from a construction standpoint.

496
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,622
[SPEAKER_21]: It moves the project along a lot faster.

497
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:18,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, if we have the grants from the board, that's going to allow us to line up our other funding, tie everything up quicker, and be moving along.

498
00:42:20,012 --> 00:42:26,393
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're in a unique position because we are experienced, and yet we're not so large that we need approvals from multi-different agencies.

499
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're not doing a tax credit deal.

500
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:33,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a straight development of a fairly easy project.

501
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, comparatively, this is not, you know, reinventing the wheel.

502
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:44,596
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very simple, you know, for-profit flippers and developers do this on a daily basis if they can find the right land or tear it out.

503
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:47,097
[SPEAKER_21]: And our other two lenders, it's a faster process.

504
00:42:48,192 --> 00:43:00,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Our private lender, it's something that we already had a commitment in the package that they're willing to lend on this and had given a letter as long as we have the other funding sources in place.

505
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,361
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the home consortium, that's a short process.

506
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:06,703
[SPEAKER_21]: We've gone through that application process several times.

507
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:09,558
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also have grant funding.

508
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:20,004
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have grant funders that have offered to give us money for these kind of projects, because that's their understanding of the necessity and need for affordable housing in this area as well.

509
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:22,785
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another question over here, Roberta.

510
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:23,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

511
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:24,286
[SPEAKER_22]: Go ahead.

512
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:24,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

513
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:27,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you remind me, this is a rental project.

514
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,409
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

515
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:34,272
[SPEAKER_22]: And can you talk about the income limits and what that means for

516
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:54,341
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be affordable to what level and... We were hoping to, and correct me if I'm wrong, Susan, but we were hoping to meet economic stratum of about 60% of the area mean income as defined, I think, by the census.

517
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:56,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it's defined by HUD.

518
00:43:56,661 --> 00:44:01,582
[SPEAKER_21]: HUD comes out with the income and rental limits every year.

519
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:14,576
[SPEAKER_21]: We are required by the home funding that all of the applicants that live in and reside in the housing have to be at 60% area median income or below.

520
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:21,060
[SPEAKER_21]: So some of our tenants have housing vouchers, and then some of them do not.

521
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:23,582
[SPEAKER_21]: But all of our residents are working families.

522
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:24,202
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

523
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:24,943
[SPEAKER_22]: And can you just

524
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of explain what level that is, like what's the income level at 60%?

525
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:40,497
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's, they just actually came out with new ones, so I believe, it's gonna be below 50s for a family of two.

526
00:44:40,617 --> 00:44:43,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't give you, but it's in the 50s, 50,000.

527
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:48,361
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're gonna do the property management in-house?

528
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:54,784
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have a property management company that's been managing our properties, but I'm actively involved as well because

529
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:59,556
[SPEAKER_21]: We also have to do income certifications every year because it is affordable rental housing.

530
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:05,542
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do that and also I do inspections of the unit but also work with the property management company.

531
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:14,052
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also have relationships with the tenants just to stay in touch because we also get feedback from our tenants too because they're living in affordable housing.

532
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,655
[SPEAKER_21]: They are up against the income challenges.

533
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:26,321
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's, and because I'm intimately involved in the projects as we go, I get to know the families as well that end up becoming residents and living there.

534
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:28,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

535
00:45:30,082 --> 00:45:37,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'd just like to add that we've collected a pile of signatures from Medford residents, and I'll leave those with Danielle.

536
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:39,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

537
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:39,966
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

538
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:40,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

539
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:41,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

540
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,809
[SPEAKER_10]: So Tom Lincoln is going to be here around 745.

541
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:52,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions?

542
00:45:52,670 --> 00:46:01,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd actually like to ask if there are comments from the public on this proposal.

543
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:02,536
[SPEAKER_11]: He's here now, Daniel.

544
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:04,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please.

545
00:46:05,118 --> 00:46:05,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the housing?

546
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:06,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

547
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,861
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can use a microphone, that would be helpful.

548
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

549
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:18,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

550
00:46:18,816 --> 00:46:20,277
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Sinsa.

551
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:25,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a Section 8 voucher holder since 2009.

552
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:32,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that 10 years, I was in affordable housing within the LaPreez Village.

553
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:34,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Lived in Medford all my life.

554
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I never knew it was called LaPreez Village.

555
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:39,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We always referred to it as the projects.

556
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:44,707
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recently attended one of Susan's workshops where

557
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:51,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn about home ownership and everything that's involved with that.

558
00:46:51,957 --> 00:46:54,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my gosh, that's a project in itself.

559
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:06,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have to tell you, with regards to your question on income, I've been looking for over three years for a two bedroom apartment.

560
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:13,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, and I've said this before, Medford is not a Section 8 friendly city.

561
00:47:14,235 --> 00:47:14,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.

562
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:22,452
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't even begin to tell you, I've already taken two people through Mass.

563
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission Against Discrimination have won.

564
00:47:25,194 --> 00:47:25,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already

565
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:33,503
[SPEAKER_01]: taken one person to court and have won, and I'm testifying in June against another party, which I expect to win.

566
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:38,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But as much winning as you think you're doing, you're still not getting into the apartment.

567
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:44,632
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to fight with somebody for housing discrimination to try to get into an apartment, do you really want to live there?

568
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to live there.

569
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:46,814
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uncomfortable.

570
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:54,200
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Housing Authority, well, all the housing authorities, really, I think it's the federal government

571
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,943
[SPEAKER_01]: have not ever caught up to the fair market rent values.

572
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:04,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, Medford and Malden are very similar with regards to their apartments.

573
00:48:05,006 --> 00:48:10,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, my phone is just, my emails are flooded with apartment rentals coming in.

574
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Zillow, Trulia, Hutpad, Zumper, everything that you can imagine.

575
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:19,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And the average apartment today is $2,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.

576
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will include, if you're lucky, laundry.

577
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:28,514
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get laundry, you might get $1,900 for a two-bedroom.

578
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:35,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, Medford, including utilities for a two-bedroom, they're only paying $1,740.

579
00:48:37,096 --> 00:48:48,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have that extra income, if you can't work, if you're disabled, and you don't have that extra income coming in, what they're doing right now is

580
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:58,647
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen is you're going to end up somewhere out in Lynn, somewhere out in Chelsea, Lawrence, Chelmsford, Lowell, all places like that.

581
00:48:58,707 --> 00:48:59,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here all my life.

582
00:48:59,928 --> 00:49:03,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go out and live in Lynn or Chelsea.

583
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:13,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lucky that my son finally graduated high school, but this is where I'm comfortable, and I don't feel that it's

584
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:21,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair to have to stop moving these families out who can't afford to live here when they've been here all their life through no fault of their own.

585
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and my son, we do work.

586
00:49:26,374 --> 00:49:28,617
[SPEAKER_01]: My son does have autism.

587
00:49:29,605 --> 00:49:36,949
[SPEAKER_01]: and does have a disability, but I thank God that he is able to work and, you know, be a productive member of society.

588
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:49,055
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think of all those other families who, you know, may be veterans or somebody who is in a wheelchair who can't work, you know, who is permanently disabled and they rely on the government for those housing

589
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:52,618
[SPEAKER_01]: for their livelihood to be able to live.

590
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:57,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And they mentioned something to the effect of to be integrated within the community.

591
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:02,406
[SPEAKER_01]: The days of segregation are over.

592
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:05,809
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be integrated in communities as well.

593
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:12,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really hope that you would consider the funding for this project and help us out a little.

594
00:50:12,695 --> 00:50:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

595
00:50:13,156 --> 00:50:14,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

596
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:30,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, are there any further comments on the Medford affordable housing?

597
00:50:33,578 --> 00:50:33,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

598
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:41,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Our next applicant is the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust, and we have three proposals.

599
00:50:43,824 --> 00:50:44,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, thank you.

600
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:55,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because we've had a few people coming in and out since the beginning, I wanted to remind everyone to sign the attendance sheet.

601
00:50:56,757 --> 00:51:05,960
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you'd like to put your signature on the poster outside that you are in favor of or opposed to any of the proposals, please do so.

602
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,561
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you'd like to fill out a comment card, please do so as well.

603
00:51:15,063 --> 00:51:15,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please do.

604
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:16,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

605
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:19,188
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

606
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:28,434
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to, I wasn't prepared to speak for them, but I did sign their petition, and I'm familiar with their properties.

607
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:30,155
[SPEAKER_24]: I helped them insure some of them.

608
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:43,623
[SPEAKER_24]: But if folks aren't familiar with them, I just want to point out that the quality of work that they do on their renovations and their construction when they build is very in keeping with the neighborhood.

609
00:51:44,844 --> 00:51:52,586
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is an organization where 100% of the properties that they work on remain affordable, essentially forever.

610
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:54,647
[SPEAKER_24]: So this isn't 10% of a project.

611
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:56,528
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's a hometown group.

612
00:51:56,908 --> 00:52:07,031
[SPEAKER_24]: But what they do within the neighborhoods, they take properties, some that are in really tough shape, they beautify them, and they keep them really in character with the neighborhood.

613
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:10,832
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the board isn't familiar with that, if there is going to be,

614
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:20,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Any CPC funds used for affordable housing, I think that group is a great way to use it.

615
00:52:20,956 --> 00:52:21,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

616
00:52:21,397 --> 00:52:21,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

617
00:52:21,697 --> 00:52:22,197
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

618
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,482
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be able to stand.

619
00:52:33,502 --> 00:52:34,603
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't need to stand for 45 minutes.

620
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:45,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, we don't have a chair at the mic, but you can sit down and stand up if you can.

621
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:48,939
[SPEAKER_22]: You can put a chair here and use this microphone.

622
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:49,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

623
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

624
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,241
[SPEAKER_17]: How about this one?

625
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that way, you'll have that one.

626
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,700
[SPEAKER_17]: You tell me.

627
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:14,342
[SPEAKER_19]: We have on the agenda first a Japanese.

628
00:53:14,602 --> 00:53:15,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Japanese.

629
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:17,003
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, we'll talk about Japanese.

630
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:20,785
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a long day.

631
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:26,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like a backup singer here.

632
00:53:26,548 --> 00:53:29,149
[SPEAKER_13]: You can take that out of the stand if you want.

633
00:53:29,169 --> 00:53:29,929
[SPEAKER_13]: You're the lead singer tonight.

634
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:30,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you bring your guitar?

635
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,371
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I played the piano, though, quite nicely.

636
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,311
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I'll be brief here.

637
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:39,012
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Tom Lincoln, the head of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

638
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:44,595
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been working for two decades to restore the Brooks Estate for public benefit.

639
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:48,096
[SPEAKER_17]: The property has been owned by the city of Medford for 76 years.

640
00:53:49,136 --> 00:53:54,799
[SPEAKER_17]: We've made a tremendous amount of progress and we're delighted that the CPA is now on the scene to help us make more progress.

641
00:53:55,928 --> 00:53:57,170
[SPEAKER_17]: We have three projects here tonight.

642
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,754
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll talk about the first one, the Japanese knotweed.

643
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:03,320
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the smallest ask, I think, is the right word.

644
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:08,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Japanese knotweed is an invasive plant.

645
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:09,970
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like bamboo.

646
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:12,718
[SPEAKER_17]: It's spread all over Massachusetts.

647
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,059
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, I think it's in 49 states at this point.

648
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:26,382
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two patches of it along the access drive, very prominently displayed at the Brooks Estate, a total of about 1,400 square feet.

649
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:33,263
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't do something about Japanese knotweed, it'll eventually take over any area that it can thrive in.

650
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,344
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's very tough.

651
00:54:35,444 --> 00:54:38,284
[SPEAKER_17]: It likes sunshine.

652
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:40,445
[SPEAKER_17]: It thrives in crummy soils.

653
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:45,109
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not a plant biologist, but it's really quite an amazing plant on its own.

654
00:54:46,550 --> 00:55:02,534
[SPEAKER_17]: But we've been aware of this issue along the access drive, and we thought this was a good opportunity to apply some expertise, some funds with your help to eradicating this before it gets any larger.

655
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:06,506
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to put up about 48% of the money.

656
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:13,628
[SPEAKER_17]: We have talked with a licensed invasives expert to help us on the project.

657
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:20,790
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's safe to say the biology of the plant requires a sustained effort over several years.

658
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:30,553
[SPEAKER_17]: We've consulted both with the gentleman that's mentioned in the application and also the Friends of the Mystic River has had some considerable experience with this

659
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,049
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a plant that also likes water.

660
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:35,450
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess all plants like water, but it likes lots of water.

661
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,610
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's been down by the Mystic River.

662
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,631
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's a pretty straight ahead project.

663
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:49,073
[SPEAKER_17]: We think we'll have great benefits in terms of the habitat because we will replace these plants with native plants.

664
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,494
[SPEAKER_17]: It will certainly improve the aesthetics.

665
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:57,375
[SPEAKER_17]: It's certainly tied into another part of our applications here on the access drive.

666
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:25,505
[SPEAKER_17]: design It will improve the visitor experience at the Brooks estate for people are walking walking their dogs jogging birding which are some of the main activities for passive recreation at the few runners to I see but mostly walkers at the at the property, so I don't know what else to tell you about about this, but Questions or are there any questions from the board

667
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this a full application or does it fall under the small grants application?

668
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:37,365
[SPEAKER_19]: We could discuss that.

669
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:48,695
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't submitted as a small grant, but we could discuss whether to, because it falls in the criteria for a small grant, whether we want to put it in that category.

670
00:56:51,937 --> 00:56:53,158
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of the small grids have we gotten?

671
00:56:53,598 --> 00:56:55,399
[SPEAKER_19]: I think none this round.

672
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:55,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

673
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:57,680
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

674
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:07,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to mention two other things.

675
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:20,092
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a gentleman named Dana Gallop, who coincidentally lives on my street, is a retired landscape designer and a landscape contractor who's going to be helping us help from our side of it, manages

676
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:24,196
[SPEAKER_17]: He's had about 40 years experience in this realm.

677
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,721
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a great guy, if you've ever met him.

678
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:30,168
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he and his wife have been quite involved in the schools over the years.

679
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:32,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

680
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,640
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a question for you.

681
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:43,566
[SPEAKER_19]: So in your proposal, you show, I think, a three-year plan for keeping it under control.

682
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:45,347
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wondered what happens after that.

683
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:47,849
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the likelihood that you need to come back and repeat the process?

684
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:53,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, basically, the general practice with invasives is plants need space.

685
00:57:54,494 --> 00:57:59,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And evasives look for empty spaces, places where they can overcome other plants.

686
00:57:59,698 --> 00:58:02,340
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you do the right kind of plantings,

687
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,740
[SPEAKER_17]: replacement plantings.

688
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:13,942
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to keep an eye on it, you know, on an annual basis, but that's the general long-term solution here.

689
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:27,804
[SPEAKER_17]: The company, Apolitan, that we've been talking with, which I think has a very good record, has done some rather large Japanese knotweed projects, like 15 acres, which is hard to imagine 15 acres of Japanese knotweed.

690
00:58:28,324 --> 00:58:30,245
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was done, I think, 15 or 20 years ago.

691
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:35,916
[SPEAKER_17]: been replaced with native plants and has been quite successful.

692
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:38,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Japanese knotweed is a bad invasive.

693
00:58:38,758 --> 00:58:50,267
[SPEAKER_17]: It's probably not the worst invasive, but it's certainly one of the most prominent ones because it tends to be along areas where there's light or pathways, access drives, things like that.

694
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,690
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you looking for for replacement species?

695
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:56,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't tell you off the top of my head.

696
00:58:56,552 --> 00:58:59,855
[SPEAKER_17]: I think when we get the gentleman on site,

697
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,972
[SPEAKER_17]: At the beginning, we'll make some decisions there.

698
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:10,097
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the issues with the replacement species is how that, you know, how you fold that in.

699
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:11,558
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I'm not an expert.

700
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:14,040
[SPEAKER_17]: This is why we're hiring an expert.

701
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,302
[SPEAKER_17]: But certainly, this is an area, it's an edge, I think is the right word.

702
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:25,611
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of meld into the understory of the woods there, which is mostly oak and maple.

703
00:59:26,531 --> 00:59:28,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Second growth forest, third growth, fifth growth.

704
00:59:30,073 --> 00:59:36,936
[SPEAKER_17]: And so things that will certainly thrive on light, because there's quite a bit of light there.

705
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:43,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think eventually with the access drive opening up that, which we can talk about more too, there'll be more light than there is now.

706
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And I presume you'll be natives.

707
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, absolutely, natives.

708
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:48,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Natives all the way.

709
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this the only area where there's Japanese knotweed?

710
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's the primary area.

711
00:59:56,262 --> 01:00:10,967
[SPEAKER_17]: There is some... The Brooks Estate has a donut hole in the middle of it called the Stump Dump, where the city DPW has piled large quantities of dead trees, and there's some up near there.

712
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:14,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Japanese knotweed, like a lot of invasives, thrives when there's been soil disturbance.

713
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:22,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's certainly an area, so that, but we thought that, and that's not technically part of the Brooks Estate, although it's certainly Japanese, not weed.

714
01:00:23,848 --> 01:00:33,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the idea here is to tackle the most prominent and containable area first, and then think about moving on.

715
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:36,078
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny you should mention that, because I just noticed it today.

716
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,139
[SPEAKER_17]: I took a walk.

717
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:51,094
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a question I think that pertains to all three of the proposals that you have, but I know that you've developed a lot of these action items from the master plan.

718
01:00:51,154 --> 01:00:51,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

719
01:00:51,574 --> 01:01:00,500
[SPEAKER_19]: But I wonder, was there public process or was there input that you obtained from the community in the process of developing that master plan?

720
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:02,282
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm getting at is, is there

721
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:15,338
[SPEAKER_19]: To what extent can you demonstrate community support or support of other organizations in the community for doing the projects that you've identified here?

722
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:22,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we have a long track record of projects at the Brooks Estate, a combination of things.

723
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:26,862
[SPEAKER_17]: We've raised and spent probably $600,000 or $700,000.

724
01:01:27,802 --> 01:01:30,523
[SPEAKER_17]: We've leveraged that with CDBG money.

725
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:34,685
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got some preservation projects fund money.

726
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:37,679
[SPEAKER_17]: which most years it's very scarce on the ground.

727
01:01:38,399 --> 01:01:40,280
[SPEAKER_17]: We've gotten a Cummings grant.

728
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:43,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a membership.

729
01:01:43,522 --> 01:01:47,644
[SPEAKER_17]: We certainly have lots of people using the Brooks Estate.

730
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,685
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done projects with the Mononomy, with the Bird Clubs.

731
01:01:50,725 --> 01:01:53,986
[SPEAKER_17]: We've done projects with the Boy Scouts.

732
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:56,568
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a pretty long list.

733
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:03,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that some of these projects, certainly the physical projects on the buildings, are very much classic

734
01:02:04,357 --> 01:02:06,453
[SPEAKER_17]: historic preservation, historic restoration.

735
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:12,544
[SPEAKER_17]: projects that involve a degree of expertise that volunteers don't bring to the table.

736
01:02:14,405 --> 01:02:17,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what else to tell you.

737
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,486
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good.

738
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:20,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we want to move on?

739
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:22,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any more questions about Japanese knotweed?

740
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:22,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

741
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,808
[SPEAKER_22]: No, not about that, but a follow-up on what you were saying, Roberta.

742
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:33,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you just talk a little bit about the land trusts, the board composition, how many people are involved in that way?

743
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: The MBELT was put together in the wake of the conservation and preservation restriction in 1998.

744
01:02:43,808 --> 01:02:51,374
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is a governing document called the manager's document passed by the city council and the mayor.

745
01:02:52,155 --> 01:03:03,944
[SPEAKER_17]: And basically the board is made up of a mixture of appointed members from the historical commission, from the mayor, from the historical society.

746
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:05,936
[SPEAKER_17]: and elected members.

747
01:03:06,336 --> 01:03:07,537
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a membership organization.

748
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:09,879
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a 501C3.

749
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, we do have a couple of vacancies, but we have five board members.

750
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:16,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Myself, who's elected.

751
01:03:16,305 --> 01:03:20,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Doug Carr, who's elected.

752
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, it's the president and two directors are elected.

753
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:32,679
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have Mark Warren, who's new, who was appointed by Mayor

754
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:34,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

755
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:40,749
[SPEAKER_17]: He replaces Mae Markerbreck, who is a famous person here in Medford, who was on our board for a long time.

756
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:49,714
[SPEAKER_17]: And our newest member is a woman named Jennifer Keenan, who lives on Grove Street, and she was appointed by the Historical Commission.

757
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:50,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

758
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:58,698
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm more concerned, just not concerned, but interested in learning about, you know, the membership and how broad-based that is.

759
01:04:00,818 --> 01:04:04,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, most members are from Medford.

760
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:17,057
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'd make this in contradistinction with the Royal House of the Slave Quarters, which I'm also involved in, in a different capacity, where the membership is probably half outside of Medford, but that's a National Historic Landmark.

761
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:22,432
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's not a huge membership.

762
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:28,757
[SPEAKER_17]: If you talk to most small non-profits, membership is one of the most difficult things to sustain.

763
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:43,008
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's certainly been loyal, and it's, you know, covers, I have every address in my head, I have a lot of them, but it covers, you know, wide swaths of Medford.

764
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:45,450
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a public property.

765
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,672
[SPEAKER_17]: It's open every day from dawn to dusk.

766
01:04:48,572 --> 01:04:49,953
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go there and enjoy it.

767
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,593
[SPEAKER_17]: It's passive recreation.

768
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:54,254
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a wonderful place.

769
01:04:56,395 --> 01:04:56,735
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

770
01:04:57,675 --> 01:05:07,579
[SPEAKER_19]: Shall we have you present the next project for the Brooks Estate, which is the entryways restoration?

771
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:07,939
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

772
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:09,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me switch this around here.

773
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:25,610
[SPEAKER_17]: So, this is a classic, I think that's the right word, building restoration or a portion of a building restoration.

774
01:05:26,391 --> 01:05:39,483
[SPEAKER_17]: The two buildings at the Brooks Estate are the Shepherd Brooks Manor and the Carriage House, both built in 1880, designed by Peabody and Stearns, very fine examples of Victorian

775
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:56,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's safe to say when we got started on this project that both buildings and certainly the manor were in very, very bad shape after years of decay, I suppose is the right word.

776
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:00,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I could spend an awful lot of time telling you everything that's been done to the manor.

777
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:02,199
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a very long list.

778
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:09,942
[SPEAKER_17]: But this restoration, East Entryways, really is one of the last major pieces of the exterior restoration.

779
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:12,002
[SPEAKER_17]: We've completed the west porch.

780
01:06:12,042 --> 01:06:21,946
[SPEAKER_17]: We've completed the south veranda, 70 windows, a new roof, five chimneys, shutters, boiler, upgraded electrical.

781
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:24,087
[SPEAKER_17]: The list goes on quite a bit.

782
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:30,959
[SPEAKER_17]: The east entryways consist of really two entrances, obviously on the east side.

783
01:06:32,299 --> 01:06:35,781
[SPEAKER_17]: One is under the Port Cochere, which is a fancy name for a carport.

784
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:37,142
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

785
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:38,523
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

786
01:06:38,543 --> 01:06:39,223
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a good drawing here.

787
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:43,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to the right, the smaller entrance.

788
01:06:44,486 --> 01:06:51,290
[SPEAKER_17]: What's interesting is in the time that the Brooks occupied this property as a summer home,

789
01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:02,167
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a summer home and they were not there in the winter, and particularly the entrance on the right gets a lot of snowfall from a very steep roof there.

790
01:07:07,453 --> 01:07:14,817
[SPEAKER_17]: I use the word temporary, it's really been there a long time, a porch there and the steep roof is above it.

791
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:23,661
[SPEAKER_17]: So that area and the portcochere needs work in terms of pointing, particularly the piers.

792
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:33,766
[SPEAKER_17]: The other entrance is a little more complicated because it needs work on the pathway, which is not draining properly.

793
01:07:34,766 --> 01:07:35,767
[SPEAKER_17]: The temporary

794
01:07:36,462 --> 01:07:39,283
[SPEAKER_17]: slanted roof needs to be replaced.

795
01:07:39,463 --> 01:07:46,326
[SPEAKER_17]: And underneath that, you can kind of see it, I think, well, it's the other picture of the other entrance.

796
01:07:46,787 --> 01:07:51,629
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a marvelous half-moon, I think that's the right word, half-moon window hidden.

797
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:52,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there it is.

798
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:52,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

799
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:56,871
[SPEAKER_17]: Hidden under there that we wanted to restore.

800
01:07:57,211 --> 01:08:04,014
[SPEAKER_17]: The manor actually has, I think, five entrances when you add them all up.

801
01:08:04,074 --> 01:08:05,835
[SPEAKER_17]: So right now, it's already

802
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:12,597
[SPEAKER_17]: qualified under the ADA with existing entrances.

803
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:22,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So this will complete a huge portion of the building's envelope.

804
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:28,707
[SPEAKER_17]: The only other piece that really hasn't been tackled is the trim, the wooden trim.

805
01:08:28,987 --> 01:08:30,128
[SPEAKER_17]: The building is very high.

806
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,570
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 70 feet from ground to crown in the back, I think.

807
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:40,564
[SPEAKER_17]: painting trim at that level requires, but that's a different project.

808
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:44,327
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is the focus here.

809
01:08:45,307 --> 01:09:05,443
[SPEAKER_17]: The Port Cochere entrance is really the formal entrance for the building, has nice double doors, comes into the main hallway, off of which are the four or five public rooms, the dining room, the Shepherd Brooks office, the parlor,

810
01:09:06,695 --> 01:09:11,039
[SPEAKER_17]: and the library right off of that.

811
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:19,406
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this is really designed to complete that portion of that side of the building.

812
01:09:21,527 --> 01:09:21,808
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

813
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:24,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any questions from the board?

814
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:26,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

815
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:37,285
[SPEAKER_22]: On that east entryway, you're removing the structure that protects the entryway from snow, and is there going to be an issue there then?

816
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:46,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I believe, and I think it should be in here, we need to also add, I think this is the right term, snow guards.

817
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:51,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, on the roof above.

818
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,693
[SPEAKER_17]: The roof was completely redone in slate.

819
01:09:55,713 --> 01:09:58,695
[SPEAKER_17]: But for some reason, it's kind of lost in the midst of time at this point.

820
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:00,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Snow guards were not included there.

821
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:01,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So that needs to be.

822
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that part of this project?

823
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:04,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it is.

824
01:10:08,623 --> 01:10:10,744
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a critical but fairly minor piece.

825
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:14,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the biggest cost element here is the pointing, I believe.

826
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,780
[SPEAKER_19]: Other questions?

827
01:10:22,862 --> 01:10:24,002
[SPEAKER_19]: I was curious to learn.

828
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:25,663
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, did you have a question?

829
01:10:25,983 --> 01:10:26,243
[SPEAKER_19]: I did.

830
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:31,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually just curious if you started discussing this project with the MHC?

831
01:10:32,025 --> 01:10:34,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they know that this is in the pipeline?

832
01:10:35,327 --> 01:10:36,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you spell out MHC?

833
01:10:36,587 --> 01:10:37,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, the Mass Historical Commission.

834
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:47,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they'll need more drawings than we have at this point.

835
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,861
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have a very good relationship with Mr. Holtz.

836
01:10:51,002 --> 01:10:55,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, frankly, they're delighted that this building has been brought back from near death.

837
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:06,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I should also mention, on all these projects, we're contributing a percentage from our own funds as an act of good faith.

838
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:07,899
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's the right thing to do.

839
01:11:08,552 --> 01:11:13,454
[SPEAKER_19]: That was actually going to be my question, is where does the funding come from for this project?

840
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:19,456
[SPEAKER_19]: So a part of it you're contributing and a part of it you're asking from the CPC.

841
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:20,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that all of the funding?

842
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:22,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

843
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:22,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

844
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:36,603
[SPEAKER_17]: We raise money, like any non-profit, through memberships, through some fundraising, through things like sponsoring our picnic, which is July 14th, by the way.

845
01:11:37,844 --> 01:11:38,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of fun.

846
01:11:38,904 --> 01:11:39,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Best deal day.

847
01:11:39,604 --> 01:11:43,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we'll have a French theme this year.

848
01:11:43,885 --> 01:11:44,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so.

849
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:46,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

850
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:53,688
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's dollars plus in-kind contribution of project management and stuff like that, right?

851
01:11:55,048 --> 01:11:55,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

852
01:11:57,006 --> 01:11:57,326
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

853
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:00,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other questions?

854
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:07,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there comments, public comments about the projects thus far?

855
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely in support, absolutely, as a former board of directors.

856
01:12:13,724 --> 01:12:15,647
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he's right.

857
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:18,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Without Tom and Doug and so many others,

858
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:34,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Tommy and Doug and everybody else.

859
01:12:34,677 --> 01:12:40,024
[SPEAKER_15]: It's such an incredible, historical piece of property in Medford, and it's been neglected for far too many years.

860
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,708
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything that this committee can do along those lines is, wow.

861
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:45,911
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be something.

862
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:46,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

863
01:12:52,903 --> 01:12:54,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Tom, I appreciate it.

864
01:12:54,665 --> 01:12:59,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom served on our board many years ago, in its early years, and I appreciate it.

865
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:00,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you do.

866
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:03,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been consistent over the years.

867
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:13,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to mention that I serve with Tom on the InBelt board, and so when it comes to voting on this project, I will be recusing myself because I obviously have a conflict of interest.

868
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:16,921
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm listening, obviously, and I'm part of this committee.

869
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,243
[SPEAKER_06]: But on these three projects, I will not be voting.

870
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:21,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not have a vote.

871
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:35,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize why you want to do it, but it shouldn't have to be that way, because each one of you represents really a quota or a segment of Medford, whether you're in favor of the Parks and Recreation, and I know you do.

872
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:39,930
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Parks and Recreation come before you all the time, and you still vote.

873
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think anybody should recuse themselves in this committee, because that's who you are.

874
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:49,573
[SPEAKER_15]: You were chosen because you're going to represent this particular segment of the Methodist society.

875
01:13:49,993 --> 01:13:56,398
[SPEAKER_15]: So because you're an incredibly ethical guy, and I've known you since your high school days, obviously.

876
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:02,123
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think you should recuse yourself, because you add a lot to who you are.

877
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:04,525
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe you guys should talk about it.

878
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we've spoken to Mr. Remway.

879
01:14:12,811 --> 01:14:15,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, I'm following his, his directive.

880
01:14:17,072 --> 01:14:20,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I'm actually serving on the, from the historical commission.

881
01:14:20,634 --> 01:14:25,856
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's where I'm coming from on this, as an appointee from, for this board, um, this committee.

882
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:33,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, just to, there's the appearance of ethical lapse and then the, you know, it's, it's just being conservative.

883
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I have full faith in my colleagues.

884
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,601
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're, they're a well-rounded, well,

885
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:44,203
[SPEAKER_06]: very diligent, hardworking group, so I have full faith that they will do, choose good products.

886
01:14:44,223 --> 01:14:45,463
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many great ones here.

887
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:48,024
[SPEAKER_06]: They all look great to me.

888
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:53,086
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

889
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:59,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we have one more project for the Brooks Estate, and that is the access drive design.

890
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:02,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, this is our biggest application.

891
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:10,687
[SPEAKER_17]: There was reference made earlier to the master plan document, which is 350 pages long.

892
01:15:11,787 --> 01:15:15,528
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is certainly a big chunk of it.

893
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:21,249
[SPEAKER_17]: If you haven't been to the Brooks Estate, there is a 1,900 foot access drive.

894
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:26,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Starts at 275 Grove Street and goes all the way up to the manor.

895
01:15:27,342 --> 01:15:29,103
[SPEAKER_17]: up the hill around the curve.

896
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:42,210
[SPEAKER_17]: This is basically what's left of a country road, hand-built, probably by Irish immigrants, I believe, in the 1850s.

897
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:56,417
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a classic country road, and it provides, obviously, given its name, the access to the historical core or the built environment.

898
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:59,575
[SPEAKER_17]: of the Brooks Estate.

899
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:07,960
[SPEAKER_17]: From the get-go working on this project, we've recognized the critical nature of this element of the infrastructure.

900
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:23,030
[SPEAKER_17]: It also ties in, as you can see from the design parameters here, ties in such critical things as utilities and parking.

901
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,812
[SPEAKER_17]: The first thing I want to say is, and we

902
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:48,523
[SPEAKER_17]: discuss this with Danielle, et cetera, we will pay the portion of the design that is not directly connected to the historic road, and that is the parking area at the top, in the very upper right corner there, which has been contemplated.

903
01:16:48,543 --> 01:16:55,348
[SPEAKER_17]: There's very little parking at the Brooks Estate, and in order to operate the manor,

904
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,645
[SPEAKER_17]: more efficiently, and certainly the carriage house, and when that comes online, we do need parking.

905
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:07,212
[SPEAKER_17]: The parking, this general plan was developed in several pieces.

906
01:17:07,953 --> 01:17:10,856
[SPEAKER_17]: We, despite some time, we engaged a

907
01:17:12,163 --> 01:17:17,685
[SPEAKER_17]: landscape architect to talk about the landscape treatment in the historic core.

908
01:17:18,626 --> 01:17:22,588
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we got some MPC money for that.

909
01:17:22,628 --> 01:17:24,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember at this point.

910
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:31,231
[SPEAKER_17]: The state actually has a very interesting landscape initiatives that kind of comes and goes a little bit from MHC.

911
01:17:33,032 --> 01:17:35,533
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where that came from.

912
01:17:36,414 --> 01:17:41,636
[SPEAKER_17]: But as for the rest of the drive, there are some

913
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:45,463
[SPEAKER_17]: quite a long list of critical design issues here.

914
01:17:46,483 --> 01:17:55,848
[SPEAKER_17]: The ultimate width of the road, the nature of the... I've been using the English word verge, but that's not right.

915
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:57,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Shoulders, I guess, is the right word.

916
01:17:57,949 --> 01:18:00,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Or at least the sides.

917
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:08,335
[SPEAKER_17]: The access drive is both a functional element, an historic element, and an aesthetic element in the estate.

918
01:18:09,057 --> 01:18:18,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, if you go up the access drive in the summer, it feels very confined because of the invasives and other plants that have just crowded.

919
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:26,062
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you look at historic photos of the country road, look, it doesn't look like that.

920
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:32,484
[SPEAKER_17]: So improving the aesthetics will also improve the functionality of the drive.

921
01:18:32,944 --> 01:18:37,706
[SPEAKER_17]: We created a conceptual plan with some cross sections, et cetera,

922
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:58,387
[SPEAKER_17]: master plan, but this has not received the necessary full design treatment to discuss a number of issues, to reach some conclusions, and then to get to the point where we have design documents, I guess is the right word.

923
01:18:59,141 --> 01:19:02,823
[SPEAKER_17]: in order to move towards ultimately the construction.

924
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,104
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a big project.

925
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:11,489
[SPEAKER_17]: This is one of the big pieces of the remaining puzzle of the Brooks Estate.

926
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:21,995
[SPEAKER_17]: But certainly, achieving the full benefit of the restored buildings is not going to be possible without a redone access drive.

927
01:19:24,036 --> 01:19:26,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I should also mention, this will help some operational issues too.

928
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:44,452
[SPEAKER_17]: The electricity now comes up on a series of poles from Grove Street, which are very prone to snow, the wires are, et cetera, and aesthetically are not appropriate for a property of this sort.

929
01:19:45,112 --> 01:19:52,157
[SPEAKER_17]: So conduiting the electrical is a critical element as part of this.

930
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:54,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

931
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:56,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any questions from the board?

932
01:19:57,653 --> 01:19:58,253
[SPEAKER_11]: No questions.

933
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:07,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just, I'm glad that you clarified that because my first question was how a 50 car parking lot was restoration of an 1800s carriage house.

934
01:20:07,896 --> 01:20:08,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Just carriages.

935
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:09,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

936
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:23,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, one thing I should mention, a detail, the area, we've thought about this, and we're very concerned about balancing uses and balancing impacts.

937
01:20:23,882 --> 01:20:27,043
[SPEAKER_17]: The area where the parking area is proposed is

938
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:32,839
[SPEAKER_17]: below the grade of the surrounding area.

939
01:20:33,239 --> 01:20:39,700
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also where at one time, probably up to the 1920s, there was at least one or two car garages.

940
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:49,282
[SPEAKER_17]: The Brooks actually had a car with a driver at the Brooks Estate and a car with a driver at 92 Beacon Street in Boston, besides the carriages.

941
01:20:49,302 --> 01:20:53,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think the carriages were used much in the 1920s, but I'm not sure.

942
01:20:57,512 --> 01:21:13,437
[SPEAKER_17]: The thing that we're really working towards too is, on the aesthetics side, is that we want people to visit the property, whether they're there for a meeting, a wedding, whatever, and be in the 19th century as much as possible.

943
01:21:13,537 --> 01:21:14,778
[SPEAKER_17]: So the parking will be hidden.

944
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:21,720
[SPEAKER_17]: You park your car and the whole area there will look as much as possible.

945
01:21:22,888 --> 01:21:24,309
[SPEAKER_17]: as a historic landscape.

946
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:37,578
[SPEAKER_11]: As a follow-up, I know that one of our goals was to enhance public access to historic assets, so I looked at it upon that, but my follow-up is, will there be bike racks or something like that installed?

947
01:21:37,718 --> 01:21:38,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

948
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:51,587
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing, which is not directly part of the access drive, but up to the right, just before where it says Acorn Hill, there is a foundation of another building, which was built as a

949
01:21:52,732 --> 01:21:55,313
[SPEAKER_17]: believe it or not, graduation present for Gorham Brooks in 1902.

950
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:58,915
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called, what's it called?

951
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:01,216
[SPEAKER_17]: The Hamlet, I'm sorry, I never remember the word for it.

952
01:22:02,216 --> 01:22:04,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is a really nice landscape feature.

953
01:22:04,357 --> 01:22:05,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've actually cleared out a lot of that.

954
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:08,279
[SPEAKER_17]: More work needs to be done.

955
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:12,321
[SPEAKER_17]: We see that as sort of a place for photo ops, et cetera.

956
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,362
[SPEAKER_17]: There's actually an historic brick pathway that goes up the hill to it.

957
01:22:16,502 --> 01:22:17,463
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty interesting.

958
01:22:18,043 --> 01:22:20,364
[SPEAKER_17]: It was burned down as a firefighting exercise, I believe.

959
01:22:25,475 --> 01:22:26,175
[SPEAKER_14]: So excuse me.

960
01:22:26,236 --> 01:22:27,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

961
01:22:27,857 --> 01:22:35,402
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think I remember in a previous presentation that the pavement is supposed to be porous.

962
01:22:35,882 --> 01:22:36,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

963
01:22:36,182 --> 01:22:36,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

964
01:22:37,783 --> 01:22:43,487
[SPEAKER_17]: And the, I'm sorry, I can never remember this term, supported, what's it called?

965
01:22:43,647 --> 01:22:44,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Reinforced.

966
01:22:44,568 --> 01:22:50,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Reinforced earth on the shoulders in terms of being able to take heavy vehicles or

967
01:22:51,628 --> 01:22:54,030
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's also, there's a management side to this eventually.

968
01:22:55,451 --> 01:23:00,575
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't allow parking along the access drive, that sort of thing.

969
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:05,498
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a small parking lot across from the boardwalk, which was put in when the boardwalk was built in 1994.

970
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:13,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a provision for some handicap parking along the access drive.

971
01:23:13,504 --> 01:23:19,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And as well as the requisite handicap parking spaces in the built environment.

972
01:23:20,217 --> 01:23:24,078
[SPEAKER_14]: So part of the existing drive is paved now.

973
01:23:25,499 --> 01:23:27,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

974
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:28,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

975
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it all of it?

976
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's about half gone.

977
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how else to explain it.

978
01:23:38,182 --> 01:23:44,404
[SPEAKER_17]: But the first third of it, the city put in a paved few years ago.

979
01:23:44,464 --> 01:23:45,904
[SPEAKER_17]: It must be 10 years ago at this point.

980
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:51,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I presume you'll be coming, obviously you'll be going before the consequences.

981
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:52,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, absolutely.

982
01:23:52,284 --> 01:23:54,845
[SPEAKER_17]: On this and also the Japanese knotweed, I wanted to mention that too.

983
01:23:54,865 --> 01:24:02,910
[SPEAKER_14]: So the access drive will need to meet the redevelopment standards for stormwater management.

984
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:03,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

985
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:04,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the drive has been there for, say, 1850.

986
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:08,914
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how long that is.

987
01:24:09,074 --> 01:24:12,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's literally a redevelopment in terms of stormwater.

988
01:24:12,176 --> 01:24:13,357
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a new project.

989
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:14,137
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you're absolutely right.

990
01:24:14,157 --> 01:24:15,498
[SPEAKER_17]: You're absolutely right, yeah.

991
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:17,740
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually quite close to the pond at one point.

992
01:24:20,995 --> 01:24:26,680
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is going to be privately owned and maintained?

993
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:27,761
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

994
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,503
[SPEAKER_17]: The property is owned by the city of Medford.

995
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:33,446
[SPEAKER_17]: We are just the proponents and the manager.

996
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:38,630
[SPEAKER_17]: In the master plan, the master plan has two pieces.

997
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:48,178
[SPEAKER_17]: It has the capital side, the planning side in terms of what needs to be done to complete the project,

998
01:24:48,612 --> 01:24:52,753
[SPEAKER_17]: than it has an income projection side to.

999
01:24:53,334 --> 01:25:17,662
[SPEAKER_17]: And the general vision, which is very common for these sorts of properties, is to have, use the carriage house primarily as a function facility, but also have, you know, it's a public building, you know, access for community groups, small meetings, whatever, you know, depending on the capacity of the rooms and the nature of the building.

1000
01:25:18,553 --> 01:25:20,214
[SPEAKER_17]: The manor is a domestic structure.

1001
01:25:21,054 --> 01:25:24,335
[SPEAKER_17]: It has some fairly large rooms, but it doesn't have a ballroom.

1002
01:25:25,095 --> 01:25:29,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Unlike the Point O'Rocks mansion, which had a fabulous ballroom, but that's been gone since 1946.

1003
01:25:29,456 --> 01:25:38,478
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the vision, because you want a sustainable.

1004
01:25:40,339 --> 01:25:43,279
[SPEAKER_22]: So my question is, does the city plow this currently?

1005
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:44,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, absolutely.

1006
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,240
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually do a good job.

1007
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:48,283
[SPEAKER_17]: There are caretakers in the manor.

1008
01:25:48,303 --> 01:25:50,384
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to have a presence there.

1009
01:25:50,404 --> 01:25:58,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And the manor has, like any house, has electricity and water and a good heating system.

1010
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:03,751
[SPEAKER_17]: We completely redid the kitchen in the last few months, that sort of thing.

1011
01:26:04,511 --> 01:26:10,454
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you walked the street with the fire chief?

1012
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,471
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll be part of this process.

1013
01:26:14,772 --> 01:26:23,439
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a bit of a chicken and the egg thing in terms of you need a professional design to work against or work off of.

1014
01:26:23,619 --> 01:26:29,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Just because being on the board of community development, I'm dealing with the access issues.

1015
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:33,868
[SPEAKER_22]: The fire department is generally the most important department.

1016
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:41,774
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of concern about being able to get large fire vehicles down there, and oftentimes

1017
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:47,081
[SPEAKER_22]: that can come into conflict with the desire to have a more of a rural road character.

1018
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:54,186
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would encourage you to just do that and kind of talk through that with the fire department early in the process.

1019
01:26:54,807 --> 01:26:55,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1020
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:56,588
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been well aware of that.

1021
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:05,755
[SPEAKER_22]: My other question is in terms of the rural character, you know, black hot top is not very rural.

1022
01:27:05,855 --> 01:27:08,997
[SPEAKER_22]: So is this going to be a different coloration?

1023
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it going to be more of a natural cement or

1024
01:27:13,265 --> 01:27:18,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, definitely lighter colored, and then as pervious as possible.

1025
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:42,314
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what we try to do, this is conservation land, and it's wetlands, portions of it, et cetera, and the thing that makes the Brooks Estate unique, I think, in Medford, but also wonderful, is it's a combination of natural habitat, historic built environment, historic landscape.

1026
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:43,546
[SPEAKER_17]: in one place.

1027
01:27:43,766 --> 01:27:46,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I think you can all think of these things.

1028
01:27:46,087 --> 01:27:52,431
[SPEAKER_17]: You can think of lots of historic buildings that have lost their context completely in terms of landscape.

1029
01:27:53,371 --> 01:28:08,680
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing about porous or pervious concrete or surfacing is that it needs to be cleaned on a regular basis in order to function because sand gets in it and then it doesn't run off.

1030
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,041
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't run through.

1031
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:16,516
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know that's, again, something that the Community Development Board would be concerned about.

1032
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:17,496
[SPEAKER_22]: We just had a meeting.

1033
01:28:17,516 --> 01:28:24,921
[SPEAKER_22]: We went over a lot of these same kinds of issues for a very short street, and a lot of concern about that.

1034
01:28:25,021 --> 01:28:27,142
[SPEAKER_22]: So just want to flag those for you.

1035
01:28:27,202 --> 01:28:28,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, I appreciate it.

1036
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:38,509
[SPEAKER_17]: I think one of the key issues here, of course, is we've never had the wherewithal to have design professionals in terms of looking at all these issues.

1037
01:28:39,215 --> 01:28:41,397
[SPEAKER_17]: in a concentrated fashion.

1038
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:49,523
[SPEAKER_17]: We've had a vision, we've had some details, we've looked at other places, but we're not access drive designers.

1039
01:28:50,243 --> 01:29:07,316
[SPEAKER_22]: So will this funding, would this funding enable experts to be hired to look at different possible treatments and compare alternatives, or is it really just to do one build out?

1040
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:14,805
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Doug will have to answer that.

1041
01:29:14,985 --> 01:29:29,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the intent, and again, we're talking about just design drawings here, right, so there's no construction happening with these dollars, just to get a design so that the landscape folks and the civil folks and the fire chief and all, there must be 20 stakeholders

1042
01:29:30,195 --> 01:29:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1043
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:30,875
[SPEAKER_06]: In this project.

1044
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:31,756
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a complex project.

1045
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:32,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Complex project.

1046
01:29:32,536 --> 01:29:36,598
[SPEAKER_06]: The neighbors and abutters certainly are a part of this as well along Grove Street.

1047
01:29:36,878 --> 01:29:46,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think balancing all those concerns and getting a design that does, that looks like it did in the 19th century but still functions in the 21st century is the challenge.

1048
01:29:47,882 --> 01:30:08,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Tom mentioned, I think we're going to rely on experts on the landscape side and the civil engineering side, but for that road design especially, to tell us the right thing, a very durable project and something that is very low maintenance, but not no maintenance, because we know that that road will need to be maintained.

1049
01:30:08,769 --> 01:30:10,790
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, but part of this process would help get that

1050
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:15,431
[SPEAKER_22]: those stakeholder conversations and feedback from the relevant departments and agencies.

1051
01:30:15,571 --> 01:30:16,551
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.

1052
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:27,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in the schedule that Tom put together, there's a detailed, I think there's at least three or four different meetings for stakeholders, both the city and the abutters that's built into the schedule.

1053
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:29,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take a year to just design this road.

1054
01:30:30,154 --> 01:30:32,275
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very complicated process, public process.

1055
01:30:37,719 --> 01:30:47,085
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, my final question would be, and then assuming the design documents are done, the actual construction would require a bond?

1056
01:30:48,886 --> 01:30:49,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Or something similar.

1057
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:50,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly.

1058
01:30:51,648 --> 01:30:56,491
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a public asset, like the library or the police station, et cetera.

1059
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:08,776
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we would contemplate, depending on our wherewithal, contributing to that as we can, to the bottom line there.

1060
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:26,488
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanted to ask you to elaborate more on how the access road improves access and function for recreational use, for handicapped accessibility.

1061
01:31:28,855 --> 01:31:35,818
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to drive to the Brooks Estate, right now you pretty much have to go through the cemetery.

1062
01:31:35,838 --> 01:31:36,839
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the geography.

1063
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:39,920
[SPEAKER_17]: There's virtually no place to park.

1064
01:31:41,141 --> 01:31:47,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't mean to be dramatic here, but there's four or five spots in the little lot that's across from the boardwalk.

1065
01:31:49,044 --> 01:31:57,548
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's some parking up near the manor, which we always reserve for events, pretty much for handicap.

1066
01:31:58,395 --> 01:31:58,775
[SPEAKER_17]: access.

1067
01:31:59,536 --> 01:32:12,121
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you want to bring a group of people or whatever, certainly use of the manor, there are limitations.

1068
01:32:13,002 --> 01:32:26,248
[SPEAKER_17]: In terms of handicap access, there's an intermediate handicap parking, a couple of spots near one of the main very flat access to the pond.

1069
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,813
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a natural landscape.

1070
01:32:28,113 --> 01:32:33,257
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not destroying the natural landscape for some of these things.

1071
01:32:34,138 --> 01:32:43,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And that obviously was why parking was put across from the existing boardwalk to the pond, which is ADA accessible boardwalk.

1072
01:32:45,907 --> 01:32:52,292
[SPEAKER_17]: It basically allows more people to enjoy this at once and more people to have access.

1073
01:32:55,002 --> 01:33:10,432
[SPEAKER_17]: The historic entrance to the estate is gated on Grove Street, but the section between Grove Street and where it meets the road, the access drive, as it comes in from the cemetery, there's a corner there, is in rough shape.

1074
01:33:11,273 --> 01:33:24,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, you want as much operational control over the properties, especially with a major investment in the carriage house, et cetera, going forward.

1075
01:33:26,756 --> 01:33:31,099
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the geography is what it is, and it's been that way for several million years, I think.

1076
01:33:32,099 --> 01:33:42,805
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you could also comment on the historic landscape and how the road fits into restoring the historic landscape.

1077
01:33:42,965 --> 01:33:44,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1078
01:33:44,586 --> 01:33:50,270
[SPEAKER_17]: The purpose of the access drive, obviously, was to get the brooks from Grove Street up to the house.

1079
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,271
[SPEAKER_17]: There's about, I think, 80 or 100 foot rise there as part of

1080
01:33:56,493 --> 01:34:03,256
[SPEAKER_17]: The general landscape treatment, we want to improve some least seasonal views towards the ponds.

1081
01:34:04,377 --> 01:34:07,138
[SPEAKER_17]: This property had many more fields.

1082
01:34:07,378 --> 01:34:10,660
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a working farm in the 19th century.

1083
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:22,286
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not cutting down 40 acres of forest and turning it back into that, but there's some opportunities for some view sheds, which we've shown on some previous documents in the master plan.

1084
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:30,701
[SPEAKER_17]: It also, the redone access drive will certainly enhance what you might call the sense of arrival.

1085
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:41,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And part of it, in a sense, it's I think also sort of the sizzle in terms of the attractiveness of the property when you're talking about weddings and things like that.

1086
01:34:41,663 --> 01:34:49,704
[SPEAKER_17]: The things that we need, like any property like this, in order to pay the bills on a sustaining basis going forward.

1087
01:34:50,264 --> 01:34:53,245
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it sounds silly, but it will just look a lot better.

1088
01:34:53,852 --> 01:35:00,377
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll be more inviting, it'll be much more open, much more naturalistic than it is now.

1089
01:35:00,797 --> 01:35:02,418
[SPEAKER_17]: The road's in very rough shape at this point.

1090
01:35:03,499 --> 01:35:04,359
[SPEAKER_17]: No two ways about it.

1091
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:07,570
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything else?

1092
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:09,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any more comments, questions?

1093
01:35:10,614 --> 01:35:11,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I make a quick statement?

1094
01:35:12,215 --> 01:35:12,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1095
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,777
[SPEAKER_12]: So shame on me.

1096
01:35:13,837 --> 01:35:15,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been in medicine for five years.

1097
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:16,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never seen it.

1098
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And your passion is just beautiful.

1099
01:35:19,202 --> 01:35:19,923
[SPEAKER_13]: And Doug, yours as well.

1100
01:35:24,768 --> 01:35:25,609
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you pay your bills?

1101
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:26,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have functions?

1102
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:29,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we don't have many bills now.

1103
01:35:30,452 --> 01:35:37,976
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds stupid, but what I'm saying is that we played a long period of catch-up ball here, I think is the word.

1104
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:41,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's put it this way.

1105
01:35:42,379 --> 01:35:46,181
[SPEAKER_17]: The manor is 90% someplace, 90% done.

1106
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:50,204
[SPEAKER_17]: The carriage house is just a shell at this point.

1107
01:35:50,224 --> 01:35:50,784
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a plan.

1108
01:35:54,325 --> 01:36:05,431
[SPEAKER_17]: both operational, capital, et cetera, for both buildings moving forward with the cost side, the income side, the projections, et cetera.

1109
01:36:06,031 --> 01:36:08,632
[SPEAKER_17]: The access drive is probably the biggest impediment.

1110
01:36:09,613 --> 01:36:17,317
[SPEAKER_17]: You could have the finest manor up there, but people aren't going to come there on this road as it exists at this point.

1111
01:36:17,753 --> 01:36:19,154
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's an interesting question.

1112
01:36:19,194 --> 01:36:21,497
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a chicken and the egg proposition here.

1113
01:36:21,677 --> 01:36:24,379
[SPEAKER_17]: You should start with the road or start with the buildings.

1114
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:32,147
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we hadn't started with the buildings, there wouldn't be any buildings there at this point.

1115
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:34,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1116
01:36:34,509 --> 01:36:37,992
[SPEAKER_17]: But at least there's an access drive.

1117
01:36:38,212 --> 01:36:40,955
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like there's no access drive.

1118
01:36:43,863 --> 01:36:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1119
01:36:44,704 --> 01:36:47,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just get your name for the record?

1120
01:36:47,564 --> 01:36:50,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1121
01:36:50,565 --> 01:36:51,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm John Anderson.

1122
01:36:52,385 --> 01:36:56,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also president of the Medford Historical Society.

1123
01:36:56,646 --> 01:37:00,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I support this application.

1124
01:37:01,388 --> 01:37:10,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I also would just like to comment that there was a question about the public process going into the master plan, and I don't think Tom fully

1125
01:37:20,738 --> 01:37:21,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Great lengths by the board.

1126
01:37:21,999 --> 01:37:23,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Various experts were brought in.

1127
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,381
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, Jim Kiley, the landscape architect.

1128
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:28,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's that guy, Wes?

1129
01:37:29,283 --> 01:37:31,864
[SPEAKER_17]: From the... From Trustees of Reservation.

1130
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Wesley Warren.

1131
01:37:32,384 --> 01:37:33,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Trustees of Reservation.

1132
01:37:34,405 --> 01:37:37,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom talked about it endlessly at our annual meetings.

1133
01:37:39,808 --> 01:37:41,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Which were all open to the public.

1134
01:37:41,389 --> 01:37:42,490
[SPEAKER_08]: These are public meetings.

1135
01:37:43,053 --> 01:37:47,135
[SPEAKER_17]: And this was also, the master plan was in front of the city council for about two and a half years.

1136
01:37:47,175 --> 01:37:47,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1137
01:37:48,376 --> 01:37:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So it had plenty of public process.

1138
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:52,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1139
01:37:53,018 --> 01:38:00,302
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1140
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:03,264
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1141
01:38:03,284 --> 01:38:03,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes?

1142
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:13,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to echo what Tom said earlier, if you want to see the master plan, go to brooksestate.org.

1143
01:38:13,069 --> 01:38:15,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the entire 300 pages.

1144
01:38:15,809 --> 01:38:17,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that's an executive summary.

1145
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only like 10 or 12 if you want to read that.

1146
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:25,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also a cleanup on May 5th, Saturday, that is open to the public from 10 to 3.

1147
01:38:26,352 --> 01:38:29,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And a free picnic on July 14th, also a Saturday from 12 to 3.

1148
01:38:30,393 --> 01:38:35,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to come up, have some free burgers, come up to see the Brooks Estate, this is the two good dates to do that.

1149
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:40,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1150
01:38:42,101 --> 01:38:48,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe, without any further comments, that concludes the presentation from the applicants.

1151
01:38:49,285 --> 01:38:53,367
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we'd like to open up the floor for further public comment and invite you to come.

1152
01:38:54,987 --> 01:38:55,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1153
01:39:02,711 --> 01:39:03,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1154
01:39:22,338 --> 01:39:24,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm working on it, thanks.

1155
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:45,178
[SPEAKER_15]: But leading up to that, I'd like to share, and by the way, so my name is Dominic Camara, and I co-chair the Governmental Affairs Committee for the Chamber of Commerce, and my esteemed co-chair is right there, Steve Pompeo, and the ex-official president, Tina Caruso, from the Chamber's right there, Charlotte Scuderi, Tom Lincoln, he's not in the Chamber, but he should be.

1156
01:39:51,239 --> 01:40:06,430
[SPEAKER_15]: By way of getting us involved, I suppose, we meaning the chamber and the commercial sector with you as a committee, we've done some research obviously to just show you at least what the commercial sector contributes to the city of Medford.

1157
01:40:07,952 --> 01:40:21,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And how, hopefully, this commission, this committee, will recognize that and perhaps help us in the chamber, which represents the commercial sector, how best to distribute some funding.

1158
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:24,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if you start from the top, I mean, this is a summary.

1159
01:40:24,996 --> 01:40:26,397
[SPEAKER_15]: This is public information, by the way.

1160
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:27,237
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all at City Hall.

1161
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:34,147
[SPEAKER_15]: As you can see, the total revenue from the levy is roughly somewhere around $110 million.

1162
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:37,611
[SPEAKER_15]: The budget is somewhere around $150 million, but that's from state and federal stuff.

1163
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:41,856
[SPEAKER_15]: But the levy from the residential, commercial, industrial sector is roughly $110 million.

1164
01:40:44,101 --> 01:41:09,008
[SPEAKER_15]: We, in the commercial sector, represent roughly 10%, roughly a billion of assessed value, which is 10% of the overall values that are in Medford, which translates into roughly $20 million that the commercial sector puts into that $110 million, because we get taxed at double the rate of the residential rate, as you all know, in the city of Medford.

1165
01:41:10,025 --> 01:41:19,871
[SPEAKER_15]: which also translates in terms of the CPA that I'm a homeowner at Medford and I pay, I think, I don't know, $60, $70, I forget what it is annually because of the CPA.

1166
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:24,253
[SPEAKER_15]: 1.5% over what you pay in taxes.

1167
01:41:24,533 --> 01:41:26,234
[SPEAKER_15]: On the commercial side, that's exactly double.

1168
01:41:26,715 --> 01:41:37,741
[SPEAKER_15]: So while I pay X amount of dollars in terms of my residential thing, in my commercial holdings that I have at Medford, I paid 10 times that amount to the city, contribute quite a bit on the commercial side.

1169
01:41:38,908 --> 01:41:46,132
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the actual dollars, if you look at the fact that we contribute roughly $20 million to the levy, the 1.5% of that is roughly $300,000.

1170
01:41:46,172 --> 01:41:48,413
[SPEAKER_15]: So the CPA collects roughly, what, a million and a half or so?

1171
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,552
[SPEAKER_15]: 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, something like that, yeah, that's right, and 1.3.

1172
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:01,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And we contribute 300,000 of that.

1173
01:42:02,014 --> 01:42:02,635
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot of money.

1174
01:42:03,416 --> 01:42:06,979
[SPEAKER_15]: And so our question on the commercial side is what is the commercial side going to get for this?

1175
01:42:07,019 --> 01:42:10,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's wonderful that it was voted, CPA, and I voted as a resident.

1176
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:15,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I voted because I love parks and recreation.

1177
01:42:15,265 --> 01:42:16,305
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the dog park.

1178
01:42:16,646 --> 01:42:20,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I love everything for the M-Belt and so on.

1179
01:42:20,347 --> 01:42:26,870
[SPEAKER_15]: And quite frankly, it was emotional for me to hear this young lady that came up on section eight for affordable housing.

1180
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:27,930
[SPEAKER_15]: It shouldn't exist.

1181
01:42:28,411 --> 01:42:39,715
[SPEAKER_15]: And I told the woman who presented the whole thing that I had a 20-unit complex in Melrose, and I went out of my way to get at least three or four section eight families into that building, to integrate into my building.

1182
01:42:39,735 --> 01:42:40,776
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe in that stuff.

1183
01:42:41,356 --> 01:42:47,600
[SPEAKER_15]: But when it comes to the commercial side, for what I think we're going to get out of it, which is probably, I don't know.

1184
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:49,481
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, Roberta was very helpful.

1185
01:42:49,741 --> 01:42:52,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to compliment you for showing up at the chamber that night.

1186
01:42:52,563 --> 01:42:55,104
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a windy, crappy night, wasn't it?

1187
01:42:55,685 --> 01:43:00,548
[SPEAKER_15]: And to meet with the board and you know what?

1188
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:09,179
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to compliment you as well because you actually, you heard me say something about the commercial sector when I came to admit, said, oh no, no, we're willing to help you out.

1189
01:43:09,519 --> 01:43:11,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So Danielle, thank you for that.

1190
01:43:11,942 --> 01:43:18,812
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this has led us to at least share with you some data of who we are, what we represent, and what we contribute to the city of Manfred.

1191
01:43:19,895 --> 01:43:22,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, perhaps, my question to you is this.

1192
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:36,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoever constructed the parameters, that is now the CPA and the CPC, were very smart people, but they kind of left the commercial sector out of the picture, quite for me, from my point of reference.

1193
01:43:36,907 --> 01:43:41,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We are five, six, seven, eight different places in Medford that represent the commercial sector.

1194
01:43:41,932 --> 01:43:48,739
[SPEAKER_15]: When you talk about Medford Square, you talk about Haines Square, you're talking about West Medford, you talk about the Heights and the Tufts area, the Wellington Circle.

1195
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:53,263
[SPEAKER_15]: So it isn't like Melrose where you got one street, oh, nice and neat, in Winchester, nice street.

1196
01:43:53,663 --> 01:43:55,064
[SPEAKER_15]: It's easy, the commercial sector.

1197
01:43:55,605 --> 01:44:00,568
[SPEAKER_15]: We are so dispersed and so huge in Medford that it's hard to unify all of that.

1198
01:44:00,748 --> 01:44:14,438
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we sort of need a wonder from you, is there any money that we can apply for to give us somebody that could become a grant writer, an application writer for all of these incredibly diverse centers that represent the commercial sector in Medford?

1199
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:17,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we can't do it in the chamber.

1200
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,402
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have that facility to represent all of these people.

1201
01:44:21,042 --> 01:44:28,185
[SPEAKER_15]: So, is there anything that we can either approach the CPC that would allow for something like that?

1202
01:44:28,645 --> 01:44:39,270
[SPEAKER_15]: We met a young lady that Cheryl Rodigues, the one who was there, and she said, well, you know, I'd like to help you out to at least write the applications for whoever needs one in the commercial sector.

1203
01:44:40,645 --> 01:44:42,686
[SPEAKER_15]: What is your feeling on that?

1204
01:44:42,706 --> 01:44:47,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think it's even out of the question, or is it something that you can look into for us and maybe make it happen?

1205
01:44:49,729 --> 01:44:53,751
[SPEAKER_19]: We're bound by the state law that created the Community Preservation Act.

1206
01:44:54,012 --> 01:44:56,353
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're working within those boundaries.

1207
01:44:56,813 --> 01:44:58,854
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a table.

1208
01:44:59,814 --> 01:45:02,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, you can't see it from here, but I'm showing you what it looks like.

1209
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:05,917
[SPEAKER_19]: It's available on our website, and it's available

1210
01:45:07,358 --> 01:45:11,460
[SPEAKER_19]: through the Massachusetts Community Preservation Coalition website.

1211
01:45:12,061 --> 01:45:17,264
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a matrix that shows the allowable uses under the Community Preservation Act.

1212
01:45:17,764 --> 01:45:24,668
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're bound to fund projects that fit within this matrix using Community Preservation Act funds.

1213
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:47,340
[SPEAKER_19]: That said, we hope that some of the funding will be able to, at least indirectly, help the business community by perhaps historic preservation projects, which make our business districts look more attractive and have a historic character that draws business to them, as well as public open space projects that likewise

1214
01:45:48,540 --> 01:46:02,763
[SPEAKER_19]: improve the quality of our commercial areas, particularly Medford Square, where we could have the Mystic River enhancements that bring the river into, you know, enliven, help to enliven Medford Square.

1215
01:46:03,263 --> 01:46:04,423
[SPEAKER_19]: So some things like that.

1216
01:46:04,443 --> 01:46:10,705
[SPEAKER_19]: There may be creative grant writers might be able to put together proposals that will specifically

1217
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:16,348
[SPEAKER_19]: benefit commercial properties, perhaps historic preservation.

1218
01:46:16,368 --> 01:46:19,090
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we don't have.

1219
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:22,052
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get the money to get a creative grant writer.

1220
01:46:23,652 --> 01:46:27,315
[SPEAKER_15]: So you talk about Catch-22s and a lot of people kind of

1221
01:46:28,654 --> 01:46:30,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, where's Chris Donovan?

1222
01:46:31,377 --> 01:46:31,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he here?

1223
01:46:32,498 --> 01:46:37,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in Florida and he called me up to do, he says, Dominic, can I use your building in Medford Square because I want to light it up.

1224
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:40,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to show how exciting Medford Square can be.

1225
01:46:40,307 --> 01:46:41,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, go ahead, what are you going to light up?

1226
01:46:42,189 --> 01:46:43,069
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to set it on fire?

1227
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,152
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, no, no, I'm going to use all kinds of lighting.

1228
01:46:45,172 --> 01:46:49,656
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got to tell you, I think this gentleman was part of it, right, Fritz?

1229
01:46:49,816 --> 01:46:50,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1230
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:57,398
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I saw it, I said, oh my God, if this was done all over Medford and all the squares, it would be so incredibly beautiful.

1231
01:46:57,698 --> 01:46:58,839
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not historical.

1232
01:47:00,019 --> 01:47:02,719
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, see, these are all the catch-22s that we encounter.

1233
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:07,740
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the kinds of things that would lighten up, whether it's lighting and so on, and we run into the same thing.

1234
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,961
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not this, it's not this.

1235
01:47:09,041 --> 01:47:11,341
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't qualify for anything, it seems.

1236
01:47:11,361 --> 01:47:14,742
[SPEAKER_15]: It's frustrating as you know what, and yet,

1237
01:47:16,122 --> 01:47:16,943
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this is data.

1238
01:47:17,283 --> 01:47:20,327
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this is not, that's a lot of money we contribute to the city of Medford.

1239
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:21,188
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we going to get back?

1240
01:47:21,548 --> 01:47:23,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Steve, would you like to add anything to this?

1241
01:47:23,391 --> 01:47:24,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam President?

1242
01:47:24,332 --> 01:47:24,752
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys?

1243
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:35,505
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to thank Roberta for coming out to the chamber that night and helping us out and the whole committee for allowing us to

1244
01:47:39,548 --> 01:47:54,564
[SPEAKER_24]: and maybe how we might be able to help our own membership if there are some ways where they could somehow benefit from these funds and improve our downtown business district in some way.

1245
01:47:55,194 --> 01:48:14,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to invite people to work with our coordinator, Danielle Evans, who can be very helpful to guide prospective applicants in what kinds of projects might be eligible and how to go through the application process and what are the steps that you need to take.

1246
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:17,863
[SPEAKER_19]: So she can be a resource person to help guide.

1247
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:24,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I have talked to you a bit about some off the top of my head projects I thought could possibly qualify.

1248
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So if one of the buildings is historic, as the historic commission has made the determination that it is, that private

1249
01:48:36,023 --> 01:48:56,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Property owners can apply for funding to you know restore the storefronts So there's a rehabilitation and restoration so making capital improvements or extraordinary repairs to make assets and

1250
01:48:56,903 --> 01:49:05,009
[SPEAKER_11]: functional for intended use, including improvements to comply with federal, state, or local building or access codes, or federal standards for rehabilitation of historic properties.

1251
01:49:05,029 --> 01:49:06,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the Department of Interior standards.

1252
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,711
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to meet those standards.

1253
01:49:07,751 --> 01:49:24,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was also thinking if, I know a lot of, at least in Medford Square, a lot of the buildings encompass the whole lot, but maybe some of them don't, and you could maybe create a pocket park that would be publicly accessible,

1254
01:49:25,301 --> 01:49:30,566
[SPEAKER_10]: That could potentially be in qualifying a recreation open space.

1255
01:49:30,907 --> 01:49:41,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's different things I've just kind of... I mean, I'm sympathetic with Bob, obviously, because it is a lot of money, and I think everyone in the city

1256
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:47,464
[SPEAKER_06]: whether you own a single family or you rent, whatever, you want to see where the money goes, obviously.

1257
01:49:47,484 --> 01:49:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what this committee is all about.

1258
01:49:49,285 --> 01:49:59,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my question is, is it worth you calling the folks at the state level and trying to like put on the Chamber of Commerce hat and see like what are the precedents?

1259
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:01,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Because these are the rules.

1260
01:50:01,911 --> 01:50:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to follow these rules, obviously.

1261
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, you know, we can't just do anything.

1262
01:50:05,951 --> 01:50:09,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't, if we wanted to, we have to follow, this is the mandate, we have to follow those rules.

1263
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,613
[SPEAKER_06]: But knowing that, is there a possibility to see what's kind of in that direction?

1264
01:50:20,195 --> 01:50:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the possibilities?

1265
01:50:22,257 --> 01:50:25,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had discussion before, even before when this first started.

1266
01:50:26,001 --> 01:50:26,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not lead by example?

1267
01:50:27,202 --> 01:50:41,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to other city sites, such as Cambridge, for example, and see what their business communities have done, what their private business owners have done, to see what has already been done and use that as an example to springboard into Medford.

1268
01:50:42,867 --> 01:50:44,468
[SPEAKER_15]: You're saying Cambridge CPA-wise?

1269
01:50:44,648 --> 01:50:45,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it doesn't have to be.

1270
01:50:45,908 --> 01:50:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the first, but you can look at a lot of other cities and towns that have done it also.

1271
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:52,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know.

1272
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit of work, but it might pay off in the long run.

1273
01:50:55,813 --> 01:51:03,896
[SPEAKER_15]: The reality of the business community, which is us, is that we're up to our eyeballs in what we need to do.

1274
01:51:04,576 --> 01:51:12,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Unlike these wonderful committees that have 50 hours a day to spend on this kind of thing, chasing down things, we don't.

1275
01:51:14,532 --> 01:51:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, we don't have 50 hours a day to work on this.

1276
01:51:17,633 --> 01:51:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys have a lot of smart minds with the chamber and everybody else.

1277
01:51:21,254 --> 01:51:26,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put a little committee together to see what could be going on and have someone investigate.

1278
01:51:26,755 --> 01:51:28,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody takes one or two towns like we broke down.

1279
01:51:28,996 --> 01:51:29,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds so easy.

1280
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:31,436
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well anyway.

1281
01:51:31,756 --> 01:51:32,836
[SPEAKER_22]: So just a couple of thoughts.

1282
01:51:33,077 --> 01:51:33,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

1283
01:51:33,857 --> 01:51:39,478
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that, you know, there may be specific projects that could be funded that would directly benefit the business community.

1284
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:50,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the benefit is more indirect in terms of this project because making Medford a better place to live and work, obviously, makes it more attractive for businesses, more foot traffic, et cetera.

1285
01:51:50,797 --> 01:52:06,545
[SPEAKER_22]: I think for what you're really interested in, though, is building some capacity so that you can, with the chamber, you know, go find some grant money and maybe have a staff person and really carry out the mission of the chamber.

1286
01:52:06,952 --> 01:52:09,754
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think for that there may be some other... On behalf of the commercial sector.

1287
01:52:09,774 --> 01:52:09,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1288
01:52:10,054 --> 01:52:14,518
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that there may be some other opportunities to do that.

1289
01:52:14,538 --> 01:52:18,921
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if you've ever dealt with the Massachusetts downtown initiative that the state has.

1290
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:22,003
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they have some resources that might be interesting.

1291
01:52:22,223 --> 01:52:25,306
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm happy to talk to you offline about it.

1292
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:29,248
[SPEAKER_22]: I've worked with business improvement districts and things like that.

1293
01:52:29,268 --> 01:52:30,830
[SPEAKER_22]: There's other mechanisms for...

1294
01:52:31,772 --> 01:52:32,492
[SPEAKER_22]: We're getting that done too.

1295
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,493
[SPEAKER_15]: We would love to have you as a guest on the committee.

1296
01:52:34,533 --> 01:52:39,155
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a possible 12 people on the committee, and several will have to go back to work.

1297
01:52:39,355 --> 01:52:42,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Maury Carroll, he's got a restaurant to run.

1298
01:52:43,457 --> 01:52:46,438
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the reality of our lives in terms of the commercial sector.

1299
01:52:46,518 --> 01:52:48,839
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd love to be able to chase down all sorts of things.

1300
01:52:48,859 --> 01:52:50,900
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to jump in for a second.

1301
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:55,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything that's been spoken about tonight needs to be taken care of.

1302
01:52:55,141 --> 01:52:55,822
[SPEAKER_16]: No question.

1303
01:52:56,062 --> 01:52:59,003
[SPEAKER_16]: But the commercial sector, as we're talking,

1304
01:53:00,047 --> 01:53:03,248
[SPEAKER_16]: We want people to come into our city and appreciate the city.

1305
01:53:03,348 --> 01:53:14,772
[SPEAKER_16]: If they're driving around and there's nothing to see, there are things that need to be taken care of, and everything we point out, it says, oh, the city will take care of it, the city will take care of it, and it's not being taken care of.

1306
01:53:15,152 --> 01:53:21,474
[SPEAKER_16]: But yet, the money is being put out through the commercial sector, and what are we getting back from?

1307
01:53:21,854 --> 01:53:25,855
[SPEAKER_16]: We need help, we need help.

1308
01:53:25,915 --> 01:53:29,076
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things that this conundrum that we run into,

1309
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:52,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that that when we ask about things a better lighting in all of Medford with oh, yeah, that's not the city So when it comes to the commercials, that's the answer we get but yet when you say well this park needs to be done Why isn't that the city to the CPA the CPA on CPC is more than willing to do that But yeah, that's a city responsibility Like do you say we pay the sidewalks and do this or do that?

1310
01:53:52,195 --> 01:53:53,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no, that's that's the city.

1311
01:53:53,415 --> 01:53:59,257
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not CPC It's almost like no matter what we want is not CPC the CPA or

1312
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:02,179
[SPEAKER_15]: grant state guidelines.

1313
01:54:02,299 --> 01:54:03,059
[SPEAKER_15]: It's frustrating.

1314
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,842
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is what we want to discuss with you as a committee.

1315
01:54:07,062 --> 01:54:11,725
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can find a way to integrate us, you know, the commercial sector.

1316
01:54:12,446 --> 01:54:16,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Forget the Chamber of Commerce, the vehicle that people complain to.

1317
01:54:16,128 --> 01:54:18,069
[SPEAKER_15]: You say, what will the Chamber do for me?

1318
01:54:18,250 --> 01:54:18,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1319
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:19,731
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you want us to do for you?

1320
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:20,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is.

1321
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:22,352
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fighting and fighting.

1322
01:54:23,553 --> 01:54:24,554
[SPEAKER_15]: All we got is brick walls.

1323
01:54:24,914 --> 01:54:29,816
[SPEAKER_15]: And when it comes to the commercial sector, not the residential sector, like I said, I benefit a lot.

1324
01:54:30,196 --> 01:54:31,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I taught at Medford High for 35 years.

1325
01:54:32,117 --> 01:54:33,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the city of Medford.

1326
01:54:34,178 --> 01:54:38,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, every park, every, you know, we started the flower things in front of Medford High.

1327
01:54:39,461 --> 01:54:43,963
[SPEAKER_15]: But when it comes to the commercial, there's a blind eye to it on every level of government.

1328
01:54:44,743 --> 01:54:54,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And we get the feeling, I know you don't mean it, that there's that same blind eye here that we're willing to help, but we don't know how you're going to help us.

1329
01:54:56,466 --> 01:55:04,187
[SPEAKER_24]: I think at this point, if the commercial sector has a project, that's what they need to do is come up and present that project.

1330
01:55:04,227 --> 01:55:04,447
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1331
01:55:04,567 --> 01:55:04,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct?

1332
01:55:04,867 --> 01:55:05,688
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing else.

1333
01:55:06,588 --> 01:55:09,008
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we've learned enough about what this committee does.

1334
01:55:09,028 --> 01:55:11,729
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing else that this group can do until

1335
01:55:13,108 --> 01:55:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, you're right.

1336
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not here to provide the ideas.

1337
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:19,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to receive the ideas and process them.

1338
01:55:19,631 --> 01:55:22,973
[SPEAKER_22]: We can help provide feedback before you get to that point so you're not wasting your time either.

1339
01:55:22,993 --> 01:55:30,537
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have an inkling of an idea, run it by me before you start putting so much effort into it.

1340
01:55:32,097 --> 01:55:39,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, we would love to have some money from the CPC in terms of providing us with somebody that can guide us.

1341
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:41,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody who's professional that says, I know what to do.

1342
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:43,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how to write this stuff.

1343
01:55:43,321 --> 01:55:44,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how to present this stuff.

1344
01:55:44,542 --> 01:55:45,722
[SPEAKER_15]: We know how to do this.

1345
01:55:45,822 --> 01:55:46,863
[SPEAKER_05]: That's planning.

1346
01:55:47,343 --> 01:55:48,843
[SPEAKER_15]: You're missing planning.

1347
01:55:49,183 --> 01:55:50,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, right.

1348
01:55:50,764 --> 01:55:52,785
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have that and we don't know how to get that.

1349
01:55:54,275 --> 01:55:55,076
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, but here it is.

1350
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:57,617
[SPEAKER_15]: We're providing $300,000 a year.

1351
01:55:58,178 --> 01:56:15,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask if the board would consider an application, say, from a private... There are many historic buildings in Medford, commercial buildings that are privately owned, that over the decades have had rather unsympathetic changes made to them.

1352
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:15,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1353
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:19,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I think of the Usher Building, for example, in West Medford, and there are many, many more.

1354
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:26,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Would the board consider an application from a private owner to restore a historic facade?

1355
01:56:28,015 --> 01:56:28,476
[SPEAKER_19]: We would.

1356
01:56:29,196 --> 01:56:36,798
[SPEAKER_19]: According to our plan, we have prioritized different kinds of historic preservation projects.

1357
01:56:37,358 --> 01:56:39,799
[SPEAKER_19]: City-owned projects are a higher priority.

1358
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:47,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Privately-owned projects are a lower priority, but they're still a project that we would consider in a given funding round.

1359
01:56:51,347 --> 01:56:52,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Like take Gaffey's funeral home.

1360
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,953
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the oldest, as you know, John, right?

1361
01:56:57,475 --> 01:57:09,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Would, for example, if somebody were able to write this thing, you know, this application thing, would this committee be able to fund the removal of all the, you know,

1362
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:15,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Aluminum siding or whatever and bring that thing back to what it used to be or is that something that that right?

1363
01:57:15,314 --> 01:57:16,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

1364
01:57:16,415 --> 01:57:18,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know what I mean that we're just thinking that's rest of me.

1365
01:57:18,637 --> 01:57:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: There's approximately 30 something commuter properties in Medford that are on the national register.

1366
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:27,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all of them are High in the eligibility lists.

1367
01:57:27,624 --> 01:57:28,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't mean residential now.

1368
01:57:28,525 --> 01:57:29,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking commercial.

1369
01:57:29,245 --> 01:57:30,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it's commercial.

1370
01:57:30,086 --> 01:57:31,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we're interested in.

1371
01:57:31,267 --> 01:57:32,868
[SPEAKER_06]: But the ocean building is a mixed use as well.

1372
01:57:32,888 --> 01:57:35,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know I think John is right.

1373
01:57:35,831 --> 01:57:38,433
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of potential products out there.

1374
01:57:42,353 --> 01:57:49,439
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just, my goodness, I've got photos in my office in Medford Square, in my building that shows you what Medford Square looked like years and years.

1375
01:57:49,499 --> 01:57:50,420
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gorgeous.

1376
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:54,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying, oh my God, if only these things, these buildings of Versailles were still there.

1377
01:57:54,323 --> 01:58:00,529
[SPEAKER_15]: But that would take millions of dollars to renovate all that, to bring it back to what it used to be.

1378
01:58:00,889 --> 01:58:02,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly limited to exterior restrooms.

1379
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:03,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1380
01:58:04,412 --> 01:58:08,033
[SPEAKER_06]: The interior is what it is, but if it's what it is, absolutely.

1381
01:58:08,113 --> 01:58:19,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you guys have been gracious enough to listen to us tonight, and it's certainly given us an opportunity to vent, for lack of a better word, because that's what we're doing tonight, and we appreciate you not taking it personally.

1382
01:58:19,957 --> 01:58:21,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope you don't.

1383
01:58:21,217 --> 01:58:22,798
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just us talking to you.

1384
01:58:23,558 --> 01:58:26,720
[SPEAKER_15]: for how we feel in terms of the contribution we make.

1385
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:33,423
[SPEAKER_15]: And without the commercial sector in Medford, there wouldn't be a social club, there wouldn't be a hockey team that could survive.

1386
01:58:33,823 --> 01:58:39,786
[SPEAKER_15]: We are the greatest contributors, not only because of taxation, but in terms of we get hit up every single day.

1387
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:42,627
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a pile like this and thousands of dollars a year.

1388
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:43,748
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1389
01:58:43,988 --> 01:58:48,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's frustrating when our membership says, what did they do for us?

1390
01:58:48,230 --> 01:58:50,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, something, they do something.

1391
01:58:50,371 --> 01:58:51,011
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they don't.

1392
01:58:51,711 --> 01:58:52,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And we take the heat.

1393
01:58:54,053 --> 01:58:56,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope it's radiating a little bit for me tonight.

1394
01:58:56,835 --> 01:58:58,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a lot, just a little bit.

1395
01:58:58,116 --> 01:58:58,957
[SPEAKER_15]: It's warm over here.

1396
01:58:58,997 --> 01:59:01,218
[SPEAKER_24]: Final question though, when is the next round?

1397
01:59:11,046 --> 01:59:18,408
[SPEAKER_19]: This year we have two funding rounds and the deadline has already passed for the preliminary applications for this year.

1398
01:59:18,888 --> 01:59:27,631
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe that we'll be making our recommendations for the second round in October and then we'll be starting all over again.

1399
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:33,353
[SPEAKER_19]: So that sometime over the winter we'll be accepting applications

1400
01:59:34,035 --> 01:59:39,057
[SPEAKER_19]: for the following round, which will be decided in October next year.

1401
01:59:39,697 --> 01:59:49,481
[SPEAKER_19]: So after our second round is completed this year, we'll be probably taking a little bit of time for ourselves to reflect on how this went this year and whether the

1402
01:59:51,603 --> 02:00:00,768
[SPEAKER_19]: The goals and priorities and criteria that we set out are still appropriate and if we want to make any changes to that before we invite the next round of applications.

1403
02:00:00,808 --> 02:00:06,651
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we start the process a little bit more slowly and less chaotically next year than we have this year.

1404
02:00:13,006 --> 02:00:15,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all kind of trying to figure this whole thing out.

1405
02:00:16,248 --> 02:00:18,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's learning pains for us, too.

1406
02:00:18,069 --> 02:00:21,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're doing the best that we can trying to get this thing up and running.

1407
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:24,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So we appreciate you guys' patience.

1408
02:00:24,452 --> 02:00:26,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll work with you.

1409
02:00:26,093 --> 02:00:27,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Just bear with us as well.

1410
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:29,235
[SPEAKER_22]: And then just one clarification.

1411
02:00:29,255 --> 02:00:38,039
[SPEAKER_22]: We do have a small pot of money set aside for smaller proposals that can come out of grant round.

1412
02:00:38,339 --> 02:00:39,220
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't have to be.

1413
02:00:40,344 --> 02:00:43,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, you're correct to make that.

1414
02:00:44,490 --> 02:00:50,579
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't have in front of me the deadline for the second round.

1415
02:00:50,599 --> 02:00:52,722
[SPEAKER_19]: The second round for?

1416
02:00:52,742 --> 02:00:55,646
[SPEAKER_19]: The small projects, I have it in front of me.

1417
02:00:57,508 --> 02:00:59,009
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when the application is due, July 13th.

1418
02:00:59,029 --> 02:01:01,751
[SPEAKER_11]: The due date for the final application is July 13th.

1419
02:01:01,911 --> 02:01:14,099
[SPEAKER_19]: July 13th is the due date for the final applications, but small projects that are asking for less than $5,000 of CPA funds can submit a full application at that time.

1420
02:01:14,139 --> 02:01:17,181
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't have to have gone through the pre-application phase.

1421
02:01:18,001 --> 02:01:28,849
[SPEAKER_19]: So the pre-application phase deadline already passed for the second round, but if it's only a small project, you can go through the small project application process.

1422
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:31,892
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's the limit on that?

1423
02:01:31,912 --> 02:01:39,637
[SPEAKER_19]: $5,000 limit for small projects, for CPA funding, for a total of $10,000 projects.

1424
02:01:39,677 --> 02:01:44,141
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have funding from other sources adding up to

1425
02:01:44,845 --> 02:01:46,907
[SPEAKER_19]: $10,000 altogether, including CPA funds.

1426
02:01:46,927 --> 02:01:48,989
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for that.

1427
02:01:49,149 --> 02:01:50,870
[SPEAKER_15]: One last thing, Roberta.

1428
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:54,053
[SPEAKER_15]: You mentioned integrating the Mystic River.

1429
02:01:54,333 --> 02:01:54,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1430
02:01:54,874 --> 02:01:57,356
[SPEAKER_15]: A huge asset to the city of Medford and everything else.

1431
02:01:58,256 --> 02:02:03,581
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just happened to know this incredible, beautiful patio in Medford.

1432
02:02:03,701 --> 02:02:04,982
[SPEAKER_15]: It's right on the Mystic River.

1433
02:02:06,724 --> 02:02:07,624
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was wondering if,

1434
02:02:08,704 --> 02:02:20,009
[SPEAKER_15]: In the event you guys want to have a meeting, a historical meeting, to show how the Mississippi River can be integrated on the river.

1435
02:02:22,095 --> 02:02:23,856
[SPEAKER_15]: It's known as One Shipyard Way.

1436
02:02:24,696 --> 02:02:25,477
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my building.

1437
02:02:25,517 --> 02:02:26,978
[SPEAKER_15]: You can use it any way you want.

1438
02:02:27,538 --> 02:02:28,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1439
02:02:28,398 --> 02:02:31,140
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do have a cappuccino machine there, so I'm just saying.

1440
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:32,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

1441
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Espresso, cappuccino.

1442
02:02:34,782 --> 02:02:38,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And a certain friend of mine provides me all those pods.

1443
02:02:38,363 --> 02:02:39,924
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, no, seriously, I'm serious.

1444
02:02:39,944 --> 02:02:44,847
[SPEAKER_15]: If you ever want to use that gorgeous patio with umbrellas and tables and everything else, be my guest.

1445
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:47,830
[SPEAKER_15]: And at least it shows that, hey, look at where we are.

1446
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:53,376
[SPEAKER_15]: We're literally on the Mystic River, this incredibly historical shipbuilding thing that's part of Medford.

1447
02:02:54,096 --> 02:02:58,281
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've got enough little ships of you to put on tables to show just exactly what used to happen in Medford.

1448
02:02:59,002 --> 02:03:04,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, thank you so much on behalf of my co-chair, Steve Pompeo, and Charlotte, and my president, and so on.

1449
02:03:05,223 --> 02:03:05,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

1450
02:03:05,923 --> 02:03:09,564
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate the fact that you listened to us, even too much at length, I probably.

1451
02:03:09,584 --> 02:03:11,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for coming this evening.

1452
02:03:11,205 --> 02:03:15,486
[SPEAKER_19]: And I apologize that it took you three tries to finally talk to us.

1453
02:03:15,506 --> 02:03:16,327
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

1454
02:03:16,407 --> 02:03:17,507
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my drama.

1455
02:03:19,248 --> 02:03:19,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Kelly.

1456
02:03:29,936 --> 02:03:30,396
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1457
02:03:30,836 --> 02:03:31,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1458
02:03:33,739 --> 02:03:34,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1459
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:39,063
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, I'll be coming back next week.

1460
02:03:39,183 --> 02:03:42,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be here.

1461
02:03:42,986 --> 02:03:47,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I put in an application?

1462
02:03:47,309 --> 02:03:50,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was for $80,000 for an HVAC system.

1463
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:50,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1464
02:03:51,552 --> 02:03:52,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I continue.

1465
02:03:52,393 --> 02:03:53,774
[SPEAKER_08]: You can sit right up at that seat, John.

1466
02:03:54,494 --> 02:03:54,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Very quick.

1467
02:03:55,638 --> 02:04:02,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to put the application together rather quickly, and further research has indicated that I could probably do this project for substantially less.

1468
02:04:12,377 --> 02:04:13,578
[SPEAKER_08]: How should I handle that?

1469
02:04:13,598 --> 02:04:15,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I cover that in my presentation next week?

1470
02:04:16,779 --> 02:04:19,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I redo parts of the application?

1471
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,261
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the best way to do this?

1472
02:04:20,381 --> 02:04:27,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I think if you can give it to us in writing so that we can keep it in our heads, but you can cover that in your application next week, that would be sufficient.

1473
02:04:27,444 --> 02:04:38,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we can recommend a funding amount for less than what you asked for in the first place, either because we choose to do that or because you have requested a smaller amount than what we asked for in the first place.

1474
02:04:38,870 --> 02:04:41,231
[SPEAKER_19]: But it would just be helpful for us to keep it straight by

1475
02:04:41,811 --> 02:04:42,992
[SPEAKER_19]: giving us that in writing.

1476
02:04:43,952 --> 02:04:50,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what happens in general with projects that have a change of scope after the grant has been approved?

1477
02:04:50,996 --> 02:04:58,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Either because of, you know, unexpected things happen, things cost less, things cost more, up or down, what happens?

1478
02:05:01,424 --> 02:05:21,897
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't increase the funding amount after the fact, but as long as the project remains consistent with the objectives, as long as all of the tasks that are being carried out are consistent with the requirements of CPA, I think that that is still allowable.

1479
02:05:22,677 --> 02:05:23,678
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean to spend less?

1480
02:05:24,161 --> 02:05:32,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it's allowable to spend less or to change exactly the components that you're doing so long as those components remain.

1481
02:05:32,611 --> 02:05:37,356
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll have Danielle to keep you on track to ensure that what you're doing is... Okay.

1482
02:05:37,556 --> 02:05:41,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to echo what you said because I've been wondering this about... Everyone has cost estimates.

1483
02:05:41,721 --> 02:05:43,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you don't really know until the...

1484
02:05:44,976 --> 02:05:48,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Affordable housing folks actually get the drawings from the architect.

1485
02:05:48,379 --> 02:05:50,080
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't actually know the actual cost.

1486
02:05:50,681 --> 02:05:55,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you were saying before, there's no ability to increase, but there is ability if you don't spend it to.

1487
02:05:55,525 --> 02:05:57,987
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no ability after the fact to say, oh, we're $10,000 short.

1488
02:05:58,007 --> 02:05:58,307
[SPEAKER_06]: We can wait.

1489
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:04,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get that or can we fold that into the next round, like phase it or something?

1490
02:06:04,732 --> 02:06:05,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the only option?

1491
02:06:05,392 --> 02:06:10,294
[SPEAKER_19]: You could come back and ask for more money later, but that would go through the same process.

1492
02:06:10,334 --> 02:06:11,574
[SPEAKER_06]: The same process, yeah.

1493
02:06:11,774 --> 02:06:13,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a limit and it's fixed?

1494
02:06:13,435 --> 02:06:13,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1495
02:06:13,835 --> 02:06:14,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good to know.

1496
02:06:14,996 --> 02:06:20,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So now if less money is actually spent completing the project than is awarded,

1497
02:06:20,818 --> 02:06:25,223
[SPEAKER_08]: That money remains in the CPA funds for future projects?

1498
02:06:25,383 --> 02:06:27,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it goes back into the open pool.

1499
02:06:27,225 --> 02:06:30,508
[SPEAKER_19]: We release it back into the pool of funding available.

1500
02:06:30,648 --> 02:06:31,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1501
02:06:31,069 --> 02:06:31,769
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not encumbered.

1502
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:32,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1503
02:06:33,351 --> 02:06:34,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a timeline?

1504
02:06:34,772 --> 02:06:41,679
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, some of these projects, the housing ones in particular, might take several years to complete.

1505
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So the money just

1506
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:49,326
[SPEAKER_19]: It stays until we tell it to go back into the, until you either spend it or we release it.

1507
02:06:49,426 --> 02:06:50,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1508
02:06:50,367 --> 02:06:50,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1509
02:06:52,349 --> 02:06:52,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1510
02:06:52,689 --> 02:06:53,110
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

1511
02:06:54,672 --> 02:06:55,613
