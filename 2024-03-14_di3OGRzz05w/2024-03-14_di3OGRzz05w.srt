12
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:44,776

[SPEAKER_08]: So present Mayor Lando.

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:13,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember joining us right now.

25
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

26
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:16,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Connecting.

27
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:17,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, man.

28
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:25,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember I thought we were taking the roll call and then just need one more person.

29
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:25,867
[SPEAKER_08]: That's you to stay here.

30
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:28,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

31
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:36,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, yes.

32
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, after you say that there are seven present.

33
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:41,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven present, zero absent.

34
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau?

35
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:52,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I just wanted to remind us that rule 19 of our member school committee rules said that we will take no votes in committees of the whole.

36
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,940
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a bad past practice of just rolling with it

37
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:05,066
[SPEAKER_08]: making all kinds of motions, and we literally have a rule we adopted saying we will take no votes in this meeting.

38
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:06,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's important.

39
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:12,751
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want to make motions, et cetera, we can bring them to the regular meeting where votes actually matter.

40
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:16,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So just a friendly reminder of our rule.

41
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:17,534
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all, thank you.

42
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, members.

43
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:23,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mayor Edward, sorry, Mayor Edward Vincent, oh my goodness.

44
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edward Vincent, would you like to lead us off?

45
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:30,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're on mute.

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,141
[SPEAKER_01]: The same situation happened to me.

48
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

49
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to extend a very warm welcome to Mr. John and Tafa.

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining the team today.

51
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:48,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look forward to continuing our work together collaboratively.

52
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome aboard.

53
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:55,432
[SPEAKER_01]: This evening, this is our first Budget Committee of the Whole.

54
00:02:55,452 --> 00:03:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just point out that this evening's presentation will be taking place by Mr. Jerry McHugh, who is our Finance Director at Medford Public Schools.

55
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:08,403
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been working

56
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:34,457
[SPEAKER_01]: um incredibly hard in collaboration with the mayor and city hall and I thank our um vice chair Graham and member Ruseau who have been um working and just providing consult and so um I would like to pass the baton on to Mr. McHugh so he can begin his um budget update for the committee and um Mr. McHugh is going to um

57
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:35,938
[SPEAKER_01]: present.

58
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:50,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I should ask, Mr. McHugh, do you want to do all of your presentation first and then take questions at the end or pause in between the different pieces of presentations?

59
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

60
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:56,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind taking questions as we go along.

61
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I think tonight's meeting was going to be focused on

62
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:06,736
[SPEAKER_07]: revenue that's, you know, available for our budget.

63
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So it probably makes sense, you know, we'll be talking about Chapter 70, revolving funds, private grants, you know, the idea of charging programs for overhead.

64
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:27,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So it might make sense to take the questions as they go along.

65
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:32,988
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, whatever the preference of the committee is, is what I'll do.

66
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:36,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

67
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you would like me to share, Member Graham?

68
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:42,628
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

69
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:45,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we let you get started, Jerry?

70
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:56,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there are stopping points, why don't you just let us know where those good stopping points are in your presentation, and we can stop and ask questions.

71
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:03,515
[SPEAKER_07]: With your permission, I thought I could give maybe a five-minute update on the FY24 shortfall.

72
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:11,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, just because we had some, um, made some progress in that area.

73
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:13,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that be okay?

74
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:17,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

75
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:21,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

76
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I, um, a couple of meetings ago, I, I came up to the committee.

77
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:34,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally, you know, we're able to run some year end projections and

78
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: were concerned about a $2.5 million shortfall that was showing up at that time.

79
00:05:47,145 --> 00:06:03,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt it prudent to advise a committee at that time of that potential shortfall, but then we went to work to see what other kind of resources we could bring to bear.

80
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:13,918
[SPEAKER_07]: working with the city's finance director, Bob Dickerson, and of course the mayor.

81
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:21,582
[SPEAKER_07]: We were able to identify a grant for homeless transportation.

82
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:27,205
[SPEAKER_07]: We determined a potential balance from ESSA funds that we could use.

83
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:33,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some circuit breaker funds for special ed tuition that we could use.

84
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:40,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We created a charge back for food service to recover utility expenses.

85
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:52,892
[SPEAKER_07]: And we came up with about $1.7 million of potential resources that we could bring to bear.

86
00:06:54,753 --> 00:07:02,656
[SPEAKER_07]: The finance director was generous with his time and reviewed

87
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,702
[SPEAKER_07]: the spreadsheet and actually identified a problem with one of the formulas in the projection.

88
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:21,626
[SPEAKER_07]: So the formula was like picking up most of the accounts that were showing a deficit, but was leaving out some accounts that were showing surplus.

89
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:30,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we made that fix, the deficit that we're looking at is about half a million dollars now.

90
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:32,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And

91
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:52,283
[SPEAKER_07]: The fiscal year 23 budget is still open and we've requested that the city apply a Teamsters, the third payment of a Teamsters union president that goes back to FY22.

92
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:05,824
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's worth $255,000, and that hit in FY24, but it's really properly charged to FY23.

93
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:17,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they make that adjustment, we get the projected deficit down to 250, and that is quite manageable with the resources that we've been able to identify.

94
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if anyone has any questions.

95
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:32,083
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's some new members on the board since that time, so be happy to respond to any questions.

96
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, did you want to take over?

97
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want me to?

98
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I can.

99
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:47,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if this question's without any sort of presentation on that 500 number, Darisa.

100
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything in your presentation on that?

101
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I do not.

102
00:08:52,026 --> 00:09:03,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, you know, this just kind of all came together this afternoon, but, um, I mean, I have a, my spreadsheet that I use for projections is quite, um, lengthy.

103
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:16,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I, yeah, I think, I think the bottom line is that, um, we'll be able to manage through, we're going to finish the year with a balanced budget.

104
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:17,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

105
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:33,413
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's anything in particular that you would want, I mean, we're gonna be running this projection once or twice a month anyway, because things change.

106
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:48,159
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the teacher's contract, the administrator's contract, and the nurse's contract all have a 1% increase that's gonna hit at the end of the month.

107
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:51,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be, after those go through, that would be a good time.

108
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,656
[SPEAKER_07]: to, you know, take another projection.

109
00:09:55,576 --> 00:10:08,764
[SPEAKER_07]: We've anticipated, you know, we have some estimated numbers for the cost of that, but, you know, it'd be best to get the actual costs, you know, baked into the projections.

110
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:10,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

111
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jerry.

112
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:18,050
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for your help, Mayor, in kind of working through this problem.

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for your hard work as well.

114
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Bradley, then Member Bradley, then Member Graham.

115
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure I'm hearing this correctly.

116
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:31,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So the $2.5 million that we once heard is now down to approximately $250,000?

117
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

118
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:34,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we do a dance?

119
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I haven't slept in years.

120
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:39,269
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

121
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:40,189
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

122
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:40,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

123
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

124
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,350
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great news.

125
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't we all screaming and dancing?

126
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sweating.

127
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:46,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

128
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:50,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Still half a million, but yeah, we made great progress.

129
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:50,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

130
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:55,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was some encumbrances.

131
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: We were over encumbered in one account, and that was a savings of $265,000.

132
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:16,196
[SPEAKER_07]: We adjusted some of our bi-weekly payroll amounts that we are using in the projections to be closer to current.

133
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:30,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the biggest difference was this error in the formula that was adding up the accounts that were in deficit.

134
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it just- I've never been so happy about a mistake.

135
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:53,338
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of worked out, you know, I'm a little bit, I don't want to say embarrassed is too strong, but you know, I wish the problem, you know, didn't happen in the first place, but it could have went the other way too.

136
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm grateful.

137
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
[SPEAKER_07]: It just worked out.

138
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's just, we have a,

139
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:31,646
[SPEAKER_07]: know we we any kind of little problem in this budget um is kind of magnified so uh but i'm totally i'm gonna sleep well tonight and uh we'll finish the year with a balanced budget okay thank you i know we i think we scheduled this from five to six so we're going to go to member graham the member reinfeld i see your hand up i'm going to go to your presentation okay um thank you jerry i wondered i don't i know that you generally um

140
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:47,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't attend our school committee meetings on Mondays, but I was hoping maybe you could just write a report and submit that as an agenda item so that somebody can like read that for the record in our main meeting and I'm going to hold my any you know any.

141
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,531
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of additional questions and comments until then because this isn't on the agenda for today.

142
00:12:52,551 --> 00:13:12,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I know that you generally aren't able to join those meetings, I did wanna say thank you for being proactive about telling us because we could easily find ourselves in the situation that Brockton is finding themselves in right now with massive surprises of deficits with everybody asleep at the wheel.

143
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:15,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think you should feel embarrassed

144
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:25,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being diligent and for informing the committee, because I think that that is what we all want and need.

145
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:26,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

146
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And then member Ruseau, I think Noah Urasko has joined us.

147
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can add him to the roll call.

148
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:33,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

149
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:35,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

150
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:36,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

151
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:36,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld?

152
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:41,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to thank Jerry again for being proactive and say, don't be embarrassed.

153
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd rather get the information sooner.

154
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:42,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

155
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,595
[SPEAKER_04]: We all make mistakes all the time.

156
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:47,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

157
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:48,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

158
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:49,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Great news.

159
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:51,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll turn it over to you, Jerry.

160
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

161
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:52,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

162
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:53,338
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

163
00:13:53,438 --> 00:14:07,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, one of the key sources of revenue or, you know, resources that we have for

164
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:19,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they, let me see, can you, are you, let's see, can you see my screen?

165
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet, yes.

166
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all right.

167
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:36,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So, historically, you know, the Chapter 70 isn't a big source of revenue for Medford,

168
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:43,576
[SPEAKER_07]: like it might be in other communities that have a high, low income population.

169
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:53,161
[SPEAKER_07]: But nevertheless, it does outline, you know, kind of the minimum spending that a school district should be spending.

170
00:14:54,061 --> 00:15:02,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And it identifies that and, you know, allocates a share that the city's expected to contribute.

171
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the state contributes,

172
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,198
[SPEAKER_07]: another amount.

173
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it might be useful just to look at kind of the last few years of Chapter 70.

174
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:31,550
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go back to FY23, our foundation enrollment, which includes not only MedFed public school students, but MedFed students attending charter schools as well.

175
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:34,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So charter schools is part of the Chapter 70 formula.

176
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:36,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city gets a bill

177
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,553
[SPEAKER_07]: every year for charter school tuition for those students.

178
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:48,497
[SPEAKER_07]: The state calculated a foundation budget of $64.9 million in 23.

179
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: They determined the city should contribute 51 million, and then 13.9 would come from Chapter 70.

180
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And this net school spending is something that

181
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: we have to report at the end of the year to show that we met our net school spending target.

182
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:30,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Now in MedFed, you're fortunate that the city picks up the health insurance for active employees and retirees that are attributable to MedFed public schools, and they pay for the charter school tuition.

183
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:48,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year we are gonna hit this med school spending target because the city routinely contributes more than they're required to.

184
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:55,888
[SPEAKER_07]: In 24, it was pretty good year for MedFed because the foundation enrollment went up by over a hundred students.

185
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that could include charter school as well.

186
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Our foundation budget went up 6.9 million.

187
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:13,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that was basically that 6.9 million increase was split between the city and Chapter 70.

188
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:19,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a three and a half million dollar increase in Chapter 70 that year.

189
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we forward to FY 25.

190
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is based on the

191
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, governor's budget that is working its way through the house.

192
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:33,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And this can change a little bit.

193
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:40,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't change too drastically, but it could change a little bit after, uh, it goes through the legislature, but.

194
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Between FY 24 and FY 25, our enrollment actually went down and our foundation budget went up by 1.7.

195
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,501
[SPEAKER_07]: The city's required contribution went up by almost 2.8 million.

196
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:18,465
[SPEAKER_07]: But because our enrollment went down, because the Chapter 70 money has a hold harmless provision, so instead of going down, which it should have, down to about 16 million, it stayed the same.

197
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:22,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we qualify for what's called minimum aid

198
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a per student amount.

199
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:28,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's $35 per student.

200
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our Chapter 70 increased by $135,000.

201
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:39,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And the net school spending increased by the total of the district contribution in the $135,000.

202
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:40,229
[SPEAKER_07]: So that went up 2.9.

203
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:40,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I also did an analysis of

204
00:18:50,769 --> 00:19:00,992
[SPEAKER_07]: our school budget versus our net school spending, just to kind of get a sense of what typically happens in MedFed.

205
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:07,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So our school budget, you know, has always increased during the year.

206
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a big increase in FY22, you know, a smaller increase in FY21.

207
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And our net school spending in relation to

208
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:33,881
[SPEAKER_07]: the school budget typically is going up, but in a couple of years, our budget was actually less than the net school spending budget.

209
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But just kind of data points on Chapter 70.

210
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:47,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I could spend a little bit of time on how Chapter 70 works for some of the new members, but I don't want to take up too much time.

211
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So happy to answer, this might be a good time just to answer any questions on chapter 70.

212
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, member Graham.

213
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:02,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

214
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:13,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I will reconnect about scheduling some time with Tracy Novick to do a real deep dive on chapter 70 for all of us.

215
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we have a new member on board, we'll get his availability and

216
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:20,178
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out a time to do that.

217
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:42,900
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jerry, a couple of things that I've been watching in the news is that two points of concern about chapter 70 is one, the rate of inflation that was assigned in the governor's budget, which was like one and a half percent, I wanna say, and people feeling like that's considerably lower than what actual inflation represents.

218
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:50,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing that people are talking about is a pretty substantial reduction in students being considered low income.

219
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:56,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually like a list of communities where the drop was significant.

220
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:05,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't see us on that list, but I was just curious if you have any insights about how our low income enrollment numbers are changing.

221
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know they're sort of attributing it to the,

222
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:11,176
[SPEAKER_03]: mass health redetermination, among other things.

223
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:27,472
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just curious what our low income numbers look like, and if we feel like those sound representative of our population, or if we are, if there is a gap there, much like our SNAP gap.

224
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:31,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let me.

225
00:21:46,348 --> 00:22:04,281
[SPEAKER_07]: just gonna call up another spreadsheet, but what, yeah, the, you know, years ago, all districts used a paper process to identify loan, you know, it was tied to the lunch fund.

226
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:15,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we have gone to, you know, community eligibility,

227
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody qualifies for free lunch.

228
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:26,854
[SPEAKER_07]: That led the state to try to come up with a different methodology.

229
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:39,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's based on identifying people that are on various benefit programs within the state.

230
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:44,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just doesn't pick up everybody for some reason, particularly

231
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:58,580
[SPEAKER_07]: recently arrived immigrants, even if you're a legal immigrant here, you're barred from receiving benefits for five years.

232
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:06,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been trying to work around that, but I will try to do some more research on that.

233
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:14,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But essentially, this is how, can everybody see this screen, FY 25, Chapter 70 Foundation Budget?

234
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't see your screen right now.

235
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:17,964
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot?

236
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:18,904
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

237
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:19,845
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

238
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:25,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it comes.

239
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:26,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

240
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:26,667
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

241
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:40,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So this part of the foundation budget is kind of what's the base budget based on all of our students.

242
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:43,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And then every community gets

243
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:51,747
[SPEAKER_07]: of incremental increase over and above the base for the foundation.

244
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:57,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's not an increase in chapter 78, it's an increase in your budget.

245
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: So because you have special needs students, English language learners, low income students, it's assumed that you need to spend more money because these students are more needy.

246
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,395
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you look over here on column 19,

247
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:19,904
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the count of low-income students that we have in Medford Public Schools.

248
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we have 4,200 students, that's about 40%, 45%.

249
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:30,854
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another, so we're in a group eight category.

250
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:44,811
[SPEAKER_07]: You see this little blue box over here, 43% of our students are low income.

251
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That qualifies us for group eight.

252
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:57,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And that dictates how much of a bump up we're gonna get for low income.

253
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:05,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So the very neediest communities get a much bigger increase for their low income students.

254
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:08,739
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is where we are.

255
00:25:10,047 --> 00:25:37,730
[SPEAKER_07]: uh group eight so our foundation budget increases by 12 and a half million dollars due to our low-income students and you know this is where we we should be spending money on interventionists and tutoring and we qualify for title one in some of our schools because of this so

256
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:45,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

257
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

258
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:55,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I can go back and figure out, I can do some trending on that too to see what the trend is.

259
00:25:57,384 --> 00:25:57,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

260
00:25:58,864 --> 00:25:59,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

261
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:13,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair, when you were showing the budget for the last few years, everybody who was here certainly remembers the level funded year of FY21.

262
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:29,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realized that we did have a supplemental, the state hadn't even finished their budget, so we level funded, and I believe there was a supplemental, and your numbers reflected an increase, which we never approved a supplemental as a school committee.

263
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:38,198
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just, because I am often looking at the data from DESE, and I cannot find the number that you showed anywhere online.

264
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:39,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe you have access to

265
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:54,390
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the login and all that, to versions of portals that the public doesn't, is that where you get the number that you are showing, not on this one, but the last five years of budget?

266
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,211
[SPEAKER_07]: This one.

267
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

268
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:07,112
[SPEAKER_08]: That FY21 number, we actually approved in our budget 61-250.

269
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:08,353
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we approved.

270
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

271
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,245
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't doubt that your number is right because I heard that there was a supplemental.

272
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,367
[SPEAKER_08]: That's as much as I ever heard about it.

273
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:31,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd have to go back and I might've just gotten them off of budgets that I found in the office here.

274
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:37,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I did look at my own copies of budgets and never saw that number.

275
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you, one second, I want to write it down.

276
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:56,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're ridiculously busy, but I really would like to know where that number came from, because these are really, really important.

277
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:57,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, 521.

278
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:06,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, this trending stuff is a constant conversation that I certainly have with others, and having the same numbers matters.

279
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:07,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

280
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

281
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:09,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

282
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:16,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You can continue Jerry, thank you.

283
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:26,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the next thing that's looking at, maybe we'll look at revolving funds.

284
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:29,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's see.

285
00:28:43,806 --> 00:29:02,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city, I mean, the school department has a number of evolving funds that they use, which provide some resources to the school department budget to run programs.

286
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:08,825
[SPEAKER_07]: This MEET program is a tuition-based program and it,

287
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,276
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'd have to go back in the years.

288
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:20,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to spend my time over the next three weeks kind of looking forward.

289
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:27,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we have some time, we can go back to see why some of these balances were accumulated.

290
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:39,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But certainly, this is an area where we could charge staff that are assigned to the MEVE program and not use those

291
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:46,539
[SPEAKER_07]: not have, you know, save those salaries from being charged to the general fund budget.

292
00:29:49,942 --> 00:30:05,594
[SPEAKER_07]: The vocational school has a number of revolving funds that they use because they provide services to students, I mean, to parents and other

293
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:12,963
[SPEAKER_07]: individuals in MedFed, and this gives them a chance to have kind of a real world experience in their education.

294
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:35,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a cosmetology program, marketing, there's culinary, the bistro, here at the high school, there's a copy program, automotive program, and a graphics group, and then there's this category tuition.

295
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:51,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in, uh, in years past, uh, MedFed, uh, was a program that was accessed by a lot of students outside of MedFed and they would pay tuition to MedFed.

296
00:30:51,884 --> 00:31:02,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It would go into this account, um, because there's, um, in the program is popular with our own students.

297
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's, there's little room to accept, um,

298
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,778
[SPEAKER_07]: students from outside.

299
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:22,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a few students that are tuitioned in that are still going through the program, but this program as a source of revenue will eventually just dry up.

300
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But this provides an opportunity for us to charge some teacher salaries if we want.

301
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,412
[SPEAKER_07]: This account typically contributed about $150,000

302
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:42,507
[SPEAKER_07]: to supply needs for the vocational school in addition to what was provided in the general fund.

303
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:56,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And because this account is not producing more revenue, I think we're gonna try to bring more of that supply expense into the general fund.

304
00:31:56,952 --> 00:32:02,334
[SPEAKER_07]: So we eventually don't kind of have a fiscal cliff with the supply budget of the

305
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: vocational program.

306
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have a separate account for the rental charges for the Edgley field.

307
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:27,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So any personnel that's assigned to that field when it's in use gets charged to this account.

308
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the lighting expenses and maintenance of the field, that all gets charged to this account.

309
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:54,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm told that there was an intentional strategy to build up the fund in this account so it would be available when the field had to be replaced.

310
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:59,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a good balance.

311
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,474
[SPEAKER_07]: If that field was replaced, it certainly wouldn't

312
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,443
[SPEAKER_07]: cover the cost of the entire field, but it might cover costs of design and project management.

313
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:19,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have the school lunch fund, which provides lunches to our students.

314
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:25,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And that fund is self-sustaining.

315
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the money comes in federal reimbursement.

316
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,974
[SPEAKER_07]: A small amount comes from state reimbursement.

317
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: that balance is in good shape.

318
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:45,982
[SPEAKER_07]: School athletics as well, we charge fees to our students to participate in sports.

319
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:50,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It certainly does not cover the entire cost of sports.

320
00:33:50,546 --> 00:34:03,256
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a budget in the general fund that covers most of the expenses, but this provides some opportunity to charge some of the expenses that we have in athletics to this fund.

321
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:18,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Community schools is another area where we are renting our facilities like the Japanese language school, churches that use the facilities.

322
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:33,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's a little concerning that we're running a deficit right now in this account, but I want to say that with these accounts, the revenues tend to lag.

323
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:38,305
[SPEAKER_07]: The expenses, the expenses more or less happen in real time.

324
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:52,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And the revenues eventually, you know, have to get up to city treasury and get deposited into the correct account.

325
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:53,932
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have to keep an eye on that.

326
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:01,976
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a driver's ed program where we charge students to have their

327
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:07,609
[SPEAKER_07]: driver's ed program to get their license.

328
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It pays for a couple of staff members.

329
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's most of the charges to this account.

330
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:19,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a good balance in that account as well.

331
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We also charge students and staff if they lose or damage their Chromebooks.

332
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Those all go into a fund.

333
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:42,356
[SPEAKER_07]: and are available to refurbish computers or to buy replacements.

334
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:57,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer School is another account where there's a fees charge for, I guess, credit recovery programs.

335
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:03,068
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another account that's in deficit, so it could be that

336
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:16,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, it could be that we haven't fully deposited the proceeds there, but we are showing a deficit in that program.

337
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:34,886
[SPEAKER_07]: This vocational early ed program is a small early childhood program that's run out of the book for students that are pursuing teaching or

338
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:42,273
[SPEAKER_07]: similar types of career paths within teaching.

339
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:50,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's charges made and a little bit of expense made, but there's balance in that account as well.

340
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Preschool, this.

341
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it might be MFN, Jerry.

342
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: MFN?

343
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:05,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford Family Network.

344
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:07,124
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

345
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:12,826
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a few accounts here from Mentored Family Network.

346
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:28,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Mentored Family Network is kind of a completely separate program from Mentored Public Schools, but we operate more or less as a fiscal agent for them.

347
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:38,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we accept their grants, we provide some accounting and payroll.

348
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:45,385
[SPEAKER_07]: HR, all those support services are provided by Medford Public Schools.

349
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:53,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the pool has its own rental fees and membership charges.

350
00:37:55,448 --> 00:38:05,671
[SPEAKER_07]: The pool, we need to really take a look at how that's staffed and the hours that are open.

351
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:12,116
[SPEAKER_07]: really kind of back of the envelope assessment when I first got here.

352
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:24,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think we're only, we lose about $20 an hour every time we're open.

353
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open a lot of hours, early in the morning, late at night.

354
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:32,789
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have some good revenue from different schools.

355
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:41,486
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of schools don't have pools, so some schools are coming to MedFed to use our facility for their swim program.

356
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:55,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But that really needs a kind of a management review to make sure that that can run in the black every year.

357
00:38:57,959 --> 00:39:02,823
[SPEAKER_07]: This short tuition account is another account similar to vocational tuition where

358
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:18,252
[SPEAKER_07]: In years past, we used to tuition in students to the Curtis Tufts program, and we haven't done that in recent years.

359
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:29,536
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did accumulate a balance, and we use that balance on and off to support the special ed program here at Medford.

360
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Kids Corner is another program that should be self-sustaining.

361
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:43,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the daycare program that's available to staff.

362
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,169
[SPEAKER_07]: It's located here in the high school.

363
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:51,033
[SPEAKER_07]: The evening school is no longer in use.

364
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:58,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this small deficit is from a prior year, and I think it's probably just missed

365
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:01,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a mis-posting to this account.

366
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:05,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to do a journal entry to clean that up.

367
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:08,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But we no longer run an evening program.

368
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:17,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the before and after school program is a good moneymaker for the school department.

369
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just has accumulated a large balance over the years.

370
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:39,293
[SPEAKER_07]: running in the red this year, but that's, again, I think the revenues are lagging and the expenses are more in real time.

371
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:43,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will finish up in a positive amount.

372
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:54,519
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are all the revolving funds that we operate in MedFed, and I'd be happy to answer any questions people might have on that.

373
00:40:57,383 --> 00:40:58,206
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great, Jerry.

374
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:58,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

375
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:04,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld, then Member Rousseau, then Member Graham.

376
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:10,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jerry.

377
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:16,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am curious when the lags will catch up.

378
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we'll know whether these numbers are lasting or temporary.

379
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:26,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess my other question is what ability do we have to see what the trends are?

380
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:36,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm seeing a lot of net losses and I'm curious how many of those are perpetuating from year to year and how many are anomalies.

381
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:36,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

382
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:39,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get that.

383
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a couple of accounts that are like the pool.

384
00:41:43,319 --> 00:42:03,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens usually is, and I don't really have a good handle here because I wasn't here last year, but there's, you know, if you had, for instance, a deficit in this vocational carpentry, which

385
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:19,733
[SPEAKER_07]: is really this happened prior to FY 24, but the vocational school has been kind of running all the carpentry revenue expenses recently through the vocational tuition account.

386
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:22,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just kind of reactivated this fund.

387
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: The students build sheds for different organizations

388
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:31,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're able to sell low shed.

389
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:33,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's gonna kind of correct itself.

390
00:42:33,878 --> 00:42:44,964
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we finish the year with that, and we had bandwidth in our general fund to absorb that, we would do a journal entry to get that account corrected.

391
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:52,687
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's probably typically what happened in years past.

392
00:42:52,748 --> 00:42:59,331
[SPEAKER_07]: There were accounting maneuvers at the end to kind of get everything into balance because

393
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:09,972
[SPEAKER_07]: The city's director of finance is going to send me a report and says, I have to get these accounts in balance to close my book.

394
00:43:10,072 --> 00:43:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's an effort made in August and September to get those straightened out.

395
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,482
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we're going to do is we're going to try to take a look at,

396
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:29,431
[SPEAKER_07]: The individual departments keep track of their deposits to the city treasury.

397
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:40,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're gonna go back and look at those figures to make sure that everything we deposited with the treasury is hitting the right account.

398
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:41,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be the first step.

399
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:47,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll go from there.

400
00:43:47,198 --> 00:43:52,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can go back a few years and identify the,

401
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:54,653
[SPEAKER_07]: if there's any problem areas.

402
00:43:55,154 --> 00:44:03,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we don't wanna be in a situation where we're like routinely bailing out these different revolving funds.

403
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:19,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're consistently running a deficit, we have to look at the revenue structure and like with the pool, with the community schools, we are looking at the rates that we're gonna charge

404
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:29,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Athletics is another account, you know, are those rates, you know, kind of keeping up with the increases in our expenses.

405
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we'll be looking at.

406
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:40,867
[SPEAKER_06]: For this cycle or for what's the timing on looking at that?

407
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as soon as we get the budget

408
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,520
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to have a general fund.

409
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:54,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And when that's finished, then we're you know, our attention is going to be turned towards, you know, year end activities and we were going to Uh.

410
00:44:54,823 --> 00:45:02,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to kind of spend make sure we're spending a general fund and make sure these revolving funds are in balance.

411
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:02,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

412
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:17,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jerry.

413
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,146
[SPEAKER_08]: This is excellent work.

414
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:23,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really appreciate having it in front of us so we can really see this.

415
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:29,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the Japanese school pays even more than the revenues listed for community schools.

416
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:39,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So if their annual contribution, their annual payment is more than that number, I think somebody should figure out where that money went.

417
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But you did indicate that.

418
00:45:43,427 --> 00:45:44,488
[SPEAKER_08]: there was work to be done there.

419
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:49,350
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that their annual payment is greatly in excess of the revenue shown.

420
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a little concerned about that.

421
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:59,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, all that money at the time it was collected went into community schools account.

422
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:04,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think what they do is they prepay for a number of years.

423
00:46:04,218 --> 00:46:08,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is something that,

424
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:12,415
[SPEAKER_07]: also has to be watched.

425
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:16,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't want to, you know, they're overpaying in the first year.

426
00:46:17,136 --> 00:46:27,298
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to use that surplus for other things because you're committed to providing them the space, you know, for the next three years.

427
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:27,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

428
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:31,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

429
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:32,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Point well taken.

430
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,040
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you.

431
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know they did it.

432
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really useful information.

433
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:38,501
[SPEAKER_08]: The pool revenue,

434
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to see that other schools that are using our facilities are paying as well.

435
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:54,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the question, and obviously our students shouldn't be paying to use the pool to do the things like, you know, swimming and all that stuff.

436
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:56,538
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess, you know,

437
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:03,639
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, are we just charging entirely ridiculously low rates to the public who wants to come in and use our pool?

438
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:08,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Because frankly, it's like the best kept secret in Medford is that our pool is fabulous.

439
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:10,124
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get in at a ridiculously early hour.

440
00:47:11,344 --> 00:47:14,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not crowded, although I have not done it myself.

441
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:22,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But we need to really have a conversation about what we're charging to the public.

442
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:30,912
[SPEAKER_08]: to folks in the public who are using the pool, and it sounds like you'll get that done.

443
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:39,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you repeat, I'm the chair of the board of SHORE, so can you repeat what you said about the SHORE tuition, because I was confused?

444
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

445
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:50,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So back, even when I was working in Chelsea, I can remember

446
00:47:51,391 --> 00:47:58,993
[SPEAKER_07]: paying tuition to MedFed because we had two or three students in the Curtis Tufts special needs program.

447
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:06,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So those tuition payments went into this revolving fund.

448
00:48:07,395 --> 00:48:12,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And so over time, surplus funds were built up.

449
00:48:14,256 --> 00:48:20,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So because the revenue that we collected was in connection with our special needs program,

450
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:28,840
[SPEAKER_07]: any spending we would do would be connected to our special needs program.

451
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can collect the money and you can kind of spend it on special needs as you see fit.

452
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:42,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last year we might've charged a portion of a teacher, but anyway.

453
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:42,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

454
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:43,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

455
00:48:43,903 --> 00:48:44,263
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

456
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:44,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

457
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

458
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:49,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the kid's corner, I mean,

459
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:56,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have people who work in Medford because we have Kids' Corner, and it's great, right?

460
00:48:57,205 --> 00:49:08,589
[SPEAKER_08]: But clearly we are not charging, which I realize it's charging staff, but we are not charging enough money to cover that, and we need to just bite the bullet.

461
00:49:08,689 --> 00:49:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I don't believe the school committee ever votes on what the costs for Kids' Corner are.

462
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:28,463
[SPEAKER_08]: which should be interesting whether we're supposed to or not, but I certainly for one hope that whatever it costs, no matter how big the increase, it just needs to be zeroed out.

463
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:44,650
[SPEAKER_08]: If the increase is to double what we charge people, then that's the increase because we can't be having other programs pay for a service that is frankly a service that people all over would die to have.

464
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:47,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

465
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:51,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, they did, this top line is the beginning balance.

466
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:54,204
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means it was the ending balance in FY22.

467
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:58,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did finish the year in a surplus.

468
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:03,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm confident that they will finish this year in a surplus.

469
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:08,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that the revenues are lagging again, but.

470
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:10,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

471
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:16,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a concern until we kind of close the books and we verify that

472
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:19,109
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it is in surplus, so.

473
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:20,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's great.

474
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:29,914
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me feel better because, you know, nobody wants to be telling folks, by the way, your daycare is going to now cost a lot more money because that would be terrible.

475
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:33,356
[SPEAKER_08]: But if this is lagging, that makes me much happier.

476
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:34,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all my questions.

477
00:50:34,476 --> 00:50:34,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

478
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:38,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

479
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up is Member Graham.

480
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:44,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

481
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:53,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I think across the board, we have unequivocally been told in the past that it is absolutely the school committee's authority to set rates for all of these things.

482
00:50:54,316 --> 00:51:02,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have never been presented with a rate card despite asking about it at least annually since I have been on the committee.

483
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:04,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And so before we

484
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:21,516
[SPEAKER_03]: go too far into the next fiscal year, I would like to see a rate card for our review and approval for all the tuition-bearing parts of this revolving fund, and that would include recommendations about Kids' Corner, the pool,

485
00:51:23,317 --> 00:51:32,563
[SPEAKER_03]: any sort of preschool programming, NEAP to the extent that community members are paying for it, driver's ed, athletics, like all of those things.

486
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:41,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have approved athletics once or twice and really to waive tuition during our waive user fees during COVID.

487
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:47,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to see a cohesive rate card that also includes our rentals.

488
00:51:48,953 --> 00:52:00,564
[SPEAKER_03]: our rental rates so that we as a committee can take a vote and be supportive of what we need to generate from a revenue perspective into these accounts.

489
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:03,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, Jerry,

490
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:26,043
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously you can't do what you weren't even here to do, but we've asked this question multiple times and we have been assured that it's coming, but I think we really do need a fiscal view of these tuitions to say, what do we recommend that they are for FY25?

491
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've already done that with before and after school.

492
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:30,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel comfortable with that, but,

493
00:52:31,246 --> 00:52:35,367
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not an exception in any way in terms of how they operate to anything else.

494
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:46,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that that can be on the agenda in the coming month or so, because some of these programs, people will need to start to plan accordingly.

495
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:51,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, yep, that makes complete sense.

496
00:52:51,589 --> 00:53:00,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the other thing... Member Grim, I was just gonna ask, do you want small presentations on each

497
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:17,089
[SPEAKER_04]: category so we could vote on them individually as they're as they come ready or do you want a full overview and when it when everything's complete just because maybe that would take longer than if yeah the pool could give us recommendations

498
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, next month along with X, Y, and Z where others take some time.

499
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a preference.

500
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:31,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there's an ease, whatever is easiest for the administration to go through and sort of cover all the bases.

501
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:38,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think whatever we do to set rates for next year, this year is going to be probably really imperfect.

502
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And next year we can be a little bit more comprehensive about it.

503
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:45,629
[SPEAKER_03]: and say like, is what we did last year, did it work, did it not work, et cetera.

504
00:53:47,149 --> 00:53:53,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think we can get on a schedule where we could do rate setting as a single thing.

505
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:57,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it takes a while for us to get there, I think that's okay.

506
00:53:57,472 --> 00:53:59,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have a strong preference.

507
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:05,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really more question of like, how can the administration be ready for that?

508
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two other questions.

509
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:23,000
[SPEAKER_03]: One is, I would like to see a reconciliation of athletic fees to ensure that we are collecting all of our athletic user fees.

510
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to know how many students are registered.

511
00:54:28,464 --> 00:54:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: What that means in terms of the anticipated fees, the number of students who are exempted from fees, whether they have like multiple siblings in sports or they play many sports or we are providing financial assistance, I would just like to see an actual accounting of like

512
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:55,423
[SPEAKER_03]: kids doing sports and money collected, and I would like to see whether that number ties out or whether we have a problem collecting our fees.

513
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:57,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I am concerned that we do.

514
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard from lots of people in the community that

515
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:07,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to actually pay the school to have their kid participate, but their kids get to participate anyway, which is great.

516
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:11,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would absolutely love for us to be a fee-free school.

517
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:16,936
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, if we're going to charge fees, I want to make sure we're doing it with accuracy and fairly.

518
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:22,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've not ever been able to see any reporting that sort of gives me that assurances.

519
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:25,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be another thing I'm interested in.

520
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:45,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think the other thing that strikes me, and it's honestly been sort of on my mind since long before I was on the school committee, is when we talk about like, and these are small examples, but like lost Chromebooks and lost library books, what is the process for replacing those?

521
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:49,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Because anytime I spent a lot of time in the school libraries and what I heard was like,

522
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:55,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well I keep this money in my petty cash because once it goes into the lost book fee, I can never get it.

523
00:55:55,712 --> 00:56:04,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I see when I see a line that says there's $30,000 in lost Chromebooks, that's $30,000 in like Chromebooks not available to students.

524
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And same thing with library books, right?

525
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:17,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a 20 something thousand dollar balance, which in the library, the used library, the lost library book fund, that means there's $28,000 worth of books not available to our students.

526
00:56:18,156 --> 00:56:23,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the point of the fund is to replace the lost books and it just doesn't seem like that happens.

527
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:36,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would also like to delve into like, what are the processes to use those funds and who is responsible for making sure that's happening on a regular basis and in those two particular instances?

528
00:56:38,973 --> 00:56:46,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So my plan, I just about finalized a scope of work to have

529
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:53,012
[SPEAKER_07]: an auditing firm come in and do a management review of our collection practices.

530
00:56:54,772 --> 00:57:13,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of it was like organizing all these accounts where we collect revenue because there's just a number of different ways we collect revenue and some departments are responsible for making deposits to the city treasurer's office.

531
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:16,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit kind of spread out

532
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:19,760
[SPEAKER_07]: from an accountability point of view.

533
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:47,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to get an idea, we have different websites where we make collections, other parents are able to pay in cash sometimes, and I don't have any, I'm not concerned that there's like fraud going on, but I think that we need somebody come in, take a look at how we do it, give us recommendations on how we can tighten up

534
00:57:48,962 --> 00:57:50,103
[SPEAKER_07]: the revenue collection.

535
00:57:50,383 --> 00:58:04,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're thinking about, you know, kind of in, you know, what is our, we need some capacity to, to manage the revenue better than we have now.

536
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:14,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So trying to, you know, envision, like making that somebody's position without necessarily adding

537
00:58:15,353 --> 00:58:19,519
[SPEAKER_07]: adding another position, but maybe that's a recommendation from this report.

538
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:22,443
[SPEAKER_07]: But I agree with you.

539
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:28,232
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen on revenue collection.

540
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:32,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I completely agree.

541
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:42,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe three years ago now, we asked for that exact audit to be done, and we retained Andy Paquette to do it.

542
00:58:43,678 --> 00:58:46,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did provide a public report

543
00:58:51,353 --> 00:59:01,908
[SPEAKER_03]: to us and it did not go into that level of detail, which was disappointing at the time and also sort of the middle of COVID and lots was going on.

544
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if privately there were

545
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:18,034
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations made about revenue collection, but as I sat here looking at this, I certainly said some sort of centralization of revenue operations and controls has to happen.

546
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:29,446
[SPEAKER_03]: All that cash management control strikes me as a risk, and it's great to hear you say you're not overly concerned about any sort of actual fraud happening right now, but

547
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,768
[SPEAKER_03]: it's incumbent on us to prevent that.

548
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to have good measures to do it.

549
00:59:34,631 --> 00:59:40,637
[SPEAKER_03]: But also we need to be able to tell people what they owe us and make it easy for people to, to, to pay.

550
00:59:40,737 --> 00:59:49,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, like I see stuff all the time and sort of, you know, like field trips, people say like send cash or, you know, please send cash.

551
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:52,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, that's, that's part of like revenue collection

552
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a symptom of complicated revenue collection, in my opinion.

553
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we do need to do that, but there may be some findings from that initial report that you can get your hands on as well.

554
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:13,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a whole accounting system around student activities, which is where those funds would go, your last example.

555
01:00:13,654 --> 01:00:19,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not even on this chart, but that would be part of the management review.

556
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:21,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK, great.

557
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think the other question I had is whether we're confident that community schools is being charged appropriately for the staff expenses.

558
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:42,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're not confident in that.

559
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:48,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, and part of it was because, you know, some of our,

560
01:00:50,843 --> 01:00:54,465
[SPEAKER_07]: costs, you know, are not keeping up with the contracts that are being settled.

561
01:00:54,545 --> 01:01:11,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really, I'm glad to hear, like, we get into a process of annual review of the rates, because I think that's going to create a system where we're looking at the sufficiency of the rates we're charging on an annual basis.

562
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:15,213
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're probably, we are not,

563
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:22,675
[SPEAKER_07]: recovering the costs of staff that are assigned on the weekends to some of these events.

564
01:01:23,615 --> 01:01:27,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that just can't continue to happen.

565
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:32,500
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't continue to pay in excess of what our rentals are providing us.

566
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,462
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not feasible, and it hurts our students.

567
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can't continue to do that.

568
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed, yeah.

569
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Jerry.

570
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,525
[SPEAKER_03]: This is super helpful.

571
01:01:47,048 --> 01:01:50,529
[SPEAKER_07]: We can, I'm looking at the time, we can stop here.

572
01:01:50,549 --> 01:02:13,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I had, you know, we do get private grants and donations as well, but, and I have a little presentation on kind of my thoughts around chargebacks to some of these programs to recover admin costs and facilities costs, but we can defer that to another time if you want.

573
01:02:15,672 --> 01:02:18,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I did see member, member Reinfeld, you put your hand down.

574
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:20,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you had a question.

575
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to the committee.

576
01:02:22,074 --> 01:02:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who has time restrictions and I'm.

577
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:26,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay to stay.

578
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna just.

579
01:02:30,637 --> 01:02:32,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe 10 more minutes.

580
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:34,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

581
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:36,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

582
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have these private grants that provide

583
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:48,994
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, you know, extra programming that doesn't affect the general fund.

584
01:02:49,555 --> 01:03:12,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so the, uh, the center of, um, citizenship and social responsibility, um, has three, three accounts that they manage this crystal Campbell betterment project, the Cummings foundation, which is really a lot of how they, uh, provide for their, uh, programming.

585
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:31,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they also get donations here in column H. So they have programs running in every school, which is providing our students after school opportunity.

586
01:03:33,653 --> 01:03:40,799
[SPEAKER_07]: This Leah Clark English Award, to be honest, I'm not sure what this is for, I have to try to go back

587
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:46,530
[SPEAKER_07]: but it looks like it might be a scholarship type of a program.

588
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:57,573
[SPEAKER_07]: This Verizon grant is another private donation that we got, small balances.

589
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:06,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these grants probably haven't been charged yet or there might be small balances that will,

590
01:04:09,062 --> 01:04:12,243
[SPEAKER_07]: transfer out at the end of the year if they're no longer active.

591
01:04:12,263 --> 01:04:17,146
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another group, Save Our Sports.

592
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:21,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a small balance, there's a gift.

593
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:27,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are little balances that will be transferred out.

594
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:32,993
[SPEAKER_07]: The Campbell Gift Fund is also another CCSR.

595
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:43,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Bloomberg gift account that looks like maybe it was something from the past with the balance on it.

596
01:04:43,802 --> 01:05:02,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have Medford Family Network has the children's, they get a grant from the Children's Trust, which I need to get a handle on because I wanna say that there's probably, they have a few accounts.

597
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:05,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna say that this account's probably being overcharged

598
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:13,937
[SPEAKER_07]: in another account, like maybe this gift account is being undercharged, but we'll get to the bottom of that.

599
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:18,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's this miscellaneous school gifts account.

600
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what's going in and out of this account, but typically a lot of schools have this type of account.

601
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:36,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people, sometimes alumni or successful families in Medford might just be generous and give

602
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:41,249
[SPEAKER_07]: give a gift for no specific reason that it would go into this account.

603
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:46,591
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's something gonna notify the art department.

604
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a money for a mural that seems to be available, Medford Family Network.

605
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:59,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we got a grant for STEM equipment and professional development.

606
01:05:59,135 --> 01:06:03,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we got it in FY23 and we spent the money in FY23.

607
01:06:03,757 --> 01:06:06,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a deficit in the account, but then we

608
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:10,850
[SPEAKER_07]: we received the funds in FY24 and that all balanced out.

609
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:15,973
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just another group of funds that are outside.

610
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you know about Title I and ESSER and those types of grants, but there's these other smaller grants that the school department manages.

611
01:06:26,518 --> 01:06:30,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's any questions on that.

612
01:06:32,378 --> 01:06:33,078
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is helpful.

613
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:33,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

614
01:06:33,818 --> 01:06:34,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

615
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:35,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And then.

616
01:06:35,479 --> 01:06:36,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

617
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:37,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't see you.

618
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:38,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau.

619
01:06:39,559 --> 01:07:01,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have one question about, and I don't expect you to have the answer on this, but some of those things have substantial balances, and I'm hoping that somebody has the documentation on those bigger things, like there's three Cummings ones, because when I see these big numbers sitting there, I worry about,

620
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:13,400
[SPEAKER_08]: the grant expiring and then we have to send the money back because we didn't figure out how to spend it, frankly, or did we spend it and we didn't properly account for the expenses.

621
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:25,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, obviously if you don't have the grant documents, you know, but that's something I hope we could do because there was some big numbers there.

622
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:26,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

623
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The Crystal Campbell Betterment Project, which,

624
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:32,765
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, has the biggest balance.

625
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:39,648
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that most of that may be an endowment.

626
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:46,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just have to kind of work something out with the treasurer where we, whatever.

627
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:57,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So, an endowment is that we're gonna keep the original contribution in perpetuity and then

628
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:04,238
[SPEAKER_07]: would probably spend any interest that's being generated from that account.

629
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:14,986
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that's why you see the balance there, but we have to set up the accounting so we make sure that we don't spend the amount that's intended to be the endowment.

630
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:17,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

631
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

632
01:08:22,171 --> 01:08:27,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So just gonna spend just a couple minutes and get your

633
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:29,252
[SPEAKER_07]: thoughts on this.

634
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:34,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, I believe member Intoppa had a question.

635
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:37,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, member Intoppa.

636
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:55,711
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just gonna, to member, thank you, to member Rousseau's point of the Cummings Foundation, that large grant funds the CCSR over an expanded amount of time, so that might be why, and I don't know if they have to give it back, but I do know they have to apply, I think,

637
01:08:56,903 --> 01:09:00,705
[SPEAKER_02]: every 10 years or so, it's like somewhere between six to 10.

638
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:22,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was curious about the gift fund and if that had any in time in with the alumni association and where those funds are handled, where the overflow of SGA funds from the previous classes, I know some of them, sometimes they're retained, sometimes the SGA funds

639
01:09:23,977 --> 01:09:27,798
[SPEAKER_02]: go into like the alumni association so that way they can do their own private scholarship.

640
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to see how much of that may be attributing to that, if at all.

641
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:39,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it's purely outside, if it's purely outside donations of people who wanna give back to our schools.

642
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:46,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a little, is that a question?

643
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a little trouble hearing that.

644
01:09:49,943 --> 01:09:50,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, my apologies.

645
01:09:51,673 --> 01:10:08,438
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out my mic, but I would be interested to see where the MHS gift fund, what is funding that, if it's anything with the alumni association, if it's in terms of like overflow of SGA funds, the student government funds with fundraised funds.

646
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:18,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the beginning point, again, I don't know how much was heard, fixing my mic situation for next meeting about the Cummings Foundation being a grant that's spent over a few years.

647
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're actually,

648
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,510
[SPEAKER_02]: in year one or year two of it.

649
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:35,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just replenished, which might be why that number is so large, but that is the predominant funding source for all of the units of CCSR and all the projects.

650
01:10:36,593 --> 01:10:39,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know they get an award for a number of years.

651
01:10:39,494 --> 01:10:43,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So they get $35,000 a year from that award.

652
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:47,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it might've been, maybe it was a 10 year award of 350,000.

653
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

654
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:57,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the committee is going to get a presentation on that program soon.

655
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:09,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you could send me an email on your question and I'll do the research for you.

656
01:11:11,314 --> 01:11:13,495
[SPEAKER_07]: gmccube at medfitk12.

657
01:11:13,515 --> 01:11:13,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

658
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:31,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, is this so no, it's Sorry

659
01:11:44,813 --> 01:12:05,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was kind of my thinking around this chargeback plan that we need a little more work to go, but essentially, you know, we have programs like the afterschool program and Kids Corner and MEEP that use our facilities, use our administrative services.

660
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:11,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we should be, we can,

661
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:25,085
[SPEAKER_07]: charge those programs for the facilities expenses and the admin expenses for the services we're providing them.

662
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:35,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So the trick is kind of coming up with a methodology that's like fairly allocates expenses to those programs.

663
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:43,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the facilities charge, I thought the easiest way to do it would be to base it on classroom use.

664
01:12:45,925 --> 01:12:57,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we might be able to kind of piggyback on this to figure out, you know, if we're charging these outside groups a sufficient amount for our facilities.

665
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:06,900
[SPEAKER_07]: But these are the number of classrooms we have according to the MSBA in each of our schools, 651 total.

666
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:11,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And then facilities budget for this year is 6.1 million.

667
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:22,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I divide the number of classrooms by the facilities budget, it's $9,400 per classroom.

668
01:13:23,495 --> 01:13:39,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I said, well, we go at least 183 school days, including teacher days, and then maybe another 40 of July and August for a 223-day year.

669
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:41,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can kind of nail that number down.

670
01:13:42,176 --> 01:13:44,196
[SPEAKER_07]: but that would be $42 a day.

671
01:13:46,377 --> 01:14:01,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I divided, I assumed a 12 hour day and divided it into kind of three time categories, because for instance, the afterschool program mostly uses it after school.

672
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I assumed 40, you know, 10 classrooms per school.

673
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know whether that's low or high, we'll confirm that number.

674
01:14:13,302 --> 01:14:31,853
[SPEAKER_07]: But 170 school days and 10 early release days where the after school program provides more of a half day program, that works out to be a charge of $100,000 that we could recover for facilities.

675
01:14:32,894 --> 01:14:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And then similarly for admin, right now we have,

676
01:14:40,382 --> 01:14:42,704
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,031 active employees.

677
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:49,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a finance, HR, and technology budget of almost $1.1 million.

678
01:14:49,610 --> 01:15:00,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So the finance, HR, and technology costs work out to be about $1,000 per employee.

679
01:15:00,419 --> 01:15:05,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm assuming before and after school program has 60 employees.

680
01:15:08,359 --> 01:15:10,080
[SPEAKER_07]: and that will be a cost recovery of 63,000.

681
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:26,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So it will look like something like this and this will be able to kind of offset some of the budgeted amounts in the general fund.

682
01:15:34,954 --> 01:15:37,556
[SPEAKER_07]: More to come to that when we do the budget presentation,

683
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:40,655
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we look at.

684
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:51,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other thing is that I don't have for you tonight, but we do get E-rate funding for our technology projects, any project that qualifies for E-rate.

685
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:57,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will be part of a additional revenue presentation.

686
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,101
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably around $100,000 or $130,000 in offset

687
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:16,059
[SPEAKER_07]: for some of our technology costs.

688
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's my presentation for tonight.

689
01:16:23,885 --> 01:16:24,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we lose the mayor?

690
01:16:28,769 --> 01:16:29,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, she's still here.

691
01:16:32,312 --> 01:16:34,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But member Ruseau, did you wanna ask a question?

692
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:35,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, yes.

693
01:16:38,048 --> 01:16:40,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to throw a wrench, and it's based on what I'm seeing.

694
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:45,696
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like throwing a little tiny file into this networks.

695
01:16:46,196 --> 01:16:58,608
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talk about the after-school program, for instance, we just became aware that a primary space they use at one of the schools was just reserved for another program without their

696
01:17:00,694 --> 01:17:03,316
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just told, by the way, you don't have your space anymore.

697
01:17:03,396 --> 01:17:26,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I think about making them pay for spaces, I think we have to also think about how their space literally, because we still can't figure out how to do reservations of space in the district, that their space may, in fact, just randomly no longer be theirs.

698
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:30,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we talk about charging them, I almost feel like we should pay them back.

699
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,895
[SPEAKER_08]: for the crisis that we put them in when we give away their space.

700
01:17:35,457 --> 01:17:40,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realize that's sort of an additional little piece of work, what to do in those situations.

701
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:48,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think it's super unfair and minor thing to think about after the fact, but.

702
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:51,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I agree.

703
01:17:51,389 --> 01:17:57,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just, it happens in every school district, but you have to,

704
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:10,542
[SPEAKER_07]: the services that are being provided by the afterschool program are just as important as whatever else is happening in the school.

705
01:18:10,622 --> 01:18:21,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best way to do it is just before school, come to an agreement with the principal, what spaces are gonna be available on a regular basis for the afterschool program.

706
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:29,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And then things come up and people work together and they kind of work things out for something unforeseen, but you have to have

707
01:18:30,558 --> 01:18:35,499
[SPEAKER_07]: a regularly available space to do proper planning.

708
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's other spaces within the school that can be used for some of these other meetings or kind of figure out a way, you know, how best to share the space, but it's not an untypical problem in districts.

709
01:18:58,092 --> 01:18:59,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you so much, Jerry.

710
01:19:00,354 --> 01:19:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's no, any other further questions?

711
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn.

712
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:14,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by Member Graham, seconded by... Second.

713
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:18,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was Member Branley or Member Reinfeld.

714
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:21,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Reinfeld, roll call, please.

715
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:28,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

716
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:31,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking to myself saying I'm muted aren't I as if anybody's going to answer.

717
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:32,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

718
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:32,835
