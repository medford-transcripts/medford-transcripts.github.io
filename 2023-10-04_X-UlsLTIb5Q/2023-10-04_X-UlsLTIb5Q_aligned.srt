00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:20,204
And additionally, if you have questions or comments, they can be submitted during the meeting.

3
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:27,827
If you don't want to speak, you can email me directly at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us.

4
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:39,671
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, or if you're an employee, just indicate that, your question or comment, the agenda.

5
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:47,062
is that we will be needing to discuss and revise the wellness policy which is policy ADF.

6
00:00:49,161 --> 00:01:11,649
for K-8 students and the resolution that sent that here was as approved by the committee on May 15, 2022, the wellness and policy ADF for K-8 students be sent to the rules and policy subcommittee for revision and that it be revised as necessary to ensure unrestricted free play recess is available to all K-8 children

7
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:18,682
daily as part of their social and emotional well being, the curtailing of unrestricted free play recess shall be tracked.

8
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:27,350
This information shall be returned to the school committee twice each year and be disambiguated by school, grade, gender, race, disability, and socioeconomic status.

9
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:37,472
Subcommittee shall invite at least one teacher and administrator from grades K to five and six to eight as well as the director of student services or designee to ensure their views are considered.

10
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:44,853
The current policy and recommended revised policy will be returned to this committee no later than the first meeting in November of 2022.

11
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:51,034
So I'll take the roll real quick and then explain why we are doing this so very late.

12
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:53,895
Member Graham.

13
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:01,937
Member McLaughlin is absent.

14
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:07,300
Member Rosado is present, two present, one absent.

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,100
We have a quorum.

16
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:14,484
So before we get into the details, so this is actually take three trying to do this.

17
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:19,587
First time was just before we had some kind of a little health crisis called the pandemic.

18
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,228
It wasn't little.

19
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:32,802
And so we kind of delayed working on this because, well there was no recess because kids weren't in school, and there were much bigger fish to fry at that moment in time.

20
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,505
And then last November we again

21
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,221
Give it another try.

22
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:47,068
And then we had the bullying policy, which kind of overtook this subcommittee for all of the winter and spring and summer.

23
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,670
So here we are, try three.

24
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,211
I think we're going to get it this time.

25
00:02:53,453 --> 00:03:05,062
So I am preparing for this meeting because while we did have some really good conversations last year in our November, I believe we had a meeting on

26
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:10,401
November 16th or something like that.

27
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,124
Forgive me for not having the exact date.

28
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:17,772
And we had really excellent conversations, made a lot of engagement.

29
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,786
that I don't want to rehash all of that.

30
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:26,949
I don't think anybody here needs to rehash all of that.

31
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:32,692
So we're not going to look at the news articles or watch a video of why recess is important.

32
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:47,340
I don't think anybody here needs to really be convinced that recess is important for the social emotional stuff, classroom behavior after kids actually get proper free play recess, all the growth that I mean,

33
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,458
Most of you here, or half of us here, are educators.

34
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:55,118
I'm not one, but you all get that.

35
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:58,499
So I think it's best if we get straight into the actual policy.

36
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,719
Amber Graham, did you have something you wanted to say?

37
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah, I just had a question.

38
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,700
What was the date of that meeting again?

39
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,741
It was, one second.

40
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,161
And I, of course, did.

41
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,542
November 16th is the date, I believe.

42
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:15,042
2022, honestly.

43
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:15,143
Yeah.

44
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:24,909
Okay, a family member was literally asking me about recess this morning, who does not live in Medford.

45
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:34,155
And I was like, I know we've talked about this like several times, but I'm actually going to point her to that meeting and she may find it helpful, so.

46
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,537
Yeah, great.

47
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:43,962
So I went and looked at our current policy because the resolution from the full committee is to update that policy.

48
00:04:45,652 --> 00:05:05,776
I quickly realized that we were looking at another scenario for those of you that were present for that, not unlike our bullying policy, where we attempted to change the current policy for many meetings, and essentially we really only ever made progress when we just kind of flushed the old policy down the toilet and started over, and then we moved quickly.

49
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:10,037
The current wellness policy, which I could share, but I don't

50
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:26,463
I mean, well, actually I will share it, has language that is clearly was in, there must've been a law passed, I'm guessing in 2021 based on some of the, where's the share?

51
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,365
I'm never gonna remember that.

52
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:29,826
Okay.

53
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:39,686
The current policy on our website doesn't read like a policy.

54
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:46,531
It, like the bullying policy, it reads like there was some legislation and people copied and pasted from somewhere.

55
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,754
And, you know, there's like WIC said to do this.

56
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:58,861
There's a whole section in here where there's the whereas, which is,

57
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:04,453
Right here, whereas, like this reads like a resolution.

58
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:15,058
And then when I read this policy, there's a couple of interesting things that are sort of like surprising.

59
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:26,562
Like our goal is that the Memphis public schools reach phase N. So like that was supposed to be filled in with a number of all nine elements within a five-year period.

60
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,582
There's no date on this.

61
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:29,123
So that five-year period,

62
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:33,190
I've been here for six years, so that five-year period long since it's passed.

63
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,714
And there are not policies on all of these things.

64
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:50,223
So this is the current language, and I'd like to just make a motion, frankly, that we, rather than beat ourselves to death with that,

65
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:56,222
existing language, which is not like the current model language from our association.

66
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,124
A current model language from our association actually makes sense.

67
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:19,621
So maybe we did this when there wasn't a model, but I'd like to make a motion that we do not try to amend the current language and that for the purposes of this meeting, that we simply move on and treat the current model language as our starting point for our deliberations to craft a new policy.

68
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:26,511
Anybody want to talk about that?

69
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,092
But I did have a question.

70
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:29,253
Sure.

71
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:40,983
Is there a reason why all of these disparate things have to be bubbled into a wellness policy?

72
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:45,948
Because if I was trying to find out what does the district think about

73
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,763
recess versus food service.

74
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:54,965
Like I would never in a million years think to go to the same policy.

75
00:07:55,225 --> 00:08:11,914
So one question I have is like, is there some like regulatory reason why the wellness policy has to be written like this versus in maybe components?

76
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:16,686
Sort of a couple of answers to that.

77
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:21,134
Let me put this other thing that's causing my learning a couple answers there.

78
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:27,545
So I didn't look up the law, but I do remember from our previous director of nursing.

79
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:39,455
Tony, that the law required that the wellness policy be re-approved every, I believe she said every two years, and obviously we should find that out.

80
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:44,738
Now, you can see on my screen, you can see my screen, correct?

81
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:48,119
That there's in the policy

82
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:55,666
naming convention, numbering convention, if you will, is these letters.

83
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:04,735
And there's the sort of the high level, well, the highest level thing is foundations, but then wellness.

84
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:12,803
And then you can see these dashes, where essentially, these are pieces that have been brought out into their own quote policy.

85
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:14,445
But

86
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,420
Your point is, of course, very accurate.

87
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:31,468
Like we used to, I don't know if anybody remembers, but maybe a year ago, we had what was called a school attorney policy and we renamed it.

88
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:41,614
I mean, because the law required a school attorney policy, but we're pretty sure nobody was coming for us if we renamed it to make it make sense that it was the district attorneys or the school committee's attorneys.

89
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:44,376
So I think we can probably get away with renaming it.

90
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:52,102
if it's not going to cause problems down the line where, you know, people are like, we have to have a wellness policy.

91
00:09:52,262 --> 00:10:03,831
I mean, we can literally put it in the language somewhere that, you know, if there's a legal reference that says school districts will have a quote wellness policy, then we put that in the legal references.

92
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:06,293
And I think that's fine.

93
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:11,477
But whether they're all in one giant policy or in sections, I think we can break them up into sections.

94
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,518
So that's my take.

95
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:22,279
I said there were two things I wanted to talk about on that, and I've already forgotten what the other one was.

96
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:32,824
So does anybody else want to talk on that before I take the roll, too, so we can stop looking at the old one?

97
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:32,884
No?

98
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:36,066
Okay, good.

99
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:36,446
So I will...

100
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:49,386
Sorry, before you do that, Dr. Edward Vincent, Dr. Cushing, Ms.

101
00:10:49,426 --> 00:11:04,331
Bowen, do you all have any reason, is there anything we're not thinking about that would require a wellness policy to be comprised of X or Y or Z?

102
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:08,772
If I were,

103
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:11,116
Ms.

104
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:12,177
Bowen, were you gonna say something?

105
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:25,823
I was listening to your point about how the current wellness policy is talking about the many different areas of wellness.

106
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:39,689
Are you asking specifically if we should separate it out from the way it's currently listed so that people will know what subcategory we're talking about?

107
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:44,028
I'm more asking what we're required to do.

108
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:49,993
Yeah, I don't know if anybody here knows the answer.

109
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:55,919
I don't, I don't have that that's something that I could definitely try to get specific information.

110
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,242
I mean, I know with rules and policy I really thought we were.

111
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:19,082
some of our policies were antiquated and I know member Russo has been, you know, helping us to make sure that we update some of them so I was thinking more updating the existing one that was in place, and I was just going to be listening to what those

112
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:36,314
revisions or updates were, but in terms of making it a freestanding policy, I would have to really research to find out is there a specific reason with the letters and how it's currently

113
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:43,330
coded with MASC, there could be a deeper reason for that.

114
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:54,001
So if that's a piece of research that I could just follow up on to find out, and if it needs to stay this way, then I'm fine with that.

115
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,122
We're following the rules.

116
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:59,447
And if we can separate it, I'm comfortable with separating it as well.

117
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,248
Great.

118
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:07,589
The current MASC policy, they updated theirs in 2022.

119
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:08,989
So theirs is quite fresh.

120
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,190
They have no subcategories.

121
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,611
But their policy, which we will get into in a minute, is really quite high level.

122
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:26,472
And some of these things like nutrition education, like I'm on the HECAT.

123
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,733
There's like, what is that, 10 lines?

124
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:37,229
That's not a lot, but how much of our health curriculum is really gonna be in policy?

125
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,331
None of it, frankly, should be in policy.

126
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:56,320
So I don't know whether this is too small or too big, but I do know that the current policy we have is, it's not enforceable or implementable because it's not written as a policy.

127
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,342
It's written as a, I don't know what to call it to be.

128
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,926
fair and nice and appropriate on a public meeting.

129
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:06,688
So.

130
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,712
And is this the same policy where the food allergy?

131
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:14,113
Yes.

132
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:15,574
Needs to go?

133
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:17,795
Correct.

134
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,357
Yeah.

135
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:26,381
And you look at if you look at the

136
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:36,513
MSC has not the word allergy does not exist in any MSC model language so we're a bit on our own there, but I know that.

137
00:14:38,194 --> 00:14:45,738
Director Heinz and some other folks have been working on language which we will have another meeting specifically for that.

138
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,862
Because it's there's no policy recommendation from MSC on this.

139
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:59,106
on allergies, my gut tells me we would actually make it a subcategory under the wellness policy.

140
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:07,451
But we'd have to look, I guess we'd have to look at all of the rest of the naming conventions to see where the right place is.

141
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:13,696
Policies can also go in multiple locations when that's appropriate too.

142
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,230
Any other questions?

143
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:42,045
I was just going to say, Member Russo and Member Graham, I am willing to reach out to MASC to just get that additional guidance as well on the allergy portion once that's ready to be submitted to the district to ask whether we can do it as a sub policy and again create

144
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:50,702
create a sub policy under wellness policy, or if it has to be incorporated into this particular one?

145
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:58,006
Yeah, I've already was communicating with them today, actually.

146
00:15:58,286 --> 00:15:59,067
Oh, OK, good.

147
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:05,811
Yeah, the answer is, unlike with the city council, ordinances actually have to be reviewed by the state.

148
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,095
It won't surprise anybody here that nobody really seems to care that much.

149
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:20,978
that we can, for the most part, do things any way we want, as long as there isn't a specific law saying we have to do it a certain way.

150
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:34,970
And, you know, the language in our current one reads a bit like, you know, that Congress will establish new requirements that all school districts with a federally funded school meals program develop and implement wellness policies

151
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:39,154
that address nutrition and physical activity.

152
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:43,017
I mean, that might be the full extent of the law.

153
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:50,443
Or I mean, that doesn't look like a law, but you know, the laws aren't typically being passed that give us enough detail.

154
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:54,126
And that's where we're sort of on our own.

155
00:16:55,748 --> 00:17:01,492
But I think if there's no other questions, I'd like to move on so we can get to the policy.

156
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,674
I have to take a roll call if there's no other questions.

157
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,105
Sorry, just one more question.

158
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:10,207
That's okay.

159
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:27,780
So is your motion essentially meaning that we are going to ultimately rescind not just ADF, but ADFR, ADFE1, and ADFE2?

160
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,644
Well, are you reading my notes before I've even had a chance to say those things out loud?

161
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:35,346
Those are my motions I'm gonna make after we get this one done.

162
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:41,114
No, I wasn't, I was just reading the policy manual, trying to understand.

163
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:41,794
Okay, sorry.

164
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,014
Yes, that's next.

165
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:49,875
Okay, so yes, let's vote on this piece.

166
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:53,496
Member Graham.

167
00:17:53,836 --> 00:17:54,136
Yes.

168
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,197
Member Rousseau, yes.

169
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,017
And Member McLaughlin is absent, so okay.

170
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:07,239
So all that is doing is sort of resetting in our meeting here what we're gonna start with for text.

171
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,162
to actually accomplish the goals.

172
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:12,983
I might as well get those other things out of the way.

173
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:22,366
So since never gonna mention them, ADF-R is also... Hi, how are you?

174
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,847
Hi Joan, you're unmuted.

175
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:25,987
Oops, sorry.

176
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:28,248
Thank you.

177
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,771
So this one here is also, this is like very strange thing.

178
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,506
I agree specifying the software we're going to get rid of, we're going to use like it.

179
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:55,331
This, this might have been a document that made sense the day we all started somewhere in the past with a like hey we need to care about this stuff but so I'd like to make a motion to rescind the ADF dash our policy.

180
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,820
And I'll just take a vote now.

181
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,520
Member Graham?

182
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:16,221
Yes.

183
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:18,362
Member Rousseau, yes.

184
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:23,466
And why on earth would my own computer not know how to spell my name?

185
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:25,127
Member Rousseau, yes.

186
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:27,569
And Member McLaughlin is absent.

187
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:34,173
Okay, and then the next one is the odd, it's very odd.

188
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,494
Sorry.

189
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,194
One second.

190
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,315
Too many windows here.

191
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,597
ADFR is the one we actually just voted on.

192
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,928
So motion to rescind ADFE1.

193
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:07,690
Correct.

194
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,812
And let me just bring it up so people know what it is we're doing.

195
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:16,697
This is literally just the law.

196
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:18,343
It is the law.

197
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:20,004
I went and looked at the law earlier today.

198
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:21,625
This is the text of the law.

199
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:28,510
A policy, it doesn't make any sense that a policy is the text of the law.

200
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,453
So I motion to rescind that.

201
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:33,714
Second.

202
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:39,979
Member Graham?

203
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:41,320
Yes.

204
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,221
Member Rousseau, yes.

205
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:47,084
Member McLaughlin is absent.

206
00:20:53,012 --> 00:21:12,922
And then the last one is the appendix, which is an entire bizarre, it says that we already have in place all of these policies, which I don't know if that's true, but also that's not a policy.

207
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,324
That's what the links between policies are for.

208
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:19,486
So just from a perspective of less is more here,

209
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,147
I'd like to make a motion to rescind that one, too.

210
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,228
Second.

211
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:27,549
Thank you.

212
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:36,014
Senator Graham?

213
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:36,974
Yes.

214
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:42,997
Senator Brousseau is yes.

215
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:45,038
Okay, good.

216
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:45,398
Sorry.

217
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:48,500
Now, let's get on to the actual work.

218
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:55,244
So I'm going to close the policy here.

219
00:21:55,324 --> 00:22:07,391
So I've taken the text of the current MASC policy, since looking at it in this window isn't really any fun, and I have moved it into a Google Doc so we can work.

220
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:21,020
And prior to the meeting, I went through and I fixed some of the, I use Grammarly, so I fixed some of the grammar mistakes in our model language that we were handed.

221
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:30,273
And I added the policy reference the policy information as we have a policy thing we'll have that information I put that at the bottom.

222
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:36,394
I just want you all to know I did that so that you know when this comes out of here you're not like that's not what we did.

223
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:37,575
I've also

224
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:42,157
highlighted the things that I've suggested crossing out.

225
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:47,058
There are three policies in the current MASC policy manual that they say are related.

226
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:50,339
In fact, EFC is not that.

227
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:54,260
IHAMA is not that and KI is not that.

228
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,901
So I've emailed them and they're going to be fixing their policy service to correct that.

229
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:02,642
So I don't believe there are related policies right now that are relevant.

230
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:07,983
But I just wanted you to note that I was taking those out because

231
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:12,585
Those are literally not what those policies are in our policy manual or theirs.

232
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:18,048
So they have a little hygiene issue there with their database maintenance.

233
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:26,372
The other thing I have done ahead of time since, oh wait, nope, that was all I did.

234
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:30,754
And so I'm just going to go to the top real quick.

235
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:34,316
I'm not going to read this line by line because we will

236
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:38,579
If we finish it today, we will be sending it to the full committee and everybody can read it.

237
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,022
But there's really so this is the interest.

238
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,123
There's a couple of things that I think are particularly interesting.

239
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:49,905
That we will have a wellness committee.

240
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:57,929
I will admit I did not look to see in the law, whether that's required, but I kind of wonder if this is ring bells to folks.

241
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:02,131
Is this something you know the districts like of course as a wellness policy committee.

242
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:03,452
And do we just have a different name.

243
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:06,198
looking for anybody in the administration?

244
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:16,723
I am looking at Linfield's policy and it does also cover a wellness committee.

245
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:18,844
Okay.

246
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:27,408
I mean, so we can just include it and then worry about it being implemented

247
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:32,311
as another, you know, that's what the superintendent in her office does.

248
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:41,918
And if in the future we decide we need to scratch it or whatever, then we can make that change now rather than digging through the law.

249
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:48,043
But I found it interesting that MASC had this as part of their model language.

250
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:51,045
And it's a very interesting committee.

251
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:51,706
It's got a

252
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:58,195
One parent, guardian, which I will change to caregiver, because that's what we use here.

253
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:04,256
And student, nurse, school food service representative.

254
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:08,277
We call ours the food service department.

255
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:15,439
School committee member, school administrator, member of the public, and other community members as appropriate.

256
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:18,399
And we

257
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:28,014
doesn't really say what they'll be, oh, implementation and evaluation of this policy, okay.

258
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:38,277
It's kind of strange to really have a policy saying somebody other than the superintendent will implement our policies, because that's sort of like, isn't that how it's supposed to work?

259
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:49,061
So, I would,

260
00:25:52,242 --> 00:26:06,594
not want to designate a school committee, like a person, like as a wellness program coordinator in a policy, right?

261
00:26:06,714 --> 00:26:12,539
Like about halfway through the paragraph, the school committee designates the following individuals as the wellness program coordinators.

262
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,544
Like practically speaking, not want to do that.

263
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,605
But, um,

264
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:40,199
The Linfield policy that I'm looking at that I kind of like says that the superintendent along with the principal of each school shall be responsible for the implementation of this wellness policy and of addressing standards of health, wellness, nutrition, and physical activity.

265
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,142
And that the committee like

266
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:47,137
meets quarterly and reports the school committee annually.

267
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:57,041
And it also says like in terms of mission, the oversight of the wellness policy and regulations and is the means of assessing and promoting a healthy environment for Linfield Public Schools.

268
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,902
I like that one.

269
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,523
So I sort of like their language.

270
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:17,398
mostly better except like, I do like sort of how this one calls out like who the wellness committee is a little bit better.

271
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:21,860
So I feel like the first half of this might like make some sense.

272
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:33,206
And I guess the question maybe for Howard is, is wellness coordinator a like defined role that we are supposed to have?

273
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,121
Linfield doesn't.

274
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:49,645
Say that.

275
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:54,248
And.

276
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:06,475
I'm just.

277
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,355
going to copy this language.

278
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:14,017
Actually, can you give me access to this document?

279
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:15,878
Sure.

280
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,340
And I can just drop the language right in?

281
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:30,626
Yes, it's important to note that when the meeting is over, we have to stop looking at the document because that would be an OML violation.

282
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:33,608
But anyways, yes, if you want to put that in there.

283
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:40,058
Did you, here it goes, okay.

284
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,415
You all see what I just dropped in?

285
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:45,807
I like it.

286
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:54,450
And I, I feel like meeting, I don't know, superintendent, if you disagree, but I feel like meeting quarterly is a lot.

287
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,012
If the purview of this committee is as narrow as policy.

288
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:05,793
Yeah.

289
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:08,494
I think meeting twice annually, definitely it's reasonable.

290
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:09,134
Okay.

291
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:28,197
where there, when you had mentioned the allergies, Member Russo, I did not specifically think to have Director Hines or our Director Retter-Smith.

292
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:36,700
Yeah, I mean, that's a, we'll have a whole meeting on that specifically.

293
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,080
So, yeah.

294
00:30:40,635 --> 00:31:03,531
I guess like the other question I had, just structurally, like could we like sort of describe this like main policy as sort of everything that's supposed to be in this policy from a model perspective, except food service, except allergies and except recess.

295
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:08,415
And that those three things are like sort of topics unto themselves.

296
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,036
So they could be sub policies.

297
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:19,353
But I like that approach as well.

298
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:24,856
We have a member of the community that would like to speak.

299
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:26,956
Shanine.

300
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,158
Hi, everybody.

301
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:36,560
Having a separate policy for allergies is consistent with what I've seen in the other manuals.

302
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:49,909
And I just wanted to let you know that Retta and Avery and I all met yesterday to really hash out all of the questions that need to be answered in the allergy policy.

303
00:31:50,629 --> 00:32:02,076
So where the policy draft that had been discussed before this body before is a very old, very wordy policy that no one will read and no one is adhering to.

304
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:06,679
So we're going to make sure that it is consistent with the, um,

305
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:20,251
Department of Early and Secondary Education recommendations, which is what the CDC recommendations are built off of and have it have clear role delineation for who's responsible for what parts of allergy management.

306
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,952
So that will be forthcoming, but it's in process.

307
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,713
Excellent, thank you.

308
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:34,816
Yeah, so I think, so let's, I mean, we don't really decide that, sorry.

309
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:35,837
Can I just ask a question?

310
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,177
I just wanna clarify something.

311
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:42,943
Maybe Dr. Edward-Vincent or Shanine can answer this question.

312
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:55,192
Is the plan for that subgroup to bring their suggested policy to this group so that it can be officially adopted by the school committee?

313
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,994
That would be my understanding, yes.

314
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:07,561
Paul and I have been discussing doing this as part of the wellness policy, but rather than just implementing or approving a policy that wasn't

315
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:12,718
well suited for the district as it is and the kids with the allergies and the reality of every day.

316
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:18,426
We wanted to make sure that we had more time to really flesh that out while getting the rest of this passed.

317
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:27,271
And I was just going to comment that I have not, I wasn't at yesterday's meeting, but Ms.

318
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:39,596
Bowen and myself, once we are caught up to speed on where things are landing, we'll definitely bring it back before the committee to have that added.

319
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:44,979
Because we want to make sure we have a consistent approach across the district.

320
00:33:46,061 --> 00:34:01,905
Yeah, that's definitely one of the goals is to make sure that across each school that it's being implemented consistently, that PTO events and field trips and all of the pieces are consistent and easily accessible.

321
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:06,846
Okay.

322
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:15,688
Based on the feedback we got yesterday about the bullying policy and how it was like people could use it, I'm pretty hopeful about

323
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:21,008
a new allergy policy, but I say a new allergy policy, but like there is no allergy policy.

324
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:39,682
If you look at our allergy in our current policy service, I mean, as I think everybody here knows, like when a school district must have policy, if the school committee does not speak on that by saying, this is our policy, then the policy is whatever the superintendent says.

325
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,786
And so I'm not saying that there's nothing in the district that cares about allergies.

326
00:34:45,222 --> 00:34:47,543
I just mean that there's no school committee policy on it.

327
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:51,044
Um, just don't invite to think that it's a complete free for all.

328
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:58,487
Um, so, um, I, I like those changes and I don't see any reason not to just accept them.

329
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:02,848
Um, and we haven't approved this as a thing to really be amended.

330
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,389
So I'm going to just click.

331
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:10,611
To accept them rather than, uh, come back and look at this Google doc in the future and be like, what did we say?

332
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:12,732
Um, agree.

333
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:21,877
We're just going to fix those while we're here.

334
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:28,619
And so the school committee designating the individual as the, I just want to scratch that entirely.

335
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,239
Yeah, I think we should delete it completely.

336
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:32,320
That doesn't make sense.

337
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Sorry, I thought I did, and it didn't.

338
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,340
Maybe go through.

339
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:37,821
All right.

340
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:44,061
All right, I'll worry about that later.

341
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:52,684
Great, so next we have the national guidelines, excuse me, nutrition guidelines.

342
00:35:55,864 --> 00:36:01,346
I feel like that should go in the food service sub-policy, so it doesn't belong here.

343
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:08,808
So what I'm gonna do is just literally have nutrition,

344
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:34,192
And we will add that when we develop that and not take that up right now.

345
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:36,653
Does that sound good?

346
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:40,515
Yes.

347
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,495
Are you going to delete it from this document?

348
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,396
Yes.

349
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:44,276
Great.

350
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:46,457
Well, yes, I am.

351
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:48,498
Okay.

352
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:55,121
You know, I find it so interesting that there's nutrition guidelines, but then there's nutrition and physical education and it's like,

353
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,453
Is it called nutrition and physical education nowadays or is it like dietary?

354
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,154
Like, is it, are we still using the word nutrition?

355
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:04,916
Is that not up to date on that stuff?

356
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,157
I would say it's health and wellness.

357
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:07,818
Yeah.

358
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:16,184
Health and wellness are, yeah.

359
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:23,389
And then we can still call it that so that we, um,

360
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:27,984
Does anything on sexuality education need to be in there?

361
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:30,605
Oh God, yes, but.

362
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:31,706
No.

363
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,468
Because nobody is touching it with a 10 foot pole.

364
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:38,729
No, I could interject.

365
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:41,590
I I think that it's curriculum, right?

366
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,050
That's curriculum focused and.

367
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:47,672
You know it wouldn't necessarily be here.

368
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:53,415
Anyway, yeah, I mean because because it's curriculum we we don't have authority over it anyway.

369
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:56,538
Yeah, there's something in here about it.

370
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:10,590
Maybe it was a different, I've read so many different policies from other districts that my head has been filled up.

371
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:15,053
So let's just skip that one for now.

372
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,856
So this nutrition education, it's interesting that they're,

373
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:23,748
recommendation is actually like, we can't use this language.

374
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:26,829
This is like, hey, maybe you want to consider some of these goals.

375
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:35,592
And so I'm a little bit confused on this one, because we just want all of this stuff, right?

376
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:43,234
Isn't this a bit, I mean, I don't know what to do with this section here.

377
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:48,936
I am going to drop in what Linfield

378
00:38:49,716 --> 00:39:02,260
has in their policy, I think it's like really brief and sufficient.

379
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:14,083
Yeah, because in the heat cap, we've talked a lot about nutrition and diet and culturally appropriate ways of teaching that kind of stuff.

380
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:18,145
And so I would be a little uncomfortable with being prescriptive in this.

381
00:39:20,629 --> 00:39:27,915
Do any of the educators here have, I mean, nutrition is integrated into health curriculum and core curriculum.

382
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:29,316
Like, yeah.

383
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:32,098
I just don't know.

384
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:37,862
Getting back to like our bullying policy, like we took it from this giant thing and made it a lot smaller.

385
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:47,409
And if we want people to read the policies, they cannot go on and on about stuff that is irrelevant to knowing what we are expecting.

386
00:39:49,201 --> 00:40:00,669
So if we just look at what I forwarded over, Medford strives to provide nutrition education at all grade levels by integrating it into other subjects and having it as part of health education.

387
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:09,255
Students will gain the knowledge and skills to select a diet that supports health and reduces the risk of illness and future chronic diseases in accordance with state standards.

388
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:11,377
Like, do we need to say anything more than that?

389
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:14,619
I don't think so.

390
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:18,702
Anybody?

391
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:20,418
I also want to comment on that.

392
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:21,939
All right.

393
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:25,142
No, I think that captures it in terms of health education K to 12.

394
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:33,670
I get color.

395
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,853
Thank you.

396
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:38,315
All right.

397
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:40,677
Physical education, we have.

398
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,520
OK, so this is where.

399
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:54,661
Let's just do the physical education because it is the last section, and then we'll go and add them will get to the point of why we're here recess.

400
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:01,681
Because physical education activities to me has nothing to do with recess.

401
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,503
So let's get that through.

402
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:08,024
And Jenny, are you going to pop in what Linfield has?

403
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,525
Yeah.

404
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:16,828
So they do commingle recess a fair bit into this policy, into this piece, which I don't think we should do.

405
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:26,173
But they do describe physical activity and physical education

406
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:37,176
as well, hold on one second, as well as health education.

407
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:43,118
So that's like a whole separate topic, but they talk about physical activity and physical education.

408
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:53,762
And I just think maybe we might like to use this more as like a suggestion.

409
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:56,563
So let me, I'm gonna drop it right after nutrition.

410
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:07,061
I think that clarifies the difference between the class and general activity opportunities throughout the school day.

411
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:16,410
Yeah, I like that physical activity being really separated like that.

412
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,531
just fixed all the LPSs.

413
00:42:29,932 --> 00:42:39,179
So physical activity, it basically says, we shall provide a physical and social environment that encourages safe and enjoyable activities for all students.

414
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:39,999
Great.

415
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:50,446
Classroom teachers shall be encouraged in supporting their efforts to incorporate movement as part of classroom activities to provide short physical activity breaks between lessons and classes.

416
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:58,235
This one is sort of like starts to get a little bit murky because it starts to talk about recess.

417
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:05,860
So maybe for clarity, we just say we prohibit the use of withholding of physical activity as a punishment.

418
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:10,363
And like, we deal with like the recess aspects of this in the recess policy.

419
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:18,789
And then I would take out four and five completely

420
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:21,301
because they're about recess.

421
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,604
So that can be dealt with in the recess policy.

422
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:33,839
And then if you keep going, six, all students grade K to 12 will participate in sequential developmentally appropriate physical education.

423
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:45,247
Consistent with Massachusetts curriculum frameworks, the physical education program will promote the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to foster lifelong enjoyment and participation of physical activity for wellness.

424
00:43:46,548 --> 00:43:51,953
MPS will encourage relationships between families and community members to institute programs that support physical activity.

425
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:55,496
I don't exactly think I know what that means, but

426
00:43:56,778 --> 00:44:00,480
It doesn't like strike me significantly one way or the other.

427
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,443
Well, it does make it longer for no reason.

428
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:08,785
Fair.

429
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:20,453
Encourage family and community members to institute programs that support physical activities such as promoting safe routes to school program for those students that live within a walkable, bikeable distance to school.

430
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:22,834
I actually think that is useful.

431
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:30,683
Afterschool programs will be encouraged to provide options that provide developmentally appropriate physical activity for students.

432
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:34,244
I think that's reasonable and consistent with what we try to do.

433
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:46,226
MPS will encourage the offering of opportunities for students to participate in physical activity before and after the school day through a variety of methods.

434
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:54,248
I feel like that sounds great, but it doesn't need to be in policy.

435
00:44:55,632 --> 00:45:02,156
No, and it's also, it's been covered already.

436
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:04,757
Yeah, exactly.

437
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:05,738
I think I'd get rid of 11.

438
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:07,999
Okay, I agree.

439
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,763
So four and five, I'm just going to go to the bottom of this and put it in the same document.

440
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,461
as things we want to incorporate into there.

441
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:34,670
I like that, you know, we just use the word recess and then the policy can hyperlink over to the recess policy instead of everywhere we use the word, we painfully define it.

442
00:45:36,051 --> 00:45:46,358
So- Could we, I don't know where this is ending or how this is going, but I would like to just talk about the wording in number three.

443
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,852
because I find the use of prohibit quite strong.

444
00:45:50,892 --> 00:46:07,602
And there are situations in which if a student is exhibiting unsafe behavior or if a student has, I think there are situations in which physical, I don't like the word prohibit and I don't like the word punishment.

445
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:13,446
And so I think there are times that logical consequences do involve

446
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:19,663
that students are not participating in a physical activity because that is the manner in which they have been physical.

447
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:33,147
And I know we don't have many principals on this call, but I think that I'd like to have a discussion about the language that's used to describe number three and maybe what the goal and intent of number three is.

448
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:42,550
I guess I want to make sure that we do have like recess should not be taken away by

449
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:50,800
as a consequence, because unless the behavior is happening at recess, it's not relevant.

450
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:52,521
But that's my point.

451
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:54,704
So what if the recess is happening?

452
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:57,126
What if the behavior is happening at recess?

453
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:03,813
But taking a like, we need a different behavioral strategy than removal of recess.

454
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:07,596
And like walking recesses, public shaming.

455
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,138
And there's like,

456
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:25,808
I think we need to have a better way of helping address the behaviors that come up at recess, like the collaborative problem solving model, which would be like, you're having difficulty doing blah, blah, blah, what's going on, and figuring out what the actual problem is, because taking away recess isn't actually teaching a kid anything.

457
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,930
But I'm talking about in the moment.

458
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:34,353
So unsafe behavior cannot continue where it may impact other students.

459
00:47:34,733 --> 00:47:36,675
So there are, I just don't want to have,

460
00:47:39,545 --> 00:48:00,398
agree with you, because I completely agree with the logical consequence piece, and you need that processing with students, but in the moment, if you have to keep that child and others safe, then there are going to be moments when that is the logical consequence, because it's happening within the moment.

461
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:04,461
Ms.

462
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:06,502
Glucy, if I can also, oh, sorry.

463
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:07,703
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

464
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:22,861
I'm sorry, I'm, I can't see the screen because I'm in my car so I'm sorry if I spoke over somebody, but I just wanted to kind of echo what Miss Lucy was saying and the fact that with the responsive classroom model and logical consequences.

465
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:27,767
Those would be the examples that I would say you know if there was a student who was

466
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:39,394
very physically aggressive outside and it was unsafe, there would be the logical consequence right then and there to miss a few minutes of the recess to have a conversation with the teacher.

467
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:46,879
And then, you know, depending on if they were able to regulate and go back into play, they could, it wouldn't be something that

468
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:54,261
is a practice that we decide in class that we are not going to send them to.

469
00:48:54,441 --> 00:49:06,185
So I just want to make sure that if this is something that we were going to look to create a policy right here and right today, I would strongly encourage that maybe we get just to kind of extend it just a little bit.

470
00:49:06,365 --> 00:49:13,267
I'd be more than happy to like sit with some of the stakeholders and talk about what this looks like in that before we get into using

471
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:25,443
the word prohibit, because I think that in the elementary world, there's logical consequences that we are striving to have teachable moments in, and I think that would take that ability away from us.

472
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:27,603
Thank you.

473
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:28,223
Who's speaking?

474
00:49:28,283 --> 00:49:28,524
Sorry.

475
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:30,864
I'm sorry.

476
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:31,724
This is Shannon Demos.

477
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,145
I'm the principal at the Brooks Elementary.

478
00:49:33,165 --> 00:49:35,185
I thought so, but I just wanted to be sure.

479
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:36,025
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:36,345
Sorry.

481
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:36,805
I don't know.

482
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:40,046
I think I might come up as my husband's phone on the car.

483
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:40,406
Sorry.

484
00:49:40,426 --> 00:49:42,107
I have his car today.

485
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:42,767
Yep.

486
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,200
Mr Tucci has his hand in the air to.

487
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,522
I good afternoon everybody.

488
00:49:49,123 --> 00:50:02,778
I just like to acknowledge the fact that you know oftentimes sometimes we do come into play where we employ a lot of restorative practices in during the recess time frame to be able to have mediations between students and have conversations between students to be able to work out conflict.

489
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:04,860
and issues that may arise.

490
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:20,316
This time is a unique time that allows a person like myself and my assistant principal to be able to pull impacted students and be able to do the work that needs to be done in a restorative fashion to be able to help resolve and capture appropriate teachable messages while not impacting class time.

491
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:25,557
which is obviously very impactful and important time that we really try to savor.

492
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:38,861
Oftentimes, this might be done for a portion of recess, and then we do try to push the students back into giving them an opportunity to be able to get some exercise, get some fresh air and socialization with peers, but after we feel like we've done our work that needs to be done.

493
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:44,182
So I do want to acknowledge that, that that's something that oftentimes does happen in many different ways.

494
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:49,744
And I know we've made a big push to be able to, you know, move in the direction of moving towards more restorative practices.

495
00:50:49,944 --> 00:50:56,846
And that's where I've seen us be able to make some really good headway in the past couple of years.

496
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:08,189
So I feel like we're like, you know, diving fast into the recess policy here, but I wonder if like for the purposes of like this physical activity section,

497
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:14,146
Could we remove this bullet completely in its entirety?

498
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:17,793
Because we have to get there as it relates to recess.

499
00:51:19,113 --> 00:51:23,954
in the recess policy, which is to me the more appropriate place for us to talk about this.

500
00:51:24,074 --> 00:51:44,861
But I will also say I've heard lots of stories about logical consequences being used to like completely inappropriately and not necessarily here in Medford, but just as a general statement as like there's complete justification for taking recess away because I told them that that's what was going to happen.

501
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:47,662
you know, do whatever it was.

502
00:51:48,043 --> 00:52:01,894
So I think we have to talk about that and like, you know, all the things, all the other things you guys are talking about, but I don't think like we have to get spun up in this part of the policy.

503
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,438
Really, that's just my take.

504
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:14,184
Yeah, I think, you know, the concept of logical consequences is not logical.

505
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:17,023
I say I'm going to do something.

506
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:17,843
Well, it can be.

507
00:52:18,983 --> 00:52:19,524
It can be.

508
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:28,308
But if I say I'm going to do something, if you do that, it is not logical that I punish you the way I said I was going to punish you.

509
00:52:28,748 --> 00:52:29,668
That's not the logic.

510
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:35,671
The logic is that the thing you did is related to the punishment, not because I said so.

511
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:42,514
And I think, I mean, I don't know if this is a professional development issue or what, but, you know,

512
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:53,122
The example of, that we were just discussing, like we're in recess, there's a behavior that requires remediation of some way that just can't continue as is.

513
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:59,647
That isn't, in my mind, the principal source of this conversation.

514
00:52:59,787 --> 00:53:04,691
It is, you didn't do your homework, so you're going to sit in class during recess and do your homework.

515
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:09,214
And even if you told the kids that's what you're going to do, that's not a logical consequence.

516
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,412
you know, those are the kinds of things that I have heard of, and I have heard of them in Medford.

517
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:24,095
Now, I don't have elementary kids anymore, so I can't speak to the last couple of years, especially during the pandemic.

518
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:40,622
But, you know, that sort of was the motivation for this entire policy coming here around recess was that it was, you know, some teachers were more willing to just take recess away for reasons that

519
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:44,325
They're not that they weren't valid reasons to have a consequence.

520
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:45,906
That is not what I'm suggesting.

521
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:57,394
I'm just saying that the consequence wasn't related to recess and leads, you know, the research, which we are not going to go through again today, is clear.

522
00:53:57,474 --> 00:54:03,599
Like, literally, you know, you're biting your nose to spite your face, whatever that saying is.

523
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:04,019
I'm sorry.

524
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:04,739
I'm terrible with those.

525
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:12,351
it doesn't have the consequence that anybody actually wanted, not to mention the consequence on the kids.

526
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:24,096
So I'm fine with moving this entire part to the recess conversation and policy, which will be a sub-policy, just so we can keep moving.

527
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:27,837
Agree.

528
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,238
All right.

529
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:34,300
I think this physical activity section looks digestible and reasonable now.

530
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:38,396
if we accept those changes.

531
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:56,284
I will remember those when we're all not staring at the screen together, because I don't know what that just did.

532
00:54:57,704 --> 00:55:01,986
Anyways, all right, so thank you.

533
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:09,429
So the next section is the, did anybody else have anything they wanted to say?

534
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:12,350
I didn't mean to like, just like rush through that.

535
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:19,633
I just feel like since we're taking a whole new policy to start from scratch, time isn't our friend.

536
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:32,579
I think the adjustments moving those other specific indicators to the next policy that that, you know, I just was in complete agreement with that.

537
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:35,313
Mr. Ducci?

538
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:47,763
My only piece of feedback or more of a question might be, is this a place where we do need to note our athletics programming that is offered at the Medford Public Schools as a part of this physical activity and physical education component here?

539
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:51,706
Could you think through that?

540
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:54,068
Because I hadn't thought about it.

541
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:59,893
I don't know.

542
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:02,175
I feel like athletics, I just worry about

543
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:07,054
pulling that, partially because I know so little about athletics, I'll be honest.

544
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:20,506
But I think the athletics, meaning not during the school day athletics, is one of those areas where it's like, what is a school activity?

545
00:56:20,566 --> 00:56:21,406
What is not?

546
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:24,969
Where are rules and authority go?

547
00:56:25,029 --> 00:56:27,251
I just get sort of, frankly, a little confused.

548
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:30,574
Okay, Amber Graham's gonna

549
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:36,162
solve it.

550
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,823
I don't know, Mr. G, are you able to see the screen?

551
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:50,305
I am, and you know, I just want to make sure we celebrate this and, you know, acknowledge the fact that, you know, we have a very strong athletics program that is with the MMIA, as what Jenny is writing here.

552
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,866
So I think that's, that'll capture it.

553
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:53,246
Thank you.

554
00:56:54,186 --> 00:57:01,988
And I don't want to complicate things, but I think there was one that we did eliminate that referenced, like clubs, because I think there's also a lot of

555
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:07,601
after school clubs that also encourage physical activity.

556
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,103
I know several schools have girls on the run.

557
00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:17,811
I'm sure Mr. Tucci could speak to some other beyond just the athletics program, just after school clubs.

558
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:19,762
Absolutely.

559
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:26,288
There's volleyball club at the middle school level, indoor soccer club in the wintertime that aren't encapsulated in the athletics program.

560
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:34,197
So to put, um, you know, athletics program, as well as other extracurricular type of activities like clubbing, uh, activities is appropriate.

561
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:45,377
I just added the word extracurricular to number six, because when I read afterschool, I've sort of been drilled into my brain that we mean the K to five afterschool program.

562
00:57:48,259 --> 00:57:49,940
Lots of other things happen after school too.

563
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,162
So I just added an extracurricular activities, number six.

564
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:59,386
And then I basically put a number seven that references like applicable MIA guidelines.

565
00:58:01,107 --> 00:58:05,190
And for number seven, do we also want to say slash GVL

566
00:58:05,745 --> 00:58:09,867
guidelines, because that's not part of MIAA, right?

567
00:58:10,507 --> 00:58:14,790
I think they're subject to MIAA guidelines, right, Dr. Cushing?

568
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:15,630
That is correct.

569
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:24,995
So I would see MIAA as the state governing authority where the GBL is subservient to those regulations.

570
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:26,655
Perfect.

571
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:27,296
Less is more.

572
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:28,296
Thank you.

573
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:31,358
All right.

574
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:33,379
Let's move on.

575
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,602
Sorry, I'm not used to raising my hand.

576
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:39,903
Do we need to include the ADA there?

577
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:46,327
Because right now they're not compliant with the ADA or the 504 guidelines.

578
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:50,869
In terms of inclusion for kids with disabilities, right now they're excluded.

579
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,470
Unless, yeah.

580
00:58:55,332 --> 00:59:04,377
So like kids with physical disabilities are not currently participating in no-cut sports and kids with developmental disabilities are excluded from after-school programs.

581
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:12,477
because they're not getting the support that they need or not allowed to come to PTO sponsored activities, even though they received substantial support from the school.

582
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:23,703
So, which is a whole separate conversation, but if we're including that the athletics program should comply with things, then maybe they should comply with civil rights laws.

583
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:25,584
Yeah.

584
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:33,588
I mean, well, PTO stuff is like a super sticky wicket because we have no authority

585
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:39,675
over the PTOs.

586
00:59:39,975 --> 00:59:43,897
They still have to comply because they're receiving substantial support from a federally funded agency.

587
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,318
The PTOs are?

588
00:59:47,698 --> 00:59:50,119
Well, yeah, because they wouldn't exist if not for the school.

589
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:54,421
So they would not pass the test of being able to say, sorry, we can discriminate against kids with disabilities.

590
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:57,422
I don't mean to derail this conversation.

591
00:59:57,442 --> 01:00:04,365
Just if you're saying that they need to apply with particular guidelines, then we should also include that.

592
01:00:06,787 --> 01:00:26,961
So I guess my take is that the MIAA guidelines, Dr. Cushing, correct me if I'm wrong, would lay out guidelines that are consistent with federal regulations.

593
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:29,521
Is that?

594
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:30,222
You're correct.

595
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:30,883
You're correct.

596
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:39,591
I'd hesitate on putting any language in on that right now until we can do some further research just to be 100% accurate.

597
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:47,418
So if that could be put at the bottom, similar to how some other things were, I think that's a good thing to research between now and the next meeting.

598
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:50,220
Great.

599
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:51,321
Yeah.

600
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:54,845
Can we just maybe put a comment for six and seven?

601
01:00:55,754 --> 01:01:09,048
around whether there's something there that can describe consistent application of

602
01:01:12,267 --> 01:01:12,747
guidelines.

603
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:22,050
And I just wanted to interject that we are following the MIA guidelines and that's approved by the state.

604
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,611
And I understand that as a district, we have been making a commitment.

605
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:37,034
We have started many other districts aren't doing it, but we have the unified sports that Medford is doing and participating with

606
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:47,826
Maldon and a few other districts that are taking the lead and creating inclusive opportunities for our students of all different abilities.

607
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:54,674
So I do want to go on the record of saying that it might not be the, you know,

608
01:01:56,277 --> 01:02:08,115
The GBL events but as a district we are prioritizing our students of different abilities and our unified sports program is an example of that.

609
01:02:08,716 --> 01:02:11,060
And today we're kicking off.

610
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:15,703
the basketball at the high school level.

611
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:22,266
It's at the secondary level, but we are attempting to be an inclusive community.

612
01:02:22,346 --> 01:02:26,168
So I just wanted to comment for the committee.

613
01:02:26,448 --> 01:02:26,808
Thank you.

614
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:35,232
And Shanine, I think your points are well taken.

615
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:38,834
And I think we just probably all need a minute to figure out

616
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:48,250
what policy issues we need to solve and reflect here versus what you are describing.

617
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:53,891
I'm not as familiar with the instances that you're talking about, but that's just because I'm not as familiar.

618
01:02:53,951 --> 01:03:03,853
So I don't feel like I know how to fix the policy today.

619
01:03:04,773 --> 01:03:05,613
But yeah, I agree.

620
01:03:05,673 --> 01:03:08,694
We should make sure that we're being clear about that as well.

621
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:12,812
Okay.

622
01:03:14,153 --> 01:03:16,595
I'd like to welcome Member McLaughlin, who has just joined us.

623
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:17,015
Hello.

624
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:22,819
Am I unmuted?

625
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:23,119
I am.

626
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:23,380
Good.

627
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,720
Okay.

628
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,743
So... Hello.

629
01:03:27,843 --> 01:03:28,123
Sorry.

630
01:03:28,143 --> 01:03:29,063
I didn't know if I could unmute.

631
01:03:29,164 --> 01:03:30,184
It wasn't working for a moment.

632
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:30,705
Thank you.

633
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:32,286
I was presenting on disability awareness.

634
01:03:32,326 --> 01:03:32,906
My apologies.

635
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:34,567
No worries.

636
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:36,148
So...

637
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,772
We are on B, physical education.

638
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:47,454
So just a super one minute, what we've been doing.

639
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,415
We looked at the current policy.

640
01:03:50,776 --> 01:03:54,477
It is sort of like the bullying policy, could not be resuscitated.

641
01:03:55,158 --> 01:03:59,260
And so we had gone to the model language from MASC.

642
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:02,492
and we have been making modifications from there.

643
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:14,576
And sort of like the bullying policy, our wellness policy looked frankly a lot like something that may have been created the day that the law somewhere was passed or something.

644
01:04:14,596 --> 01:04:16,397
It wasn't really a policy.

645
01:04:16,877 --> 01:04:26,881
So we are now working our way through that model language and incorporating changes from

646
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:31,845
other districts that looked good, rather than writing from scratch.

647
01:04:32,805 --> 01:04:35,607
So we are on to the physical education section.

648
01:04:35,627 --> 01:04:56,921
So I'm looking at the amount of time, physical education, we required subject in K to 12.

649
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:02,093
Elementary 75 minutes per week, full year, middle 90 minutes per week.

650
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:09,919
I don't think this is how we do it though, because we, no, I didn't think so.

651
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,260
This is from Winfield.

652
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:24,891
So I think my question is what is the right description of our timeframes and do they need to be reflected in policy at all?

653
01:05:27,964 --> 01:05:44,975
Yeah, I mean, I'll let those hands up and speak in a moment, but my preference around this is to, you know, after number one, you know, comma in compliance with state requirements or something along those lines, because those do change.

654
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,296
I know there's a health curriculum.

655
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:53,404
update coming down that we have to redo this policy just because they've said no, not 20 minutes, you need 21.

656
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:57,086
But that's just my take on it.

657
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:00,808
I don't know whose hand went up first, but I'll go with Mr. Tucci.

658
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:03,609
Just a comment on the middle school.

659
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:06,171
Middle school is 90 minutes per week as well here in Medford.

660
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:12,414
If we were to add recess, it would add an additional 100 minutes because students on average get 20 minutes of recess each day.

661
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:32,707
Oh, and thank you and Dr. Cushing.

662
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:53,560
Yep, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak just real quick, I would like to, again, take this back to our phys ed and health director, Rachel Perry, to make sure that she goes through this, and I know that one of the things that we were slightly disappointed in was with the new standards that were just approved by the

663
01:06:54,153 --> 01:07:01,936
Board of Elementary and Secondary Education that the physical education standards really were not enhanced as the health standards were.

664
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:06,237
So it's not that we're working towards the national health standards.

665
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,518
I know that those are the standards we're implementing.

666
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:11,519
So I'd really like to take this back to her.

667
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:20,622
So I think that she and her teachers might be able to offer some really good insight on language changes here to be the best applicable.

668
01:07:24,192 --> 01:07:24,912
Great, thank you.

669
01:07:25,612 --> 01:07:28,833
What are you material reductions in total minutes per week?

670
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:32,493
Oh, okay.

671
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,514
Member McLaughlin.

672
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:35,834
Sorry.

673
01:07:35,874 --> 01:07:36,974
Yeah, go ahead, sorry.

674
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,435
Can someone hear me?

675
01:07:44,736 --> 01:07:48,516
I'm reading my... One second.

676
01:07:48,556 --> 01:07:52,997
Member McLaughlin, you broke up hardcore when you were just speaking.

677
01:07:54,870 --> 01:08:02,593
Oh, I said, can someone let me rename myself, please?

678
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:04,794
The chat is disabled.

679
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:08,275
Sure.

680
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:09,676
Dr. Cushing, could you do that?

681
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:10,836
I'll put it in the chat.

682
01:08:12,097 --> 01:08:12,497
Thank you.

683
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,158
Dr. Cushing, I think you'll have to do that.

684
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:15,978
Thank you.

685
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:16,458
Oh, there you are.

686
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:17,198
It clears the bell now.

687
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:21,300
Great.

688
01:08:23,715 --> 01:08:24,340
Did you do that?

689
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:32,669
So what I just did in the language was remove the number of minutes from policy.

690
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:43,576
And in that first bullet, as you were describing, talk about like, that we will obviously comply at minimum with the state approved frameworks.

691
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:55,765
But I also added a line which I'm totally open to discussion about that, if for some reason the district is gonna materially change the amount of minutes of physical education, that that would,

692
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:17,412
be something that would come to the school committee for approval, because if we're gonna reduce the amount of physical activity going on, I feel like that is worthy of a discussion, even though we're not laying out some hard amount of time that we're binding the district to in the policy.

693
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:22,394
Yeah, I happen to like that because, yeah,

694
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:29,939
nothing being done wrong here, but we will, as school committee members, hear from parents if this happens.

695
01:09:30,019 --> 01:09:34,842
So I would, if we can get ahead of it, that's always a good thing.

696
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:36,302
Dr. Cushing?

697
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:47,949
Yeah, so I just wanted to say that, you know, I think that offers the flexibility still, and we would definitely notify the committee, but there are some opportunities to,

698
01:09:50,399 --> 01:10:01,647
you know, take physical education from, say, being two times per week and, you know, physical education is really focused on curriculum, not just the minutes of activity.

699
01:10:01,927 --> 01:10:09,092
Physical education should not be seen as a student's, a child's only outlet for physical activity during the week.

700
01:10:09,132 --> 01:10:10,713
It should be a curriculum focused

701
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:37,202
opportunity to build a lifelong love of physical activity and there may be room to say schedule you know things on the quarter where you'll go for 45 days straight and then you'll switch up and you'll go to other unified arts but just allowing us the scheduling flexibility which would still meet the state standards and would probably actually expand the amount of time available to students when you think about two times over the course of a year.

702
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,350
just something to consider.

703
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:47,713
It's not really necessary now, but I don't want to limit the flexibility as we really look at improving scheduling in our middle schools.

704
01:10:49,694 --> 01:11:00,697
So I just suggested a change that says like the material reductions in total minutes per year of physical education is what would require school committee approval.

705
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,398
So if we're going to

706
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:16,161
you know, that would sort of give us some like leeway on the scheduling piece, but not, but still like require that if somebody was like, we're going to cut phys ed in half, that that conversation can be had with the school committee.

707
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:18,882
It sounds good to me.

708
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:28,468
Looking at the suggested changes, I don't see any reason to not accept those unless anybody else does.

709
01:11:29,816 --> 01:11:33,259
I did have a question about this number four.

710
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:34,500
Again, this is from Linfield.

711
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:43,488
Waivers, exemptions and substitutions for physical education will not be granted except to meet a student's medical or social emotional needs.

712
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:55,078
I guess what I would rather talk about is like,

713
01:11:56,343 --> 01:12:10,350
the process for waivers, exemptions and substitutions so that they are consistently applied versus like this.

714
01:12:12,892 --> 01:12:25,218
If I can just jump in, this is a very strange, I mean, this means like a senior who doesn't have enough physical education and is in a car accident, we're not gonna let them graduate.

715
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:26,956
That's what this says.

716
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:29,498
Well, that would be a medical need, I suppose.

717
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:30,819
What?

718
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:31,200
No.

719
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,761
Oh, it says except to.

720
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:33,282
I'm sorry.

721
01:12:33,302 --> 01:12:34,463
I thought it meant include.

722
01:12:35,664 --> 01:12:36,224
Oh, no.

723
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:38,166
OK.

724
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,772
But this to me, it feels like it's really getting at how.

725
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:49,363
Many of our students on IEPs, frankly, do miss an awful lot of things.

726
01:12:49,944 --> 01:12:51,385
I don't know if PE is among them.

727
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:52,026
I think it is.

728
01:12:52,046 --> 01:13:03,436
I know it is from my own child's experience that health curriculum just didn't get taught because there were only so many hours a day and so many services that needed to be done.

729
01:13:04,837 --> 01:13:06,799
I'm wondering if that's not what the point of this is.

730
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:12,580
I would also wonder very much like, so how does Linfield manage it then?

731
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,903
Like, you can't not give a kid reading services because they need health education.

732
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:25,888
Well, this is just, Ed, this is just physical education section.

733
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:33,693
This isn't talking about health education.

734
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:35,134
Remember, sorry.

735
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:44,121
Go ahead, you froze and we can't hear you.

736
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:52,508
I'm gonna stop your video to see if that helps.

737
01:13:52,528 --> 01:14:03,297
Sarah McLaughlin, can you hear us?

738
01:14:03,337 --> 01:14:08,982
Yeah, and also to that point, you can't not give a child physical education because they need one.

739
01:14:10,728 --> 01:14:10,908
Yeah.

740
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:14,053
Can you hear me now?

741
01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:15,214
I just heard what you just said, yes.

742
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:18,118
Yeah, you can't hear me?

743
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:19,981
That's better.

744
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:23,285
We can hear you.

745
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:24,006
You can hear me now?

746
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:25,588
Yes.

747
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:25,769
Yes.

748
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:30,956
Yeah, that was all just delayed because I said whatever you guys heard like two minutes ago.

749
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:31,856
So that's weird.

750
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:33,917
But anyway, can you hear me now?

751
01:14:34,698 --> 01:14:45,543
No, and I was just going to say, and to your point, like you said something about a child can't, you know, miss reading, you know, supports because they are required to have phys ed.

752
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:46,183
And I would say,

753
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,168
And the converse of that, the child can't miss phys ed because they have to have reading support.

754
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:54,350
So it's like the curriculum is required for both.

755
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:59,072
So it's not just that this is where you miss gym because you have to have reading sports.

756
01:14:59,112 --> 01:15:02,293
That's also not how it works, just saying.

757
01:15:02,313 --> 01:15:04,014
Right.

758
01:15:11,685 --> 01:15:18,031
So maybe that's what this is getting after, but it doesn't really say that.

759
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:19,632
It doesn't.

760
01:15:19,652 --> 01:15:27,879
And I think my concern is with the word waiver, because that's a school policy, like a school-based, school-level policy.

761
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:33,824
I understand if the intent is around

762
01:15:38,846 --> 01:15:44,690
opportunity and access, but I just, I have a concern with the use of the word waiver.

763
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:53,415
Or even substitutions, like, I don't even know what that would entail for us.

764
01:15:55,696 --> 01:16:01,200
Like, does that mean I... It could mean PT, like if people are doing physical therapy.

765
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:18,136
But I mean, when I read this, like if a student has, well, social emotional needs, like if their IEP had something about that was a social emotional need.

766
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,958
They cannot go to gym class.

767
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,620
Right, then that would be acceptable.

768
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,942
But I just, I don't know what this is getting at.

769
01:16:27,562 --> 01:16:35,568
And I just don't know what this is getting at because it's very, very,

770
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:44,009
watered down if the real issue here is we need our students on IEPs to get this education like everybody else.

771
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:46,252
Like, you should just say that.

772
01:16:46,713 --> 01:16:53,322
Instead, it's this like murky thing that isn't even addressing that issue at all.

773
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:14,565
I think what it's saying is that, I think it is soft in terms of what it's saying, but what it's saying is that everyone is required to take physical education unless you have an exemption, is really what it's saying.

774
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:20,248
And the exemption might be medical or social emotional, but that would be indicated on a IEP or 504.

775
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:24,190
So, physical education is a requirement unless there is,

776
01:17:26,576 --> 01:17:32,202
an exemption according to, you know, IDA or ADA, that would be it, you know.

777
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:41,771
I just insert that I think number four actually says that, and I think you should delete number three.

778
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:51,023
because well, number may I for a moment, sorry, member Rousseau.

779
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:58,129
Number four says that in a very all encompassing way, and it does, but it doesn't address when some students aren't able to go to the gym class.

780
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:07,156
So that says all students, regardless of their ability, which is that's wording I would not want, but regardless of their ability are integrated into physical education classes throughout the district.

781
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,260
are integrated, perhaps, but what does that look like?

782
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:24,867
So some students might not be able to go into the physical education class, for example, if the gym has a lot of audio echoing and there's a lot of issues with, you know, sensitivity to, you know, noise or sound or something like that, which some children have that.

783
01:18:25,428 --> 01:18:29,530
So, um, I think it's not eliminating three and keeping four.

784
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,791
I think it might be an integration of three and four.

785
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:50,204
Yeah, I would just say that, you know, I actually think three and four mixed together makes sense because this is policy.

786
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:52,646
It's not supposed to be like, hey, do whatever you want.

787
01:18:52,926 --> 01:18:54,188
And what's the point of the policy?

788
01:18:54,708 --> 01:19:01,133
So, you know, wait, before we do that, I actually think they should be separate.

789
01:19:02,114 --> 01:19:24,330
And I think that because there's a difference between a waiver, an exemption, or a substitution, whatever those things are, that is like specifically requested by a student or caregiver, and that there should be a process to vet those, whether it's like in accordance with an IEP or 504,

790
01:19:27,748 --> 01:19:32,452
that's fine, but there probably are other reasons, right?

791
01:19:32,492 --> 01:19:37,357
Like, you know, student gets an accident, needs to not have gym class for six months, right?

792
01:19:37,777 --> 01:19:50,388
So I think what I'd like to see number three become is about that students and caregivers may request this and that those decisions will be made in accordance with

793
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:59,245
the 504s, IEPs or specific circumstances and who will, how do you do that?

794
01:19:59,325 --> 01:20:08,388
Like, that's what I would like to see number three become is like, if I need a waiver for my kid, how do I do that?

795
01:20:08,848 --> 01:20:10,428
Like, how does it happen?

796
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:15,430
And that that's the policy, that there is a process

797
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:39,884
in order for people that we have, we have a process in order for people to request a waiver, should they need it, to me is what three should become, which is to me also different than the inverse of that, which is the district saying, we don't have time to teach your kid physical education, which is a different problem.

798
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:45,667
So I feel like there's like, am I the caregiver requesting that or is the,

799
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:49,939
is the school district telling me that?

800
01:20:50,099 --> 01:20:54,101
And I think those are two different sort of needles to thread.

801
01:20:56,783 --> 01:20:57,643
Mr. Tucci.

802
01:20:58,704 --> 01:21:04,828
Yes, I wanted to provide some real world context to maybe a situation here at the middle school level.

803
01:21:04,988 --> 01:21:08,870
There are times where some students may be enrolled in orchestra or band.

804
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:16,235
And oftentimes when the addition of a couple of those classes are added to a student's schedule,

805
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:24,102
They may end up having one less physical education class because of the addition of those classes into their schedule.

806
01:21:24,503 --> 01:21:32,430
So I wanted to just provide that example of where I've seen this come into play at the middle school level.

807
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,692
Yeah, that was.

808
01:21:34,152 --> 01:21:34,312
Yes.

809
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:39,674
Yeah, I was going to say that's totally outside of the scope of both of these, which is really interesting.

810
01:21:40,054 --> 01:21:43,517
So that's an interesting point, you know, altogether different.

811
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:58,748
I just, I guess I was going to say for three, you know, what I'm hearing is instead of saying, you know, these things will not be granted, except I think what I'm hearing is that, you know, they can be great, you know, these things can be granted, maybe request.

812
01:21:58,768 --> 01:21:59,488
Yeah.

813
01:22:00,129 --> 01:22:00,329
You know,

814
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:08,416
instead of they cannot be, and the ambiguity around the other needs are interesting.

815
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:19,806
May be requested by students and caregivers, not just students and caregivers, students, caregivers, and staff, really, because it could be that the IEP team needs to do that, whatever.

816
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:23,863
I would say students, caregivers and staff.

817
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:27,124
But would staff be in the next bullet?

818
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:31,685
What I'm trying to do is distinguish like who is doing the asking.

819
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:34,866
Like if staff is doing the asking, then the district is doing the asking.

820
01:22:35,366 --> 01:22:42,567
Maybe requested to students and caregivers and will be granted except to meet a student.

821
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,048
Forget the word, get rid of except.

822
01:22:44,948 --> 01:22:45,748
Yeah, hold on one second.

823
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:16,554
I would say IEP 504 is common medical, you know, you know, doctor's notes, you know, and at the sole discretion so that you're incorporating those folks, like you said, that, you know, might have an injury, might have a whatever.

824
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:24,420
So I approved IEP 504 is, you know, medical common, you know, doctor's notes.

825
01:23:28,864 --> 01:23:31,686
And it's not at the sole discretion of the director of physical education.

826
01:23:32,523 --> 01:23:37,665
because if it's an IEP or 504, the director of physical education doesn't have a say or a medical note.

827
01:23:38,085 --> 01:23:42,866
So in accordance with approved IEPs and 504s, that's one like category.

828
01:23:42,886 --> 01:23:44,106
504, right?

829
01:23:44,627 --> 01:23:45,507
That's one category.

830
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:51,108
Or at the discretion of the director of physical, yeah.

831
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:59,971
Or at the discretion of the director of physical education, which in my mind would include like the medical note situation.

832
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:03,079
like that still has to go to somebody, right?

833
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:04,900
It still has to be approved by somebody.

834
01:24:05,821 --> 01:24:16,686
Yeah, that's more specific.

835
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:25,050
I respectfully don't really think it belongs here because I also feel like this is specific to physical education.

836
01:24:25,575 --> 01:24:29,396
But there are situations in which this could apply to another UA class.

837
01:24:29,476 --> 01:24:35,899
And I just feel like we're going to be going down a rabbit hole or creating like a Pandora's box.

838
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:45,122
I think there are several situations and more than just physical education, there are different classes, there are different environments.

839
01:24:46,643 --> 01:24:49,524
Every student needs are taken into account.

840
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:55,226
And I think those situations are usually handled with the staff where it's needed, whether that's

841
01:24:56,273 --> 01:25:03,317
medical in its Avery Hines department, whether it's Joan Bowen, Stacey Shulman's department, principals are involved.

842
01:25:04,237 --> 01:25:09,680
I just worry that this is a little, I worry with this one.

843
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:16,984
I don't think it's appropriate for this policy because I think it's not specific to just physical education.

844
01:25:33,571 --> 01:25:35,572
I'm not really following exactly.

845
01:25:36,732 --> 01:25:48,656
I know at the high school, if you take the vocational rotation, you don't have the art requirements or the language requirements.

846
01:25:51,117 --> 01:25:54,038
I believe the principal has to sign off on those exemptions.

847
01:25:55,799 --> 01:26:01,021
But I think in this particular context of this policy, we're trying to lay down that

848
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:23,600
we really have expectations around being a physical education that, I mean, the- Well, member McLaughlin had said a little while ago something about it's the expectation that all students attend physical education, you know, except with exception or something along those lines.

849
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:28,842
I just think that this is the language that is being discussed here is very specific.

850
01:26:31,678 --> 01:26:39,300
And I think is going to, these situations can span outside of physical education.

851
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:46,482
I think if just to keep it simple, which the expectation of Medford Public Schools is that all students participate in physical education.

852
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:49,823
I think I'm understanding you now.

853
01:26:50,143 --> 01:26:53,624
I'm sorry, I'm a little slow there.

854
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:58,366
So like you're saying like exemptions to any kind of class.

855
01:26:58,666 --> 01:26:58,946
Yes.

856
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:02,351
that we should probably have a policy on that.

857
01:27:02,371 --> 01:27:05,132
I don't know if we do, but we perhaps don't.

858
01:27:05,572 --> 01:27:15,757
That really is more that, first of all, could be more specific in the language and take into account lots of different scenarios rather than trying to craft one sentence that somehow magically covers everything.

859
01:27:18,928 --> 01:27:30,293
And then the sort of the corollary to that is by putting this in here, we run the risk of having policies where in one policy the exemptions are done this way and another policy the exemptions are done that way.

860
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:33,255
And then we already have enough trouble with policy hygiene.

861
01:27:35,076 --> 01:27:37,677
I certainly, I sort of see that point.

862
01:27:38,777 --> 01:27:41,819
I think it just should be what our expectations are.

863
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:48,222
And our expectations are that every student K to 12 participates in physical education classes.

864
01:28:00,712 --> 01:28:01,974
I just changed bullet number one.

865
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:21,997
Yeah, I mean, I hear the argument there and that all students are expected to attend physical education.

866
01:28:22,017 --> 01:28:26,681
And and obviously our policy does not supersede the law.

867
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,142
Right.

868
01:28:27,222 --> 01:28:37,372
So so I think saying something to the effect of, you know, other than when, you know, the law indicates otherwise or something to that effect, because I think people need to understand that.

869
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:50,379
there are gonna be situations where you don't have to be specific about what the situations are, but, you know, reading this policy, I don't want somebody who's not an experienced staff member or somebody, whatever, you know, that's like, oh no, everybody has to take physical education.

870
01:28:50,819 --> 01:28:54,681
And they're not really understanding that actually, no, there are exceptions, right?

871
01:28:55,101 --> 01:29:07,848
So I think that we have to at least indicate, you know, this policy, you know, does not supersede, you know, whatever, IDA 504, any of those things, something, but people have to understand that, like,

872
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:10,526
Yeah, that there are exceptions.

873
01:29:10,786 --> 01:29:16,430
So I'm not sure that it has, how specific it has to be, but it has to be at least stated either in a disclaimer or something.

874
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:21,654
Cause we can't say, in my opinion, we can't say as a school committee, every student's required to take physical education.

875
01:29:22,515 --> 01:29:24,637
Every student's not required to take physical education.

876
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:31,341
You know, I think every student is entitled to physical education, you know, and there might be a requirement for graduation.

877
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:35,565
That's a different thing than, you know, every student is required to take it.

878
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:37,306
So I think we just have to be careful.

879
01:29:40,077 --> 01:29:41,838
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

880
01:29:43,058 --> 01:30:01,748
Yeah, my concern is creating a slippery slope where, you know, offering an exemption in one curricular area might lead to people seeking other exemptions for a variety of other reasons in other curricular areas that, you know, would not fall under opt-out normally.

881
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:29,791
and I really think something extraordinarily narrowly tailored because physical education is also not just about the physical activity piece, but it's also around healthy living, about hygiene standards, and a great many other things that I really don't want to go into right now, but I would really be concerned about a slippery slope of any type of an exemption and

882
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:34,308
you know, there are certain requirements to a curriculum.

883
01:30:36,488 --> 01:30:39,909
So yeah, I was just gonna add that.

884
01:30:40,029 --> 01:30:41,030
Sorry, go ahead.

885
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:48,932
I just updated number one, it says all students are entitled to physical education in grades K to 12, unless otherwise defined and approved.

886
01:30:50,123 --> 01:31:02,129
And in an approved IEP or 504, the amount of time will comply at minimum with state approved frameworks, material reductions in the total minutes per year to physical education shall be approved by the school committee.

887
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:03,810
And then we could get rid of three and four.

888
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:08,252
I would just, the word entitled there.

889
01:31:08,272 --> 01:31:11,674
I mean, they're entitled there.

890
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:15,076
IEP may say they don't have to take it, but they're still entitled to it.

891
01:31:17,461 --> 01:31:19,361
if there's a way to provide them with that.

892
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:28,283
So I think the word entitled becomes a problem there because, I mean, I think the point is made.

893
01:31:28,523 --> 01:31:35,164
I just don't think the word entitled, I mean, you have an entitlement or you don't, there's no exceptions to entitlements.

894
01:31:39,185 --> 01:31:42,665
So I don't know how to put that.

895
01:31:43,406 --> 01:31:45,246
I also just worry about, you know,

896
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:48,705
being as specific as an approved IEP or 504.

897
01:31:48,966 --> 01:32:00,572
I mean, there's the students whose family has had a horrible tragedy, or there's the homeless student who this isn't gonna work for, for some reason.

898
01:32:00,612 --> 01:32:12,859
To me, there are lots of things for which there may not be an IEP or 504 because maybe there's no family to provide the kind of supports to get that stuff rolling.

899
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:44,549
I don't know, I'm just concerned about putting required things that have to happen in order for a student to be excused from this, that just adds paperwork and a bunch of opportunity for students to, for instance, I'm not going, and then they just get asked, and then they become a dropout risk, and that's not a positive outcome.

900
01:32:45,529 --> 01:32:45,669
Ms.

901
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:45,909
Bowen?

902
01:32:47,549 --> 01:32:54,076
I was just gonna say the same thing but I wonder, because I don't want to pigeonhole us with the IP and the 504.

903
01:32:54,596 --> 01:33:06,028
I do think that we want to talk about the laws that regulate like ADA or IDA put that in there as opposed to 504 and IP because there are a lot of circumstances.

904
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:22,411
that don't involve students with disabilities who are not on 504s or have an IEP like a certain student might have surgery so it's just a wide range of things that may fall into this category so I would say you know whatever the

905
01:33:23,132 --> 01:33:26,093
The state regulations are LARAs and that covers it.

906
01:33:26,453 --> 01:33:36,636
And then when the situation does come up for students with disabilities or a student on a 504, then the parent caregivers have brought that to the team.

907
01:33:37,096 --> 01:33:48,179
And then they discuss it within the context of a meeting, you know, what that specific need may be that maybe they don't participate in gym, or maybe there's an alternative that the school

908
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:58,322
nurse or the director of physical education approves for that particular student and it's more on a case-by-case situation.

909
01:33:58,342 --> 01:34:05,625
So what about otherwise provided by law or regulation?

910
01:34:05,645 --> 01:34:08,386
I like remember McLaughlin.

911
01:34:09,486 --> 01:34:10,647
Yeah, I was just going to say,

912
01:34:12,273 --> 01:34:15,534
Yeah, I mean, I think obviously ID and ADA are important.

913
01:34:15,594 --> 01:34:26,539
I'm trying to back it up a little bit here and forgive me, like I said, I was presenting elsewhere, but is the idea that, so we know that physical education is required as a partially as a graduation requirement.

914
01:34:26,599 --> 01:34:30,641
Is this in addition to the graduation requirement that you guys are talking about?

915
01:34:30,901 --> 01:34:35,383
Because I'm not sure what the extension of this is like, where is our,

916
01:34:36,423 --> 01:34:59,709
latitude on this like there's obviously a requirement and the state has a requirement and the graduation requirement so how are we getting involved with this with policy i'm just a little i missed that part um i mean the the legal references are all down here i would have to um i actually had the other or is it

917
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:05,879
No, but maybe Maurice or Dr. Cushing or Ms.

918
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:09,742
Galussi know, like what is the requirement for physical education?

919
01:35:10,743 --> 01:35:11,524
Do you guys know?

920
01:35:12,825 --> 01:35:13,726
Can you see my screen?

921
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:14,687
Yeah.

922
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:17,189
Okay.

923
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:20,071
I never know when I share, if I'm just sharing the tab or the whole enchilada.

924
01:35:22,674 --> 01:35:27,778
So this is the current, this is the Massachusetts law, chapter 71 something, it's too small for me to read.

925
01:35:31,903 --> 01:35:33,484
It has to be taught in all grades.

926
01:35:34,845 --> 01:35:40,588
There's not a minimum time requirement?

927
01:35:42,368 --> 01:35:42,649
No.

928
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:43,589
I think that's elsewhere.

929
01:35:43,969 --> 01:35:44,149
No?

930
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:46,311
There are state frameworks around that, right?

931
01:35:47,871 --> 01:35:49,412
There's no minimum requirement.

932
01:35:50,353 --> 01:35:50,693
Really?

933
01:35:50,713 --> 01:35:58,297
I thought there was, at least when I was, I remember you would be like, it was especially, and my kids too, I thought like you had to go to gym or you couldn't graduate.

934
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:03,486
See, this is where I think where we need Rachel.

935
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:26,514
I apologize for speaking over, but the program of studies and Mass Corps will set, Mass Corps curriculum requirements will set forth, say like, you know, you have to have four math courses to graduate high school and four English and, you know, three lab sciences and then X physical education.

936
01:36:26,534 --> 01:36:36,336
And, but it is, it is required as this law states, you know, for certain, but there is no minimum time requirement on it from a state

937
01:36:37,407 --> 01:36:38,649
regulatory perspective.

938
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:45,580
Can we double check with, like, thank you, and may I, Member Russo, if we could double check with

939
01:36:46,883 --> 01:37:14,511
with Rachel and with even Desi on that because that sounds, and I'll check tomorrow too when I'm at work, but that sounds a little bit suspect to me because I was always under the impression that it was required to be able to graduate and that a certain minimum of time was required and that if you missed X amount of time, then it was a real problem, but maybe that- Well, I think- Yeah.

940
01:37:15,515 --> 01:37:22,763
graduation requirements are also the purview of the school committee right and there are documented graduation requirements.

941
01:37:24,165 --> 01:37:28,110
Somewhere we've never taken them up that that we've been around Melanie.

942
01:37:29,424 --> 01:37:40,874
But there probably are graduation requirements that like you're referring to, but they just also may not have anything to do with the law, but being something that we have purview over.

943
01:37:40,894 --> 01:37:40,874
100%.

944
01:37:40,914 --> 01:37:48,420
And that's what I want to differentiate, because I think that there's a difference, obviously, between what we have purview over and what we don't.

945
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,022
And I'm not convinced that some of this is not

946
01:37:52,003 --> 01:38:13,397
state law versus you know school committee policies so that's and like we know MCAS is a state law right well is required right unless you bypass it but so those are sort of the things and I want to get somebody that is a little bit to weigh in that knows more than we do about whether that is the case or not because I I would just like to be, thank you.

947
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:14,820
Yeah.

948
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:24,145
And I think as written, all we're saying is that we will comply with state frameworks, which if there are no state frameworks, that's fine.

949
01:38:24,285 --> 01:38:25,186
We're still in compliance.

950
01:38:26,427 --> 01:38:30,669
But I agree that we should ask Rachel to weigh in on this.

951
01:38:31,269 --> 01:38:33,070
Like this is the problem with this wellness policy.

952
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:36,933
It's like all over the place in terms of the topics that it covers.

953
01:38:36,973 --> 01:38:37,373
So it's,

954
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:39,554
There's no, there's no, we're already over time.

955
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:41,575
There's no chance for finishing this today.

956
01:38:41,915 --> 01:38:43,256
And we didn't even get to recess.

957
01:38:43,296 --> 01:38:53,381
So, but having said that, a separate conversation around graduation requirements, like may be in order at some point in time in the future.

958
01:38:54,022 --> 01:38:57,904
But this to me, like I read this as like, this is the overarching framework.

959
01:38:58,664 --> 01:39:09,088
of K-12 for Medford Public Schools, which is obviously they can't, it can't conflict with graduation requirements, but it is much broader than what you must do to graduate high school.

960
01:39:11,989 --> 01:39:19,492
Okay, we are way over time, I apologize, and I'm sure many of you have been working since a very early hour.

961
01:39:19,512 --> 01:39:20,312
So

962
01:39:21,963 --> 01:39:29,667
I just wanna see if there are any things we can check off here so we don't have to rehash those conversations the next time we bring this up.

963
01:39:30,648 --> 01:39:33,950
This is the addition of the words, all students are entitled to.

964
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,772
I think that sounds good, unless there's any objections to that.

965
01:39:37,792 --> 01:39:47,977
I think I can live with this sentence as it's written and we will have to revisit this anyways.

966
01:39:48,218 --> 01:39:50,439
So I like that.

967
01:39:53,211 --> 01:39:55,733
I like the by grade edition that's.

968
01:39:57,535 --> 01:39:58,856
Good since they're not the same.

969
01:39:59,216 --> 01:40:05,081
i'm not going to do my grammarly changes and then we cut these two out.

970
01:40:10,986 --> 01:40:11,566
And.

971
01:40:12,347 --> 01:40:14,849
This was that same what is this one sorry.

972
01:40:17,133 --> 01:40:20,776
This, that was just, that was the model policy from MASC.

973
01:40:20,856 --> 01:40:21,296
Oh, okay.

974
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:22,818
That we rewrote.

975
01:40:23,799 --> 01:40:25,360
We liked the Linfield one better.

976
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:42,234
I think the other, like, just note, if I'm reading through this Linfield policy, there are some other components of the Linfield policy that we may want to talk about in the next meeting, in addition to recess, so that we can take one swipe at this policy and actually get it in good shape.

977
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:43,695
Okay, good.

978
01:40:43,735 --> 01:40:44,956
But we can talk about that next time.

979
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:51,168
Yes, all we have left in this is this other school based activities which we may not keep or may.

980
01:40:51,775 --> 01:40:56,176
and then evaluation, which I have not actually read what that says.

981
01:40:56,676 --> 01:41:08,658
And then we will take up, remember McLaughlin, the other thing we did discuss before you came on was that in some of the policies and the policy manual, there are sub policies.

982
01:41:09,178 --> 01:41:13,439
And we agreed earlier that we would move to recess to a sub policy.

983
01:41:13,499 --> 01:41:16,319
So EDF dash, whatever the right letter should be.

984
01:41:16,899 --> 01:41:18,900
And then we would also move the,

985
01:41:21,152 --> 01:41:23,934
Well, we did discuss what was the other one.

986
01:41:24,554 --> 01:41:24,874
Give me.

987
01:41:27,176 --> 01:41:28,216
We're going to move another.

988
01:41:28,456 --> 01:41:36,561
Oh, the allergy policy will go as a sub policy as well, rather than injecting it into this this policy here.

989
01:41:37,401 --> 01:41:40,643
So those are the things we will do at our next meeting.

990
01:41:40,763 --> 01:41:42,704
I don't actually feel like I have any to do's.

991
01:41:43,285 --> 01:41:46,206
So I just want to remind the members that

992
01:41:47,711 --> 01:42:01,657
For open meeting law, we can continue to look at this, but we should not be typing into this document at all until we are in our next meeting since we cannot deliberate outside of the meeting by sharing our thoughts on policy.

993
01:42:01,817 --> 01:42:07,719
So I just closed it and I promise not to look at it again.

994
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:10,180
Thank you.

995
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,202
Is there a motion to adjourn?

996
01:42:17,168 --> 01:42:18,029
Motion to adjourn.

997
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:22,335
Second.

998
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:26,360
Member Graham?

999
01:42:26,881 --> 01:42:27,161
Yes.

1000
01:42:28,623 --> 01:42:29,604
Member McLaughlin?

1001
01:42:30,685 --> 01:42:30,986
Yes.

1002
01:42:31,006 --> 01:42:34,611
And Member Rousseau?

1003
01:42:34,671 --> 01:42:34,771
Yes.
