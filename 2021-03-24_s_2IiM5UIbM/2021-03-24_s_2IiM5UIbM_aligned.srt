1
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:17,904
All right, I think we have everybody here we need for sure to be here.

2
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:19,786
Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:27,710
I'm going to call to order the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting of the Medford School Committee.

00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:37,617

20
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,380
First, I'd like to take a roll call.

21
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:09,462
Member Graham?

22
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:10,502
Here.

23
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:13,725
Member McLaughlin?

24
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:14,585
Here.

25
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,287
And a member or so here, three present.

26
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,268
We have a quorum.

27
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,270
So we have two items on our agenda tonight.

28
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,972
The first item we'll just get right into.

29
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:30,176
So in light of recent events in Boston regarding the participation of the student representative to the school committee,

30
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:36,823
conversation with the current representatives, Colin Bailey and David, David, how do you say your last name?

31
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,264
May or my?

32
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,124
It's May, like a month.

33
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:40,244
May, thank you.

34
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:55,429
Will take place to understand how they are experiencing participation as our student representatives, as well as what changes may be necessary to better integrate their voices and perspective and respect their participation as critical members of the school committee.

35
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,270
So I first wanna welcome Colin and David, and thank you for joining us.

36
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,891
Member Graham, I think has to say something.

37
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,294
member of Mr. McLaughlin, sorry.

38
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,256
Member Graham was like, I do?

39
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,538
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

40
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:16,440
I just wanted to say welcome to Colin and David, and it's nice to see you.

41
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,903
I know we've been exchanging email and having a little bit of email tag, so I'm really glad.

42
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:29,087
And thank you to Member Rousseau for convening the meeting so that we can hear from you guys publicly in this meeting.

43
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,168
So it's good to see you.

44
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:30,908
Thanks for coming.

45
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:36,928
So I hadn't really thought too much about how we would do this.

46
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:46,315
The nice thing about subcommittees and small committees versus the giant meetings where there's 180 people watching is we can actually have a regular conversation.

47
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:50,718
And frankly, I would wish this was just sitting around a table together because it would be way better.

48
00:04:52,419 --> 00:05:01,906
So I think that if it's OK with you too, I would certainly welcome either one of you commenting or providing any feedback you have before

49
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:07,229
the members before we start pontificating, which I'm certainly prepared to do.

50
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:10,630
Sorry, point of information member Russo.

51
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,470
Sure.

52
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:19,592
Would you mind also just sharing what the, I know that you said regarding the, what had happened in the Boston school committee.

53
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:23,474
So maybe for folks who are watching or who don't know what you're referencing, maybe you could share that.

54
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:24,774
Sure.

55
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:28,795
So I did not read all the articles and there were more than, there was a few.

56
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:48,538
So the representative, and I don't believe this was the only representative, I believe this has happened more than once, to the school committee resigned in protest to being dismissed and having their voices not valued and their opinions valued.

57
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,423
And I did not watch any of the recordings to see what that looked like.

58
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,765
I certainly had no trouble just accepting

59
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,477
that the experience of the students was the experience of the student representatives.

60
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:05,158
That sort of is a baseline for me.

61
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:14,502
So I don't know if either Colin or David want to provide more details, but, and I don't know, can you?

62
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:17,104
Yeah, sorry.

63
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,264
Thank you, Marusa.

64
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:23,166
Yeah, I actually have the article pulled up right now and I'm looking at it.

65
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,908
And one thing that he's talking about is,

66
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:40,623
the member of the school committee who resigned, he said that he felt that he was immediately shut down when he had a question and they answered questions from other people that weren't asked yet.

67
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:51,308
Personally, I don't feel that the comments that I make are overshadowed, but I do feel that they aren't as representative

68
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,441
as representative as other comments are.

69
00:06:56,461 --> 00:07:13,153
I don't know if there could be an, if David agree with me or disagree, I would like to hear his input too, but personally, I feel like the voice that we have is not the same voice that the member that resigned had, where he could actually make comments on the regular.

70
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:31,799
Um, to also that point, um, I kind of just want to preference that I rather this just be an open conversation between all of us and the school board, um, it just makes a lot easier and for us to have a conversation to talk about these things and like I said Colin was bright with that, um, I think, right now, with me and calling on this board.

71
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:46,591
We really don't have much of a say, nor do we have a vote at all and I think these are, this is one of the biggest issues that we need to come forward and tackle because right now we just feel like we're just a person on the board to represent the students, and we don't really have a say but we're just here to be here.

72
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:53,397
I kind of just drawn up like a couple of things that I think would help us to move on forward with this.

73
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:58,118
So one of the things is basically creating new student representation within the board.

74
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:06,942
I feel as though that we should basically move forward in a plan to basically expand how many students are on this board and to be representative of the school.

75
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:13,827
So one of the things I came up with is having a class liaison or two class liaisons per each class.

76
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:32,580
So we would have freshmen's liaisons, sophomores, juniors, and seniors that would basically talk amongst each other to basically come up with new plans about school committee items or any new proposals that they'd like to see in the future to be added to the school or to the board at all.

77
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:36,367
And, um, this is like one of the ways that just continue to help.

78
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:43,023
I think there's also be little to no adult supervision because I feel as though that whenever there is adult in the room or an adult on the board.

79
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:49,797
it kind of creates a new feeling or different type of mood that the students aren't able to be open or freely to discuss about these topics.

80
00:08:50,357 --> 00:09:06,348
So I feel like this should be a student led organization that kind of just encompasses the entire high school from each different grade level to talk about what's going on within their own grade or class that then is brought up to the entire board itself to propose new plans or new ideas in the future.

81
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,680
I'd actually like to piggyback off of what David was saying.

82
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:25,791
I previously worked alongside the headmaster DeLeva and a couple other members of the site council as vice president of the class for freshmen through junior year.

83
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:27,593
And there were meetings and

84
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,494
One thing that I really liked about it was that we had student representation through and through.

85
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:38,802
We had two representatives, the president and the vice president of each class show up to the meetings.

86
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:43,888
And I thought that was a really good opportunity for students to express their ideas because it gave a

87
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:48,164
it gave the president, the vice president, they were the ones who knew the class the most.

88
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:58,187
And I thought that was a really good opportunity for students to actually get their voice out there because I felt that we were heard and our ideas were put into action immediately.

89
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:00,947
So ideally, yeah, go.

90
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,688
Can I just ask for a clarification on that?

91
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:13,751
So this president, vice president from each of the classes, this was a thing that's, I mean, this whole year is sort of, when I say usually,

92
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:23,934
always have to sort of caveat that this year doesn't really count, but so this was a, this is a thing that's already existed that where these people are meeting, these students are meeting.

93
00:10:23,954 --> 00:10:37,482
I believe that it was, it was for the, for the time that I was vice president of the class, but I cannot speak for this year because I am not an elected official or an officer.

94
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:43,005
So, but for the time that I did do it, I thought that was a great opportunity for students to get their voice out there and

95
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,677
And was there a name for this group?

96
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:46,877
Sorry, if I missed that.

97
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,358
No, no, no, no.

98
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,920
It was just called site council, I believe.

99
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,980
Oh, site council.

100
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,280
Thank you.

101
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,541
Sorry.

102
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:52,961
Yeah.

103
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:53,841
Sorry about that.

104
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,442
I completely glanced over that.

105
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:56,723
Yeah.

106
00:10:58,664 --> 00:10:59,965
Melanie?

107
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,665
Member McLaughlin, excuse me.

108
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:02,246
Yeah.

109
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:08,029
No, it's good to hear this, and I'm glad that you really felt incorporated into the site council.

110
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:13,352
Colin, one of the things I am wondering about David and Colin both,

111
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:18,967
as we're thinking about the vice president and president, I'm assuming you mean the class officers.

112
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:20,942
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:30,104
So yeah, that are elected by the class, which again, I mean, I think that's a good starting point.

114
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:36,426
But I also want to make sure that we're thinking about our students that are outside of those regular sort of spaces.

115
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:39,486
So students that might not necessarily be elected to the class officers, right?

116
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:44,167
Or, you know, haven't run for office or don't want to or whatever.

117
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,068
It's like, how are we thinking about and I know that

118
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:51,872
The class offices represent all students, but I think it would be nice to see a mix too.

119
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,774
So yes, so that's my point member or so.

120
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:55,094
Thank you.

121
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:56,295
Thank you.

122
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:05,715
No, I agree with Mr. McLaughlin 100%.

123
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:12,119
I feel like obviously student representatives are elected by the class and I think for the vice president and president position.

124
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:18,523
And I think that there should be more representation when it comes to that if we were to incorporate this into the committee.

125
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:28,112
Yeah, so I'm like my initial proposal, I only propose one or two people but I do see in the future where we, sorry, where we would have to expand.

126
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:35,461
And I think that would become a idea that part of the board does so student led board will talk about and to expand it to how many students.

127
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,964
I also think that diversity is another huge thing.

128
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:54,946
within that board to basically having a diverse students from different backgrounds or different types of ways of life, a loss of life to be able to talk about these ideas and create new change is going to be a very, very crucial thing, because I know currently I feel as though that metaphor is kind of divided in a way.

129
00:12:55,937 --> 00:13:01,741
There's a lot of classism, and there's a lot of social economic issues within Medford that needs to be addressed.

130
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:10,947
And this kind of goes towards our own personal academics do it comes to removing the bias of honors and AP classes because right now, you can see a lot of students and I'll

131
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,989
a lot of the diversity isn't there for these classes.

132
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:21,593
The honors and APs are mostly Asians or whites compared to the regular standard classes.

133
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:29,057
And this kind of is like one of the biggest issues that I want to continue to tackle is to basically continue to remove the bias of honors and APs.

134
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:34,720
Because right now, it feels as though that if you're in the honors course or you're in the AP course, you must stay within that path.

135
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,282
Or if you're in the standard course, you must stay within the standard course.

136
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:38,202
standard course paths.

137
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:44,384
Of course, there are students who are, you know, moving up throughout the ranks to move into honors classes or AP classes.

138
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:50,686
But there's just a continuous, like, if you're in a standard class, you're going to stay in the standard class.

139
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,427
There's no reason for you to move out of it.

140
00:13:52,447 --> 00:14:01,349
And that's like one of the biggest issues that I feel as though that minority groups aren't able to be a representative within these honor classes or within these AP classes.

141
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,010
That should be a thing that should

142
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:13,995
you know, partly because everyone's smart in their own ways, and even if they may not do good in academics in certain parts, they still should be within these honors or AP courses if they feel as though that they should be part of it.

143
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,419
That was pretty profound, David.

144
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,800
Thank you for sharing that.

145
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,102
I think that's something that we have to look at data-wise as well.

146
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:32,124
You know, when we talk about subgroups and, you know, the classism,

147
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,888
and ableism, frankly, that exists in our culture and in our community.

148
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,569
So I think that that's really important.

149
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:39,930
I appreciate you naming that.

150
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:52,098
And I think that that's exactly what I was addressing in terms of the diversity and thinking about outside of the box around that, but also, you know, what kind of how data tells a story for us with that.

151
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,400
And I know for me, even last year, going to the

152
00:14:55,948 --> 00:15:10,011
To the curriculum night, there were a number of experiences I had where there were comparisons made at curriculum night to standard classes and students versus honor and AP students.

153
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:13,172
And it was literally by staff, right?

154
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,773
They were talking about sort of, well, our standards class sort of

155
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:22,938
doesn't, you know, may not listen or may have behavior or whatever, just sort of, and it was really right in the presentations.

156
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,000
And I thought that was really interesting.

157
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:35,487
And I did bring it to the principal's attention and I'm sure it wasn't intentional and I'm not trying to call anybody out on it, but I think the implicit bias is really real in that way.

158
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:37,189
And so I appreciate you naming that.

159
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:37,649
Thank you.

160
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:43,033
Okay.

161
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:44,714
David and Colin,

162
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:58,876
You know, I guess what I am trying to think through as you guys are talking is the connection between the site council that you were referring to and the role that you play on the school committee.

163
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:10,203
And like, are you suggesting that there needs to be like a better connection or a different connection or something else?

164
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:14,165
So I'm just trying to think through some of your comments to figure out like,

165
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:25,337
how we make sure from a school committee perspective that we are actively hearing your voices in our meetings.

166
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:33,721
And maybe that's because you are bringing forward issues or maybe it's because you are talking to the site council.

167
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:38,443
So I'm just trying to think through in real time, like how do those two things connect?

168
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:44,388
Um, what I was looking at was David's proposal of having liaisons for each grade.

169
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:47,269
Um, and I correlated that myself.

170
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,969
Yeah.

171
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,590
Um, so yeah, just two per class.

172
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,390
That was how it was for the site council as well.

173
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,850
And that's what he proposed for the school committee as well.

174
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,352
Um, I thought, yeah, the way that we had, that was just, we talked directly to the members themselves and I thought that it was.

175
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:12,287
I thought it was the best form of communication that I've had when talking to people who are obviously higher up in school committee.

176
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:14,651
So I thought it was just a good opportunity then.

177
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,214
I thought that was a good quality.

178
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:27,205
Um, to add to that to also, um, I kind of just want to have more student representation throughout the board also because right now to students isn't really fully reflective of the entire school.

179
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:35,791
I think having more students from different grades and different backgrounds, but continue to show more and better representation of the of the students within the school.

180
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:52,863
I think also that right now the school committee really just handles a lot of the budgeting and we kind of as students aren't really into the budgeting or the financial aspect of school committee, but also we feel as though that we should have representation, an actual vote within the school committee board.

181
00:17:53,104 --> 00:18:05,473
So to actually voice our opinions if we don't ever agree with the adults regarding a topic or a certain issue, that way it kind of will show that we students are actually standing for something and rather than us just being here without any vote at all.

182
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:10,345
member McLaughlin, then superintendent.

183
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:12,867
Thank you.

184
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,208
And just backing it up a little bit.

185
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:17,250
If you guys can tell me how were you selected in your liaison roles?

186
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:22,715
What is that process to the school currently?

187
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,731
So currently, our principal.

188
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:40,159
So, since I'm part of the vote, Mr Fallon reached out to me and asked me if I'd like to become a school committee board member and I said yes, and I was super approachable to the role I didn't call them as a contact the same way through either a teacher or a supervisor within the school.

189
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:46,899
That currently isn't a good way to choose who should be within the school committee board.

190
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,441
But at the same time, this is the only way that we have it for right now.

191
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:55,105
But I think throughout my plan, we should have an elected official between the students.

192
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,929
So the students would hold a vote between who would they want to be elected for the class liaisons.

193
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,693
And then in the future, within the next couple of years, we can expand to more liaisons.

194
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:09,496
But my current first year plan would be electing two liaisons from the senior class

195
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:13,559
to basically speak on these issues that they feel as though are within the school.

196
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,241
And then maybe year two, we expand to the junior class.

197
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,483
And then year three, we expand to the sophomore class.

198
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,304
And then year four, we expand to the freshman class.

199
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:28,689
And then after year four, we could look into within our own student representative board to having to expand for more than two liaisons per class.

200
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,873
And before the superintendent speaks, I just wanted to jump in here real quick.

201
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:38,476
So I do have the Mass General Law that dictates all of this.

202
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:56,165
On principle, I actually think having voting members of the school committee being members of the actual people we're overseeing is sort of almost natural and obvious and like, duh, I mean, seriously.

203
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:01,406
Unfortunately, the current law is quite explicit.

204
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:09,468
Now, what David just iterated on how we actually select the student representative is actually what the law says it should be.

205
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:24,519
getting us to the point where there's a student-based election to select the person to be the advisory committee, to be the representative, that shouldn't be too hard since that's technically the law.

206
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:37,962
And operationally, I'm sure there's some work to do to make that happen going forward, but I think that should be an easy win because that's what has to happen.

207
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:46,468
But it's a pretty small section on the law, but it also is very clear that you cannot be voting members.

208
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:59,355
You can't be compensated, which I personally, as somebody who believes all work should be valued and paid, find that particularly crazy, offensive, sorry, that's the wrong word, crazy.

209
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:07,700
But no matter how many hours you spend sitting there doing your duty, we cannot compensate you.

210
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:15,669
And then the other part about this that is a little concerning is that it says there can only be one.

211
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,510
We have always had two.

212
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,030
And as far as I know, I mean, this is my fourth year.

213
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,151
And my understanding why we had two was it's a huge burden.

214
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,572
I mean, our meetings are not half an hour long.

215
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:38,373
Our trivia game name was the all-nighters for a reason.

216
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:57,013
So, you know, I think I will, one of the takeaways I will take from this is to find out, you know, this section of the law, what parts of it are restrictive and what parts are sort of like the minimum, you know, can we have two without any problem?

217
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:04,515
If we have, you know, not if, but, you know, it's pretty clear about that there should be an election of the student body to discern who it is.

218
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:06,916
But if the student body picks two people

219
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:11,236
or four people or whatever, is that okay?

220
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,516
I think it's something we can get an answer to.

221
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:21,558
Sometimes things are really like, this is the minimum you can do, the most you can do, and sometimes the minimum you must do.

222
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,499
And it's not a lot of language, but some of it seems to definitely be going back and forth between those two things.

223
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:37,241
But being a voting member would require the state legislature to change that, because it's explicit there.

224
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,453
But I just wanted to get that out there.

225
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:46,175
And I will send you all a link to this particular section.

226
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:50,257
It's actually short, which is nice, because usually these things are pages long.

227
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:52,939
Dr. Edward Benson, you wanted to say something?

228
00:22:53,277 --> 00:23:04,384
Yeah, so what I had wanted to say, thank you for just quoting that, because I appreciate both David and Colin sharing their perspectives and giving feedback.

229
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:18,213
And I was going to say that we're actually following the law that, and in Medford, I think the thinking behind having the two representatives at one point in time

230
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:36,755
Where we had both the high school and the vocational school, those are the two kind of we trying to take one person from each side, because the school kind of has two personalities if we can use that.

231
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:59,064
image but the intent was we always had one student at one meeting so they would alternate because pre-COVID times students were part of the band or they had you know practice and football games or whatever the case may be so I think the two the two members would alternate if there was maybe a test

232
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:02,718
the following day, then the other person could do it.

233
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:07,160
So they kind of had like a backup responsibility.

234
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:25,291
And I wanted to say, you know, when I think about this, I think of this experience as like a precursor or practice for those who would consider

235
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:34,242
becoming elected officials that you the school committee members were elected, you know, by the public.

236
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:39,027
And so, as elected officials, I do feel that you guys should

237
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:53,910
be the voting members because there is information that you're privy to that not everyone would be privy to in your official role as school committee members.

238
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:07,758
But I do like the idea of having a more active student council, I guess the way they were describing, you know, who the,

239
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:11,249
representatives would be etc.

240
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:21,884
So I just had wanted to say that we're following the law, and that in other, I think the newspaper article where the student did comment.

241
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:34,316
about providing specific opinions or feedback and the student was not allowed or they were not allowed to speak.

242
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:48,107
I think in Medford, if Colin or David raises their hand and we see it, I've seen the chair or other members acknowledge and say a student's raising their hand.

243
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:51,050
And when we're eventually back in the chambers,

244
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:54,589
you could see one another.

245
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:59,894
So when you raised your hand, it was like, oh, Colin's raising his hand, David's raising his hand.

246
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:08,102
You know, there was a little button and they would come over and speak into the microphone and go back and sit down.

247
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:09,062
So I do feel

248
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:18,410
The fact that, you know, we're on COVID time and that the meetings are taking place remotely.

249
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:23,074
And so we're not always all on the same exact page.

250
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:33,850
You know, if there are hundreds of people on the call, someone could be in another page, and if they don't use the raise hand function, sometimes you're just not seen.

251
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,231
So there are a lot of limitations.

252
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:49,436
So I think that I don't want you, Colin or David, to feel like we don't value what you have to say, or we don't want to hear what it is that's being said.

253
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,697
I, you know, I know Mr. DeLeva's on the call.

254
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:55,095
Dr. Cushing's on the call.

255
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,180
You know, Ms.

256
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,282
Galluzzi, we would love.

257
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,046
Dr. Riccadeli's on the call.

258
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,355
We have administrators who would love to be able to

259
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:26,924
receive additional student feedback and even possibly ask for a school committee member to be a liaison or to also work with that because I think in some communities that might be that a school committee member is kind of elected

260
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:37,300
or selected to be the official point person between the student voice and the school committee body.

261
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:47,769
And that person can kind of mentor and help to say, David has something to say today, or Colin's gonna be bringing something forward.

262
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,572
And there would be a specific school committee person helping to

263
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:54,419
navigate that pass.

264
00:27:54,999 --> 00:28:10,967
So I just wanted to say we are, you know, taking little notes here and, you know, I'm really happy to see how the two of you have really been thinking about how you can increase

265
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,761
you know, student voice, and we're definitely open to that.

266
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:25,522
But there are some guidelines, because we do need to follow the law, that we are, there is a slight restriction about that.

267
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:28,923
So I just wanted to say that piece.

268
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:38,725
And thank you, Member Rousseau, for adding the law, Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 71, Section 38M.

269
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:39,985
Thank you for that.

270
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:47,942
Thank you.

271
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:55,165
I just wanted to also say to Colin and David, like there's a million ways to sort of think about this, right?

272
00:28:55,285 --> 00:29:06,869
So I think one of the things that I was reading about in the, with the Boston School Committee student members too, was it seemed like the individual that resigned was part of a group of students that resigned, right?

273
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:11,691
So they had another group, whether it was their own, you know, school committee themselves.

274
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,571
I forget what they called it.

275
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:16,853
I hadn't seen, I don't remember in the article, but I think they did have like a school committee or something, right?

276
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:36,700
So they have their own group that basically, I think, you know, the representatives probably went back to and met just as you were saying right in a group setting like after school group that is created at the high school, you know where you have representatives that are doing this that are part of the student government, if you will, and to the superintendent's point.

277
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,625
I'm sure you've seen your predecessor, Justin Tseng is running for city council in Medford, right?

278
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:50,809
And he was an excellent school committee representative and we enjoyed him and listening to him and his perspective.

279
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,810
And he was also on the superintendent hiring committee.

280
00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:05,798
So I think that when students realize how valuable their voice is and when they realize that their voice is heard and does have a lot of social capital, then they really start to, I think,

281
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:12,324
come to the table right and rise to the occasion and your voice is so critical, it's the most critical voice in my opinion.

282
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:21,772
And when you guys really, you know, can articulate that and express that then I think that's, that's really the key and figuring out how to do that right.

283
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,260
working around, if you will, the legislature, right?

284
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:30,304
Because this is the law, we have to follow the law, but what other options do we have, right?

285
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:38,611
So if we have a representative, you guys meet with your schools, you come back with a statement from this organization to us, any of those things that you can think about as workarounds.

286
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,573
And we're all, I'm sure, happy to talk to you about

287
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:42,003
any of these things.

288
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:48,348
And so to the superintendent's point as well, superintendent respectfully, I love the idea of liaison to the students.

289
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:57,095
The only thing about that is I think all seven members, maybe six members would be clamoring to be the liaison to the students because we all very much care.

290
00:30:57,615 --> 00:31:00,316
about of course about your opinion and your perspective.

291
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:15,262
So I think that there could be a way that you know maybe we think about liaisons per class or liaisons per school or sort of anything like that so that every member can be included and have a voice a conversation with the student but also you should know many of us have office hours

292
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:23,824
that are open, obviously, but also will meet for coffee anytime with any constituent yourselves included, because you are constituents.

293
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:29,331
Even for those who are not voting age yet, but I think you know you guys are either 18 or coming up on 18 right.

294
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,716
Yeah, so there you go, you're constituents.

295
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,738
And the other, anybody else are pre-constituents.

296
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:38,319
So we work for you, right?

297
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,000
We're elected, we work for you.

298
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,622
And remembering that is super important.

299
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:44,383
So I want your voice to be heard.

300
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:50,966
And there's a lot of ways to, I don't wanna say skin a cat, cause I don't like that image, but I guess that's sort of what I'm talking about.

301
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:52,507
There's a lot of ways to get things done.

302
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,388
Thank you.

303
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:55,709
Before we go on to Memogram, I just wanna,

304
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:00,040
We have one other agenda item that I expect will take less than 10 minutes.

305
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,641
So I just wanna keep our time in sync.

306
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:11,462
And I also want to make sure we leave with some action items.

307
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:18,904
I think that the law, which you may not have all had a chance to just read, sort of lays out three things for which we are doing none of them.

308
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:22,484
So it seems like those would be good things to be considered action items.

309
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,185
And then,

310
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:29,295
I have some other thoughts on things we might be able to do as well.

311
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,297
Member Graham?

312
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:37,682
So I had a couple of tactical thoughts and maybe some questions as well.

313
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:46,608
So it strikes me that our student liaison always starts with us pretty late in the fall.

314
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,052
So the student does not typically join us until

315
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:55,886
November-ish, if I recall.

316
00:32:56,026 --> 00:33:12,395
And I think perhaps we need to think about the timing of that so that we can make sure that you get the joy of a full year of service with us when you come on board.

317
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:17,257
So I think that goes back to, we should be holding elections according to the law.

318
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:37,529
that you know those obviously like mechanically would need to happen very early in the year maybe the prior year I don't know so that you can join us at the beginning of the school year to have that sort of full that kind of full experience because there are things that move from

319
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:40,313
Meeting to meeting in different ways.

320
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:49,506
So I think that's sort of one thing that is on my mind is, how do we make sure that you all whoever the representative is is into the fold much sooner.

321
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:54,833
I also would like to see us when we call the role.

322
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:03,075
add you to the role so that we know who's there, we know who to be looking for.

323
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:21,309
It isn't usually a problem in chambers because there's like nobody there, but when you add Zoom and there's hundreds of people, it can be challenging, but I would want to make sure that we call the role, we log you in as here or not here, no judgment because

324
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:37,097
You know you are students first, but whoever is there we know and we can make you a co host so that we can see you on the front of the screen instead of like hunting for your reactions and things like that like when I you know when I am on zoom.

325
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:44,903
I like to see all of my colleagues, I want to see their reactions, just like I would in person and I certainly would want to see yours.

326
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:51,429
And I don't, I don't believe there's anything under the law that would preclude us from calling your names in the role.

327
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:57,875
Another thought that I had as we were talking is, is there a way to

328
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,662
call you to vote in a non-binding way.

329
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:15,584
And I think the question and maybe the takeaway for the two of you is, if we were to do that, would you want us to call you first or last?

330
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:22,726
And I would be perfectly fine if you didn't wanna answer that question right now.

331
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:29,107
Because the elected official, the elected members of the school committee by the city of Medford do have to cast the votes.

332
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:34,969
But when it's a nice vote, it's not a problem.

333
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:43,612
It doesn't matter if you vote first or last, but you may wanna think about some of the more contentious votes that we take and sort of the role and the voice you might wanna play.

334
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:52,456
And perhaps we can investigate calling you as a part of the role, even though your vote is not a binding factor.

335
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:57,018
The other thing that we have had on our agenda on this committee for a while

336
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:02,462
is to redesign the agenda itself.

337
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:12,049
And perhaps in that the redesign of the agenda, there needs to be a report from our student liaison, just the same way we have a report from our secretary.

338
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:25,599
And then sort of my final thought as it's been like rattling around in my head is, are students allowed to submit resolutions the same way that voting members of the school committee are under the law?

339
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,281
And if you are allowed to do that, are you aware that you're allowed to do that?

340
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,401
What does that look like?

341
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,362
And what would our rules be around that?

342
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:41,363
So those are some things that, as I've been listening to the conversation, have been sort of rolling around in my head.

343
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:44,585
Thank you, Mayor Graham.

344
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,365
Just a moment, Mayor McLaughlin.

345
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:53,687
I did write down all of those suggestions, half of which I had, but found some other ones for me to put on my list.

346
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:58,628
The agenda items one is a particularly interesting one.

347
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:08,512
I feel like we don't even have to ask because the public can submit items for presentation in general.

348
00:37:09,012 --> 00:37:18,515
So I feel like we would probably wanna nail that down a little bit more precisely because these are not just the public, these are the student representatives.

349
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:21,496
But at the same time, I can't imagine that they could not.

350
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:26,718
And then the liaison part, I have that written down.

351
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:40,391
It does say that we as a committee will designate a student liaison or excuse me, an outreach coordinator for the purposes of working with the student advisory committee.

352
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,234
So that doesn't have to be one of us.

353
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:48,418
I think it does not say it has to be one of us, because I agree with member McLaughlin

354
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:57,140
We all might be clamoring for that when in fact it might be better to assign somebody an administration or a teacher or somebody who's interested in that work.

355
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:00,001
Instead of piling it on.

356
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:05,163
And to to those of us that may have it where it gets lost in the mix.

357
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,265
And then.

358
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:26,045
The voting, my other question for Colin and David around the voting, whether you go first or last, if we are allowed to add you as a person who votes on things, even though it's not going to be counted, there's the first and the last, it's very, very important.

359
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:33,110
And as Member Graham pointed out, for the fun stuff, it really just doesn't matter.

360
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:38,393
For the scary stuff where Member Graham's the first person to vote on everything,

361
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:44,046
And sometimes being the first person out of the gate to say something can be no fun.

362
00:38:45,727 --> 00:39:07,685
But I would also ask you to consider whether or not you would be okay voting, because you're representing a group of students, you don't have time to go back and say, okay, here's a motion that just got cobbled together by one of us in the committee, and you've not had a chance to talk to anybody.

363
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:08,683
about this.

364
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,745
It's sort of, you know, it's life as a person who gets to vote.

365
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:15,088
I don't get to go off and ask constituents, how should I vote?

366
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:20,312
But it is certainly something I think you should think about when you contemplate this question.

367
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:24,095
And then member Graham, member McLaughlin, excuse me.

368
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:24,255
Sorry.

369
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:28,639
Yeah, thank you.

370
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:37,696
Yeah, also it was something that was noticed in chambers because I'm assuming at some point will we be back in chambers and this was something that I had mentioned last year to.

371
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:43,607
the tech people is that it would be nice for the student to have a microphone.

372
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:45,948
So that would be something else that I would add.

373
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:53,630
Instead of having to saddle up to one of the members and squish over and speak through their microphone and feel awkward about everything, they should have their own microphone.

374
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,932
And so I'd like to see even if it's a handheld, we can do that once we're back in chambers.

375
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,312
I like the idea of the,

376
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:09,350
of the advisory and sort of going back to your constituents, which are your students, your cohort and the other grades.

377
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:17,753
And then I would also just encourage folks to really be thinking about how are you representing those most marginalized communities, right?

378
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:24,516
Our subgroups and how are you, you know, are you, you know, either through the CCSR, are you part of the Common Ground Program?

379
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:30,218
Are you going into any of the access classrooms or the EL classrooms and talking to those folks and helping,

380
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,199
ensure that they have a voice as well.

381
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:41,484
And so that's something that I really, you know, I'm happy to talk with you guys about more, but that I, again, would just ask you to think about as you're thinking about these issues and these questions.

382
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:57,114
And then I don't know if it's the law or not, but I was actually wondering this myself, Member Russo, about the voting order, because I, as the Secretary, I'm always like, as you can see, the past couple of times I stumble until I write it down in my Excel spreadsheet and do my tally and all that stuff.

383
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:57,274
But

384
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:00,475
Is there anything that says it has to be alphabetical?

385
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,596
Because, you know, I'm smack in the middle, which is convenient, frankly.

386
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,516
I don't mind being in the middle.

387
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:11,158
But it is tricky, right, when you have those tough times, right?

388
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,259
And so I'm curious about that.

389
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:24,922
It's another question for another day, I think, but it's something that I would ask my committee members, my subcommittee members as the policy subcommittee that we look at that, because I think it's reasonable.

390
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,063
And why should people always be put in that position?

391
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:29,347
Thank you.

392
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:37,250
I want to let Mr. Murphy speak, and then I do want to make sure that the last people talking on this are Colin and David.

393
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,431
So think of something to say if you don't have something right on the tip of your tongue.

394
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,913
I think that's appropriate, and I'll be concise so we can get back to the students.

395
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:56,116
But I did want to say, just as my way of background, say that a long, long time ago when I was a high school student, I had the opportunity to sit in one of these roles.

396
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:57,517
And then years later,

397
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:05,631
when I was an elected member of a school committee, was the committee liaison to the student advisory council, which is what that community called it.

398
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:08,251
We found that that system did work well.

399
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:25,875
I think the point that I think Mr. Rousseau made about making sure that the committee designee is paired with someone from the administration or even potentially a teacher to work as a co-advisor, both because the students have more access to that adult in that role, but also it's important for the,

400
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,151
A big part of this experience for Colin, Dave, and for the other students that serve is an educational experience.

401
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:43,693
And so the stronger that bridge can be between the committee and the students who are representing their peers, the better of the experience generally is for everyone.

402
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:55,795
What we found was helpful was to identify at the beginning of the year, some specific projects that were chosen by the students that were generated by the students, similar to the way the CCR projects work here.

403
00:42:56,333 --> 00:43:02,937
and that way the committee was fully informed about what it was that the students were looking to advocate for and to lead in.

404
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:10,842
And so if that's something that isn't currently incorporated into these roles, I think it's something that we definitely could think about.

405
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:21,388
I would say with regard to the non-binding vote, I think that, and certainly Colin and David should speak in their own right with regard to this when they feel appropriate,

406
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:39,723
It was my experience, both as a student leader and as a committee member, that it was not uncommon for the committee to be deliberating over issues in which the students who were serving in the student body didn't necessarily have a fully defined position.

407
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:46,127
And I wouldn't want to see students who are serving in a role that is meant to be educational feel as though

408
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:59,879
they are being compelled to take out a binary position in one direction or another, or sticking out if they choose to abstain, which could be, I think, a particularly difficult situation.

409
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:11,225
So I think it's a better practice to invite the students to comment on whatever they want and to withhold comment on anything they choose to withhold comment on, rather than to sort of like

410
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:15,328
being called within the role, which incidentally does not need to be alphabetically.

411
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:17,530
There's certainly nothing at the state level that would require that.

412
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:21,594
That's a practice that the municipality can adopt or not adopt.

413
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:25,037
I would recommend that you don't for the exact reasons that Melanie spoke to.

414
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:36,047
But I think that that gives a little more flexibility in a way that I think is appropriate given the fact that this is, well, certainly an opportunity to lead,

415
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:38,415
also an opportunity to learn.

416
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:48,260
And I wouldn't want the students to feel as though they were being put in an uncomfortable position because it sort of, it wastes the opportunity at that point.

417
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,981
So that's all I wanted to add.

418
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:56,725
And hopefully the fact that I was in your seat at one point isn't too, isn't terrifying that this is where you could end up, but it's something that you should think about.

419
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:58,586
But you've got many years to do that.

420
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:00,487
Thank you.

421
00:45:00,747 --> 00:45:06,670
And I would welcome David or Colin to speak before we wrap this item up.

422
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:11,075
Yeah, no, of course.

423
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,757
Yeah, so there are a lot of things that I agree with there.

424
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:20,622
So I do think that this is a learning experience, but also a rightful experience that I should be encompassing to.

425
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,383
So I think we should have a vote.

426
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:32,811
And I think since the students who do choose to become liaisons of the class, either they vote yes or no, or they abstain, that is a decision that they make themselves.

427
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:36,755
And I think just having that experience to being able to make those decisions,

428
00:45:37,618 --> 00:45:42,061
is going to be a crucial thing for these students to learn because we're all going to be faced with hard challenges.

429
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,763
And for a student to make a yes or no decision, that is up to them.

430
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:49,146
And I feel as though that they should have a non-binding vote to say yes or no or to abstain.

431
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:51,948
So that just comes with the process of learning.

432
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:55,791
Another thing that you kind of covered was having a plan at the beginning of the year.

433
00:45:56,232 --> 00:45:59,354
So I kind of include that in my own personal plan to have a program of work every year.

434
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:03,057
So projects that students want to work on or the entire board wants them to work on.

435
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:08,683
that will be part of their program of work that they designed at the beginning of the year.

436
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:13,650
So then that kind of covers what they want to accomplish towards the end of the year and what goals are being met.

437
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,875
And that kind of just puts out a path for the students to be representative in their own way.

438
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:20,839
And if Colin wants to add anything to that, then yeah.

439
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,884
Um, yeah, I totally agree with David.

440
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:28,604
I believe that, um, any vote is better than no vote, even if it's non-binding.

441
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:34,166
Um, I feel that students should have a say on behalf of their class or the student body in general.

442
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:50,970
Um, and in regards to whether voting first or last, um, we can decide this at a different time, but personally, I would prefer to vote first because I think that, um, we should get our voices out there first and students should have the confidence to know that we have their backs and

443
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:57,194
that we're like putting our opinions first to the stage.

444
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,236
Thank you.

445
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:01,478
I appreciate this conversation.

446
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,780
It was like, how's this going to go?

447
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,862
This was way better than I really expected.

448
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,085
I also don't feel like this is the end of this conversation.

449
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:15,210
I feel like, you know, we should work up some black and white written down,

450
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:22,414
you know, next steps and maybe we will have another one of these to kind of go over those.

451
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:29,880
This particular subcommittee would of course be recommending any new rules or if necessary policy changes.

452
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:36,825
So they would certainly come back here and I will be certain to invite you when those come up.

453
00:47:36,885 --> 00:47:45,852
It probably won't be at the next meeting because we have a substantial list of backlog things, but I'm hoping we can have something

454
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:54,044
going before the end of the school year so that we can start the next school year on a good foot with some changes.

455
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:00,170
And if there are no other last member McLaughlin.

456
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:16,851
Yeah, I was just gonna say, would it be too much to ask that we think about a schedule just right now that we can I would like to see, you know, since Colin and David and you sort of, you know, came up with this idea in this process, it would be nice for them to be able to have

457
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:20,693
participate in this process before graduating.

458
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:34,279
So in some context, so could we give ourselves a deadline of say, you know, beginning May that were and last meeting in April or whatever, that we have this recommendation to come before the school committee as a whole to vote.

459
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:41,043
And then, you know, there will be still some opportunity for Colin and David to participate in the process.

460
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:47,509
Certainly I expect a good number of things actually to happen before the end of the school year.

461
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:59,556
Looking at the language of the law, there is an expectation that the student body will actually hold their election for their new representative or hopefully representatives if we can have more than one.

462
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:05,140
So that has to happen, it says, prior to the first day of June each year.

463
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,623
So that the problem mentioned earlier of we don't really see them until November.

464
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:13,599
That's because we haven't been doing that.

465
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:23,326
So prior to June, which is incredibly soon, there should be an election to identify who this person or hopefully more than one person will be.

466
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:29,611
And that would come to the school committee, presumably just as a report.

467
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:35,015
I don't think the school committee votes on whether to accept that, but that would be the first week of June, presumably.

468
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:38,938
I also don't have a clue how elections are being handled

469
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:47,764
current situation with COVID, but there's still class officers now, and I'm sure that is a process that can continue.

470
00:49:48,725 --> 00:50:02,191
And then the other items, I will write those up this week and distribute them and just see if there's any of them that are just not controversial in any way.

471
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:07,794
They're not complicated or not controversial and not complicated if we have to

472
00:50:09,803 --> 00:50:15,186
do something that's gonna take substantial time and resources in the middle of the pandemic, that may be a challenge.

473
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:21,008
But the three items that are in the law, we really are not complying with any of those.

474
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,830
So to me, we should just get those done and that shouldn't be a conversation.

475
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:39,297
And that would be a huge step up and the creation of the student advisory committee, which may actually exist, but not if there's no liaison and there's no passing of our agenda to that group so that they can develop a response so that

476
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:41,958
representatives can come to a committee prepared.

477
00:50:42,618 --> 00:50:51,183
I mean, yeah, I think we can get a lot done before the school year is over and David and Colin are not our representatives.

478
00:50:52,524 --> 00:50:53,904
I wanna say thank you to everybody.

479
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:56,686
We do have to get this other policy done by five o'clock.

480
00:50:56,826 --> 00:51:01,208
So if you want to stay or leave, that's up to you, but thank you very much.

481
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:02,709
I greatly appreciate this meeting.

482
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:06,091
So,

483
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,072
agenda item number two.

484
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:11,213
Where's my agenda item number two?

485
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:12,513
There it is.

486
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:20,656
So the next item is a policy on face coverings.

487
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:24,837
The members all received the policy.

488
00:51:25,277 --> 00:51:26,598
It is part of the agenda.

489
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:32,359
So the public that would have seen the agenda to know we even are here would actually have also been able to read it.

490
00:51:32,419 --> 00:51:33,980
So I won't read the whole policy.

491
00:51:34,976 --> 00:51:48,247
The policy was sent to us from the mass Association of school committees and nursery did you want to speak on anything in particular about this I know you made a couple tiny updates.

492
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:52,632
Um, I really don't have much to add.

493
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:59,535
I mean, we, all of the principles of this policy we had incorporated into our reopening plan.

494
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:07,659
Um, at the beginning of the school year, um, we followed both, uh, CDC and department of public health guidance on that.

495
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:11,701
Um, so it really doesn't need any more explanation.

496
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:13,421
Thank you.

497
00:52:13,502 --> 00:52:14,462
Uh, member McLaughlin.

498
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:29,661
So I didn't realize that this was from MASC, but I think it's interesting that there's nothing in here about IEPs or IERs, the individual emergency response or individual education plan.

499
00:52:30,802 --> 00:52:42,348
So I would obviously assume if it's on a student IEP that they are not wearing a mask or that they are working on wearing a mask, because some students have mask wearing as part of their,

500
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:49,826
individualized education process and some students, you know, are not there yet.

501
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:56,693
So I understand it says has trouble breathing, is unconscious, is incapacitated, cannot remove the mask or face covering without assistance.

502
00:52:58,014 --> 00:53:03,719
So that says nothing about, you know, has a disability or has an IEP that sort of suggests that.

503
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:05,561
So I'm wondering why that might be.

504
00:53:05,601 --> 00:53:06,302
Did you have, yeah.

505
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:07,903
So I can answer that.

506
00:53:07,983 --> 00:53:18,347
So if you go to the next paragraph, it says, in addition, masks or face coverings will not be required for anyone who has a medical, behavioral, or other challenge making it unsafe to wear a face mask.

507
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:28,711
And it is the state mandate that in that instance, a physician needs to write the note for an exemption.

508
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:32,332
And we have followed that this school year.

509
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:43,775
Okay, so it is the state mandate for a student with a disability on an IEP who's not able to wear a mask has a doctor's note that they cannot wear a mask.

510
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:44,616
Is that right?

511
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:52,421
Yep, it's written very narrowly and we have followed that in our schools.

512
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:54,983
That's interesting because I would imagine that

513
00:53:55,613 --> 00:54:01,538
you know, um, therapists or others, but I guess if they're an MD, they can get it from their, um, From their medical doctor.

514
00:54:01,558 --> 00:54:03,760
So that's important, but I know that they say challenge.

515
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,302
I just, I'm just in, so this language is from who this is from Desi.

516
00:54:09,384 --> 00:54:11,306
Mass association of school committee.

517
00:54:11,606 --> 00:54:12,346
Okay.

518
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:14,268
So we can let mass association of school committees.

519
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:19,172
Now, if we have any issue or concern with the language, is that what I'm hearing?

520
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:24,708
Well, member McLaughlin, I mean, we can change language to anything we want as a school committee.

521
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:34,335
The legal references below at the bottom of the policy explain what MASC used to write the language.

522
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:37,678
And this is their suggestion.

523
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:39,399
This is the starter kit.

524
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:46,024
I'm quite sure there are districts that have probably made substantial changes to this,

525
00:54:47,658 --> 00:55:03,445
you know, after I got the new policy from MASC, I read it and Nurse Ray also had a chance to review it and that's why I sent it here without substantial editing.

526
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:04,806
Member McLaughlin.

527
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,600
Thank you.

528
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:24,692
So I guess I would like to make a motion that we include a sentence that says something to the effect of, you know, is a student with a disability, you know, where an IEP indicates is unable to wear a mask, and if we want to put in parathetical notation, doctor's note required or something, that's fine, but I think it's an important

529
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:39,449
point both for families of students with disabilities and for self advocates and others to understand that category so a student with a disability may look at this and say, you know, especially someone who takes things quite literally might look at this and say I don't have a problem breathing I'm not unconscious.

530
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:51,540
I'm not incapacitated, I can take the mask on or off, but I can't because I feel like whatever, I have a stimulus, I have a sensory thing, I can't, whatever, any number of things that happen for individuals with disabilities.

531
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,302
So not being classified in that, I think is important.

532
00:55:55,342 --> 00:56:09,090
So I would respectfully request that we include the individual as a student with a disability who has a doctor's note or IEP notation

533
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:14,213
that, you know, precludes them from being able to wear a mask, right?

534
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,634
So we want to remember about that.

535
00:56:17,955 --> 00:56:30,583
Can I just, you know, I mean, being on an IEP is, you know, you could not be in an IEP and definitely qualify with a physician now and vice versa.

536
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:38,428
So I do feel a bit like the IEP part of the language would say muddle it, but it's, it's, it's not,

537
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:43,087
requirement or not a requirement to really have this exception.

538
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:49,809
And I mean, certainly plenty of people with physical disabilities may not have an IEP at all.

539
00:56:49,829 --> 00:57:00,652
And, you know, I think there's lots of students and adults with anxiety disorders for which, you know, that's just between them and their physician.

540
00:57:01,872 --> 00:57:04,193
So I certainly

541
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:07,800
And fine with kind of pulling that out and making that explicit.

542
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,601
I'm just worried about how do we do it?

543
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,582
And we have like 90 seconds.

544
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:27,309
So my ask was, would you take it on to look in other policies or find some language to suggest at the regular school committee to amend it then rather than us trying to amend it here?

545
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:31,351
Because I feel like time-wise, we're kind of lacking that.

546
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:36,197
Sure, I would be happy to do that.

547
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:40,458
And I would be happy to consult with the Director of Pupil Services regarding that.

548
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:48,841
And I fully understand that people with disabilities aren't on IEPs necessarily, but IEPs can also drive training around wearing masks.

549
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:51,742
And so that's sort of part of the issue that I'm discussing right now.

550
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:53,823
And so that's the nuance around some of this.

551
00:57:54,403 --> 00:58:02,766
So, but I'm sure the Director of Pupil Services and I can come up with something that will feel appropriate.

552
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,307
So sure, I'm happy to do that.

553
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:18,094
And I do want to add in our programs, the teachers and the school nurses have done a wonderful job with introducing students with disabilities to mask wearing.

554
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:29,639
We have been using social stories to encourage students and help them understand what the process is for wearing a mask.

555
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,261
There has been accommodation.

556
00:58:34,922 --> 00:58:44,227
with physician notes and with parent input that, you know, that facilitates that, that action within the classrooms.

557
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:49,450
So, you know, we are addressing the needs of all of our students.

558
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,012
Even- Don't doubt that for a second, Ms.

559
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:53,292
Ray.

560
00:58:53,712 --> 00:58:54,332
I don't doubt that.

561
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:56,633
Thank you.

562
00:58:57,014 --> 00:58:58,855
I did also want to just highlight,

563
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:03,742
There's a review frequency as part of our policy information.

564
00:59:03,822 --> 00:59:14,191
I've set that to five months so that at either our very first meeting in September that we review this again, because we really don't have a clue what things will look like come September.

565
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:19,356
And I would hate for us to have a policy mandating this if everybody's vaccinated and nobody needs to wear a mask.

566
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,322
Do either student representatives since you're here, do you have anything you wanna say about this?

567
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:29,504
You don't have to say anything, by the way.

568
00:59:29,664 --> 00:59:32,145
That's sort of, politicians take a while to learn that.

569
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:41,569
You know, of course, I think a member of McLaughlin makes a great point with the language within the context of the law we must follow.

570
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:50,773
And I think having another meeting towards September to review this and to see how things have changed since and to make sure that everything is going well.

571
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:52,994
So thank you guys so much for being today.

572
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:54,695
Thank you.

573
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,056
All right.

574
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:01,387
Are there any other comments or anything on this?

575
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:07,591
So is there a motion to send this up as it's presently written, knowing full well we will be looking for an amendment?

576
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:17,897
Sorry, what are you looking for in terms of a motion, the motion to send this to the school committee as a whole?

577
01:00:18,557 --> 01:00:20,759
Yeah, just a motion to approve the new policy.

578
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:27,823
Motion to approve the policy with an amendment forthcoming.

579
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:29,766
Um, sure.

580
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:37,428
Well, I don't know that we can do exactly that way, because, um, we because we have to say, Okay, that's fine.

581
01:00:37,448 --> 01:00:38,709
I'll do it on the floor motion.

582
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:39,169
Thank you.

583
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:39,829
Yeah.

584
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:40,910
Thank you.

585
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:42,150
Thank you.

586
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:44,751
So member Graham?

587
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:45,371
Yes.

588
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:46,872
Remember McLaughlin?

589
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:47,412
Yes.

590
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:48,432
Remember?

591
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:49,833
So yes, three in the affirmative.

592
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:56,135
The new policy is, um, passed out of subcommittee will be sent to the full school committee on April 12th.

593
01:00:56,896 --> 01:00:57,696
Um, and

594
01:00:58,249 --> 01:00:59,550
I appreciate everybody.

595
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:04,235
We managed to only be three minutes over, which I personally.

596
01:01:04,255 --> 01:01:06,757
So I take your three minutes away from your last 20, Paul.

597
01:01:06,778 --> 01:01:07,899
No, I'm just kidding.

598
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:08,840
I'm not keeping notes.

599
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,122
Motion to adjourn.

600
01:01:11,422 --> 01:01:12,443
Member Graham?

601
01:01:12,783 --> 01:01:13,004
Yes.

602
01:01:13,824 --> 01:01:14,705
Member McLaughlin?

603
01:01:14,986 --> 01:01:15,286
Yes.

604
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:17,969
So yes, three in the affirmative.

605
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:19,010
This meeting is adjourned.

606
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,470
Thank you all.
