30
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:07,863

[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

37
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:35,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just to clarify, there was a payment made to Mrs. Van de Kloof for the amount of $280 and 59 cents.

38
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,772
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a payment made to Mrs. Van de Kloof in the amount of I think $280 and 59 cents.

39
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:49,435
[SPEAKER_05]: The reimbursement for the, uh, travel that took place for the MASC, uh, conference back in November.

40
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe there was one to Mr. Scarry as well.

41
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:52,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

42
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:53,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't see it.

43
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:53,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

44
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:54,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

45
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that was the, um,

46
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,478
[SPEAKER_05]: M A S C conference.

47
00:01:59,058 --> 00:01:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

48
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it usually paid for differently than reimbursed to you guys?

49
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:13,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I just thought it was unusual that it was like a line item to get a better, better deal.

50
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:24,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, we actually, I actually made my, um, uh, reservation first directly with the hotel because there was a time factor involved and, um, it was more cost effective.

51
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you for saving us money then.

52
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:30,342
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just, it was an unusual expense, so.

53
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't charge it through the school system, I charged it on my credit card for that reason.

54
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:36,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect, thank you.

55
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:39,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

56
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno, point of information.

57
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:50,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason that you haven't seen in the last few years is because actually Paulette and I had been paid for, our expenses were paid for MASC.

58
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:57,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Paulette and I are no longer on MASC as far as executive board is concerned, so that's why the reimbursement.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And you haven't seen it over the last few years, that's the reason.

60
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:04,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second for the approval?

61
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:06,316
[SPEAKER_08]: of bills, transfer funds.

62
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:08,138

00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:08,918

00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:10,720

00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,855
[SPEAKER_14]: on the Disney soundtracks and recordings.

163
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:27,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And they get to learn a piece with a conductor, not myself, someone that works for Disney.

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they are able to actually watch the movie playing on the huge screen behind them as they get to play it.

165
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And every kid gets a copy of it.

166
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:41,412
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's lots of other activities that we can sign up for, depending on what the kids are interested in.

167
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:42,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Very neat.

168
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:43,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the color guard go as well?

169
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,094
[SPEAKER_14]: The color guard does go as well, yes.

170
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:46,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And they march in the parade.

171
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,357
[SPEAKER_14]: There are specific uniforms that they have to wear.

172
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,698
[SPEAKER_14]: And Disney will also provide drum heads.

173
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:55,339
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll change out all of our drum heads to Disney logos.

174
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,321
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're very specific on what we look like and how we act.

175
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,462
[SPEAKER_14]: But the kids are really excited.

176
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:02,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

177
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:02,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuneo.

178
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:08,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want to congratulate you guys for doing, finally getting to this place.

179
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,344
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a big step for us.

180
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:11,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge step.

181
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge step.

182
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:14,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big enough step.

183
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We can still step bigger, but we're getting there.

184
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:19,887
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the right direction.

185
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you tell me how many other schools or districts are participating in this?

186
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,268
[SPEAKER_06]: This across, because this is a,

187
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,705
[SPEAKER_14]: across the country?

188
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,846
[SPEAKER_14]: It is across the country, yep.

189
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:36,848
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends, it runs all year, depending on, there's like different, there's a fall one you can participate in, a spring one, a winter one.

190
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:40,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know off the top of my head right now how many would be accepted.

191
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,211
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have to apply once, if it is approved.

192
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:51,734
[SPEAKER_14]: So we still have that round, but I'm sure from the sounds of it, it looks like we've already made it through the first level, so.

193
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds great.

194
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:54,975
[SPEAKER_06]: How many chaperones are we looking at?

195
00:08:56,065 --> 00:09:00,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, I have it based off of 50 kids going, and that would be 10 chaperones.

196
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:04,188
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be five staff members and five chaperones.

197
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,850
[SPEAKER_14]: The five staff members that are going also act as chaperones.

198
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,010
[SPEAKER_14]: That does not include myself.

199
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:14,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't put myself as a chaperone, because I consider myself in charge of the entire trip.

200
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:18,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't have five students specifically assigned to myself.

201
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone is assigned to me.

202
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And that way, I'm also able to deal with any conflicts or any problems.

203
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:28,093
[SPEAKER_14]: The students can always check in with their chaperones.

204
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:32,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am free to do things like take someone to the infirmary or deal with a problem.

205
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:38,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's technically 11 adults and five kids, and 50 kids.

206
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,018
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's five to one, basically.

207
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And are the chaperones paying the same amount?

208
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,320
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't pay the same amount as the students.

209
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
[SPEAKER_14]: They pay a little bit less.

210
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be in the packet.

211
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:49,721
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $15.33, I believe, for the students.

212
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,122
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's around $1,200 for the chaperones.

213
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:03,991
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason for that is Medford requires us to provide money for a nurse if needed, so the chaperones don't need to pay that cost.

214
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:09,012
[SPEAKER_14]: They also don't need to pay for things like participating in the workshops.

215
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:18,253
[SPEAKER_14]: The chaperones will attend the workshops with the students to make sure they are safe and okay, but they don't actually participate in the workshops, so they don't pay a fee for that.

216
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:23,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and I know that it says that it has the insurance.

217
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:40,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So is the insurance, I mean the details of the insurance, have they been over, like have you sat down or will you sit down with the parents and the students to make sure the details of the insurance itself because in the past we've had a couple of issues that parents thought it covered one thing and then it didn't cover another thing.

218
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, our insurance includes, it will cover everything.

219
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:51,107
[SPEAKER_14]: We are requiring all of our students to purchase it in case of any problems or in case we had to pull out of the trip last minute for some reason.

220
00:10:52,082 --> 00:11:16,945
[SPEAKER_06]: That will all be explained to our kickoff meeting which is March 15th with the travel agency that we're using That will be they'll have a whole sign off on that the parent and student also have to sign off on it with this part of their contract Okay to commit to the trip, and I'm looking at it, and I'm just going over It says here that this includes the cost of providing a nurse, and I'm just curious maybe through the mayor to the superintendent I don't remember seeing this in other trips and

221
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:22,723
[SPEAKER_14]: That's new, that's part of the new updated 2016 as of August this year.

222
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:32,813
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a new field trip packet and it says in that packet that you must provide the cost of a nurse just in case one of your students medically needs one.

223
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens if we don't use that money?

224
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:38,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Then that would get reimbursed to the students.

225
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,850
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

226
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And are the students paying for this?

227
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to be out of their own pocket?

228
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there fundraising involved with this?

229
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:46,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

230
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,112
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a fundraising schedule included in your packet.

231
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:50,473
[SPEAKER_14]: It is on page 19.

232
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:51,613
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the last one.

233
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So far, the students have only done one fundraiser.

234
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:55,794
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one coming up this month.

235
00:11:56,574 --> 00:12:02,116
[SPEAKER_14]: But the band parents and I sat down last summer and figured out a way for the students to raise up to $1,400.

236
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,417
[SPEAKER_14]: So they can technically pay for their entire trip if they need to.

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good, and the only other question I have is, Mr. Seary might have the answer to this one, or Ms.

238
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:24,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Joy, which is, our last year at this time, we actually had the science department take the students to Disney at this time, and I'm not sure if that's happening again this year.

239
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:30,911
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be back in our next meeting, looking to go in February, rather than... Oh, it would have been nice.

240
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,973
[SPEAKER_10]: The library's preparing that, so we're keeping Disney busy.

241
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:45,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Audrey actually sent me an email to see if we could try to combine them, but I think her program only runs in February, and we really need to go in April because I have a lot of families that are driving down.

242
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,694
[SPEAKER_14]: All of our equipment has to be driven down three days before.

243
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:55,401
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to bring all the uniforms, all the music equipment and whatnot, so I don't want my grandparents to have to drive like three days in the snow to try to get there.

244
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking it was in April, but you're right.

245
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,184
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in February last year.

246
00:12:59,204 --> 00:12:59,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

247
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,026
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, but it would have been nice.

248
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:04,730
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot more baggage coming with us, so we're a little bigger to try to get down there.

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been involved with that baggage.

250
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:06,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

251
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:13,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, and congratulations to all, and we're looking forward to hearing back.

252
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're really excited to go.

253
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

254
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:16,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

255
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:18,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

256
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:19,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot.

257
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this actually goes to the superintendent.

258
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:30,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not familiar with this clause that we've seen before, as my colleague said about requiring nursing coverage in it.

259
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:31,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you speak to that at all?

260
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:32,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Nursing.

261
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Nursing.

262
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you point out where we're talking about right now?

263
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was... I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question.

264
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it on the first page?

265
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:46,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw it when I read...

266
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:56,578
[SPEAKER_15]: It says cost per student, and it's mid, and it says this includes the cost of providing a nurse at $1,700.

267
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:18,812
[SPEAKER_15]: And when Haley spoke, she said that that's because in the new rules and regulations, if nursing is needed for one student on the trip, then the cost of that nurse is... Well, again, you know, one of the things that we face, and we faced this a couple of times, is that we can't deny a person

268
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:21,499
[SPEAKER_10]: the right to go, and they may have needs.

269
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:27,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a result, it's important to have the possibility that we would have a nurse on there.

270
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:36,429
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the school system to assume that cost altogether undercuts our ability to fund or let's say sponsor these trips.

271
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So by spreading it out, everybody shares a little bit of that responsibility.

272
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:41,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

273
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:59,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Personally, I think that there should be a different way of doing it, because if I'm the student on the trip who needs a nurse, and I know that the year that I go, it's going to cost my fellow students more money, that feels extraordinarily awkward to me.

274
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I don't think that we've looked at that.

275
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to sort of see if there's another way that we could approach this subject.

276
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:13,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand what you're saying, what the issue is, but I'm uncomfortable with the way that this would work out.

277
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:20,029
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me that we ought to have some money aside, because you wouldn't want to have

278
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:27,053
[SPEAKER_15]: the rest of the students feeling like my trip is more expensive because I had to provide nursing for someone else.

279
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's just, it's just not, it's just uncomfortable.

280
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:42,620
[SPEAKER_10]: The way the civil rights office would look at it is, is that if in fact an individual student, because they had a handicap or some other kind of need, we had to pay more, that would be reducing access.

281
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,422
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a, you know, making it more difficult for them to participate.

282
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one of the reasons why, you know, it has to be spread out.

283
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:54,797
[SPEAKER_10]: So the choice is whether the school system picks it up or we spread it out across the cost of the trip.

284
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:56,938
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really the only two choices you have.

285
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:59,520
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have it as a, as a reality.

286
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,240
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is, is that who pays?

287
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:08,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it spread out among all the people as a legitimate cost or is it the school system that picks it up every time there's a trip?

288
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:17,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm going to ask that you bring to us the new, um, policy that, that says this so that we can take a look at it in its entirety.

289
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Expressing my concern that this doesn't feel comfortable.

290
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:21,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

291
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:25,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly have no reason to You know, it's not something that's going to affect this trip.

292
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:41,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So I certainly would make a motion that That we approve the trip this evening, but I would like to ask that we see that just Point of information to my colleague and working in another district I

293
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,579
[SPEAKER_05]: they do handle it in this manner.

294
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's usually not obvious to what child, and the nurse provides care for all things on that trip.

295
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:56,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's good to have, it's not just for the child with the disabilities, but any child on medication as well.

296
00:16:56,986 --> 00:17:00,788
[SPEAKER_05]: If a child takes a prescription medication, you need to have a nurse disperse that.

297
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:08,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just this trip, it's all trips, and it's a regulation that needs to come forward.

298
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:10,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And most districts don't take on this cost,

299
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: because it would actually prohibit us, because we would have such a big line item for this, that it would prohibit children from getting this opportunity.

300
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:24,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

301
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandekloot.

302
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:34,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I hear what you're saying, though, then it's saying that on all trips, whether it's the trip to Italy or the trip to- Overnight trips.

303
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:40,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Or whatever, that a nurse needs to go because she's there to provide- A possibility.

304
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:42,379
[SPEAKER_15]: possibility of medical care for everyone.

305
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:57,249
[SPEAKER_15]: That's sort of different than the way it's been presented to us this evening, because I'm certainly sure that's, and I think that that's something that is incumbent on the school committee to discuss and make clear amongst ourselves in our policy.

306
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to clarify, a nurse doesn't go in case of a possibility.

307
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:09,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So a nurse is required to go if there's prescription meds that need to be held and to be doled out.

308
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,766
[SPEAKER_05]: and it has to be a registered nurse in order to do that.

309
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:16,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You could not provide a chaperone to stand in that place to give those things.

310
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:28,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that's the situation, or if there is a medical condition, then that's when it's necessary to have a licensed RN on those trips.

311
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And the districts that I have been talking to about this, because this is a bigger, newer thing, and the nurses that are actually providing care, they need more notification so that they can

312
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:43,170
[SPEAKER_05]: time notification so they can get people ready to do that.

313
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:48,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a huge cost on a district to put money in the line item for this.

314
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:56,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And it might shut down the amount of overnight opportunities we give to the students in our community.

315
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

316
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:57,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

317
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:59,099
[SPEAKER_15]: So I understand all of that.

318
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,359
[SPEAKER_15]: That's interesting information.

319
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:08,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think that the school committee should have the opportunity to discuss it a little bit further with the wording before us and the rest of the policy.

320
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:09,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Will do.

321
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:13,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it needs to be included in our policy manual if we've updated a policy.

322
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:14,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

323
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:15,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

324
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Discaria, I believe you were blinking.

325
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:18,544
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all set.

326
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto, you had a follow up?

327
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:21,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

328
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:26,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering since you're here and I don't know if you know or if the superintendent knows

329
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Have the musical instruments been sold at this point?

330
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,321
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

331
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anything moved forward with that?

332
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,262
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got some estimates on them that have changed since the last time.

333
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:39,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll pursue that with people as to find out what, what the status is.

334
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll provide us with the report.

335
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:42,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

336
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll add that to the list.

337
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Add the report to reports too.

338
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:46,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

339
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:46,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

340
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:47,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

341
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:48,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

342
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:53,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess through you to the superintendent, I also need a little bit more of clarification as we've been speaking about the $1,700.

343
00:19:55,834 --> 00:20:02,583
[SPEAKER_06]: The $1,700 is money that the group, whoever's going, is going to raise to cover the $1,700?

344
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we ran into a problem.

345
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:10,755
[SPEAKER_14]: The band traveled to Hershey Park last spring.

346
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the students needed medication.

347
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,925
[SPEAKER_14]: And because it was an overnight trip, we went for the weekend.

348
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:21,730
[SPEAKER_14]: The nurse that we usually have come with us is a band parent who is a registered nurse.

349
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:29,374
[SPEAKER_14]: And they come because NESBA requires us, which is the New England Scholastic Band Association, requires us to have a nurse with us at all times to travel.

350
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:40,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, through the new Medford policies working with the nurse's office at the high school, it's a HIPAA violation if a parent is the registered nurse on the trip.

351
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:43,608
[SPEAKER_14]: because they can't know personal information about the other students.

352
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:48,611
[SPEAKER_14]: So they had said they were going to put a new policy in place to work with that.

353
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:57,357
[SPEAKER_14]: So because I was the only Medford employee, I had to administer and pass out all of the medications on the trip, for the entire trip, and carry it with me.

354
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,258
[SPEAKER_14]: So they said they would be changing that policy.

355
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we had to do is send notifications home.

356
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:03,277
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to meet with all the parents.

357
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:07,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to sign off on something, a waiver granting me permission to do that.

358
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:25,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And now that they're saying moving forward, they would rather prefer to have a nurse on the trip so that any medications or any problems or anyone that would need any kind of assistance, the nurse is with us and then it wouldn't be a HIPAA violation and that person would be kind of unbiased in any situation.

359
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:25,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

360
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:25,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

361
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:27,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess I have a couple of questions on this.

362
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be incorporated into the students.

363
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:31,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

364
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:33,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes out to be like $35 a student.

365
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

366
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: But now here's the other question.

367
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:40,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Who pays for that person to go to Florida or Italy or wherever?

368
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that their trip is also incorporated into the students fees?

369
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:51,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the $1,700 is the, is the cost of having the nurse come and stay in a single hotel room, um, with a refrigerator for medications.

370
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and per,

371
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a access to the parks where the students are going to be.

372
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's incorporated Yes, so that $1,700 isn't just is inclusive separate plus.

373
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,094
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's the entire trip.

374
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:07,756
[SPEAKER_08]: All right salaries are separate Okay salary for the nurse.

375
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:08,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

376
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:19,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get that All right, so it's all included report for next week's next meeting and then the other thing was is that as far as insurance is

377
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:21,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but this is separate, so forget that.

378
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:22,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, forget it.

379
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:22,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

380
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Kratz.

381
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:23,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

382
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Hayley.

383
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

384
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to thank you for the report.

385
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:29,273
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really detailed, and I wanted you to- Yeah, you look crazy when you travel, so.

386
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:35,037
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really, I know, in the mail summary, I thought that was really interesting, and I wanted to know if you could- Yeah, if you ever go to Disney, it's actually a pretty good list.

387
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:43,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Explain that, you know, all the options that the students have, and the allergy-free and- Yeah, well, Disney World can be really expensive, so I think a lot of parents get nervous at first, but it's actually very doable, so.

388
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:47,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I just thought it was really nice that you had the allergy-free, like the gluten-free,

389
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,328
[SPEAKER_12]: metabolic disorders.

390
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:52,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we have a lot of allergies in the band.

391
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

392
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,933
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just thought that was really, really nicely done.

393
00:22:55,953 --> 00:23:08,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, and also there was, um, um, a nice write up about the rules and the guidelines for the curfew and, you know, no tolerance in the rooms and going to bed at night.

394
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:10,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, um, that was really detailed and,

395
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:13,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure you'll go over that with the parents at the upcoming meeting.

396
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:14,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

397
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:18,854
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a kickoff meeting on the 15th and they have to sign off saying they've read the packet, understand the rules and regulations.

398
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:19,054
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

399
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:20,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

400
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:20,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

401
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:21,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

402
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:22,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scary.

403
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:40,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, through you to the superintendent, I would ask that you secure a copy of the, and uh, net the national band organizations guidelines when it comes to nurses on road trips to help us better inform us and to help us make a decision on how we will implement this into our policies for the school year and

404
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:45,818
[SPEAKER_11]: future overnight field trips for our students and make sure that they're safe and secure.

405
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:48,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

406
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,196
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval, offered by Ms.

[SPEAKER_08]: Keep us posted.

426
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:08,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, I will do.

00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:08,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

428
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:09,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

429
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you.

430
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, by the way.

431
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:11,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

432
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:19,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Item three, recommendation to accept Tufts Neighborhood Service Fund grant to measure family resources coalition.

433
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty self-explanatory.

434
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:27,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Tufts Neighborhood Service Fund provides these, uh, funds to the schools will be used by our early childhood.

435
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:33,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a total of 18,000 to distribute and this family resources received $250, right?

436
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:37,134
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Scary.

437
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:37,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

438
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:38,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

439
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Kratz roll call vote, please.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

442
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:50,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

443
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:51,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

444
00:24:51,844 --> 00:24:52,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

445
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:54,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Acceptance of the gift.

446
00:24:54,745 --> 00:25:01,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Item four, recommendation to formally merge Medford High School and Medford Vogue Technical High School into one local education state code.

447
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:02,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

448
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:05,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report in front of you.

449
00:25:05,847 --> 00:25:06,848
[SPEAKER_10]: The headmaster is here.

450
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:09,588
[SPEAKER_10]: The director and principal of the vocational school is here.

451
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:16,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight we'll give you a brief introduction and then we should schedule a more formal meeting to discuss it in greater depth.

452
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:27,712
[SPEAKER_10]: But just to go over it so that you have a brief introduction and that you can ask any quick questions you may have of the two individuals, why don't you come on up and we can go over it.

453
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, as you know, we're currently in the fourth year of the process of having the two schools collaborate more completely together.

454
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:44,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been a pretty high priority for the school committee because you've made that very clear that you want to see the two schools work closely together.

455
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,466
[SPEAKER_10]: And this goal would continue to

456
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:55,787
[SPEAKER_10]: expand the program to the comprehensive nature and give opportunities to both students at the Volk and at the high school that were previously not available.

457
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:01,172
[SPEAKER_10]: We've advanced the program so that there's a lot of participation across the schools.

458
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:05,616
[SPEAKER_10]: This time the ninth and tenth grade students are fully integrated academically.

459
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Some eleventh grade students are also integrated.

460
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,702
[SPEAKER_10]: High school students can now explore occupational programs

461
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,088
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on and so forth, the number of electives.

462
00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:16,190
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a number of benefits.

463
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't read the whole report.

464
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:18,271
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the idea.

465
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:24,696
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you have any direct questions you want to ask to the headmaster or the director, please do so.

466
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:27,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we can schedule a committee of the whole to move forward.

467
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:33,622
[SPEAKER_10]: It is important, if we're going to do this, that we move forward, because obviously we need a plan going into next year.

468
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:35,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

469
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:35,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

470
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,465
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I have you both here, so I want to say congratulations for all the work that you, your staff, and everybody involved in this has done.

471
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:48,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been an incredible four years as a school committee member and as a parent.

472
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:55,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really happy and thrilled to see the collaboration between the two and to see that divided

473
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:59,088
[SPEAKER_06]: the division between the two is finally diminishing.

474
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:05,591
[SPEAKER_06]: As the superintendent said, I think this is a wonderful idea, but there were concerns.

475
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I had called him today because there's just so much to go over that we really can't do it in such a very short time.

476
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:19,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am thrilled that we are, you know, we have decided, or I'm hoping that we decide to do this as a committee of the whole.

477
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way we could have more presented to us.

478
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: and that way we could sit down and actually go through the detail.

479
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:29,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to put hysteria out there saying that one school is taking over the other school.

480
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:36,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that people understand that this has been a work in progress, that the people involved are involved.

481
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:41,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that the school committee or their superintendent has thrown at you or vice versa.

482
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to give the opportunity for people in our city to come and voice their opinion if they have concerns or whatever the situation may be.

483
00:27:51,149 --> 00:28:01,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, I, again, congratulate all of you, including the students, because I've seen the atmosphere change and it's nice to see.

484
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:05,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to- Are you making a motion to send to Committee of the Whole?

485
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:05,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

486
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:08,379
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

487
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you wish to speak on this?

488
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:11,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just had a question through you to the superintendent.

489
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:19,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Given the complexity of this nature, Mr. Superintendent, are there any contractual obligations that have to be visited or reworked?

490
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:27,784
[SPEAKER_10]: we believe that the nature of what we're proposing does not require any contractual, uh, uh, negotiations.

491
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:33,906
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you know, from time to time, the union may raise something, but, uh, we have, uh, vetted a lot with them.

492
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:41,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, uh, at this point in time, uh, the issues that we have in front of you, changing the LAA code would not fall into that category.

493
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, uh, Mr. Superintendent, we, uh, Madam Mayor, through you to Ms.

494
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Riccio and Dr. Perrella,

495
00:28:49,637 --> 00:28:54,441
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that has, as long as I've been a member of the school board, that we've tried to bring to fruition.

496
00:28:54,981 --> 00:29:01,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, as one committee member, thank you for your expertise and your tenacity in getting this done.

497
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:04,828
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully, if there are any more questions, we'll get them squared away in the community hall.

498
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:08,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can get this enacted as soon as possible and keep everybody on the same page.

499
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:11,493
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, thank you very much for your due diligence.

500
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:12,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

501
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:12,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

502
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:13,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Kratz.

503
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hi.

504
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:15,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say congratulations.

505
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,638
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know how hard both of you have been working on this.

506
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just had one question.

507
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:22,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Would there be a new name for the school?

508
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Would the school change names?

509
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Would it maybe something else?

510
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:31,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Or would it still be separate, like Medford High School and Medford Vocational or Medford Technical High School?

511
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:32,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Would there be a name change?

512
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:33,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just curious.

513
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's definitely open for conversation.

514
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:49,571
[SPEAKER_07]: At the present moment, we feel as though it's important for the integrity of both schools to keep both names until it's decided upon by a much larger group than Dr. Preller and I. OK.

515
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:57,356
[SPEAKER_13]: That is an option that we could create a common name if we so choose, if you so choose.

516
00:29:58,697 --> 00:29:58,898
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

517
00:29:59,058 --> 00:29:59,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

518
00:29:59,398 --> 00:29:59,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

519
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:00,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

520
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

521
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:03,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

522
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:16,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I've been elected, I've really focused on vocational education, and I saw the need in us, our thing, and I spoke day one, I think, to the superintendent about it.

523
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:33,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I really always envision one school with two programs, and the crossover, and the way that you and your team work together is really making that happen on a daily basis for all the children in our community,

524
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:38,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to know all the downfalls as well as all the benefits.

525
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:41,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make a very educated choice.

526
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:57,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to rush into it because I'm sure there's some community members that value the old traditional vocational as well as others who want the high school to remain the prestige that it's been as well.

527
00:30:57,994 --> 00:31:01,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the transition is going to be uncomfortable because change sometimes is.

528
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:14,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make sure that we really appreciate community input and really hear what our community has to say, because this is a major change for education in our system.

529
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really would like to make sure that all our meetings are posted clearly and that everybody is invited and all voices are heard throughout the whole process.

530
00:31:25,578 --> 00:31:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see how well you collaborate together and that

531
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,742
[SPEAKER_05]: right there and how open you are has opened the doors.

532
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:37,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would like to see that continue and I thank you for all your hard work.

533
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:39,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

534
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:39,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Vander Kloot.

535
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:40,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

536
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,556
[SPEAKER_15]: I had, for instance, some questions about the reporting of MCAS scores and other tests.

537
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:50,119
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, for one of the things, actually for the vocational school kids in the past couple

538
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: They've done so well.

539
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:58,397
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been nice to have them separate just to say, look how our students are succeeding.

540
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:01,138
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was sort of curious about some of those things.

541
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:19,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I also wanted to make sure that as we discuss this, that everybody understands that this is not a weakening of the vocational school in any way, shape, or at all, but in fact, all along,

542
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:45,295
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been working to strengthen the vocational school and our high school as well And the collaboration between them is what what we see does this but it's not necessarily Apparent, you know when you hear it it could certainly Be taken the wrong way So I think that's why it's very very important that we go and we have some more discussion on this so that we can very quickly

543
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,686
[SPEAKER_15]: clarify this to our community about what our future intentions might be.

544
00:32:52,426 --> 00:33:07,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I can, I guess just say publicly, being the vocational director for the last four years is that when I was hired, the intention was to bring the two schools together and to think and act more collaboratively.

545
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:20,614
[SPEAKER_07]: but also to recoup funds that was going to another district outside of this district so that the residents of Medford and the students of Medford can benefit wholeheartedly to strong vocational technical education.

546
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:27,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think over the last four years, the dedication of the superintendent and you as a school committee in supporting

547
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:36,327
[SPEAKER_07]: the vocational education and moving forward has been a significant value to the residents, but particularly to the students of Medford.

548
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:44,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And so opening nine programs in four years is typically unheard of, of any other vocational school across the Commonwealth.

549
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:53,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really the commitment that you all have had and the trust in me and our ability to be able to do that job and move that school forward.

550
00:33:54,622 --> 00:34:08,908
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is equally important to offer those offerings to the comprehensive high school as well, because in any report, I mean, the Boston Herald, the Globe, in the last two weeks have had time and time again about a skilled workforce.

551
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:15,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And that skilled workforce is every kid in Medford, whether they're graduating with a Medford high school.

552
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,812
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, all kids in Medford graduate with a Medford high school diploma.

553
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:32,367
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not separate between the name of the diploma, and I think that that's important for the community to recognize, is that we believe wholeheartedly in strong vocational technical programs, or else I wouldn't be employed.

554
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:41,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's important for us to recognize that all kids are going to go to work, whether they're in the biotech fields or the engineering fields.

555
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:45,234
[SPEAKER_07]: We're simply opening up an opportunity for more students.

556
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:53,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 55 grade nine Medford High School students taking career and technical education programs as an elective.

557
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to be able to expand that.

558
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to say that publicly.

559
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,690
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could add something as well.

560
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,212
[SPEAKER_13]: We believe that the continued integration will be at the benefit of both schools.

561
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:07,493
[SPEAKER_13]: So it will strengthen each school.

562
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,934
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's our experience.

563
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:17,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And we think that this technical move of creating a common LEA number will just strengthen that, what we've been doing the past few years.

564
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:19,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

565
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

566
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

567
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just want to go back and I totally agree with what my colleagues have said and both of you actually, all of us.

568
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:33,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that we do have this committee of the whole, but also

569
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:37,980
[SPEAKER_06]: let it be understood that this has been a, you know, work in progress.

570
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:50,268
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something, and I have no intentions, and I'm sure we all have the same one, which is I'm not expecting to go into a committee of the whole for a couple of hours and have all the answers and shut the book and say, okay, guess what, this is what's going to happen.

571
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:56,533
[SPEAKER_06]: What I really would like to see is I would like to see as we post the meeting to make sure that we invite alumni,

572
00:35:57,273 --> 00:36:13,042
[SPEAKER_06]: that we make sure that we, you know, invite not only our alumni as students, but our alumni who are now our businesses, because I know that there's a lot of collaboration between the high school, the vocational school, and our businesses right now, but really the input of everything.

573
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:22,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to understand, as I've mentioned before, and the fact is that having the opportunity of being on MASC, I've also seen the opportunity of

574
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: how vocational schools have been changing throughout not only the state of Massachusetts, but throughout the country.

575
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:32,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have always had a strong vocational school.

576
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:37,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one is saying that what we've done in the past wasn't right.

577
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:41,517
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just saying, let's go forward because we all have to change.

578
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And change, as my colleagues have said, is a very delicate situation.

579
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:56,714
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had these conversations with alumni and strong people that have been affiliated with the vocational school in the past and said, what do you want to do?

580
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting rid of a vocational school.

581
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:03,058
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not getting rid of one or eliminating the other.

582
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:07,361
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a collaboration, a collaboration that we've been working on for four years.

583
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a school committee, we've been working on it even longer than that.

584
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:20,466
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, the word out there, you know, the rumors are going to start, the gossiping is going to start, but I want to make sure that people understand the integrity of what we're doing.

585
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:26,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And the integrity of what we're doing is to give the opportunity for our students to go forward.

586
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:29,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether they're in the high school side or the vocational side, it doesn't matter.

587
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure

588
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,233
[SPEAKER_06]: that these kids leave our school with the ability of doing both.

589
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:41,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And also making sure that our students are proud when they leave, no matter which side they're leaving from.

590
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:43,399
[SPEAKER_06]: One is not a failure of the other.

591
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Many, many years ago, it was like, oh, you go to here if you can't be book smart.

592
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:49,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't exist anymore.

593
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:51,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Book smart is across the board.

594
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:52,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for everyone.

595
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tell students, you know, I tell

596
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:03,691
[SPEAKER_06]: people that have known what our vocational school was many years ago, that, well, why aren't our kids doing this anymore when they come out of the vocational?

597
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, they don't have the time.

598
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:07,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before, you had the choice.

599
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:09,374
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do the academic.

600
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:10,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You did it.

601
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But it wasn't as strong or mandated by the state as we have now.

602
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:17,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our students don't have that opportunity.

603
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:19,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to, that's a really big thing.

604
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,580
[SPEAKER_06]: for me, because we all hear it.

605
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just don't want those rumors to squash the good work that's being done.

606
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a work in progress, and it's going to take more than just one Committee of the Whole.

607
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:34,905
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to send this paper to Committee of the Whole, offered by Ms.

608
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno, is there a second by Ms.

609
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:37,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Kretz?

610
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:39,207
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

611
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:39,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

612
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: All opposed?

613
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:41,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion stands.

614
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:42,968
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you at Committee of the Whole.

615
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:43,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

616
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:44,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

617
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:44,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

618
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:45,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to just stay up?

619
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:45,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

620
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:50,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on vocational and science department grants.

621
00:38:52,068 --> 00:39:00,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, we have the director and the director both here to tell you about some of the fabulous grants we're getting.

622
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Who would like to go first?

623
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it rocks, papers, scissors?

624
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:08,201
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

625
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:14,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be the spokesperson, but if you have any technical questions related to science, that would be rocking.

626
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:18,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

627
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Superintendent Bellson.

628
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: School committee.

629
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:31,360
[SPEAKER_07]: As we continue to integrate programs at our school, we actively pursue grant funding to enhance the educational opportunities for our students.

630
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:37,584
[SPEAKER_07]: This report will provide you with an update on grant activity between the vocational school and the science department.

631
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:41,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Massachusetts Life Sciences Grant.

632
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,093
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2014, we received $100,000 to support the new Chapter 74 program of biotechnology.

633
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:57,278
[SPEAKER_07]: These funds helped support the biotechnology and equipment and consumable supplies that completed in 2016.

634
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:05,843
[SPEAKER_07]: The biotechnology program is now equipped with industry standard equipment and supplies to educate in biotechnology-related occupations.

635
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:20,277
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2016, Rocco Sieri and Sam Christie, who is a member of our engineering and robotics department, co-wrote a $100,000 grant for robotics and automation.

636
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:28,926
[SPEAKER_07]: The key to this grant is that it is directly related to the Massachusetts Life Sciences, so it could not just be for robotics or engineering.

637
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:35,391
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of this grant was to design and build robotic arms to serve the biotechnology program.

638
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:43,795
[SPEAKER_07]: The arms will be manufactured using some of the equipment requested from CNC machinery to a laser cutter and programming the arms.

639
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:49,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will learn all aspects of automation to be used in the life sciences occupations.

640
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:53,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Public notification of this will be forthcoming.

641
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,742
[SPEAKER_07]: This particular grant that Sam Christie is working on

642
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,218
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very important to understand where the $100,000 is going to go.

643
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:05,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we develop more information, we'll probably give you another report.

644
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:17,429
[SPEAKER_07]: But the great part about Rocco Siuri and Sam Christie is that we could have spent $65,000 on one robotic arm that was manufactured by a manufacturer.

645
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:26,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, the department opted to write the grant for $100,000 that would actually give the students the ability to build

646
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:30,226
[SPEAKER_07]: up to 20 robotic arms for automation.

647
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:39,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So each student will have a distinct opportunity to learn all aspects of the design process and using the CNC machinery from raw materials.

648
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:45,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an important learning difference comparatively speaking to other funds that have been requested.

649
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:53,513
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Education Foundation, which was written by Sam Christie, to support a student-initiated project.

650
00:41:54,253 --> 00:42:00,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that two students were really the cheerleaders of this particular grant, and one of which being Ms.

651
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz's son, Noah.

652
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:05,176
[SPEAKER_07]: They are both in the robotics, and Derek.

653
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:07,897
[SPEAKER_07]: They are both in the robotics program.

654
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:19,120
[SPEAKER_07]: They have been awarded $750 from the Medford Education Foundation and will support a student group to design, build, and test an underwater robot.

655
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,080
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

656
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:21,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very cool.

657
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:23,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

658
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:24,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

659
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:34,825
[SPEAKER_07]: This idea was actually formed from the integrated project between robotics and biotechnology for the filtration system as it relates to the current and existing Tilapia Farm.

660
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will connect with the Massachusetts Marine Trades Educational Trust to gain insight and knowledge of underwater robots throughout the learning process.

661
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:56,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have already contacted and connected with this trust fund, and those students are going to directly relate to real world experiences by those connections.

662
00:42:56,655 --> 00:43:02,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So while I will be CC'd on the emails that they send, the students will be doing all of the work.

663
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:10,593
[SPEAKER_07]: the Northeast Advanced Manufacturing Consortium for Electronics and Robotics Adult Certification Program.

664
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:19,722
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a partnership grant with the Northeast Advanced Manufacturing Consortium, Metro North Employment Board, and Bunker Hill Community College.

665
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:30,251
[SPEAKER_07]: A total of $48,500 was to be used to pay for the course materials, instructors, adult education coordinator stipend, and other related costs.

666
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:34,560
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 successful programs have occurred across the state.

667
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,102
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first of its kind in the Metro North Regional Employment Area.

668
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:42,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There are currently 13 students enrolled.

669
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:48,165
[SPEAKER_07]: All adults have been quarried for this adult education program and is scheduled to begin in March.

670
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:53,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Equipment purchased for this program will also be able to be used by our day students.

671
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:59,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The last grant related to science is the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center grant.

672
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,893
[SPEAKER_07]: This has a total of value of $13,750.

673
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:17,278
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Cool Green Power, who will work with our students in the HVAC and refrigeration shop, as well as electrical, to install and monitor efficiency devices in the following locations.

674
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:21,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Rooftop units for the gymnastics and fitness rooms,

675
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:35,285
[SPEAKER_07]: health assisting lab with new high-efficiency system installed throughout the previous grant, vocational main office, and three walk-in coolers in the cafeteria, and a computer lab that has an AC system.

676
00:44:36,225 --> 00:44:42,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Students will learn the installation and monitoring of industry-specific efficiency ratings.

677
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:48,950
[SPEAKER_07]: The grants written were authorized by multiple individuals in order to gain the expertise of those the grant will serve.

678
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:59,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Each of these grants have a specific purpose and align with both the vocational technical education frameworks and the science, technology and engineering academic frameworks.

679
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:06,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Integration of these standards deepen the understanding of how science relates to the application of technical education.

680
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Authentic learning and the positive impact it has on student success was taken into consideration during all aspects of the writing of these applications.

681
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:19,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

682
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:20,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

683
00:45:22,477 --> 00:45:26,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very good.

684
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion?

685
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?

686
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:31,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept the report?

687
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept the report.

688
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:35,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Great work, by the way.

689
00:45:35,124 --> 00:45:37,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to say, yeah, I mean, this is amazing.

690
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:39,066
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really amazing.

691
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:40,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

692
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:43,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have a question about the students being on the roof.

693
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:45,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the roof we replaced?

694
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:51,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to be very careful with that, Ruth?

695
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:52,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be careful with students.

696
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be enough supervising, not just the teacher, with kids.

697
00:45:57,384 --> 00:45:58,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, kids hoss around.

698
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:01,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping just to throw them up there and see what happens.

699
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:14,810
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our students on top of their technical education also receive a construction 10-hour OSHA certification that is mandated by law.

700
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: No student will be unattended at any time during any of this process because it really is driven by the instructional staff and the monitoring of the devices.

701
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:36,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Once the devices are actually installed, which will be installed under the direction of cool green energy and power, the students will be monitoring them, but they're able to monitor it remotely.

702
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:38,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was hoping for.

703
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:39,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

704
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:41,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome job.

705
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:41,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

706
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:42,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Kretz?

707
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just wanted to say thank you.

708
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And the students, I've been hearing students are very excited about everything that's going on.

709
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:51,402
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's very exciting.

710
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I just hear all the good things every day.

711
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:54,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so excited.

712
00:46:54,763 --> 00:46:56,644
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so excited.

713
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:57,404
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's great.

714
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:00,606
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to receive and place this report on file.

715
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:01,366
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

716
00:47:01,846 --> 00:47:01,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

717
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:02,746
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

718
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:03,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

719
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

720
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:10,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, before we move away from these two, I think it's kind of important to see.

721
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's two examples of the high school and the vocational school working together.

722
00:47:14,692 --> 00:47:18,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Biotech was never envisioned at the vocational school.

723
00:47:18,434 --> 00:47:22,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Environmental science was never envisioned as a vocational program because it was really a trade school.

724
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:28,279
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of the evolutions that has taken place, and this is one of the results.

725
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,521
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is where both sides of the school need to be able to participate.

726
00:47:32,992 --> 00:47:39,894
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's equally valuable to whether you're pursuing a high school diploma as a high school or a vocational technical area.

727
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:42,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is kind of the kind of thing we're looking at right now.

728
00:47:43,596 --> 00:47:51,579
[SPEAKER_10]: In many of the jobs that come out, a high school graduate who knows this stuff will actually be able to go on and get a two-year degree before they pursue either a four-year degree.

729
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:59,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's all kinds of options that are coming out that didn't exist before when we had a more traditional alignment.

730
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:01,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Great synergy.

731
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:03,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

732
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:06,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Report number six on this past one.

733
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:30,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say, if possible, to both of you, if possible, like when the students are doing, I mean, I know you can't do it all the time, but is it possible to have certain things like videotaped that we could actually put it into a video and show it off and maybe even bring it to one of our meetings and see what's really going on on an everyday basis without

734
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the school is open for all of us to visit, and I know that we're all welcome.

735
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:40,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though we enjoy doing that, I think sometimes the students might think, oh, there's other people watching us.

736
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:54,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas if they're free and they don't have that type of, yes, they have to have the supervision, but not our eyes being there, that maybe it would be nice to see and have them even come in down the road after this is done and give their input.

737
00:48:55,606 --> 00:49:04,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now that we have a media tech program fully approved by the Department of Elementary and Education, we certainly have that ability to videotape these programs in action.

738
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:19,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that we are considering through the public access station as well is through the education component is having monthly departmental what's happening in those departments so the community also gets to see.

739
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

740
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I welcome anyone to come into this school, not just an open house.

741
00:49:24,835 --> 00:49:28,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a very cool experience.

742
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it becomes your happy place when you go in and see what the kids are actually doing and performing.

743
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And we weren't able to offer that before.

744
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:44,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So the kids that are in robotics and biotech, the work that they're doing in there is completely unbelievable.

745
00:49:44,563 --> 00:49:47,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beyond me completely.

746
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:53,025
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also often wonder when I walk in there, what would have happened to those kids?

747
00:49:54,245 --> 00:49:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we didn't have that program four years ago.

748
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Where would they have gone?

749
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:02,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And the creativity that is, they created this.

750
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:05,171
[SPEAKER_07]: The underwater robot was student-driven.

751
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not teacher-directed.

752
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It was student-driven.

753
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:14,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We have three high school students that are now taking advantage of the environmental science program.

754
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,831
[SPEAKER_07]: which we wouldn't have had before.

755
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:22,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And these kids are working alongside Tufts University and Harvard.

756
00:50:22,132 --> 00:50:32,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, we will start videotaping because we are at that point where the kids are doing some really phenomenal things and they should be recognized for what they're doing.

757
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

758
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:35,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Great segue, by the way, to the station.

759
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:35,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

760
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:36,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, look at the relationships.

761
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:42,236
[SPEAKER_10]: The earlier you saw a gift to the robotics club, they go together.

762
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,177
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these things have synergy.

763
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:45,537
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually fit together.

764
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:53,490
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of the reason why you see them all on the same agenda, so that you can see the relationships of different activities, how they interact with each other.

765
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,371
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not just standalone activities.

766
00:50:57,753 --> 00:50:57,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

767
00:50:57,953 --> 00:50:58,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Kratz on this topic?

768
00:50:58,994 --> 00:50:59,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

769
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:01,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to mention that Ms.

770
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:08,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Frazier is putting out some small, short YouTube videos, and it's getting shared by the blog.

771
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:10,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Lisa Evangelista shares them.

772
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,344
[SPEAKER_12]: So anybody who's interested in signing up,

773
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:16,725
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I get the YouTube videos and they're just fantastic.

774
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I even got to see just everything.

775
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:23,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to see Mr. DeLaver and they were doing the Geometry Bee.

776
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:24,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, everything.

777
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:25,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything's out there.

778
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:30,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And today it was, you know, teenage, you know, don't drink teenagers.

779
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:33,796
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had the can video and just everything.

780
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:35,297
[SPEAKER_12]: The Christmas caroling.

781
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,058
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just wonderful.

782
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:43,343
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are videos that are out right now that you can watch as well as all the pictures and the blogs and the write-ups.

783
00:51:44,282 --> 00:51:44,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

784
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:45,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Kretz.

785
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:50,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Report number six, report on elementary science curriculums 2017 to 2020.

786
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have our assistant superintendent, buttressed by our director of science.

787
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:00,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rocco's not going to get off so easy this time.

788
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:02,148
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to get to the microphone.

789
00:52:03,148 --> 00:52:12,091
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the past few years in elementary education, you know that we put a lot of time and effort and energy into making sure we had a great literacy program.

790
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:12,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We have journeys.

791
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:16,278
[SPEAKER_02]: and Envision, which is our math program.

792
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, it's time for us to do some science work.

793
00:52:20,381 --> 00:52:29,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Rocco Sieri, who is our Director of Science, has prepared a report for you on the subsequent plans for the elementary science curriculum.

794
00:52:31,703 --> 00:52:46,148
[SPEAKER_02]: These plans are in response to school committee's request to pilot new curriculum-based and the most recent science frameworks, as well as offering some professional opportunities for our elementary staff.

795
00:52:46,868 --> 00:53:01,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Cieri is here with us this evening to tell you all of the PD he has set up from now until the end of the school year for all of our elementary teachers and not just the classroom teachers, but our specialists as well, K to five.

796
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:05,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone.

797
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:13,938
[SPEAKER_09]: As you all know, the Board of Education adopted new science and technology engineering frameworks back in April of 2016.

798
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:30,445
[SPEAKER_09]: While some of the standards are similar to what was in place before then, there have been updates based on what's in the field, changes in science and engineering over the past 15 years, as you've heard from previous reports.

799
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of integration that we want to be exposing our students to, and also adding inquiry and design skills that students need to successfully engage in these science and technology engineering disciplines.

800
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:59,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Based on the 2006 framework, what we notice at the K-8 level is that there are sort of new ways of addressing the content.

801
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:05,486
[SPEAKER_09]: In one case, all of the standards are broken up by grade level.

802
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,007
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to be grade bands.

803
00:54:07,894 --> 00:54:09,756
[SPEAKER_09]: They were also broken up by discipline.

804
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:11,458
[SPEAKER_09]: That's no longer the case.

805
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:18,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Each grade band, each grade has the four disciplines integrated right on the document.

806
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:22,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are changes that the teachers are going to have to be sort of made apprised of.

807
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:41,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also some reductions, but at the elementary level, there's sort of like a net increase of some of these standards, and we want to make sure that we're aligned with those increases and also making sure that the teachers are comfortable with the new framework, familiar and comfortable with the new framework.

808
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:52,790
[SPEAKER_09]: In the coming months, professional development opportunities are proposed to revamp the K to 5 science curriculum, the first of which is going to be an unpacking of the 2016 curriculum framework.

809
00:54:53,700 --> 00:55:05,567
[SPEAKER_09]: The document that's produced will serve as our local reference document so that when we review curriculum programs and recommend programs for piloting, we have something in place that reflects those standards.

810
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:15,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Students, in terms of the MCAS, are still going to be assessed in grades 5, 8, and at the high school.

811
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:21,235
[SPEAKER_09]: In this year, in 2017, the test questions are based on last year's or

812
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:25,412
[SPEAKER_09]: the old framework, the 2001-2006 framework.

813
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:33,454
[SPEAKER_09]: A document which listed the exact standards to be assessed was developed by the Department of Education.

814
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,414
[SPEAKER_09]: That was emailed to principals on the 20th.

815
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:47,297
[SPEAKER_09]: It was developed probably at the beginning of this year and released by the Department of Education at that time, shared with the principals, and on January 25th,

816
00:55:48,341 --> 00:56:01,286
[SPEAKER_09]: there's one of the professional development programs where we'll review those specific standards, tie them to the released questions, and allow grades four and five teachers to review these things to use them as assessments.

817
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of the PDP opportunities that's available on the 25th.

818
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:17,553
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2018, that exam, and over the next several years, we'll start that gradual transition from the old frameworks to the new frameworks in assessment.

819
00:56:18,726 --> 00:56:25,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And so by that point, we should be completely integrated into the new framework.

820
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:29,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got several opportunities.

821
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,292
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be two introductions of the curriculum framework.

822
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,532
[SPEAKER_09]: One will occur in March.

823
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Another will occur in May.

824
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:42,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll continue these next year as well to make sure that people are familiar with those frameworks.

825
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:48,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have two other sort of larger professional development opportunities.

826
00:56:49,878 --> 00:56:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is to unpack the standards, and that'll be occurring from the beginning of February to essentially the end of March.

827
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:07,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Once that document is created, we'll begin a second professional development committee, which will look at curriculum programs that are available for science.

828
00:57:07,706 --> 00:57:12,428
[SPEAKER_09]: In that particular program, for the teachers, there are PDPs.

829
00:57:13,357 --> 00:57:24,383
[SPEAKER_09]: But this also involves the, we can have members of outside community groups participate in that because the vendors will come in, share their programs with us.

830
00:57:24,743 --> 00:57:32,467
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have certain standards that we want to look at and then also have some input and questions at that time.

831
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:37,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll review all of those programs and decide which ones we'd like to pilot for the following year, 2017, 2018.

832
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:46,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And then by the end of 2018, we should be able to select one for implementation.

833
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:58,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Through 2017 and 2018 and beyond, you'll notice that we're going to have to look at content instruction, how to use the program that's chosen at the end of 2018.

834
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:11,380
[SPEAKER_09]: what kind of pedagogy is most appropriate for the curriculum programs, and also targeting some of the key content in earth and space sciences, life science, physical sciences, and technology and engineering.

835
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:18,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized that at the last school committee meeting that I was supposed to present at, you got a lot of opportunities.

836
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:26,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be very similar in terms of what kinds of opportunities we'll be able to provide for professional development to the elementary school teachers.

837
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:27,868
[SPEAKER_09]: and staff members.

838
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:33,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So, moving forward, those relationships we've built with these organizations don't disappear.

839
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:37,275
[SPEAKER_09]: They only get enhanced and sort of amplified.

840
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:41,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sort of at the beginning stages of this process.

841
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:43,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

842
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:43,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

843
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot.

844
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:54,608
[SPEAKER_15]: So, can I ask, is there – I think there's a little bit of a problem here, because as you're talking about standards, the committee is not familiar enough

845
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,633
[SPEAKER_15]: with each of the standards and knowing.

846
00:58:56,673 --> 00:58:58,054
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, it feels distant.

847
00:58:58,794 --> 00:59:14,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and obviously our, our concern was, was that, um, we would be improving, uh, elementary science education, um, so that it impacted students quickly within this.

848
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:22,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there, for example, more hands on activities for students and are those, um, so as it's a great question, um,

849
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:34,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, as we review and unpack the standards, we want to look to what kinds of materials are available currently in our curriculum that we can reuse.

850
00:59:35,592 --> 00:59:44,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of the activities that are present in future activities will reflect a need for materials.

851
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:46,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we'll be sort of looking at that.

852
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:52,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working with Donna Lasky to identify some of those places where

853
00:59:52,978 --> 00:59:59,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Materials are necessary, hands-on activities, and that will allow some of those activities to happen in the interim.

854
00:59:59,642 --> 01:00:07,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the longer-term plan, which is the purchase of a program, would need to occur as well.

855
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:19,695
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's embedded within these activities that teachers also get some professional development on what kind of activities they can perform with their kids.

856
01:00:21,223 --> 01:00:32,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you envision any sort of science nights where parents are being brought in and helped, how they can help their kids with science education the way we do for math and literacy?

857
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:33,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

858
01:00:34,228 --> 01:00:36,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are going to be additional opportunities.

859
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:38,670
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'm just a little bit concerned.

860
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:45,373
[SPEAKER_15]: I was speaking with a group of parents and they told me that their child had never had a hands-on science activity.

861
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:49,414
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, and I felt such an urgency.

862
01:00:50,274 --> 01:01:02,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so that's part of what I'm trying to grasp here, uh, of trying to say is, is okay, how are we going to meet those needs sooner?

863
01:01:03,665 --> 01:01:05,947
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what I'm concerned about.

864
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:11,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So madam mayor, if I can, um, as you know, the envision series will be paid for.

865
01:01:12,412 --> 01:01:21,698
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a result, our next budget will allow some funding that was previously assigned to envision, and then previously before that to journeys will now become available for science.

866
01:01:21,718 --> 01:01:22,739
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our next priority.

867
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:24,900
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was what we discussed at budget last time.

868
01:01:27,462 --> 01:01:27,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

869
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:28,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Mustone.

870
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:29,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here.

871
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:31,904
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad to see there's an outline.

872
01:01:32,765 --> 01:01:37,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So from the little that I've learned so far in curriculum development,

873
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:43,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So the Curriculum Committee, it's the third paragraph down, did you pick the committee, or do people volunteer to be on the Curriculum Committee?

874
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:43,987
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

875
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:57,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So unpacking the standards for the Science and Technology Engineering Curriculum Committee, that's available on the Medford Public Schools PD website, and individuals sign up for that.

876
01:01:57,174 --> 01:01:57,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a picking.

877
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:03,457
[SPEAKER_16]: So will that not be the group that will actually pick the curriculum that we finally put into place September of 2018?

878
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: That would not.

879
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:06,702
[SPEAKER_09]: They are unpacking the standards.

880
01:02:08,044 --> 01:02:15,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires teachers to be familiar with those standards to be able to then speak to which programs best match the standards.

881
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:25,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So teachers will provide you with input on which standards align best with the programs or which programs align best with the standards.

882
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:48,093
[SPEAKER_09]: There's other people that have to provide some input in that, and I'm sure that school committee members and also community members would want to participate in the fourth one down, which is reviewing curriculum programs, where people would come from the vendors, explain what kind of program it is, and then we can ask questions of the vendors themselves.

883
01:02:48,153 --> 01:02:50,274
[SPEAKER_16]: How many programs do you expect will be piloted?

884
01:02:50,762 --> 01:02:52,023
[SPEAKER_16]: that are out there that are somewhat.

885
01:02:52,243 --> 01:02:54,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we hope to narrow it down to two.

886
01:02:54,864 --> 01:02:57,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think more than two would be a good idea.

887
01:02:57,124 --> 01:03:13,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I think I'm frustrated if I am not, I hope I'm not appearing too frustrated, but I was hoping for September of 2017 cause my kids at the Roberts have books that say 1983 and I feel like since my oldest who's now in eighth grade, I can bring the book.

888
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:16,812
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been talking about science and

889
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:21,632
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we kept on waiting for the frameworks, the frameworks, the state kept putting it off, the state kept putting it off.

890
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:33,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we're here and it seems like it's, I understand it's a well thought out plan, but in the meantime, so we have the whole year of 2017 to 2018 that we're still stuck with this very old science curriculum.

891
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:46,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess what Paulette was saying, is there a budget that we can do to have more hand on that, you know, Ellery Klein has written to both of us about kits that you can bring into classrooms for teachers.

892
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:50,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So Rocco has brought in kids in the past.

893
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:59,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And like I said a few moments ago, the availability of funding now that Envision has paid for, and Journeys has paid for, now moves to science.

894
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:06,555
[SPEAKER_10]: So Rocco will get first crack at those dollars that have been previously assigned to mathematics.

895
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:09,196
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's for this September 2017?

896
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:09,916
[SPEAKER_10]: For going forward.

897
01:04:09,956 --> 01:04:10,097
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

898
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:10,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Going forward.

899
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:13,558
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, you just stepped into this role, so I mean,

900
01:04:14,678 --> 01:04:16,679
[SPEAKER_16]: around when Quinn was in first grade, you know.

901
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:19,541
[SPEAKER_16]: So I feel like it's not you that I'm really frustrated with.

902
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:22,923
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the science curriculum for the past eight years.

903
01:04:23,503 --> 01:04:27,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at the elementary level, I mean, the science program has not been everything we want it to be.

904
01:04:28,026 --> 01:04:34,949
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can see at the upper grades, based on some of the discussions that you've seen, science has taken off in a very, very robust way.

905
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:43,074
[SPEAKER_10]: But this one of the discussions we had was to make the elementary science program a priority going forward with funding available.

906
01:04:43,508 --> 01:04:45,329
[SPEAKER_10]: that can be used in the next fiscal year.

907
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:51,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And with a game plan to review it against the standards, I think you're going to see quite a bit of material going in there.

908
01:04:51,631 --> 01:05:02,195
[SPEAKER_10]: But the material that's selected will have to be things that we know will match up with the standards and with either one of the two or three curriculum programs that we would adapt.

909
01:05:02,635 --> 01:05:12,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for example, if you're looking at thermodynamics, you're looking at heat and cold and the impact on matter, you can have kits that demonstrate that.

910
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:16,691
[SPEAKER_10]: that aren't going to be contradictory to any program.

911
01:05:17,472 --> 01:05:18,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can do those things.

912
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:22,775
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have botany programs that aren't going to contradict any program.

913
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:27,618
[SPEAKER_10]: But you won't get the exact program until people actually review it.

914
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:33,962
[SPEAKER_10]: But you will get the opportunity to have additional materials at the elementary level based on our budget allocations next year.

915
01:05:34,615 --> 01:05:39,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so how do we plan over the summer to have kits come into the schools for that one year?

916
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:55,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is where, you know, if Rocco knows that we are going to allocate, which he will know, we're going to allocate those funds, he will start identifying those items with teachers and letting us know so that we begin the purchasing process going into the summer and possibly running some workshops.

917
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:00,202
[SPEAKER_16]: So you are giving Rocco the authorization to ask science teachers to look at kits to

918
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:01,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Purchase.

919
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:01,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

920
01:06:02,184 --> 01:06:02,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

921
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:03,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone heard that.

922
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:05,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

923
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:07,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Who didn't hear it?

924
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:14,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that the process that we've identified will help us work with teachers that are interested in doing so and also community members.

925
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:21,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So it, it seems like it's a very slow, but I feel like it's pretty accelerated.

926
01:06:21,153 --> 01:06:29,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got six months to do a lot of work and hopefully by next September we'll have something pretty concrete to offer to the children.

927
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:32,497
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, it's a year and a half out.

928
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:33,218
[SPEAKER_16]: It's September of 2018.

929
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:43,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not necessarily, because you would put in place some things that you know are going to work, that are identifiable.

930
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:48,271
[SPEAKER_16]: But the curriculum won't be chosen.

931
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:50,332
[SPEAKER_16]: The new program won't be chosen until September of 2018.

932
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:55,377
[SPEAKER_16]: So we still have a school year between now and September of 2018, right?

933
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:56,839
[SPEAKER_16]: This coming September, September of 2017.

934
01:06:57,779 --> 01:07:08,748
[SPEAKER_10]: The final program selection won't be until 2018-19, but the curriculum based on standards and based on new materials will be available next year.

935
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:13,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And what will happen is we'll be piloting a few programs.

936
01:07:13,647 --> 01:07:19,049
[SPEAKER_02]: These pilots offer materials for our staff, so we will have the materials.

937
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:27,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, but just like in Visions and Journeys that my kids piloted, some of my kids piloted the program and other classes didn't and were stuck with the older curriculum for that school year.

938
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:34,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I believe that we'll have two different pilots running simultaneously with the science.

939
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:35,522
[SPEAKER_02]: For every class.

940
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:39,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Because only certain classes got picked to pilot envisions and journeys.

941
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:40,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Not every class did those.

942
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:45,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, teachers chose, after looking at them, what they wanted to pilot in envision and journeys.

943
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:50,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But every class should have one of the science curriculums to pilot.

944
01:07:50,394 --> 01:07:50,694
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

945
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:51,975
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

946
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:52,616
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

947
01:07:54,854 --> 01:07:55,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Ms.

948
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuneo.

949
01:07:57,215 --> 01:08:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: For members that, I know this is a, it's kind of thrown at us, and I know being a little bit newer on this process, it's harder to understand, but just to explain, I know that with the math that you just talked about, when this all came about, we were basically in the same position that we were in for the math as we are now for the science.

950
01:08:16,768 --> 01:08:20,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happened is the department heads,

951
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:22,113
[SPEAKER_06]: and the teachers collaborated.

952
01:08:22,553 --> 01:08:25,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They sought out the information that they were looking for.

953
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:30,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the curriculum didn't change until the following year, it was presented to us around budget time.

954
01:08:30,922 --> 01:08:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: it was presented to us prior to budget time, so that way we could actually allocate how much money we're gonna put towards the program.

955
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:42,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it does take a component of everyone.

956
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:43,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So as Ms.

957
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:58,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell said, it wasn't that we chose as a school committee which classes were gonna do certain things, that we also gave the opportunity to the teachers that work on the subject on an everyday basis, that they decided what they wanted in their classroom room, and at one point in time,

958
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:02,358
[SPEAKER_06]: they thought each group was different from the group next door.

959
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:09,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So as far as I am understanding it all, it's a very similar process, even though it might not be the academic year of 2018.

960
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:17,816
[SPEAKER_06]: with us knowing what has been brought to us by the state and with the work that the department heads and Ms.

961
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:30,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell are doing, they're going out, they're seeking out the best possible programs for us, then they will be bringing it back to us and in the meantime also reviewing it with the people involved.

962
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:36,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of components to it rather than just saying this is what we're approving and that's that.

963
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:38,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that was beneficial.

964
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:40,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you all set?

965
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

966
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:41,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone?

967
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:43,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

968
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:43,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

969
01:09:44,676 --> 01:09:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to clarify, when we piloted the math and the English, certain grade levels were picked and certain classrooms were picked.

970
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:59,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Not every single classroom piloted those items, one or the other.

971
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:00,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Some had none.

972
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:10,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I want for clarification, when we're piloting in 2017, is every elementary classroom going to be piloting?

973
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:12,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd say yes.

974
01:10:13,234 --> 01:10:14,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say yes, too.

975
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:19,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to believe that no one piloted.

976
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:25,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, personally, when we were piloting our literacy series and our math series,

977
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:36,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of a teacher who didn't choose one to pilot because what we were currently using at the time was everyday mathematics and none of the teachers wanted to stick with everyday mathematics.

978
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,472
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to choose one or the other to pilot.

979
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:41,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So another question.

980
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:42,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

981
01:10:43,252 --> 01:10:53,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So the companies that are piloting with us and giving us their programming, um, to review, to pick are going to provide us with enough materials

982
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:56,687
[SPEAKER_05]: for each and every classroom and each and every student.

983
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,568
[SPEAKER_05]: One or two of those.

984
01:10:59,608 --> 01:11:00,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That is our hope.

985
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,289
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to try to do that, yes.

986
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:03,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what happened in the past.

987
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We got enough material for every single classroom or do we share it?

988
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:14,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Benedetto, when I was looking at the journeys program and our math program,

989
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:21,642
[SPEAKER_02]: If a teacher or a classroom wanted one specific program, they were allowed to use that program.

990
01:11:22,242 --> 01:11:26,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the teachers did not want to stick with whatever they had before.

991
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:35,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, it's our hope that each of our teachers in each of the classrooms get to pilot one or the other before a decision is made.

992
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:36,965
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

993
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:38,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's wonderful.

994
01:11:38,246 --> 01:11:44,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't think it was that clear, and I'm very happy to hear that, that every classroom will be piloting

995
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:46,886
[SPEAKER_05]: a new science curriculum program.

996
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some other questions about, um, so since we have these new standards, what are we doing now this year?

997
01:11:53,568 --> 01:12:01,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we taking what we have and changing it up or are we waiting for the training and is the training required by all of our students?

998
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:12,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so if it would be very difficult to switch over right now because the students that are in grades,

999
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:19,938
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially grades three through five, could still see the old framework standards on their test.

1000
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So to move to those immediately could be problematic.

1001
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:38,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, the teachers are, they've been asked to stay with the current standards that are in place, which are the 2006 standards, according to Medford standards.

1002
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:42,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we've,

1003
01:12:42,596 --> 01:12:44,477
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I've suggested to teachers.

1004
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:55,362
[SPEAKER_09]: In the coming year, there will be some changes and it will make sense at that point when teachers are piloting that we should be able to find a program that matches.

1005
01:12:55,743 --> 01:13:02,666
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have any standards that are found in the new frameworks, it looks like

1006
01:13:03,285 --> 01:13:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: There are more framework standards in the new than there are in the old, so my guess is they would be covered.

1007
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:10,928
[SPEAKER_09]: The kids would be covered by that point.

1008
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:21,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and as far as professional development is, I know it's encouraged for our teachers to attend, especially with so many changes in this department.

1009
01:13:23,052 --> 01:13:29,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we making any requirements in their evaluations or in their goals or their SMART goals?

1010
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not to you through the superintendent,

1011
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:42,082
[SPEAKER_05]: What are our expectations for, you know, wonderful teachers to make sure that they receive this professional belt or they show up at it?

1012
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:47,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, every teacher has their own evaluation and they set up SMART goals and they set up individual goals.

1013
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:56,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, obviously you try to encourage them to take on goals that are going to advance their capacity to help their students in their classroom.

1014
01:13:56,789 --> 01:14:01,732
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, there are so many different areas for an elementary school teacher to be involved in.

1015
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:11,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of which is, many of which these things are tied to differentiated instruction, working with youngsters who have other needs and the like.

1016
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:20,263
[SPEAKER_10]: The content areas, you know, really vary based on the expertise of the teachers as to which ones they would spend more time with.

1017
01:14:20,343 --> 01:14:27,486
[SPEAKER_10]: But certainly something as important as this, you know, will get greater emphasis in our discussions with the teachers.

1018
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:33,656
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many things that teachers need to be competent in.

1019
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience is teachers are really good at certain things in science, like math or English.

1020
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And some are really good in history and social studies.

1021
01:14:44,942 --> 01:14:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And some are exceptional.

1022
01:14:46,943 --> 01:14:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we can have mentor teachers through this process to help those that struggle with this.

1023
01:14:53,363 --> 01:15:08,654
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit and just, you know, our lead teachers, whichever way you want to describe it, so that way we use the people that find this natural and let them share their knowledge with the other teachers and help them along.

1024
01:15:09,575 --> 01:15:16,220
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, there are at least, in most instances, four sections in each elementary school by grade level.

1025
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's five.

1026
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:23,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And generally within each of those groups, there are people who have expertise in different areas.

1027
01:15:23,468 --> 01:15:27,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's important that we emphasize that they share with each other and that they work together.

1028
01:15:28,132 --> 01:15:41,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've done that right along, but we need to perhaps emphasize that a little bit to people that are more akin to a particular subject matter like science, that they step up and serve maybe as a little bit of a leadership role for the other members of that group.

1029
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually encouraged when I walk around to the different schools by the number of teachers who are excited by the new science standards and have been asking me, when are we going to do some work on this?

1030
01:15:53,225 --> 01:15:55,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Rocco put together this schedule.

1031
01:15:55,626 --> 01:15:59,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that we're going to find a lot of teachers very excited about participating.

1032
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they're dying for new materials.

1033
01:16:03,229 --> 01:16:04,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they are, too.

1034
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And new things.

1035
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your time and effort on this.

1036
01:16:07,711 --> 01:16:09,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I know when there's new standards brought out,

1037
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:15,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tremendous amount of time to see what we have that works and what we need.

1038
01:16:16,587 --> 01:16:23,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it seems like a very long time for this process, but we also need to plan the money for it, because we want to fund it well.

1039
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:25,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1040
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:28,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1041
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:28,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1042
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:33,271
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to accept the report placed on file, seconded by Mr. Panadetto.

1043
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:34,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1044
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:34,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1045
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:35,452
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1046
01:16:36,052 --> 01:16:36,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1047
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:37,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1048
01:16:43,476 --> 01:16:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Item seven, report on WIDA access testing for ELL students.

1049
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

1050
01:16:49,277 --> 01:16:59,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you know, we have to test our non-native language speakers, our ELL students, every year under a system called the WIDA testing.

1051
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:04,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And our director of ELL is here to go over that with you.

1052
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now underway.

1053
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:05,901
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going well.

1054
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:12,982
[SPEAKER_10]: But we want to bring you up to date in case you hear these terms and you want to know what's going on with regard to access testing

1055
01:17:13,527 --> 01:17:16,150
[SPEAKER_10]: and how it works in terms of the schools.

1056
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:17,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So Leslie Trotter is here.

1057
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:19,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1058
01:17:19,694 --> 01:17:21,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the midst of testing.

1059
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:27,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we started at the McGlynn last week and today we started at the high school and the Roberts.

1060
01:17:28,465 --> 01:17:30,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other schools will follow suit.

1061
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the report I gave you, you have a schedule.

1062
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:41,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to give you a quick rundown so that you do understand it a little bit better because there is some confusion, it seems, about this test.

1063
01:17:42,488 --> 01:17:49,192
[SPEAKER_00]: So all schools except for the Andrews will be testing.

1064
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:52,294
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews is the only school in the city that doesn't have an ELL program.

1065
01:17:53,095 --> 01:17:59,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a mandated by federal and state law test.

1066
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:09,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law mandates that all ELLs across the country will take a test to determine English language proficiency, all the ELLs.

1067
01:18:10,454 --> 01:18:16,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are part of the WIDA Consortium, Massachusetts, and many other states are as well.

1068
01:18:16,698 --> 01:18:21,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So the WIDA Consortium states give the Access 2.0 test.

1069
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:24,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states choose a different comparable test.

1070
01:18:26,343 --> 01:18:30,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Our window for testing in Massachusetts is January 5th to February 8th.

1071
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:38,252
[SPEAKER_00]: The test measures, as I said, the English proficiency level of ESL students, excuse me, ELL students.

1072
01:18:38,432 --> 01:18:45,517
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been so many acronyms over the years that I've been teaching ESL, ELL, bilingual, whatever you want to call it at the time.

1073
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:49,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're switching over to EL as of next year.

1074
01:18:49,981 --> 01:18:52,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might hear ELL, you might hear EL, they're the same thing.

1075
01:18:55,922 --> 01:18:57,864
[SPEAKER_00]: The results are very important.

1076
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:03,908
[SPEAKER_00]: They determine the amount of ESL service a student receives each day.

1077
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:08,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also determines whether a student can exit the program or not.

1078
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:12,555
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to reach a certain benchmark to be able to exit the program.

1079
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:20,882
[SPEAKER_00]: According to data put out by DESE, last year 72 percent of our students made progress in learning English.

1080
01:19:21,484 --> 01:19:26,126
[SPEAKER_00]: The state designated the district target as 52%, so we were well above.

1081
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:37,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also designated our target for attaining English proficiency at 17%, and we reached 31%.

1082
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:39,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did very well last year.

1083
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:44,453
[SPEAKER_00]: We're testing approximately 425 students.

1084
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:48,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that is a different number than what you have, but our numbers change literally every day.

1085
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:53,447
[SPEAKER_00]: One poor little girl, Arthur Roberts, entered today and had to take the test.

1086
01:19:54,307 --> 01:20:01,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily they mostly don't mind doing it because it's on a computer and it's pretty interactive.

1087
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So the little ones particularly are quite engaged.

1088
01:20:07,853 --> 01:20:17,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The only paper versions that we're using this year are the kindergarten tests and the access alternate test for the kids with severe disabilities.

1089
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:19,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the only paper ones.

1090
01:20:21,528 --> 01:20:24,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it's really gone quite smoothly.

1091
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:28,813
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few tiny little issues, but nothing that couldn't be resolved very quickly.

1092
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:41,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's thanks to really a lot of legwork by my administrative assistant, my assessment specialist, the technology department, the test coordinators at each building.

1093
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,203
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a group effort.

1094
01:20:44,063 --> 01:20:45,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going really well.

1095
01:20:48,045 --> 01:20:50,147
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't really have a whole lot to say.

1096
01:20:50,187 --> 01:20:54,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could thank a whole lot of people, but I don't know that I will spend time doing that.

1097
01:20:56,712 --> 01:20:59,434
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.

1098
01:21:01,776 --> 01:21:02,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive?

1099
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:06,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive and place on file this report.

1100
01:21:06,839 --> 01:21:07,680
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1101
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:07,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1102
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:09,101
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1103
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:09,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1104
01:21:09,902 --> 01:21:10,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

1105
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:10,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Trotta.

1106
01:21:11,203 --> 01:21:11,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

1107
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:20,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Item eight report on technology infrastructure study for capital planning and E-rate fund acquisition.

1108
01:21:20,306 --> 01:21:21,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

1109
01:21:21,886 --> 01:21:40,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you heard about ELL or EL, you know, in the use of technology and the use of technology and with regard to our other programs, science programs and the like, one of the most important initiatives that we have to launch in this district is to upgrade our technology network infrastructure.

1110
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:44,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, in order to be eligible for substantial,

1111
01:21:44,742 --> 01:22:01,952
[SPEAKER_10]: tier two E-rate funding and related grants, we have to complete a study of our current network infrastructure, which will then guide our applications for funding and ensure that we efficiently and effectively identify and target the critical elements of our infrastructure.

1112
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:10,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We're eligible approximately for $400,000 federal entitlement funds, which we then have to match with an additional 40% at this time.

1113
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:17,021
[SPEAKER_10]: This funding would then supplement local capital funds and other available grants.

1114
01:22:17,902 --> 01:22:19,544
[SPEAKER_10]: The funding is available this year.

1115
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:28,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot guarantee that going forward, given changes in Washington and other places, that the money will be available in subsequent years.

1116
01:22:28,673 --> 01:22:31,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So it behooves us to go get it now.

1117
01:22:32,257 --> 01:22:35,761
[SPEAKER_10]: It's imperative that we act now for multiple reasons, the availability of funding,

1118
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:50,384
[SPEAKER_10]: the overall demand for technology for both instructional and administrative matters, the increased requirement to implement computer-based estate testing, and planned initiatives for online coursework and remedial credit recovery programs.

1119
01:22:51,484 --> 01:23:03,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Further, the purchase of state-of-the-art hardware and software must be supported by a network infrastructure that is sufficiently constructed to enable simultaneous high utilization and to filter out cyber malware

1120
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,700
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent with SIPA standards.

1121
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,802
[SPEAKER_10]: SIPA is the Computer Protection Act.

1122
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:20,304
[SPEAKER_10]: The study must provide us with detailed information, an independent assessment that is free from internal bias, which we tend to have.

1123
01:23:20,365 --> 01:23:22,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody has a different idea of what ought to be done.

1124
01:23:23,145 --> 01:23:30,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Programs and services are becoming increasingly dependent upon a robust and reliable internet and intranet capacity.

1125
01:23:31,128 --> 01:23:32,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So we selected,

1126
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:37,999
[SPEAKER_10]: TechEdge of Cambridge to conduct the study and provide us with ongoing support.

1127
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: TechEdge is our current E-rate consultant and have done this for a period of years.

1128
01:23:43,341 --> 01:23:57,728
[SPEAKER_10]: They are also the E-rate consultants in the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Massachusetts Instructional Technology, Informational Technology rather, Massachusetts Department of Youth Services, and over 20 Massachusetts school districts.

1129
01:23:58,428 --> 01:24:02,350
[SPEAKER_10]: And they serve as the technical consultants to the DESE Office of Digital Learning

1130
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:07,983
[SPEAKER_10]: the digital connections partnership grant, which is another grant we'll go after, which is an important grant.

1131
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:09,384
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're the consultants.

1132
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:10,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1133
01:24:10,985 --> 01:24:12,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, you know, what's in here.

1134
01:24:13,587 --> 01:24:15,588
[SPEAKER_10]: If you agree with me, we need to go forward.

1135
01:24:15,628 --> 01:24:18,830
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to get this done so we can apply and move it, move it forward.

1136
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:20,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1137
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1138
01:24:22,552 --> 01:24:29,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so my end with reading this paperwork, my understanding is that, um, the study is gonna,

1139
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:35,559
[SPEAKER_05]: be at a cost of $33,150, and that's what we'd be approving this evening.

1140
01:24:36,059 --> 01:24:38,943
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be approving check-edge, approximately that kind of money.

1141
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:40,025
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't think it'll exceed that.

1142
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:41,267
[SPEAKER_10]: We think it may be less than that.

1143
01:24:42,769 --> 01:24:44,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be paid for by funds that we acquire.

1144
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: paid for by what funds?

1145
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,851
[SPEAKER_10]: E-rate funds that we acquire.

1146
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:52,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So out of the $400,000 that we require?

1147
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:54,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of the funds we currently acquire from E-rate.

1148
01:24:54,755 --> 01:24:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1149
01:24:56,096 --> 01:24:57,517
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get about $60,000 a year.

1150
01:24:58,878 --> 01:25:00,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So was that already in our budget?

1151
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's something I planned for.

1152
01:25:01,801 --> 01:25:03,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you utilize for something else?

1153
01:25:03,522 --> 01:25:04,383
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I planned for that.

1154
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:05,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1155
01:25:05,764 --> 01:25:08,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So does it have to go to bid since it's such a high thing?

1156
01:25:08,787 --> 01:25:12,370
[SPEAKER_10]: No, their contract, they have a state contract to provide this service.

1157
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:12,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1158
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:15,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can avoid that and work with people that have knowledge.

1159
01:25:15,952 --> 01:25:17,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have been working with this organization.

1160
01:25:17,973 --> 01:25:19,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, this is a company that we work with.

1161
01:25:19,874 --> 01:25:24,537
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a lot to do with our last capital project that we did for the computers in the school system.

1162
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:27,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so I have another question.

1163
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:36,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I really believe that we need to always invest in this and we definitely need to move towards this because of all the new testing requirements.

1164
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:44,410
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want everybody to be aware, when we get the $398,000, we'll also have to bond for the 250,000, the 40%.

1165
01:25:46,551 --> 01:25:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to start communicating with city councilors right away about this program.

1166
01:25:51,935 --> 01:25:53,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Has any of that started yet?

1167
01:25:53,596 --> 01:25:54,437
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we'll do that.

1168
01:25:54,477 --> 01:25:57,999
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll begin that process as we go forward from this evening.

1169
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:03,223
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we can then acquire the company and then we'll put together a package for presentation.

1170
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:06,505
[SPEAKER_05]: My concern is that we'll,

1171
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:17,906
[SPEAKER_05]: pay the $33,150 and then not get approval from our council or support at this time for a bond of $235,000 to make this?

1172
01:26:18,366 --> 01:26:26,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to believe that the Medford City Council will be supportive of enhancing technology in the schools.

1173
01:26:26,174 --> 01:26:29,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe that they would be less than supportive of something

1174
01:26:29,856 --> 01:26:38,759
[SPEAKER_10]: that would provide us with close to $400,000 position us to get additional dollars and allow our students to have the latest information capacity.

1175
01:26:39,059 --> 01:26:47,202
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my point is that we need to collaborate just like our high school and vocational school does with the city council on projects like this.

1176
01:26:47,442 --> 01:26:52,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And a meeting of both boards when this comes forward is never a bad thing.

1177
01:26:52,724 --> 01:26:54,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Opening up that communication.

1178
01:26:54,965 --> 01:27:03,926
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll leave that to you, but I think the reality is that we need to put together our plan, we need to come in and say what we're going to do, and then we should be asking for more than...

1179
01:27:05,168 --> 01:27:08,609
[SPEAKER_10]: just a match for this from the chair.

1180
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:16,131
[SPEAKER_08]: We did submit the list that originally came to us that the superintendent and all his department has put together that was given to the city council.

1181
01:27:16,151 --> 01:27:20,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're aware of the cumulative list that the superintendent put together.

1182
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:22,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1183
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that it actually goes all the way through.

1184
01:27:25,694 --> 01:27:31,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just want to, Alec, I just want the whole community to know how much we're spending and what we're approving tonight.

1185
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:33,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I want to name it.

1186
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:43,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that way people understand it is going to cost us $33,150 to do the study, which could give us the opportunity of receiving close to $400,000.

1187
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:44,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And more.

1188
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:44,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And more.

1189
01:27:47,412 --> 01:27:50,053
[SPEAKER_05]: and money to upgrade our programs.

1190
01:27:50,434 --> 01:27:54,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, we did just upgrade them, what, four years ago, but it's a continual issue.

1191
01:27:55,516 --> 01:27:58,018
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to continuously do this.

1192
01:27:58,178 --> 01:28:04,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I think it's a great program, and I think any way that we can get stuff 60% funded is excellent.

1193
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that we're ready to answer any questions that our counselors have, so that way they're in an open, respectful way, because, you know,

1194
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:24,452
[SPEAKER_05]: There are other things on their caseload other than just this, and I want them to know that this is a priority for us.

1195
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:28,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to know who will be overseeing this project.

1196
01:28:29,255 --> 01:28:32,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the project will work with the consultants.

1197
01:28:32,117 --> 01:28:39,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they'll report directly to myself and to Christine, the business office, but we'll work closely with Alan Arena, who is our network

1198
01:28:40,234 --> 01:28:54,803
[SPEAKER_10]: and Richie Trotter, who is our instructional media supervisor, and all the other people, Molly Gladen, who works on our special projects, and all the support staff in the technology area, as well as the department heads and the like who know what they need for their particular areas.

1199
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:59,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll be interviewed, and all their input will come together in a report.

1200
01:29:00,947 --> 01:29:08,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So this report will reflect not only what, you know, the actual inside network does, but also what people believe they need.

1201
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So I second Mr. Skerry's motion to approve this.

1202
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:17,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to really be clear as to how much money we're spending up front.

1203
01:29:19,251 --> 01:29:27,800
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion for approval of expenditure of the funds to use TechEdge for E-rate technology upgrades and studies.

1204
01:29:28,481 --> 01:29:29,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, please.

1205
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:40,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1206
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:42,226
[SPEAKER_08]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1207
01:29:42,266 --> 01:29:42,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1208
01:29:44,207 --> 01:29:50,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Update report on new public records law and appointment of MPS, public records access officer.

1209
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:55,093
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could, prior to the superintendent speaking, there was a change in the law this past year.

1210
01:29:55,113 --> 01:29:59,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It was set to implement 2017, which is why this is before you today.

1211
01:30:00,515 --> 01:30:07,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to go on record that we are required to have a records access officer named for the city.

1212
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:19,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And because of the size of our community, we felt it was wise to have a city person as well as a school person that's responsible for all the freedom of information requests that come through our doors on a daily basis.

1213
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:31,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have named Kim Scanlon, who's Assistant City Solicitor, as the RAO for the City of Medford, and the Superintendent would like to announce his selection.

1214
01:30:31,605 --> 01:30:40,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to appoint Alicia Palmer, who works in our human resources area with the Director of Finance and Administration.

1215
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,812
[SPEAKER_10]: to take on that role.

1216
01:30:41,832 --> 01:30:43,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia is very computer savvy.

1217
01:30:43,753 --> 01:30:47,013
[SPEAKER_10]: She's extremely diligent and capable of doing this kind of work.

1218
01:30:47,673 --> 01:30:50,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where we're going to go with this appointment.

1219
01:30:51,374 --> 01:30:54,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And we believe that there's a lot involved here.

1220
01:30:56,135 --> 01:31:01,736
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already started to get some requests across our table, and they need to be responded to very quickly.

1221
01:31:02,577 --> 01:31:05,617
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to have the capacity to do that.

1222
01:31:06,077 --> 01:31:07,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Naturally, no one person does things.

1223
01:31:07,758 --> 01:31:09,318
[SPEAKER_10]: The individual coordinates other people.

1224
01:31:09,815 --> 01:31:18,877
[SPEAKER_10]: So if something's requested from a department, that individual needs to get on that department to get the information, pull it up, coordinate it, pull it together, and ship it out in a timely way.

1225
01:31:18,997 --> 01:31:23,837
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be the gatekeeper, though, to make sure when requests that come in, answers go out.

1226
01:31:24,518 --> 01:31:25,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll organize the process.

1227
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, you could send it to any department head, and they're doing their own freedom of information request.

1228
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:31,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

1229
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:38,700
[SPEAKER_05]: How will this affect our budget, and where are these funds coming for for the increased cost in this person's position?

1230
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't affect our budget that much.

1231
01:31:40,858 --> 01:31:49,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're talking about approximately $5,000 of annual outlay, uh, to do this plus any costs associated with the production of materials.

1232
01:31:49,863 --> 01:32:02,991
[SPEAKER_10]: But we can charge individuals making the request and we will recoup a substantial portion of that cost, um, over time because as individuals request items, we will appropriately charge them.

1233
01:32:03,031 --> 01:32:06,173
[SPEAKER_10]: If individual requests, a simple couple of documents, that's one thing.

1234
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:13,794
[SPEAKER_10]: But if an individual requests any kind of work, we're going to be charging them at the rate that's allowed by law, and also for the paperwork and production that's required by law.

1235
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:22,522
[SPEAKER_05]: As a follow-up question, is this an appointable thing, or do we have to open it up to all staff to apply for this?

1236
01:32:23,295 --> 01:32:28,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It's appointable because the individual is not part of a unit, and they don't have to be bid within a unit.

1237
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:35,422
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why we're keeping it close to our office so that Kirsten and I can monitor it very closely.

1238
01:32:36,403 --> 01:32:41,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Because obviously, an individual getting a request would have to know what can be asked, what can't be asked.

1239
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:43,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will also provide training.

1240
01:32:43,247 --> 01:32:48,370
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also going to run some training programs so that everybody is really on top of this.

1241
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,372
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of those things where there are fines if we don't do it.

1242
01:32:52,587 --> 01:32:59,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to, we need to have everything properly set up and we need to have an inventory and an archive for everything we responded to.

1243
01:32:59,352 --> 01:33:00,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve.

1244
01:33:02,255 --> 01:33:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor for approval.

1245
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:03,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1246
01:33:03,776 --> 01:33:04,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Van de Kloet.

1247
01:33:05,177 --> 01:33:06,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no, I'm good.

1248
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:08,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, do we need a roll call vote for this one?

1249
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:08,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I would.

1250
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:09,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1251
01:33:09,981 --> 01:33:10,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

1252
01:33:11,142 --> 01:33:11,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Van de Kloet.

1253
01:33:11,802 --> 01:33:12,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1254
01:33:12,743 --> 01:33:12,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1255
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:13,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuneo.

1256
01:33:14,585 --> 01:33:15,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

1257
01:33:16,206 --> 01:33:16,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1258
01:33:16,366 --> 01:33:16,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Kratz.

1259
01:33:17,387 --> 01:33:17,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1260
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:17,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Stone.

1261
01:33:18,528 --> 01:33:19,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Scurry.

1262
01:33:19,228 --> 01:33:19,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1263
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:20,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Van de Kloet.

1264
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:20,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1265
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:21,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Burke.

1266
01:33:21,258 --> 01:33:23,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1267
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:23,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1268
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:29,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on impact of weather conditions on outdoor recess policy slash practice.

1269
01:33:29,865 --> 01:33:30,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

1270
01:33:31,086 --> 01:33:39,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee, we did get some inquiries from people about why we didn't always let students out, you know, on recess and cold days.

1271
01:33:40,594 --> 01:33:47,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I've tried to provide something that would give us some guidance and I just try to go through it a little bit because I think some people,

1272
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,643
[SPEAKER_10]: think that there's one universal thing you can do.

1273
01:33:52,164 --> 01:33:53,865
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't paint this with a broad brush.

1274
01:33:54,826 --> 01:33:55,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Days are different.

1275
01:33:56,127 --> 01:34:07,258
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not only temperature, it's wind chill, it's ground conditions, it's disabilities on the part of certain youngsters in certain situations that take place, it's timing.

1276
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:11,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so many different factors that come into play.

1277
01:34:11,666 --> 01:34:18,312
[SPEAKER_10]: But recently, some elementary parents have raised the concern that students were not allowed to have outdoor recess on certain cold weather days.

1278
01:34:19,173 --> 01:34:23,416
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all recognize that recess, and we've talked about this many times, is an important element of the school day.

1279
01:34:23,436 --> 01:34:30,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It provides an opportunity for students to get a break from academics, to burn off excess energy, and get some exercise.

1280
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:39,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Current time and learning regulations, as well as curriculum demands of the school, limit the amount of time we can currently allow for recess at this point.

1281
01:34:40,855 --> 01:34:45,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Outdoor recess is certainly desirable in most instances because it changes the environment.

1282
01:34:46,018 --> 01:34:48,179
[SPEAKER_10]: It provides fresh air opportunities to students.

1283
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there are significant reasons to keep students indoors when weather conditions are adverse.

1284
01:34:54,423 --> 01:35:00,746
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no national standard for keeping students indoors or allowing them to go outdoors for school recess.

1285
01:35:01,485 --> 01:35:06,269
[SPEAKER_10]: As a result, site principals must make the decision based upon local conditions.

1286
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:11,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We trust our principals to make decisions about the safety of our youngsters in many ways.

1287
01:35:12,634 --> 01:35:15,076
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to trust them to make this decision.

1288
01:35:15,477 --> 01:35:19,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We give them some guidance, but they need to be able to have that discretion.

1289
01:35:19,917 --> 01:35:21,718
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to be making it from distance.

1290
01:35:22,579 --> 01:35:25,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Temperatures alone is not sufficient to control decision making.

1291
01:35:26,002 --> 01:35:30,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Wind chill, rain, ice, snow, other factors have to be considered.

1292
01:35:30,946 --> 01:35:41,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Not all students, and that's true of a lot of students who come to our schools, have sufficient layered clothing to withstand extreme cold and other weather factors, even if we try.

1293
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:44,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Student safety is most important consideration.

1294
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:45,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Decisions aren't made with a broad brush.

1295
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:47,959
[SPEAKER_10]: We can encourage outdoor recess,

1296
01:35:48,672 --> 01:35:52,917
[SPEAKER_10]: but ultimate decisions must rest with the building principal at the local school site.

1297
01:35:53,517 --> 01:35:54,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there are a number of things we can do.

1298
01:35:56,661 --> 01:36:00,925
[SPEAKER_10]: We can advise parents to provide layered clothing, including hats and gloves.

1299
01:36:01,606 --> 01:36:07,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We can also carry a supply of our own for some youngsters who don't have it, who don't come prepared.

1300
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,443
[SPEAKER_10]: and that sometimes is reality.

1301
01:36:10,043 --> 01:36:17,034
[SPEAKER_10]: We can reschedule recess to some degree for a warmer part of the day if possible, maybe a little bit later in the morning rather than earlier.

1302
01:36:17,454 --> 01:36:19,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Difficult because there's a lot of other factors going on.

1303
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:22,502
[SPEAKER_10]: We can shorten the time spent outside.

1304
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:25,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Mix indoor with outdoor time.

1305
01:36:25,472 --> 01:36:27,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's 10 minutes outside, read in the full time.

1306
01:36:29,215 --> 01:36:36,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can differentiate which students participate either by age or by condition when circumstances allow.

1307
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:41,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously we have to closely monitor certain students who may be more susceptible to cold conditions.

1308
01:36:42,844 --> 01:36:47,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I will direct principals to keep a log of the days when outdoor recess is not implemented.

1309
01:36:48,408 --> 01:36:52,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll collect the data and review it this spring to see what patterns emerge.

1310
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:57,783
[SPEAKER_10]: In the interim, it's my strong recommendation that principal discretion be maintained.

1311
01:36:58,383 --> 01:37:02,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We trust our principals to make safety decisions regarding students.

1312
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,868
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just one of the many safety decisions that they must make on a daily basis.

1313
01:37:08,549 --> 01:37:21,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And I provided a chart for you to look at, which we'll provide to them, and they've been provided with some of this material in the past, to look at this stuff to see exactly how to make these decisions maybe a little bit more scientifically.

1314
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:24,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1315
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:29,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Millstone, did you send it to the parents who voiced their concern this letter?

1316
01:37:30,105 --> 01:37:31,846
[SPEAKER_10]: We will once, you know, we're through tonight.

1317
01:37:32,066 --> 01:37:32,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1318
01:37:32,927 --> 01:37:37,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, I wanted to present it to you and get feedback that you have, but we'll send this out.

1319
01:37:37,891 --> 01:37:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1320
01:37:38,831 --> 01:37:39,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1321
01:37:39,552 --> 01:37:45,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. Superintendent, does it, does the principal decide whether there's indoor or outdoor recess for the whole building?

1322
01:37:46,817 --> 01:37:52,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, every building has its own culture, but I will now make it imperative upon the teacher to consult with the principal.

1323
01:37:53,820 --> 01:38:06,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I know other school districts might announce whether it's indoor or outdoor recess for the whole school so that way some teachers aren't holding their kids in while other teachers are letting them out.

1324
01:38:06,724 --> 01:38:09,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a suggestion in the protocol.

1325
01:38:10,005 --> 01:38:23,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way it's not like some teachers get cold easily and they might wanna do different activities inside when other teachers are getting out more often because they're just like that and that's what they,

1326
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be a strong suggestion from me to have a whole school either in or out, an announcement made each day.

1327
01:38:31,055 --> 01:38:34,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way, you know, well, you know, I want to be careful.

1328
01:38:35,037 --> 01:38:38,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sometimes an older child can go out, a younger child may not be able to go on.

1329
01:38:39,219 --> 01:38:47,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there may be some mitigating circumstances, but the emphasis will be on having the school work as a unit as much as possible.

1330
01:38:48,157 --> 01:38:53,198
[SPEAKER_10]: and the principal consult with those teachers who might have a particular reason for not wanting to do it.

1331
01:38:53,598 --> 01:39:01,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to maintain principal discretion, but I also want to encourage them to not prevent outdoor recess just on a cavalier basis.

1332
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:06,202
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do want them to have some discretion because there are individual situations.

1333
01:39:06,602 --> 01:39:11,543
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be a class in which some of the youngsters have severe colds or have some colds or just come back from colds.

1334
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,724
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be some youngsters with other considerations on ground cover.

1335
01:39:15,277 --> 01:39:17,558
[SPEAKER_10]: ice on the playground or whatever the case may be.

1336
01:39:17,978 --> 01:39:19,399
[SPEAKER_10]: All these things need to be thought about.

1337
01:39:19,939 --> 01:39:21,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So we trust our principals to make decisions.

1338
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:28,263
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to give them discretion, but we'll monitor it, log it, and then review to see what the pattern has been.

1339
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:35,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as a follow-up, can we monitor which classrooms get out and which classrooms don't?

1340
01:39:35,286 --> 01:39:36,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and monitor the whole thing.

1341
01:39:36,646 --> 01:39:37,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that going to be part of it?

1342
01:39:38,047 --> 01:39:41,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wouldn't want teachers just simply to say, I'm not going out because I don't want to go out.

1343
01:39:42,069 --> 01:39:44,690
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really got to be a situation where there's a reason

1344
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:45,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1345
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:53,493
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not doing it generally based on environmental conditions, but there may be a few other human conditions that require a consideration on a given day.

1346
01:39:54,613 --> 01:39:55,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1347
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:56,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scary.

1348
01:39:57,014 --> 01:40:03,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent, I was really glad to see this report and I think it's about time that we issue guidelines across the board.

1349
01:40:04,057 --> 01:40:14,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, I have the utmost faith in my principals and teachers and uh, you know, except there are, there are always a few parents that want to undermine the, the educators role.

1350
01:40:14,817 --> 01:40:20,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope that, uh, this gets out and the point is well taken and that there won't be any commotion in the future.

1351
01:40:21,462 --> 01:40:26,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think, you know, people have different opinions and I understand that some people are hardier than other people.

1352
01:40:26,466 --> 01:40:29,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people ski on a regular base and other people have never been on a mountain.

1353
01:40:29,869 --> 01:40:41,078
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, but, uh, but the reality is, is that, you know, we need to have some sort of balance in a school and we need to respect the right of the principal, uh, to, uh, make a judgment and then we'll monitor it.

1354
01:40:41,098 --> 01:40:41,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll monitor it.

1355
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:43,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a thorough agreement.

1356
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:45,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Move the paper Madam Chairman.

1357
01:40:46,308 --> 01:40:48,931
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to receive and place on file this report.

1358
01:40:49,011 --> 01:40:49,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1359
01:40:49,231 --> 01:40:49,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

1360
01:40:50,072 --> 01:40:58,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say just to be careful and pin pigeonhole everybody only because you also have to take in consideration the ages of the students in the classes.

1361
01:40:58,979 --> 01:41:02,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, it's a little bit different from a kindergartner than it is a fifth grader.

1362
01:41:03,263 --> 01:41:06,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So to, to say the whole school or not, the whole school is a little bit delicate.

1363
01:41:07,426 --> 01:41:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think we've got to use our common sense, you know,

1364
01:41:11,305 --> 01:41:14,268
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor to receive in place on file, seconded by Ms.

1365
01:41:14,308 --> 01:41:14,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

1366
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:16,050
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1367
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1368
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:17,231

[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1370
01:41:19,753 --> 01:41:20,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Financial report.

1371
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:29,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, I'll call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Kirstine, who's been working real hard and doing a great job to deliver the financial report.

1372
01:41:29,943 --> 01:41:30,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1373
01:41:31,405 --> 01:41:32,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

1374
01:41:37,452 --> 01:41:43,577
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor to table this report for our next meeting.

1375
01:41:44,138 --> 01:41:45,038
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1376
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:45,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1377
01:41:45,919 --> 01:41:46,600
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1378
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1379
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:49,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Great presentation.

1380
01:41:49,162 --> 01:41:50,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1381
01:41:51,824 --> 01:41:54,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We will hold on to it though.

1382
01:41:54,947 --> 01:41:55,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor.

1383

[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

1387
01:42:05,874 --> 01:42:06,614
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1388
01:42:06,974 --> 01:42:07,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1389
01:42:07,435 --> 01:42:08,095

[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of William Quealy.
