    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=48.202s">I</a>  had offered to dedicate the last meeting in the memory of Gene Barry, and it was not in the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=57.196s">included</a>  in the minutes and the minutes tabled until next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=60.238s">You'd</a>  like the minutes to be tabled?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=61.579s">Yes,</a>  for that inclusion.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=62.98s">On</a>  the motion to table the minutes, which is undebatable, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=66.702s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=67.043s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=68.964s">The</a>  minutes have been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=71.285s">Subject</a>  to an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=80.251s">Approval</a>  of bills, transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=83.153s">Motion</a>  for approval by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=84.974s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=86.845s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=87.605s">Um,</a>  just to clarify, there was a payment made to Mrs. Van de Kloof for the amount of $280 and 59 cents.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=96.429s">There</a>  was a payment made to Mrs. Van de Kloof in the amount of I think $280 and 59 cents.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=103.112s">The</a>  reimbursement for the, uh, travel that took place for the MASC, uh, conference back in November.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=109.575s">And</a>  I believe there was one to Mr. Skerry as well.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=112.156s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=112.596s">I</a>  just didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=113.537s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=114.117s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=115.177s">Um,</a>  so that was the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=117.458s">M</a>  A S C conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=119.058s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=120.239s">Isn't</a>  it usually paid for differently than reimbursed to you guys?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=124.939s">I</a>  just thought it was unusual that it was like a line item to get a better, better deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=133.681s">Uh,</a>  we actually, I actually made my, um, uh, reservation first directly with the hotel because there was a time factor involved and, um, it was more cost effective.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=144.659s">Oh,</a>  thank you for saving us money then. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=147.941s">No,</a>  it's just, it was an unusual expense, so.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=150.382s">So</a>  I didn't charge it through the school system, I charged it on my credit card for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=155.544s">Perfect,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.607s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=159.827s">Cuno,</a>  point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=161.508s">The</a>  reason that you haven't seen in the last few years is because actually Paulette and I had been paid for, our expenses were paid for MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=170.715s">Paulette</a>  and I are no longer on MASC as far as executive board is concerned, so that's why the reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=177.52s">And</a>  you haven't seen it over the last few years, that's the reason.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=182.323s">Is</a>  there a second for the approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=185.115s">of</a>  bills, transfer funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=186.696s">Seconded</a>  by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=188.198s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=189.259s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=190.059s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=190.76s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=192.121s">Approval</a>  of payrolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=194.183s">Motion</a>  for approval by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=195.344s">Disceri.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=195.905s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=196.465s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=197.306s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=198.407s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=199.488s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=200.128s">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=201.249s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=202.531s">Report</a>  of secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=204.172s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=206.814s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=208.676s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=210.838s">Community</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=213.719s">Is</a>  there anyone wishing to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=215.4s">None?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=216.56s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=217.621s">Report</a>  of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=218.961s">Item</a>  one, recommendation to accept gift to MHS robotics team. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=222.983s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=404.908s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=405.469s">So</a>  the MHS band has been invited to participate in the Disney Magic Music Days. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=411.78s">which</a>  includes your marching band performing in a parade inside Magic Kingdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=417.342s">And</a>  then as the concert band portion, you get to perform at the downtown Disney floating stage, which is really cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=424.245s">It's</a>  actually floats in the middle of this lake and everyone has a big amphitheater and gets to sit and watch you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=429.727s">And</a>  then we get to participate in educational film scoring, music workshops, where the students actually get to sit in a recording studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=437.109s">They</a>  get to talk to actual musicians that play <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=439.893s">on</a>  the Disney soundtracks and recordings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=442.455s">And</a>  they get to learn a piece with a conductor, not myself, someone that works for Disney. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=448.08s">And</a>  then they are able to actually watch the movie playing on the huge screen behind them as they get to play it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=455.266s">And</a>  every kid gets a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=457.488s">And</a>  there's lots of other activities that we can sign up for, depending on what the kids are interested in.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=462.153s">Very</a>  neat. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=462.513s">Does</a>  the color guard go as well?</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=463.954s">The</a>  color guard does go as well, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=465.535s">And</a>  they march in the parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=467.436s">There</a>  are specific uniforms that they have to wear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=470.397s">And</a>  Disney will also provide drum heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=473.258s">So</a>  we'll change out all of our drum heads to Disney logos. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=475.439s">And</a>  they're very specific on what we look like and how we act. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=479.401s">But</a>  the kids are really excited.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=481.903s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=482.103s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=483.123s">Well,</a>  I want to congratulate you guys for doing, finally getting to this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=488.244s">This</a>  is a big step for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=489.385s">It's</a>  a huge step. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=491.965s">It's</a>  a huge step.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=493.145s">It's</a>  not a big enough step.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=495.546s">We</a>  can still step bigger, but we're getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=498.846s">It's</a>  in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=501.407s">Could</a>  you tell me how many other schools or districts are participating in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=505.108s">This</a>  across, because this is a,</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=507.125s">across</a>  the country? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=507.765s">It</a>  is across the country, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=509.506s">It</a>  depends, it runs all year, depending on, there's like different, there's a fall one you can participate in, a spring one, a winter one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=517.749s">I</a>  don't know off the top of my head right now how many would be accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=521.73s">We</a>  do have to apply once, if it is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=526.512s">So</a>  we still have that round, but I'm sure from the sounds of it, it looks like we've already made it through the first level, so.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.054s">That</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=532.774s">How</a>  many chaperones are we looking at?</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=536.065s">Right</a>  now, I have it based off of 50 kids going, and that would be 10 chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=540.367s">It</a>  would be five staff members and five chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=545.309s">The</a>  five staff members that are going also act as chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=547.89s">That</a>  does not include myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=550.171s">I</a>  don't put myself as a chaperone, because I consider myself in charge of the entire trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=554.873s">So</a>  I don't have five students specifically assigned to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=559.055s">Everyone</a>  is assigned to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=560.875s">And</a>  that way, I'm also able to deal with any conflicts or any problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=565.512s">The</a>  students can always check in with their chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=568.253s">And</a>  I am free to do things like take someone to the infirmary or deal with a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=574.395s">So</a>  it's technically 11 adults and five kids, and 50 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=578.617s">So</a>  it's five to one, basically.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=580.038s">And</a>  are the chaperones paying the same amount?</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=583.739s">They</a>  don't pay the same amount as the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=585.36s">They</a>  pay a little bit less. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=587.06s">It</a>  should be in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=588.341s">It's</a>  $15.33, I believe, for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=589.801s">And</a>  it's around $1,200 for the chaperones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=595.149s">The</a>  reason for that is Medford requires us to provide money for a nurse if needed, so the chaperones don't need to pay that cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=604.511s">They</a>  also don't need to pay for things like participating in the workshops. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=610.272s">The</a>  chaperones will attend the workshops with the students to make sure they are safe and okay, but they don't actually participate in the workshops, so they don't pay a fee for that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=618.553s">Okay,</a>  and I know that it says that it has the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=623.647s">So</a>  is the insurance, I mean the details of the insurance, have they been over, like have you sat down or will you sit down with the parents and the students to make sure the details of the insurance itself because in the past we've had a couple of issues that parents thought it covered one thing and then it didn't cover another thing.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=641.26s">Yep,</a>  our insurance includes, it will cover everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=644.382s">We</a>  are requiring all of our students to purchase it in case of any problems or in case we had to pull out of the trip last minute for some reason.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=652.082s">That</a>  will all be explained to our kickoff meeting which is March 15th with the travel agency that we're using That will be they'll have a whole sign off on that the parent and student also have to sign off on it with this part of their contract Okay to commit to the trip, and I'm looking at it, and I'm just going over It says here that this includes the cost of providing a nurse, and I'm just curious maybe through the mayor to the superintendent I don't remember seeing this in other trips and</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=677.597s">That's</a>  new, that's part of the new updated 2016 as of August this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=683.764s">There's</a>  a new field trip packet and it says in that packet that you must provide the cost of a nurse just in case one of your students medically needs one.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=694.355s">What</a>  happens if we don't use that money?</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=697.638s">Then</a>  that would get reimbursed to the students.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=699.59s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=700.11s">And</a>  are the students paying for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=703.711s">Is</a>  it going to be out of their own pocket? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=704.911s">Is</a>  there fundraising involved with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=706.532s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=706.772s">There's</a>  actually a fundraising schedule included in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=709.913s">It</a>  is on page 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=710.573s">It's</a>  the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=712.693s">So</a>  far, the students have only done one fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=714.754s">We</a>  have one coming up this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=716.574s">But</a>  the band parents and I sat down last summer and figured out a way for the students to raise up to $1,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=722.896s">So</a>  they can technically pay for their entire trip if they need to.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=727.6s">Sounds</a>  good, and the only other question I have is, Mr. Seary might have the answer to this one, or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=733.903s">Joy,</a>  which is, our last year at this time, we actually had the science department take the students to Disney at this time, and I'm not sure if that's happening again this year.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=744.388s">They'll</a>  be back in our next meeting, looking to go in February, rather than... Oh, it would have been nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=750.931s">The</a>  library's preparing that, so we're keeping Disney busy.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=754.542s">Yeah,</a>  Audrey actually sent me an email to see if we could try to combine them, but I think her program only runs in February, and we really need to go in April because I have a lot of families that are driving down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=765.552s">All</a>  of our equipment has to be driven down three days before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=767.714s">We</a>  have to bring all the uniforms, all the music equipment and whatnot, so I don't want my grandparents to have to drive like three days in the snow to try to get there.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=775.741s">I</a>  was thinking it was in April, but you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=777.803s">It</a>  was in February last year.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=779.204s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=780.025s">All</a>  right, but it would have been nice.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=781.066s">We</a>  have a lot more baggage coming with us, so we're a little bigger to try to get down there.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=784.75s">I've</a>  been involved with that baggage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=786.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=788.253s">Thank</a>  you very much, and congratulations to all, and we're looking forward to hearing back.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=794.479s">Yeah,</a>  we're really excited to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=796.04s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=796.541s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=798.515s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=798.655s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=799.216s">I</a>  think this actually goes to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=801.617s">I'm</a>  not familiar with this clause that we've seen before, as my colleague said about requiring nursing coverage in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=810.324s">Can</a>  you speak to that at all?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=812.346s">Nursing.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=812.786s">Nursing.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=813.226s">Can</a>  you point out where we're talking about right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=817.089s">Well,</a>  there was... I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=822.414s">Is</a>  it on the first page? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=825.816s">I</a>  saw it when I read... <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=829.553s">It</a>  says cost per student, and it's mid, and it says this includes the cost of providing a nurse at $1,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=837.018s">And</a>  when Haley spoke, she said that that's because in the new rules and regulations, if nursing is needed for one student on the trip, then the cost of that nurse is... Well, again, you know, one of the things that we face, and we faced this a couple of times, is that we can't deny a person</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=859.137s">the</a>  right to go, and they may have needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=862.479s">So</a>  as a result, it's important to have the possibility that we would have a nurse on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=867.983s">But</a>  for the school system to assume that cost altogether undercuts our ability to fund or let's say sponsor these trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=876.449s">So</a>  by spreading it out, everybody shares a little bit of that responsibility.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=881.672s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=882.413s">Personally,</a>  I think that there should be a different way of doing it, because if I'm the student on the trip who needs a nurse, and I know that the year that I go, it's going to cost my fellow students more money, that feels extraordinarily awkward to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=900.526s">And</a>  so I don't think that we've looked at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=902.709s">I'd</a>  like to sort of see if there's another way that we could approach this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=907.474s">I</a>  understand what you're saying, what the issue is, but I'm uncomfortable with the way that this would work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=914.623s">It</a>  seems to me that we ought to have some money aside, because you wouldn't want to have <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=920.71s">the</a>  rest of the students feeling like my trip is more expensive because I had to provide nursing for someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=927.213s">I</a>  mean, it's just, it's just not, it's just uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=929.994s">The</a>  way the civil rights office would look at it is, is that if in fact an individual student, because they had a handicap or some other kind of need, we had to pay more, that would be reducing access. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=942.8s">That</a>  would be a, you know, making it more difficult for them to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=946.762s">So</a>  that's one of the reasons why, you know, it has to be spread out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=949.675s">So</a>  the choice is whether the school system picks it up or we spread it out across the cost of the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=955.278s">That's</a>  really the only two choices you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=956.978s">You</a>  have to have it as a, as a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=959.58s">The</a>  question is, is that who pays? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=961.561s">Is</a>  it spread out among all the people as a legitimate cost or is it the school system that picks it up every time there's a trip?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=968.864s">Well,</a>  I'm going to ask that you bring to us the new, um, policy that, that says this so that we can take a look at it in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=977.835s">Expressing</a>  my concern that this doesn't feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=980.558s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=981.258s">I</a>  certainly have no reason to You know, it's not something that's going to affect this trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=986.163s">So</a>  I certainly would make a motion that That we approve the trip this evening, but I would like to ask that we see that just Point of information to my colleague and working in another district I</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1001.918s">they</a>  do handle it in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1003.799s">And</a>  it's usually not obvious to what child, and the nurse provides care for all things on that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1011.143s">And</a>  it's good to have, it's not just for the child with the disabilities, but any child on medication as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1016.986s">If</a>  a child takes a prescription medication, you need to have a nurse disperse that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1021.148s">So</a>  it's not just this trip, it's all trips, and it's a regulation that needs to come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1028.492s">And</a>  most districts don't take on this cost, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1031.113s">because</a>  it would actually prohibit us, because we would have such a big line item for this, that it would prohibit children from getting this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1044.521s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1044.681s">Vandekloot.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1045.782s">So</a>  if I hear what you're saying, though, then it's saying that on all trips, whether it's the trip to Italy or the trip to- Overnight trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1054.307s">Or</a>  whatever, that a nurse needs to go because she's there to provide- A possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1060.698s">possibility</a>  of medical care for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1063.64s">That's</a>  sort of different than the way it's been presented to us this evening, because I'm certainly sure that's, and I think that that's something that is incumbent on the school committee to discuss and make clear amongst ourselves in our policy.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1077.809s">Just</a>  to clarify, a nurse doesn't go in case of a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1081.692s">So</a>  a nurse is required to go if there's prescription meds that need to be held and to be doled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1089.524s">and</a>  it has to be a registered nurse in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1091.826s">You</a>  could not provide a chaperone to stand in that place to give those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1097.371s">So</a>  if that's the situation, or if there is a medical condition, then that's when it's necessary to have a licensed RN on those trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1108.2s">And</a>  the districts that I have been talking to about this, because this is a bigger, newer thing, and the nurses that are actually providing care, they need more notification so that they can <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1118.924s">time</a>  notification so they can get people ready to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1124.191s">It</a>  would be a huge cost on a district to put money in the line item for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1129.037s">And</a>  it might shut down the amount of overnight opportunities we give to the students in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1136.958s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1137.118s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1137.818s">So</a>  I understand all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1139.179s">That's</a>  interesting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1140.399s">I</a>  just think that the school committee should have the opportunity to discuss it a little bit further with the wording before us and the rest of the policy.</p>

    <p>[Carolyn Joy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1149.381s">Will</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1149.741s">Because</a>  it needs to be included in our policy manual if we've updated a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1153.883s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1155.823s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1155.963s">Discaria,</a>  I believe you were blinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1157.704s">You're</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1160.184s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, you had a follow up?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1161.565s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1162.005s">I</a>  was just wondering since you're here and I don't know if you know or if the superintendent knows <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1166.96s">Have</a>  the musical instruments been sold at this point?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1170.121s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1170.681s">Has</a>  anything moved forward with that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1173.302s">We've</a>  got some estimates on them that have changed since the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1176.302s">So</a>  I'll pursue that with people as to find out what, what the status is.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1179.983s">So</a>  you'll provide us with the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1182.424s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1182.684s">And</a>  I'll add that to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1183.844s">Add</a>  the report to reports too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1185.725s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1186.265s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.505s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1187.685s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1188.345s">So</a>  I guess through you to the superintendent, I also need a little bit more of clarification as we've been speaking about the $1,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1195.834s">The</a>  $1,700 is money that the group, whoever's going, is going to raise to cover the $1,700?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1204.887s">I</a>  know that we ran into a problem.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1208.272s">The</a>  band traveled to Hershey Park last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1211.343s">And</a>  a lot of the students needed medication. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1213.024s">And</a>  because it was an overnight trip, we went for the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1216.426s">The</a>  nurse that we usually have come with us is a band parent who is a registered nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1221.97s">And</a>  they come because NESBA requires us, which is the New England Scholastic Band Association, requires us to have a nurse with us at all times to travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1230.175s">Unfortunately,</a>  through the new Medford policies working with the nurse's office at the high school, it's a HIPAA violation if a parent is the registered nurse on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1240.566s">because</a>  they can't know personal information about the other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1244.068s">So</a>  they had said they were going to put a new policy in place to work with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1248.651s">So</a>  because I was the only Medford employee, I had to administer and pass out all of the medications on the trip, for the entire trip, and carry it with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1257.437s">So</a>  they said they would be changing that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1259.856s">And</a>  what we had to do is send notifications home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1262.357s">I</a>  had to meet with all the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1263.338s">I</a>  had to sign off on something, a waiver granting me permission to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1268.3s">And</a>  now that they're saying moving forward, they would rather prefer to have a nurse on the trip so that any medications or any problems or anyone that would need any kind of assistance, the nurse is with us and then it wouldn't be a HIPAA violation and that person would be kind of unbiased in any situation.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.187s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1285.707s">So</a>  I guess I have a couple of questions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1288.855s">It's</a>  going to be incorporated into the students.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1291.618s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1291.838s">It</a>  comes out to be like $35 a student.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1294.461s">But</a>  now here's the other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1296.382s">Who</a>  pays for that person to go to Florida or Italy or wherever? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1301.147s">So</a>  is that their trip is also incorporated into the students fees?</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1304.751s">Um,</a>  the $1,700 is the, is the cost of having the nurse come and stay in a single hotel room, um, with a refrigerator for medications. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1312.398s">Um,</a>  and per, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1314.008s">Have</a>  a access to the parks where the students are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1317.07s">Okay,</a>  so that's incorporated Yes, so that $1,700 isn't just is inclusive separate plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1322.053s">No,</a>  that's the entire trip.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1324.314s">All</a>  right salaries are separate Okay salary for the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1327.796s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1329.397s">I</a>  need to get that All right, so it's all included report for next week's next meeting and then the other thing was is that as far as insurance is</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1339.707s">Okay,</a>  but this is separate, so forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1341.568s">Okay,</a>  forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.809s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1342.989s">Kreatz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1502.847s">Madam</a>  Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1505.847s">The</a>  headmaster is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1506.888s">The</a>  director and principal of the vocational school is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1510.188s">Tonight</a>  we'll give you a brief introduction and then we should schedule a more formal meeting to discuss it in greater depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1517.245s">But</a>  just to go over it so that you have a brief introduction and that you can ask any quick questions you may have of the two individuals, why don't you come on up and we can go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1528.313s">You</a>  know, as you know, we're currently in the fourth year of the process of having the two schools collaborate more completely together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1536.359s">And</a>  it's been a pretty high priority for the school committee because you've made that very clear that you want to see the two schools work closely together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1544.905s">And</a>  this goal would continue to <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1547.7s">expand</a>  the program to the comprehensive nature and give opportunities to both students at the Volk and at the high school that were previously not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1557.029s">We've</a>  advanced the program so that there's a lot of participation across the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1562.073s">This</a>  time the ninth and tenth grade students are fully integrated academically. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1566.257s">Some</a>  eleventh grade students are also integrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1569.039s">High</a>  school students can now explore occupational programs <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1572.247s">and</a>  so on and so forth, the number of electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1574.889s">So</a>  there are a number of benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1576.23s">I</a>  won't read the whole report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1577.431s">You</a>  get the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1579.252s">But</a>  if you have any direct questions you want to ask to the headmaster or the director, please do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1584.756s">And</a>  then we can schedule a committee of the whole to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1587.958s">It</a>  is important, if we're going to do this, that we move forward, because obviously we need a plan going into next year.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.099s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1595.299s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1597.16s">First</a>  of all, I have you both here, so I want to say congratulations for all the work that you, your staff, and everybody involved in this has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1604.485s">It's</a>  been an incredible four years as a school committee member and as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1609.028s">I'm</a>  really happy and thrilled to see the collaboration between the two and to see that divided <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1616.187s">the</a>  division between the two is finally diminishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1619.989s">As</a>  the superintendent said, I think this is a wonderful idea, but there were concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1625.611s">I</a>  had called him today because there's just so much to go over that we really can't do it in such a very short time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1633.114s">So</a>  I am thrilled that we are, you know, we have decided, or I'm hoping that we decide to do this as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1639.737s">So</a>  that way we could have more presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1642.501s">and</a>  that way we could sit down and actually go through the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1645.122s">I</a>  don't want to put hysteria out there saying that one school is taking over the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1650.383s">I</a>  want to make sure that people understand that this has been a work in progress, that the people involved are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1656.865s">It's</a>  not something that the school committee or their superintendent has thrown at you or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1662.127s">And</a>  I also want to give the opportunity for people in our city to come and voice their opinion if they have concerns or whatever the situation may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1671.149s">So</a>  with that being said, I, again, congratulate all of you, including the students, because I've seen the atmosphere change and it's nice to see.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1681.855s">So</a>  I just want to- Are you making a motion to send to Committee of the Whole?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1685.097s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1686.037s">On</a>  the motion, seconded by Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1688.499s">Did</a>  you wish to speak on this?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1689.379s">And</a>  I just had a question through you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1692.481s">Given</a>  the complexity of this nature, Mr. Superintendent, are there any contractual obligations that have to be visited or reworked?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1701.102s">we</a>  believe that the nature of what we're proposing does not require any contractual, uh, uh, negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1707.824s">However,</a>  you know, from time to time, the union may raise something, but, uh, we have, uh, vetted a lot with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1714.146s">And</a>  I think that, uh, at this point in time, uh, the issues that we have in front of you, changing the LAA code would not fall into that category.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1722.529s">Also,</a>  uh, Mr. Superintendent, we, uh, Madam Mayor, through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1726.69s">Riccio</a>  and Dr. Perrella, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1729.637s">This</a>  is something that has, as long as I've been a member of the school board, that we've tried to bring to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1734.981s">And</a>  I, as one committee member, thank you for your expertise and your tenacity in getting this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1741.126s">And</a>  hopefully, if there are any more questions, we'll get them squared away in the community hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1744.888s">And</a>  we can get this enacted as soon as possible and keep everybody on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1749.312s">And</a>  again, thank you very much for your due diligence.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1751.934s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1752.734s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1752.954s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1753.655s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1754.415s">I</a>  just want to say congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1755.656s">And</a>  I know how hard both of you have been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1758.132s">And</a>  I just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1759.953s">Would</a>  there be a new name for the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1762.914s">Would</a>  the school change names? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1764.374s">Would</a>  it maybe something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1765.795s">Or</a>  would it still be separate, like Medford High School and Medford Vocational or Medford Technical High School? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1772.097s">Would</a>  there be a name change? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1773.017s">I</a>  was just curious.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1775.56s">That's</a>  definitely open for conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1777.862s">At</a>  the present moment, we feel as though it's important for the integrity of both schools to keep both names until it's decided upon by a much larger group than Dr. Preller and I. OK.</p>

    <p>[John Perella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1790.691s">That</a>  is an option that we could create a common name if we so choose, if you so choose.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1798.697s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1799.058s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1799.398s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1800.539s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1801.86s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1802.921s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1805.29s">Since</a>  I've been elected, I've really focused on vocational education, and I saw the need in us, our thing, and I spoke day one, I think, to the superintendent about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1816.793s">I</a>  really always envision one school with two programs, and the crossover, and the way that you and your team work together is really making that happen on a daily basis for all the children in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1834.413s">I</a>  just need to know all the downfalls as well as all the benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1838.897s">I</a>  want to make a very educated choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1841.179s">I</a>  don't want to rush into it because I'm sure there's some community members that value the old traditional vocational as well as others who want the high school to remain the prestige that it's been as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1857.994s">So</a>  I think the transition is going to be uncomfortable because change sometimes is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1862.241s">So</a>  I want to make sure that we really appreciate community input and really hear what our community has to say, because this is a major change for education in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1875.171s">So</a>  I really would like to make sure that all our meetings are posted clearly and that everybody is invited and all voices are heard throughout the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1885.578s">I</a>  do see how well you collaborate together and that <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1891.019s">right</a>  there and how open you are has opened the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1894.202s">And</a>  so I would like to see that continue and I thank you for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1899.128s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1899.388s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1900.409s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1901.21s">I</a>  had, for instance, some questions about the reporting of MCAS scores and other tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1906.776s">I</a>  mean, for one of the things, actually for the vocational school kids in the past couple <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1910.993s">They've</a>  done so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1913.014s">It's</a>  been nice to have them separate just to say, look how our students are succeeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1919.077s">So</a>  I was sort of curious about some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1921.919s">I</a>  also wanted to make sure that as we discuss this, that everybody understands that this is not a weakening of the vocational school in any way, shape, or at all, but in fact, all along, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1940.715s">We've</a>  been working to strengthen the vocational school and our high school as well And the collaboration between them is what what we see does this but it's not necessarily Apparent, you know when you hear it it could certainly Be taken the wrong way So I think that's why it's very very important that we go and we have some more discussion on this so that we can very quickly <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1965.84s">clarify</a>  this to our community about what our future intentions might be.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1972.426s">And</a>  if I can, I guess just say publicly, being the vocational director for the last four years is that when I was hired, the intention was to bring the two schools together and to think and act more collaboratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1987.544s">but</a>  also to recoup funds that was going to another district outside of this district so that the residents of Medford and the students of Medford can benefit wholeheartedly to strong vocational technical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2001.214s">And</a>  I think over the last four years, the dedication of the superintendent and you as a school committee in supporting <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2008.5s">the</a>  vocational education and moving forward has been a significant value to the residents, but particularly to the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2016.807s">And</a>  so opening nine programs in four years is typically unheard of, of any other vocational school across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2024.874s">So</a>  it's really the commitment that you all have had and the trust in me and our ability to be able to do that job and move that school forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2034.622s">But</a>  it is equally important to offer those offerings to the comprehensive high school as well, because in any report, I mean, the Boston Herald, the Globe, in the last two weeks have had time and time again about a skilled workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2049.408s">And</a>  that skilled workforce is every kid in Medford, whether they're graduating with a Medford high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2055.81s">By</a>  the way, all kids in Medford graduate with a Medford high school diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2060.357s">We</a>  do not separate between the name of the diploma, and I think that that's important for the community to recognize, is that we believe wholeheartedly in strong vocational technical programs, or else I wouldn't be employed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2073.526s">And</a>  it's important for us to recognize that all kids are going to go to work, whether they're in the biotech fields or the engineering fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2081.652s">We're</a>  simply opening up an opportunity for more students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2085.675s">We</a>  have 55 grade nine Medford High School students taking career and technical education programs as an elective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2094.528s">And</a>  we want to be able to expand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2096.689s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that publicly.</p>

    <p>[John Perella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2098.429s">If</a>  I could add something as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2100.85s">We</a>  believe that the continued integration will be at the benefit of both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2105.932s">So</a>  it will strengthen each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2108.373s">And</a>  that's our experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2110.694s">And</a>  we think that this technical move of creating a common LEA number will just strengthen that, what we've been doing the past few years.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2118.838s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2119.879s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2120.079s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2121.06s">Yes,</a>  I just want to go back and I totally agree with what my colleagues have said and both of you actually, all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2129.171s">I</a>  think it's important that we do have this committee of the whole, but also <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2134.457s">let</a>  it be understood that this has been a, you know, work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2138.04s">This</a>  isn't something, and I have no intentions, and I'm sure we all have the same one, which is I'm not expecting to go into a committee of the whole for a couple of hours and have all the answers and shut the book and say, okay, guess what, this is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2151.349s">What</a>  I really would like to see is I would like to see as we post the meeting to make sure that we invite alumni, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2157.273s">that</a>  we make sure that we, you know, invite not only our alumni as students, but our alumni who are now our businesses, because I know that there's a lot of collaboration between the high school, the vocational school, and our businesses right now, but really the input of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2173.082s">And</a>  we have to understand, as I've mentioned before, and the fact is that having the opportunity of being on MASC, I've also seen the opportunity of <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2183.328s">how</a>  vocational schools have been changing throughout not only the state of Massachusetts, but throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2189.091s">And</a>  we have always had a strong vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2192.212s">And</a>  no one is saying that what we've done in the past wasn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2197.735s">We're</a>  just saying, let's go forward because we all have to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2201.917s">And</a>  change, as my colleagues have said, is a very delicate situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2205.807s">And</a>  I've had these conversations with alumni and strong people that have been affiliated with the vocational school in the past and said, what do you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2217.034s">You're</a>  getting rid of a vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2219.456s">This</a>  is not getting rid of one or eliminating the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2223.178s">This</a>  is a collaboration, a collaboration that we've been working on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2227.401s">And</a>  as a school committee, we've been working on it even longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2231.383s">So,</a>  again, the word out there, you know, the rumors are going to start, the gossiping is going to start, but I want to make sure that people understand the integrity of what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2240.586s">And</a>  the integrity of what we're doing is to give the opportunity for our students to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2246.388s">Whether</a>  they're in the high school side or the vocational side, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2250.25s">We</a>  want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2251.45s">that</a>  these kids leave our school with the ability of doing both. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2255.633s">And</a>  also making sure that our students are proud when they leave, no matter which side they're leaving from. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2261.837s">One</a>  is not a failure of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2263.839s">Many,</a>  many years ago, it was like, oh, you go to here if you can't be book smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2268.022s">That</a>  doesn't exist anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2269.763s">Book</a>  smart is across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2271.464s">It's</a>  for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2272.985s">And</a>  I tell students, you know, I tell <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2276.007s">people</a>  that have known what our vocational school was many years ago, that, well, why aren't our kids doing this anymore when they come out of the vocational? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2283.731s">And</a>  I said, they don't have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2285.792s">Because</a>  before, you had the choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2288.273s">You</a>  could do the academic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2290.114s">You</a>  did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2291.055s">But</a>  it wasn't as strong or mandated by the state as we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2295.397s">And</a>  so our students don't have that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2297.658s">So</a>  I just want to, that's a really big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2300.579s">for</a>  me, because we all hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2302.68s">And</a>  I just don't want those rumors to squash the good work that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2307.222s">It's</a>  a work in progress, and it's going to take more than just one Committee of the Whole.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2346.82s">Was</a>  it rocks, papers, scissors? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2348.061s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2348.281s">I'll</a>  be the spokesperson, but if you have any technical questions related to science, that would be rocking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2357.673s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2359.014s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2362.536s">School</a>  committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2363.736s">As</a>  we continue to integrate programs at our school, we actively pursue grant funding to enhance the educational opportunities for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2372.041s">This</a>  report will provide you with an update on grant activity between the vocational school and the science department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2379.348s">Massachusetts</a>  Life Sciences Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2382.39s">In</a>  2014, we received $100,000 to support the new Chapter 74 program of biotechnology. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2390.374s">These</a>  funds helped support the biotechnology and equipment and consumable supplies that completed in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2398.159s">The</a>  biotechnology program is now equipped with industry standard equipment and supplies to educate in biotechnology-related occupations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2407.684s">In</a>  2016, Rocco Sieri and Sam Christie, who is a member of our engineering and robotics department, co-wrote a $100,000 grant for robotics and automation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2421.459s">The</a>  key to this grant is that it is directly related to the Massachusetts Life Sciences, so it could not just be for robotics or engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2430.068s">The</a>  purpose of this grant was to design and build robotic arms to serve the biotechnology program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2436.151s">The</a>  arms will be manufactured using some of the equipment requested from CNC machinery to a laser cutter and programming the arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2444.496s">Students</a>  will learn all aspects of automation to be used in the life sciences occupations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2450.299s">Public</a>  notification of this will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2454.161s">This</a>  particular grant that Sam Christie is working on <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2457.496s">It's</a>  very important to understand where the $100,000 is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2461.339s">So</a>  as we develop more information, we'll probably give you another report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2465.621s">But</a>  the great part about Rocco Siuri and Sam Christie is that we could have spent $65,000 on one robotic arm that was manufactured by a manufacturer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2478.33s">Instead,</a>  the department opted to write the grant for $100,000 that would actually give the students the ability to build <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2487.543s">up</a>  to 20 robotic arms for automation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2490.286s">So</a>  each student will have a distinct opportunity to learn all aspects of the design process and using the CNC machinery from raw materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2499.517s">And</a>  that's an important learning difference comparatively speaking to other funds that have been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2507.271s">The</a>  Medford Education Foundation, which was written by Sam Christie, to support a student-initiated project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2514.253s">I</a>  have to say that two students were really the cheerleaders of this particular grant, and one of which being Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2520.915s">Kreatz's</a>  son, Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2523.215s">They</a>  are both in the robotics, and Derek. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2526.216s">They</a>  are both in the robotics program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2528.117s">They</a>  have been awarded $750 from the Medford Education Foundation and will support a student group to design, build, and test an underwater robot.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2758.844s">I</a>  was hoping just to throw them up there and see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2766.486s">All</a>  of our students on top of their technical education also receive a construction 10-hour OSHA certification that is mandated by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2775.631s">No</a>  student will be unattended at any time during any of this process because it really is driven by the instructional staff and the monitoring of the devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2786.493s">Once</a>  the devices are actually installed, which will be installed under the direction of cool green energy and power, the students will be monitoring them, but they're able to monitor it remotely.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2797.477s">That's</a>  what I was hoping for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2798.778s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2800.938s">Awesome</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2801.799s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2802.019s">Kreatz?</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2803.119s">Oh,</a>  I just wanted to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2804.64s">And</a>  the students, I've been hearing students are very excited about everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2810.062s">So</a>  it's very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2812.343s">I</a>  just hear all the good things every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2814.103s">I'm</a>  so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2814.763s">I'm</a>  so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2816.724s">So</a>  it's great.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2817.965s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place this report on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2820.646s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2821.846s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2821.966s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2823.187s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2824.607s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2825.688s">Madam</a>  Mayor, before we move away from these two, I think it's kind of important to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2830.43s">Here's</a>  two examples of the high school and the vocational school working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2834.692s">Biotech</a>  was never envisioned at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2838.434s">Environmental</a>  science was never envisioned as a vocational program because it was really a trade school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2843.957s">This</a>  is one of the evolutions that has taken place, and this is one of the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2848.959s">And</a>  this is where both sides of the school need to be able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2852.992s">because</a>  it's equally valuable to whether you're pursuing a high school diploma as a high school or a vocational technical area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2860.455s">And</a>  this is kind of the kind of thing we're looking at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2863.596s">In</a>  many of the jobs that come out, a high school graduate who knows this stuff will actually be able to go on and get a two-year degree before they pursue either a four-year degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2872.179s">So</a>  there's all kinds of options that are coming out that didn't exist before when we had a more traditional alignment.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2880.542s">Great</a>  synergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2882.591s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2883.832s">Report</a>  number six on this past one.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2886.094s">I</a>  just want to say, if possible, to both of you, if possible, like when the students are doing, I mean, I know you can't do it all the time, but is it possible to have certain things like videotaped that we could actually put it into a video and show it off and maybe even bring it to one of our meetings and see what's really going on on an everyday basis without <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2911.395s">I</a>  know the school is open for all of us to visit, and I know that we're all welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2916.119s">And</a>  even though we enjoy doing that, I think sometimes the students might think, oh, there's other people watching us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2920.842s">Whereas</a>  if they're free and they don't have that type of, yes, they have to have the supervision, but not our eyes being there, that maybe it would be nice to see and have them even come in down the road after this is done and give their input.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2935.606s">Well,</a>  now that we have a media tech program fully approved by the Department of Elementary and Education, we certainly have that ability to videotape these programs in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2945.248s">And</a>  that's something that we are considering through the public access station as well is through the education component is having monthly departmental what's happening in those departments so the community also gets to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2959.652s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2961.092s">I</a>  welcome anyone to come into this school, not just an open house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2964.835s">It</a>  is a very cool experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2968.96s">You</a>  know, it becomes your happy place when you go in and see what the kids are actually doing and performing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2975.641s">And</a>  we weren't able to offer that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2977.702s">So</a>  the kids that are in robotics and biotech, the work that they're doing in there is completely unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2984.563s">It's</a>  beyond me completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2988.204s">But</a>  I also often wonder when I walk in there, what would have happened to those kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2994.245s">Because</a>  we didn't have that program four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2996.867s">Where</a>  would they have gone? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2998.587s">And</a>  the creativity that is, they created this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3002.349s">The</a>  underwater robot was student-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3005.711s">It</a>  was not teacher-directed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3007.132s">It</a>  was student-driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3009.133s">We</a>  have three high school students that are now taking advantage of the environmental science program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3016.25s">which</a>  we wouldn't have had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3018.011s">And</a>  these kids are working alongside Tufts University and Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3022.132s">So,</a>  yes, we will start videotaping because we are at that point where the kids are doing some really phenomenal things and they should be recognized for what they're doing.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3032.734s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3033.454s">Great</a>  segue, by the way, to the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3035.315s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3035.655s">I</a>  mean, look at the relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3036.615s">The</a>  earlier you saw a gift to the robotics club, they go together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3042.456s">I</a>  mean, these things have synergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3044.217s">They</a>  actually fit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3045.985s">That's</a>  part of the reason why you see them all on the same agenda, so that you can see the relationships of different activities, how they interact with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3053.51s">They're</a>  not just standalone activities.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3057.753s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3057.953s">Kreatz</a>  on this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3058.994s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3059.534s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3061.996s">Frazier</a>  is putting out some small, short YouTube videos, and it's getting shared by the blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3069.261s">Lisa</a>  Evangelista shares them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3071.443s">So</a>  anybody who's interested in signing up, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3073.683s">You</a>  know, I get the YouTube videos and they're just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3076.785s">I</a>  even got to see just everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3079.327s">I</a>  got to see Mr. DeLaver and they were doing the Geometry Bee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3083.91s">Yeah,</a>  everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3084.891s">Everything's</a>  out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3085.631s">And</a>  today it was, you know, teenage, you know, don't drink teenagers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3090.975s">And</a>  they had the can video and just everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3094.137s">The</a>  Christmas caroling. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3095.358s">It</a>  was just wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3096.138s">So</a>  there are videos that are out right now that you can watch as well as all the pictures and the blogs and the write-ups.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3104.282s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3104.902s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3106.923s">Report</a>  number six, report on elementary science curriculums 2017 to 2020.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3110.324s">So</a>  we have our assistant superintendent, buttressed by our director of science.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3118.647s">So</a>  Rocco's not going to get off so easy this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3120.808s">He's</a>  going to get to the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3123.148s">So</a>  in the past few years in elementary education, you know that we put a lot of time and effort and energy into making sure we had a great literacy program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3132.111s">We</a>  have journeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3134.317s">and</a>  Envision, which is our math program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3136.759s">And</a>  now, it's time for us to do some science work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3140.381s">So,</a>  Rocco Sieri, who is our Director of Science, has prepared a report for you on the subsequent plans for the elementary science curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3151.703s">These</a>  plans are in response to school committee's request to pilot new curriculum-based and the most recent science frameworks, as well as offering some professional opportunities for our elementary staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3166.868s">So</a>  Mr. Cieri is here with us this evening to tell you all of the PD he has set up from now until the end of the school year for all of our elementary teachers and not just the classroom teachers, but our specialists as well, K to five.</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3184.299s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3185.902s">As</a>  you all know, the Board of Education adopted new science and technology engineering frameworks back in April of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3196.442s">While</a>  some of the standards are similar to what was in place before then, there have been updates based on what's in the field, changes in science and engineering over the past 15 years, as you've heard from previous reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3211.625s">There's</a>  a lot of integration that we want to be exposing our students to, and also adding inquiry and design skills that students need to successfully engage in these science and technology engineering disciplines. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3227.472s">Based</a>  on the 2006 framework, what we notice at the K-8 level is that there are sort of new ways of addressing the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3240.082s">In</a>  one case, all of the standards are broken up by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3245.826s">They</a>  used to be grade bands. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3247.894s">They</a>  were also broken up by discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3250.297s">That's</a>  no longer the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3252.339s">Each</a>  grade band, each grade has the four disciplines integrated right on the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3258.486s">So</a>  these are changes that the teachers are going to have to be sort of made apprised of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3264.88s">There</a>  are also some reductions, but at the elementary level, there's sort of like a net increase of some of these standards, and we want to make sure that we're aligned with those increases and also making sure that the teachers are comfortable with the new framework, familiar and comfortable with the new framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3282.326s">In</a>  the coming months, professional development opportunities are proposed to revamp the K to 5 science curriculum, the first of which is going to be an unpacking of the 2016 curriculum framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3293.7s">The</a>  document that's produced will serve as our local reference document so that when we review curriculum programs and recommend programs for piloting, we have something in place that reflects those standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3307.668s">Students,</a>  in terms of the MCAS, are still going to be assessed in grades 5, 8, and at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3316.132s">In</a>  this year, in 2017, the test questions are based on last year's or <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3321.611s">the</a>  old framework, the 2001-2006 framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3326.512s">A</a>  document which listed the exact standards to be assessed was developed by the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3334.314s">That</a>  was emailed to principals on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3337.135s">It</a>  was developed probably at the beginning of this year and released by the Department of Education at that time, shared with the principals, and on January 25th, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3348.341s">there's</a>  one of the professional development programs where we'll review those specific standards, tie them to the released questions, and allow grades four and five teachers to review these things to use them as assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3361.326s">So</a>  that's one of the PDP opportunities that's available on the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3368.549s">In</a>  2018, that exam, and over the next several years, we'll start that gradual transition from the old frameworks to the new frameworks in assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3378.726s">And</a>  so by that point, we should be completely integrated into the new framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3387.649s">We've</a>  got several opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3390.29s">There's</a>  going to be two introductions of the curriculum framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3394.432s">One</a>  will occur in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3396.273s">Another</a>  will occur in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3397.973s">And</a>  we'll continue these next year as well to make sure that people are familiar with those frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3403.475s">And</a>  we have two other sort of larger professional development opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3409.878s">One</a>  of them is to unpack the standards, and that'll be occurring from the beginning of February to essentially the end of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3417.821s">Once</a>  that document is created, we'll begin a second professional development committee, which will look at curriculum programs that are available for science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3427.706s">In</a>  that particular program, for the teachers, there are PDPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3433.357s">But</a>  this also involves the, we can have members of outside community groups participate in that because the vendors will come in, share their programs with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3444.743s">We</a>  will have certain standards that we want to look at and then also have some input and questions at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3453.033s">Then</a>  we'll review all of those programs and decide which ones we'd like to pilot for the following year, 2017, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3458.454s">And</a>  then by the end of 2018, we should be able to select one for implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3468.756s">Through</a>  2017 and 2018 and beyond, you'll notice that we're going to have to look at content instruction, how to use the program that's chosen at the end of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3480.273s">what</a>  kind of pedagogy is most appropriate for the curriculum programs, and also targeting some of the key content in earth and space sciences, life science, physical sciences, and technology and engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3492.58s">I</a>  realized that at the last school committee meeting that I was supposed to present at, you got a lot of opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3499.104s">It</a>  will be very similar in terms of what kinds of opportunities we'll be able to provide for professional development to the elementary school teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3507.047s">and</a>  staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3507.968s">So,</a>  moving forward, those relationships we've built with these organizations don't disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3514.233s">They</a>  only get enhanced and sort of amplified. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3518.436s">We're</a>  sort of at the beginning stages of this process.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3523.039s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3523.64s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3523.84s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3525.181s">So,</a>  can I ask, is there – I think there's a little bit of a problem here, because as you're talking about standards, the committee is not familiar enough <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3535.032s">with</a>  each of the standards and knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3536.673s">So</a>  it's, it feels distant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3538.794s">Um,</a>  and obviously our, our concern was, was that, um, we would be improving, uh, elementary science education, um, so that it impacted students quickly within this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3554.683s">Are</a>  there, for example, more hands on activities for students and are those, um, so as it's a great question, um,</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3563.287s">Certainly,</a>  as we review and unpack the standards, we want to look to what kinds of materials are available currently in our curriculum that we can reuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3575.592s">Many</a>  of the activities that are present in future activities will reflect a need for materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3584.236s">And</a>  so we'll be sort of looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3586.677s">I'm</a>  working with Donna Lasky to identify some of those places where <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3592.978s">Materials</a>  are necessary, hands-on activities, and that will allow some of those activities to happen in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3599.642s">And</a>  then the longer-term plan, which is the purchase of a program, would need to occur as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3608.188s">So</a>  it's embedded within these activities that teachers also get some professional development on what kind of activities they can perform with their kids.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3621.223s">Do</a>  you envision any sort of science nights where parents are being brought in and helped, how they can help their kids with science education the way we do for math and literacy?</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3633.068s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3634.228s">Those</a>  are going to be additional opportunities.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3636.789s">I</a>  guess I'm just a little bit concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3638.75s">I</a>  was speaking with a group of parents and they told me that their child had never had a hands-on science activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3646.291s">And</a>  so, and I felt such an urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3650.274s">Um,</a>  so that's part of what I'm trying to grasp here, uh, of trying to say is, is okay, how are we going to meet those needs sooner? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3663.665s">So</a>  that's what I'm concerned about.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3666.588s">So</a>  madam mayor, if I can, um, as you know, the envision series will be paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3672.412s">So</a>  as a result, our next budget will allow some funding that was previously assigned to envision, and then previously before that to journeys will now become available for science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3681.718s">That's</a>  our next priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3683.039s">And</a>  that was what we discussed at budget last time.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3687.462s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3687.682s">Mustone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3688.782s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3689.843s">And</a>  I'm glad to see there's an outline. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3692.765s">So</a>  from the little that I've learned so far in curriculum development, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3697.724s">So</a>  the Curriculum Committee, it's the third paragraph down, did you pick the committee, or do people volunteer to be on the Curriculum Committee?</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3703.667s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3706.328s">So</a>  unpacking the standards for the Science and Technology Engineering Curriculum Committee, that's available on the Medford Public Schools PD website, and individuals sign up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3717.174s">It's</a>  not a picking.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3718.114s">So</a>  will that not be the group that will actually pick the curriculum that we finally put into place September of 2018?</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3724.46s">That</a>  would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3725.161s">They</a>  are unpacking the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3728.044s">It</a>  requires teachers to be familiar with those standards to be able to then speak to which programs best match the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3735.771s">So</a>  teachers will provide you with input on which standards align best with the programs or which programs align best with the standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3746.247s">There's</a>  other people that have to provide some input in that, and I'm sure that school committee members and also community members would want to participate in the fourth one down, which is reviewing curriculum programs, where people would come from the vendors, explain what kind of program it is, and then we can ask questions of the vendors themselves.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3768.153s">How</a>  many programs do you expect will be piloted? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3770.762s">that</a>  are out there that are somewhat.</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3772.243s">Um,</a>  we hope to narrow it down to two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3774.864s">I</a>  don't think more than two would be a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3777.124s">Um,</a>  so I think I'm frustrated if I am not, I hope I'm not appearing too frustrated, but I was hoping for September of 2017 cause my kids at the Roberts have books that say 1983 and I feel like since my oldest who's now in eighth grade, I can bring the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3794.531s">I've</a>  been talking about science and <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3797.59s">I</a>  know we kept on waiting for the frameworks, the frameworks, the state kept putting it off, the state kept putting it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3802.012s">Now</a>  we're here and it seems like it's, I understand it's a well thought out plan, but in the meantime, so we have the whole year of 2017 to 2018 that we're still stuck with this very old science curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3813.518s">So</a>  I guess what Paulette was saying, is there a budget that we can do to have more hand on that, you know, Ellery Klein has written to both of us about kits that you can bring into classrooms for teachers.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3827.428s">So</a>  Rocco has brought in kids in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3831.209s">And</a>  like I said a few moments ago, the availability of funding now that Envision has paid for, and Journeys has paid for, now moves to science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3839.933s">So</a>  Rocco will get first crack at those dollars that have been previously assigned to mathematics.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3846.575s">So</a>  that's for this September 2017?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3849.236s">For</a>  going forward.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3849.956s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3850.317s">Going</a>  forward.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3850.977s">And</a>  I mean, you just stepped into this role, so I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3854.678s">around</a>  when Quinn was in first grade, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3857.059s">So</a>  I feel like it's not you that I'm really frustrated with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3860.201s">It's</a>  the science curriculum for the past eight years.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3863.503s">Well,</a>  at the elementary level, I mean, the science program has not been everything we want it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3868.026s">But</a>  you can see at the upper grades, based on some of the discussions that you've seen, science has taken off in a very, very robust way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3875.77s">But</a>  this one of the discussions we had was to make the elementary science program a priority going forward with funding available. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3883.508s">that</a>  can be used in the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3886.089s">And</a>  with a game plan to review it against the standards, I think you're going to see quite a bit of material going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3891.631s">But</a>  the material that's selected will have to be things that we know will match up with the standards and with either one of the two or three curriculum programs that we would adapt. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3902.635s">I</a>  mean, for example, if you're looking at thermodynamics, you're looking at heat and cold and the impact on matter, you can have kits that demonstrate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3912.989s">that</a>  aren't going to be contradictory to any program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3917.472s">And</a>  you can do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3918.452s">You</a>  can have botany programs that aren't going to contradict any program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3923.636s">But</a>  you won't get the exact program until people actually review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3927.958s">But</a>  you will get the opportunity to have additional materials at the elementary level based on our budget allocations next year.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3934.615s">Okay,</a>  so how do we plan over the summer to have kits come into the schools for that one year?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3939.836s">Well,</a>  this is where, you know, if Rocco knows that we are going to allocate, which he will know, we're going to allocate those funds, he will start identifying those items with teachers and letting us know so that we begin the purchasing process going into the summer and possibly running some workshops.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3955.3s">So</a>  you are giving Rocco the authorization to ask science teachers to look at kits to <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3961.224s">Purchase.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3961.724s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3962.184s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3962.605s">Everyone</a>  heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3964.145s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3965.926s">Who</a>  didn't hear it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3967.607s">I'm</a>  hoping that the process that we've identified will help us work with teachers that are interested in doing so and also community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3974.65s">So</a>  it, it seems like it's a very slow, but I feel like it's pretty accelerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3981.153s">We've</a>  got six months to do a lot of work and hopefully by next September we'll have something pretty concrete to offer to the children.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3990.675s">But</a>  no, it's a year and a half out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3992.637s">It's</a>  September of 2018.</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3995.72s">Well,</a>  not necessarily, because you would put in place some things that you know are going to work, that are identifiable.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4006.349s">But</a>  the curriculum won't be chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4008.431s">The</a>  new program won't be chosen until September of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4012.355s">So</a>  we still have a school year between now and September of 2018, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4015.517s">This</a>  coming September, September of 2017.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4017.779s">The</a>  final program selection won't be until 2018-19, but the curriculum based on standards and based on new materials will be available next year.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4029.645s">And</a>  what will happen is we'll be piloting a few programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4033.647s">These</a>  pilots offer materials for our staff, so we will have the materials.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4039.349s">Right,</a>  but just like in Visions and Journeys that my kids piloted, some of my kids piloted the program and other classes didn't and were stuck with the older curriculum for that school year.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4048.836s">Well,</a>  I believe that we'll have two different pilots running simultaneously with the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4054.621s">For</a>  every class.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4055.542s">Because</a>  only certain classes got picked to pilot envisions and journeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4059.084s">Not</a>  every class did those.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4060.165s">Well,</a>  teachers chose, after looking at them, what they wanted to pilot in envision and journeys. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4065.93s">But</a>  every class should have one of the science curriculums to pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4070.394s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4071.735s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4072.516s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4074.854s">Point</a>  of information, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4075.875s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4077.215s">For</a>  members that, I know this is a, it's kind of thrown at us, and I know being a little bit newer on this process, it's harder to understand, but just to explain, I know that with the math that you just talked about, when this all came about, we were basically in the same position that we were in for the math as we are now for the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4096.768s">And</a>  what happened is the department heads, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4100.811s">and</a>  the teachers collaborated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4102.553s">They</a>  sought out the information that they were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4105.618s">Even</a>  though the curriculum didn't change until the following year, it was presented to us around budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4110.922s">it</a>  was presented to us prior to budget time, so that way we could actually allocate how much money we're gonna put towards the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4118.945s">And</a>  then it does take a component of everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4122.547s">So</a>  as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4123.267s">Caldwell</a>  said, it wasn't that we chose as a school committee which classes were gonna do certain things, that we also gave the opportunity to the teachers that work on the subject on an everyday basis, that they decided what they wanted in their classroom room, and at one point in time, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4138.913s">they</a>  thought each group was different from the group next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4142.798s">So</a>  as far as I am understanding it all, it's a very similar process, even though it might not be the academic year of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4151.691s">with</a>  us knowing what has been brought to us by the state and with the work that the department heads and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4157.836s">Caldwell</a>  are doing, they're going out, they're seeking out the best possible programs for us, then they will be bringing it back to us and in the meantime also reviewing it with the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4170.466s">So</a>  there's a lot of components to it rather than just saying this is what we're approving and that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4176.831s">So</a>  if that was beneficial.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4179.573s">Are</a>  you all set?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4180.874s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4181.014s">Stone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4182.315s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4183.356s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4184.676s">So</a>  just to clarify, when we piloted the math and the English, certain grade levels were picked and certain classrooms were picked. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4192.561s">Not</a>  every single classroom piloted those items, one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4199.866s">Some</a>  had none. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4201.865s">So</a>  what I want for clarification, when we're piloting in 2017, is every elementary classroom going to be piloting?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4212.154s">I'd</a>  say yes.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4213.234s">I</a>  would say yes, too.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4216.677s">It's</a>  hard for me to believe that no one piloted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4219.4s">I</a>  know that, personally, when we were piloting our literacy series and our math series, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4226.188s">I</a>  can't think of a teacher who didn't choose one to pilot because what we were currently using at the time was everyday mathematics and none of the teachers wanted to stick with everyday mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4237.191s">They</a>  wanted to choose one or the other to pilot.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4240.792s">So</a>  another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4242.432s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4243.252s">So</a>  the companies that are piloting with us and giving us their programming, um, to review, to pick are going to provide us with enough materials <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4254.306s">for</a>  each and every classroom and each and every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4257.287s">One</a>  or two of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4259.608s">That</a>  is our hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4260.689s">We</a>  are going to try to do that, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4262.609s">And</a>  that's what happened in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4264.03s">We</a>  got enough material for every single classroom or do we share it?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4268.832s">So</a>  Mr. Benedetto, when I was looking at the journeys program and our math program, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4275.621s">If</a>  a teacher or a classroom wanted one specific program, they were allowed to use that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4282.242s">Most</a>  of the teachers did not want to stick with whatever they had before. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4286.703s">So,</a>  yes, it's our hope that each of our teachers in each of the classrooms get to pilot one or the other before a decision is made.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4296.005s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4297.145s">I</a>  think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4298.246s">I</a>  just didn't think it was that clear, and I'm very happy to hear that, that every classroom will be piloting <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4305.146s">a</a>  new science curriculum program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4307.346s">I</a>  had some other questions about, um, so since we have these new standards, what are we doing now this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4313.568s">Are</a>  we taking what we have and changing it up or are we waiting for the training and is the training required by all of our students?</p>

    <p>[Rocco Cieri]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4321.97s">Um,</a>  so if it would be very difficult to switch over right now because the students that are in grades, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4333.416s">potentially</a>  grades three through five, could still see the old framework standards on their test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4340.458s">So</a>  to move to those immediately could be problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4347.241s">Right</a>  now, the teachers are, they've been asked to stay with the current standards that are in place, which are the 2006 standards, according to Medford standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4360.645s">So</a>  that's what we've, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4362.596s">That's</a>  what I've suggested to teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4366.178s">In</a>  the coming year, there will be some changes and it will make sense at that point when teachers are piloting that we should be able to find a program that matches. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4375.743s">If</a>  we have any standards that are found in the new frameworks, it looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4383.285s">There</a>  are more framework standards in the new than there are in the old, so my guess is they would be covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4389.427s">The</a>  kids would be covered by that point.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4391.348s">Okay,</a>  and as far as professional development is, I know it's encouraged for our teachers to attend, especially with so many changes in this department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4403.052s">Are</a>  we making any requirements in their evaluations or in their goals or their SMART goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4410.615s">That's</a>  not to you through the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4413.117s">What</a>  are our expectations for, you know, wonderful teachers to make sure that they receive this professional belt or they show up at it?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4422.822s">Well,</a>  every teacher has their own evaluation and they set up SMART goals and they set up individual goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4428.145s">And,</a>  you know, obviously you try to encourage them to take on goals that are going to advance their capacity to help their students in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4436.789s">But,</a>  you know, there are so many different areas for an elementary school teacher to be involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4442.577s">Many</a>  of which is, many of which these things are tied to differentiated instruction, working with youngsters who have other needs and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4452.521s">The</a>  content areas, you know, really vary based on the expertise of the teachers as to which ones they would spend more time with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4460.343s">But</a>  certainly something as important as this, you know, will get greater emphasis in our discussions with the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4470.995s">There</a>  are many things that teachers need to be competent in.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4473.816s">My</a>  experience is teachers are really good at certain things in science, like math or English. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4480.88s">And</a>  some are really good in history and social studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4484.942s">And</a>  some are exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4486.943s">And</a>  maybe we can have mentor teachers through this process to help those that struggle with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4493.363s">a</a>  little bit and just, you know, our lead teachers, whichever way you want to describe it, so that way we use the people that find this natural and let them share their knowledge with the other teachers and help them along.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4509.575s">As</a>  you know, there are at least, in most instances, four sections in each elementary school by grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4516.62s">Sometimes</a>  it's five. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4519.182s">And</a>  generally within each of those groups, there are people who have expertise in different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4523.468s">So</a>  it's important that we emphasize that they share with each other and that they work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4528.132s">And</a>  we've done that right along, but we need to perhaps emphasize that a little bit to people that are more akin to a particular subject matter like science, that they step up and serve maybe as a little bit of a leadership role for the other members of that group.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4541.62s">So</a>  I'm actually encouraged when I walk around to the different schools by the number of teachers who are excited by the new science standards and have been asking me, when are we going to do some work on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4553.225s">And</a>  then Rocco put together this schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4555.626s">So</a>  I think that we're going to find a lot of teachers very excited about participating.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4560.848s">I'm</a>  sure they're dying for new materials.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4563.229s">I'm</a>  sure they are, too.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4564.35s">And</a>  new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4565.51s">Thank</a>  you so much for your time and effort on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4567.711s">I</a>  know when there's new standards brought out, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4570.266s">It's</a>  a tremendous amount of time to see what we have that works and what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4576.587s">And</a>  I know it seems like a very long time for this process, but we also need to plan the money for it, because we want to fund it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4584.289s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4585.949s">Motion</a>  to accept the report and place it on file.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4588.65s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4589.43s">On</a>  the motion to accept the report placed on file, seconded by Mr. Panadetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4593.311s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4594.071s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4594.651s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4596.052s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4596.772s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4603.476s">Item</a>  seven, report on WIDA access testing for ELL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4608.437s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4609.277s">So</a>  as you know, we have to test our non-native language speakers, our ELL students, every year under a system called the WIDA testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4619.899s">And</a>  our director of ELL is here to go over that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4624.24s">It's</a>  now underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4625.18s">It's</a>  going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4626.521s">But</a>  we want to bring you up to date in case you hear these terms and you want to know what's going on with regard to access testing <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4633.527s">and</a>  how it works in terms of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4636.651s">So</a>  Leslie Trotter is here.</p>

    <p>[TQ69v4m8ftY_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4638.933s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4639.694s">So</a>  we are in the midst of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4641.837s">Um,</a>  we started at the McGlynn last week and today we started at the high school and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4648.465s">Um,</a>  the other schools will follow suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4650.687s">And</a>  I think in the report I gave you, you have a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4654.404s">So</a>  I just want to give you a quick rundown so that you do understand it a little bit better because there is some confusion, it seems, about this test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4662.488s">So</a>  all schools except for the Andrews will be testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4669.212s">The</a>  Andrews is the only school in the city that doesn't have an ELL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4673.095s">And</a>  so this is a mandated by federal and state law test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4681.208s">Federal</a>  law mandates that all ELLs across the country will take a test to determine English language proficiency, all the ELLs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4690.454s">And</a>  so we are part of the WIDA Consortium, Massachusetts, and many other states are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4696.698s">So</a>  the WIDA Consortium states give the Access 2.0 test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4702.282s">Other</a>  states choose a different comparable test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4706.343s">Our</a>  window for testing in Massachusetts is January 5th to February 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4712.047s">The</a>  test measures, as I said, the English proficiency level of ESL students, excuse me, ELL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4718.432s">There</a>  have been so many acronyms over the years that I've been teaching ESL, ELL, bilingual, whatever you want to call it at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4725.597s">So</a>  now they're switching over to EL as of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4729.981s">So</a>  you might hear ELL, you might hear EL, they're the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4735.922s">The</a>  results are very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4738.064s">They</a>  determine the amount of ESL service a student receives each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4744.929s">And</a>  it also determines whether a student can exit the program or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4748.792s">They</a>  have to reach a certain benchmark to be able to exit the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4753.956s">According</a>  to data put out by DESE, last year 72 percent of our students made progress in learning English. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4761.484s">The</a>  state designated the district target as 52%, so we were well above. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4767.266s">And</a>  they also designated our target for attaining English proficiency at 17%, and we reached 31%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4778.471s">So</a>  we did very well last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4781.452s">We're</a>  testing approximately 425 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4784.513s">I</a>  know that is a different number than what you have, but our numbers change literally every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4789.965s">One</a>  poor little girl, Arthur Roberts, entered today and had to take the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4794.307s">So</a>  luckily they mostly don't mind doing it because it's on a computer and it's pretty interactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4801.791s">So</a>  the little ones particularly are quite engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4807.853s">The</a>  only paper versions that we're using this year are the kindergarten tests and the access alternate test for the kids with severe disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4818.606s">So</a>  those are the only paper ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4821.528s">So</a>  far, it's really gone quite smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4824.71s">We've</a>  had a few tiny little issues, but nothing that couldn't be resolved very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4829.613s">And</a>  that's thanks to really a lot of legwork by my administrative assistant, my assessment specialist, the technology department, the test coordinators at each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4841.501s">It's</a>  been a group effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4844.063s">And</a>  it's going really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4848.045s">So</a>  yeah, I don't really have a whole lot to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4850.187s">I</a>  mean, I could thank a whole lot of people, but I don't know that I will spend time doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4856.712s">So</a>  if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4881.886s">So</a>  as you heard about ELL or EL, you know, in the use of technology and the use of technology and with regard to our other programs, science programs and the like, one of the most important initiatives that we have to launch in this district is to upgrade our technology network infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4902.176s">Uh,</a>  in order to be eligible for substantial, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4904.742s">tier</a>  two E-rate funding and related grants, we have to complete a study of our current network infrastructure, which will then guide our applications for funding and ensure that we efficiently and effectively identify and target the critical elements of our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4922.892s">We're</a>  eligible approximately for $400,000 federal entitlement funds, which we then have to match with an additional 40% at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4932.917s">This</a>  funding would then supplement local capital funds and other available grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4937.902s">The</a>  funding is available this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4940.305s">We</a>  cannot guarantee that going forward, given changes in Washington and other places, that the money will be available in subsequent years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4948.673s">So</a>  it behooves us to go get it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4952.257s">It's</a>  imperative that we act now for multiple reasons, the availability of funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4956.421s">the</a>  overall demand for technology for both instructional and administrative matters, the increased requirement to implement computer-based estate testing, and planned initiatives for online coursework and remedial credit recovery programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4971.484s">Further,</a>  the purchase of state-of-the-art hardware and software must be supported by a network infrastructure that is sufficiently constructed to enable simultaneous high utilization and to filter out cyber malware <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4984.2s">consistent</a>  with SIPA standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4985.72s">SIPA</a>  is the Computer Protection Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4992.322s">The</a>  study must provide us with detailed information, an independent assessment that is free from internal bias, which we tend to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5000.365s">Everybody</a>  has a different idea of what ought to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5003.145s">Programs</a>  and services are becoming increasingly dependent upon a robust and reliable internet and intranet capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5011.128s">So</a>  we selected, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5013.417s">TechEdge</a>  of Cambridge to conduct the study and provide us with ongoing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5018.219s">TechEdge</a>  is our current E-rate consultant and have done this for a period of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5023.341s">They</a>  are also the E-rate consultants in the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Massachusetts Instructional Technology, Informational Technology rather, Massachusetts Department of Youth Services, and over 20 Massachusetts school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5038.428s">And</a>  they serve as the technical consultants to the DESE Office of Digital Learning <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5043.06s">the</a>  digital connections partnership grant, which is another grant we'll go after, which is an important grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5048.403s">And</a>  they're the consultants.</p>

    <p>[4OUqwVVt47Q_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5049.844s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5050.985s">So</a>  anyway, you know, what's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5053.587s">If</a>  you agree with me, we need to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5055.628s">We</a>  want to get this done so we can apply and move it, move it forward.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5059.991s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5060.971s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5062.552s">Um,</a>  so my end with reading this paperwork, my understanding is that, um, the study is gonna, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5070.131s">be</a>  at a cost of $33,150, and that's what we'd be approving this evening.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5076.059s">We'll</a>  be approving check-edge, approximately that kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5078.964s">We</a>  don't think it'll exceed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5080.065s">We</a>  think it may be less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5082.769s">And</a>  it'll be paid for by funds that we acquire.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5086.889s">paid</a>  for by what funds?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5088.15s">E-rate</a>  funds that we acquire.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5089.871s">So</a>  out of the $400,000 that we require?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5092.313s">Out</a>  of the funds we currently acquire from E-rate.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5094.755s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5096.096s">We'll</a>  get about $60,000 a year.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5098.878s">So</a>  was that already in our budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5101.0s">Yeah,</a>  that's something I planned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5101.801s">Do</a>  you utilize for something else?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5103.522s">No,</a>  I planned for that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5104.883s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5105.764s">So</a>  does it have to go to bid since it's such a high thing?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5108.787s">No,</a>  their contract, they have a state contract to provide this service.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5112.71s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5113.27s">So</a>  we can avoid that and work with people that have knowledge.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5115.952s">And</a>  we have been working with this organization.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5117.973s">Right,</a>  this is a company that we work with.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5119.874s">They</a>  had a lot to do with our last capital project that we did for the computers in the school system.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5124.937s">Great,</a>  so I have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5127.579s">I</a>  really believe that we need to always invest in this and we definitely need to move towards this because of all the new testing requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5137.605s">But</a>  I just want everybody to be aware, when we get the $398,000, we'll also have to bond for the 250,000, the 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5146.551s">So</a>  we need to start communicating with city councilors right away about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5151.935s">Has</a>  any of that started yet?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5153.596s">No,</a>  we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5154.477s">We'll</a>  begin that process as we go forward from this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5158.019s">You</a>  know, we can then acquire the company and then we'll put together a package for presentation.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5165.244s">My</a>  concern is that we'll, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5167.075s">pay</a>  the $33,150 and then not get approval from our council or support at this time for a bond of $235,000 to make this?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5178.366s">I</a>  have to believe that the Medford City Council will be supportive of enhancing technology in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5186.174s">I</a>  don't believe that they would be less than supportive of something <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5189.856s">that</a>  would provide us with close to $400,000 position us to get additional dollars and allow our students to have the latest information capacity.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5199.059s">This</a>  is my point is that we need to collaborate just like our high school and vocational school does with the city council on projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5207.442s">And</a>  a meeting of both boards when this comes forward is never a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5212.724s">Opening</a>  up that communication.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5214.965s">We'll</a>  leave that to you, but I think the reality is that we need to put together our plan, we need to come in and say what we're going to do, and then we should be asking for more than... <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5225.168s">just</a>  a match for this from the chair.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5228.709s">We</a>  did submit the list that originally came to us that the superintendent and all his department has put together that was given to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5236.151s">So</a>  they're aware of the cumulative list that the superintendent put together.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5241.333s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5242.153s">I</a>  just want to make sure that it actually goes all the way through. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5245.694s">Um,</a>  I just want to, Alec, I just want the whole community to know how much we're spending and what we're approving tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5252.377s">Like</a>  I want to name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5254.311s">And</a>  so that way people understand it is going to cost us $33,150 to do the study, which could give us the opportunity of receiving close to $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5263.836s">And</a>  more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5264.057s">And</a>  more. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5267.412s">and</a>  money to upgrade our programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5270.434s">And</a>  yes, we did just upgrade them, what, four years ago, but it's a continual issue.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5275.516s">We</a>  need to continuously do this.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5278.178s">Right,</a>  I think it's a great program, and I think any way that we can get stuff 60% funded is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5284.541s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we're ready to answer any questions that our Councilors have, so that way they're in an open, respectful way, because, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5296.807s">There</a>  are other things on their caseload other than just this, and I want them to know that this is a priority for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5305.853s">And</a>  I wanted to know who will be overseeing this project.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5309.255s">Well,</a>  the project will work with the consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5312.117s">I</a>  mean, they'll report directly to myself and to Christine, the business office, but we'll work closely with Alan Arena, who is our network <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5320.234s">and</a>  Richie Trotter, who is our instructional media supervisor, and all the other people, Molly Gladen, who works on our special projects, and all the support staff in the technology area, as well as the department heads and the like who know what they need for their particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5335.204s">So</a>  they'll be interviewed, and all their input will come together in a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5340.947s">So</a>  this report will reflect not only what, you know, the actual inside network does, but also what people believe they need.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5349.28s">So</a>  I second Mr. Skerry's motion to approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5352.564s">I</a>  just wanted to really be clear as to how much money we're spending up front.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5359.251s">On</a>  the motion for approval of expenditure of the funds to use TechEdge for E-rate technology upgrades and studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5368.481s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5373.902s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5380.866s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5382.266s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5384.207s">Update</a>  report on new public records law and appointment of MPS, public records access officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5390.21s">If</a>  I could, prior to the superintendent speaking, there was a change in the law this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5395.113s">It</a>  was set to implement 2017, which is why this is before you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5400.515s">And</a>  I just wanted to go on record that we are required to have a records access officer named for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5407.877s">And</a>  because of the size of our community, we felt it was wise to have a city person as well as a school person that's responsible for all the freedom of information requests that come through our doors on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5420.22s">So</a>  we have named Kim Scanlon, who's Assistant City Solicitor, as the RAO for the City of Medford, and the Superintendent would like to announce his selection.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5431.605s">So</a>  we're going to appoint Alicia Palmer, who works in our human resources area with the Director of Finance and Administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5440.852s">to</a>  take on that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5441.832s">Alicia</a>  is very computer savvy. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5443.753s">She's</a>  extremely diligent and capable of doing this kind of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5447.673s">And</a>  that's where we're going to go with this appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5451.374s">And</a>  we believe that there's a lot involved here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5456.135s">We've</a>  already started to get some requests across our table, and they need to be responded to very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5462.577s">And</a>  we need to have the capacity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5466.077s">Naturally,</a>  no one person does things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5467.758s">The</a>  individual coordinates other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5469.815s">So</a>  if something's requested from a department, that individual needs to get on that department to get the information, pull it up, coordinate it, pull it together, and ship it out in a timely way.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5478.997s">They</a>  will be the gatekeeper, though, to make sure when requests that come in, answers go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5484.518s">So</a>  it'll organize the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5486.018s">Right</a>  now, you could send it to any department head, and they're doing their own freedom of information request. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5491.319s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5492.439s">How</a>  will this affect our budget, and where are these funds coming for for the increased cost in this person's position?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5499.377s">It</a>  won't affect our budget that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5500.858s">I</a>  mean, we're talking about approximately $5,000 of annual outlay, uh, to do this plus any costs associated with the production of materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5509.863s">But</a>  we can charge individuals making the request and we will recoup a substantial portion of that cost, um, over time because as individuals request items, we will appropriately charge them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5523.031s">If</a>  individual requests, a simple couple of documents, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5526.627s">But</a>  if an individual requests any kind of work, we're going to be charging them at the rate that's allowed by law, and also for the paperwork and production that's required by law.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5534.915s">As</a>  a follow-up question, is this an appointable thing, or do we have to open it up to all staff to apply for this?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5543.295s">It's</a>  appointable because the individual is not part of a unit, and they don't have to be bid within a unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5549.359s">And</a>  that's why we're keeping it close to our office so that Kirsten and I can monitor it very closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5556.403s">Because</a>  obviously, an individual getting a request would have to know what can be asked, what can't be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5561.866s">And</a>  we will also provide training. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5563.247s">We're</a>  also going to run some training programs so that everybody is really on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5569.19s">This</a>  is one of those things where there are fines if we don't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5572.587s">So</a>  we need to, we need to have everything properly set up and we need to have an inventory and an archive for everything we responded to.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5611.086s">So</a>  Madam Mayor and members of the committee, we did get some inquiries from people about why we didn't always let students out, you know, on recess and cold days. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5620.594s">And,</a>  you know, I've tried to provide something that would give us some guidance and I just try to go through it a little bit because I think some people, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5628.48s">think</a>  that there's one universal thing you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5632.164s">You</a>  can't paint this with a broad brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5634.826s">Days</a>  are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5636.127s">It's</a>  not only temperature, it's wind chill, it's ground conditions, it's disabilities on the part of certain youngsters in certain situations that take place, it's timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5648.183s">And</a>  there's so many different factors that come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5651.666s">But</a>  recently, some elementary parents have raised the concern that students were not allowed to have outdoor recess on certain cold weather days. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5659.173s">And</a>  we all recognize that recess, and we've talked about this many times, is an important element of the school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5663.436s">It</a>  provides an opportunity for students to get a break from academics, to burn off excess energy, and get some exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5671.05s">Current</a>  time and learning regulations, as well as curriculum demands of the school, limit the amount of time we can currently allow for recess at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5680.855s">Outdoor</a>  recess is certainly desirable in most instances because it changes the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5686.018s">It</a>  provides fresh air opportunities to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5688.82s">However,</a>  there are significant reasons to keep students indoors when weather conditions are adverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5694.423s">There</a>  is no national standard for keeping students indoors or allowing them to go outdoors for school recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5701.485s">As</a>  a result, site principals must make the decision based upon local conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5706.93s">We</a>  trust our principals to make decisions about the safety of our youngsters in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5712.634s">We</a>  need to trust them to make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5715.477s">We</a>  give them some guidance, but they need to be able to have that discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5719.917s">You</a>  don't want to be making it from distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5722.579s">Temperatures</a>  alone is not sufficient to control decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5726.002s">Wind</a>  chill, rain, ice, snow, other factors have to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5730.946s">Not</a>  all students, and that's true of a lot of students who come to our schools, have sufficient layered clothing to withstand extreme cold and other weather factors, even if we try. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5741.834s">Student</a>  safety is most important consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5744.196s">Decisions</a>  aren't made with a broad brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5746.538s">We</a>  can encourage outdoor recess, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5748.672s">but</a>  ultimate decisions must rest with the building principal at the local school site. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5753.517s">Now</a>  there are a number of things we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5756.661s">We</a>  can advise parents to provide layered clothing, including hats and gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5761.606s">We</a>  can also carry a supply of our own for some youngsters who don't have it, who don't come prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5767.74s">and</a>  that sometimes is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5770.043s">We</a>  can reschedule recess to some degree for a warmer part of the day if possible, maybe a little bit later in the morning rather than earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5777.454s">Difficult</a>  because there's a lot of other factors going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5780.659s">We</a>  can shorten the time spent outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5784.011s">Mix</a>  indoor with outdoor time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5785.472s">Maybe</a>  it's 10 minutes outside, read in the full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5789.215s">And</a>  we can differentiate which students participate either by age or by condition when circumstances allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5796.66s">And</a>  obviously we have to closely monitor certain students who may be more susceptible to cold conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5802.844s">I</a>  will direct principals to keep a log of the days when outdoor recess is not implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5808.408s">And</a>  we'll collect the data and review it this spring to see what patterns emerge. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5813.38s">In</a>  the interim, it's my strong recommendation that principal discretion be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5818.383s">We</a>  trust our principals to make safety decisions regarding students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5822.566s">This</a>  is just one of the many safety decisions that they must make on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5828.549s">And</a>  I provided a chart for you to look at, which we'll provide to them, and they've been provided with some of this material in the past, to look at this stuff to see exactly how to make these decisions maybe a little bit more scientifically.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5844.761s">Millstone,</a>  did you send it to the parents who voiced their concern this letter?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5850.105s">We</a>  will once, you know, we're through tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5852.066s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5852.927s">I</a>  think, you know, I wanted to present it to you and get feedback that you have, but we'll send this out.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5857.891s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5858.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5859.552s">Um,</a>  Mr. Superintendent, does it, does the principal decide whether there's indoor or outdoor recess for the whole building?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5866.817s">Well,</a>  you know, every building has its own culture, but I will now make it imperative upon the teacher to consult with the principal.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5873.82s">So</a>  like I know other school districts might announce whether it's indoor or outdoor recess for the whole school so that way some teachers aren't holding their kids in while other teachers are letting them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5886.724s">So</a>  that's just a suggestion in the protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5890.005s">So</a>  that way it's not like some teachers get cold easily and they might wanna do different activities inside when other teachers are getting out more often because they're just like that and that's what they, <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5903.732s">So</a>  that would be a strong suggestion from me to have a whole school either in or out, an announcement made each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5911.055s">So</a>  that way, you know, well, you know, I want to be careful.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5915.037s">I</a>  mean, sometimes an older child can go out, a younger child may not be able to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5919.219s">Um,</a>  there may be some mitigating circumstances, but the emphasis will be on having the school work as a unit as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5928.157s">and</a>  the principal consult with those teachers who might have a particular reason for not wanting to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5933.598s">I</a>  want to maintain principal discretion, but I also want to encourage them to not prevent outdoor recess just on a cavalier basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5942.601s">But</a>  I do want them to have some discretion because there are individual situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5946.602s">There</a>  may be a class in which some of the youngsters have severe colds or have some colds or just come back from colds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5951.863s">There</a>  may be some youngsters with other considerations on ground cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5955.277s">ice</a>  on the playground or whatever the case may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5957.978s">All</a>  these things need to be thought about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5959.939s">So</a>  we trust our principals to make decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5962.26s">We've</a>  got to give them discretion, but we'll monitor it, log it, and then review to see what the pattern has been.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5968.823s">Just</a>  as a follow-up, can we monitor which classrooms get out and which classrooms don't?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5975.286s">Yes,</a>  and monitor the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5976.646s">Is</a>  that going to be part of it?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5978.047s">And</a>  I wouldn't want teachers just simply to say, I'm not going out because I don't want to go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5982.069s">It's</a>  really got to be a situation where there's a reason <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5985.11s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5985.51s">They're</a>  not doing it generally based on environmental conditions, but there may be a few other human conditions that require a consideration on a given day.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5994.613s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5995.454s">Mr.</a>  Skerry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5997.014s">Superintendent,</a>  I was really glad to see this report and I think it's about time that we issue guidelines across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6004.057s">And</a>  at the same time, I have the utmost faith in my principals and teachers and uh, you know, except there are, there are always a few parents that want to undermine the, the educators role. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6014.817s">And</a>  I would hope that, uh, this gets out and the point is well taken and that there won't be any commotion in the future.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6021.462s">Well,</a>  I think, you know, people have different opinions and I understand that some people are hardier than other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6026.466s">Some</a>  people ski on a regular base and other people have never been on a mountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6029.869s">But</a>  I mean, but, uh, but the reality is, is that, you know, we need to have some sort of balance in a school and we need to respect the right of the principal, uh, to, uh, make a judgment and then we'll monitor it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6041.098s">We'll</a>  monitor it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6042.779s">I'm</a>  a thorough agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6044.747s">Move</a>  the paper Madam Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6046.308s">On</a>  the motion to receive and place on file this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6049.011s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6049.231s">Cuno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6050.072s">I</a>  just want to say just to be careful and pin pigeonhole everybody only because you also have to take in consideration the ages of the students in the classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6058.979s">I</a>  mean, you know, it's a little bit different from a kindergartner than it is a fifth grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6063.263s">So</a>  to, to say the whole school or not, the whole school is a little bit delicate.</p>
