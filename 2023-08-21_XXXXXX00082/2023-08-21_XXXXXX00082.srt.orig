1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.

10
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:53,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

12
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,880
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Aaron Olopade.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the he series, so the he, him, his pronouns.

14
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:02,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running for school committee and I'm really happy to be here, so thank you.

15
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being here, Aaron.

16
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:12,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will also ask you the question that we ask everybody on the show, which is what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

17
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:22,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's tough because I know that this is a question that gets asked and it's always one of those things where I think it changes with the wind just because of my mood or the day of the week or who I'm with.

18
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:29,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a West Medford liver, so tend to find myself down there in the West Medford Square.

19
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Snappy Patty's is a big place for me.

20
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:35,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked there a little bit during the peak COVID year.

21
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:38,598
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I kind of became accustomed to their food and their menu.

22
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:44,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I really enjoy that spot and I tend to choose the chicken schnitzel or the schnitty as we call it there.

23
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,245
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a good piece of food and it's hearty.

24
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,147
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big, so it's pretty filling.

25
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:55,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Tasty on the Hill near Tufts is another big place for me and my family.

26
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to go for the chicken and waffles.

27
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,238
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both a breakfast and lunch kind of thing for me.

28
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,104
[SPEAKER_00]: So both sweet and savory, I would say, is probably where I'm going to when I go out to eat with people.

29
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.

30
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:09,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Tasty on the hill isn't one we've heard before, so thank you.

31
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right, it is sometimes the most challenging question for folks, so thank you.

32
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:14,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have you on again, it might be different.

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

35
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:18,914
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.

36
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just jump in, I guess.

37
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to share, Aaron, a little bit about how you decided to run for school committee and a little bit about the moment that brought you here?

38
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

39
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:29,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for asking.

40
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:33,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that to start, I'm a younger candidate.

41
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:34,157
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 23.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,550
[SPEAKER_00]: But I grew up in Medford.

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of matured, went through the kind of experiences of younger life here in Medford and moved about 10 years ago, 2013.

44
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:47,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in seventh grade here at the Andrews Middle School, then I went to the high school.

45
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really grew up in Medford.

46
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:56,076
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that because of that, it makes me want to see Medford continue evolving into a progressive space for everyone.

47
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,917
[SPEAKER_00]: People coming here to work, to live,

48
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:04,159
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like they have a space to kind of live into themselves a little bit with themselves and their families.

49
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:13,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's partly what really is the root of my motivation running for school committee to to open up that conversation and allow people to feel like they have that safe space.

50
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:32,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think also partly what kind of got got me excited about local politics is like the upbringing to my mom kind of instilled in me and my older brother, you know, she's a practicing minister and a faith leader and for her, you know, being of service to other people really is how faith should be done.

51
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree that my faith really does inform me and how I make decisions.

52
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:56,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that has led me to the school committee and how we as a community, as adults, can give the younger generations the opportunity and the tools that we might not have had to kind of continue improving and progressing our society, but mostly right now our community, of course.

53
00:03:57,587 --> 00:04:07,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've kind of done a variety of things in the city and the greater Boston area in that pursuit, um, of working with younger folks, um, and just working with people in general, again, to really be of service.

54
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:16,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I volunteered a lot in high school at the, at Medford high, you need to graduate with about 60 hours of community service, um, which I think is still very much their practice.

55
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's not a new, uh, method.

56
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,179
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of schools in the area do do that.

57
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, getting 60 hours is,

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:35,524
[SPEAKER_00]: not a tall, tall task, but it does take a little, a little work, you know, through the four years, especially when you're, you know, 14 to 18, you might not know the different, you know, different types of programs and nonprofits in the area, for example, that offer community service hours.

59
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:42,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of had a bit of a bit of a, you know, behind the scenes connection with my mom, who just does a lot of that kind of stuff.

60
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a little easier for me to get those 60 hours, freshman year.

61
00:04:46,188 --> 00:05:00,341
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I found so much joy in getting to know people and helping people in any way that I could or any way that felt right to them that I kind of kept doing that and so when I graduated high school I thought, man, this is really good work and I really find myself wanting to do it more and more.

62
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:07,628
[SPEAKER_00]: was so enamored with service work and community engagement that I took gap year from high school.

63
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:09,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I graduated, I thought, I want to keep doing this.

64
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what this does.

65
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:17,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied and I worked for a non-profit in Boston for a full year, working in a school system.

66
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:18,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a teacher.

67
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,419
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a teacher's aide, teaching kids math.

68
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I was seeing what it's like to be a student in the inner city and what that looks like.

69
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college and same thing.

70
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:31,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was service work, community engagement,

71
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:42,672
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, racial justice really were kind of things that I found myself just being drawn to, um, and- and interacting with people who might not be, um, as, uh, able- as able to advocate for themselves as you might hope.

72
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I thought that I could be an advocate for them, um, in some situations.

73
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:51,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really was kind of the beginning where it was faith-based action and mission drive.

74
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:59,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that finding myself just wanting to understand people's experiences more so that I can then inform myself in what I wanna do, if that makes sense.

75
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

76
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:01,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

77
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:15,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I think that we're looking at both city council and school committee in this election and sort of how much can change in the makeup of that group in terms of identity and, you know, school committees historically like white moms.

78
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that.

79
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:37,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting to think about having a, you know, I think in any kind of like group that's representing a big, you know, a city or like a big interest that it's important to have people that from all different perspectives and you having been recently a student in Medford Public Schools, it seems like a really valuable perspective.

80
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder like, you know, especially like hearing stuff going on last year about some of the sort of incidents of violence in the high school.

81
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wonder like what,

82
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you think are the strengths of Metro Public Schools and maybe what you, if on city council, what you would sort of want to focus on in terms of change?

83
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

84
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:04,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I think first and foremost, like what happened last year is not new.

85
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:09,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it felt like in a really, you know, incredibly scary moment for everyone.

86
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:14,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was no one really knew what to do or where to go or who to look to for answers.

87
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:20,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in some ways we're not trained as adults or as professionals or educators or students to handle things like that.

88
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:24,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to not point the finger.

89
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:35,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to not look for someone's head on a spike because you think to yourself, how can my child or how could my teacher, my educator, whoever it may be, how could they go into school each day and feel safe?

90
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that

91
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:42,989
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in schools, the issues were still there, but they looked a little different, right?

92
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:48,714
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have to be conscious of the fact that we're in a very different world than when I was in high school five years ago.

93
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:54,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, post-COVID is an incredibly different life for all of us, right?

94
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for kids who are really learning themselves for the first time.

95
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,804
[SPEAKER_00]: They're maturing at their own pace, in their own way.

96
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:16,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it's a little harder or greatly harder for younger people to advocate for themselves because they might not have the language, they might not have the ability to, you know, comprehensively discuss what's going on with them.

97
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,967
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not even know what's happening for them quite yet.

98
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:24,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And COVID, I think, exacerbated that fact even more so or put us on notice even more.

99
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:33,332
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have to give students the opportunity to work through these questions they're having about themselves and about their peers recurringly.

100
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:37,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't be a, you know, biannual or a once a month kind of thing.

101
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,555
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a daily conversation.

102
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:48,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we kind of may or may not remember, when we were at that age, we were having those daily questions about who we were, how we identify, who we identify with.

103
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

104
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I remember when I was in high school, there was an incident with a with a gun clip that was found.

105
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:58,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really, you know, 2018.

106
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,657
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really big moment for the city where people were recognizing that safety is not always a given.

107
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:15,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, even in cities where we might have a low crime rate or we feel as though there aren't big incidents like that in the schools or or outwardly right we might not hear about them at the very least.

108
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:25,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety is not a given all the time, unfortunately, as much as we would hope it to be, and so we need to again open up a conversation, not just with our students with ourselves with each other.

109
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:29,228
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can start discussing what safety really looks like for the majority.

110
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:40,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm not disassociated from the fact that whatever I were to do as a school committee member or someone to do in a different position, I can't make everyone happy, unfortunately.

111
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,438
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the reality.

112
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:49,805
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that there is a way to find a form of bipartisan agreement where everyone feels they've been heard at the very least.

113
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That misunderstanding between one another really is, I think,

114
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:56,493
[SPEAKER_00]: a root of a majority of the problems that local municipalities are feeling.

115
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,458
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more agreement to be had.

116
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:07,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's a miscommunication or a disagreement on the way to accomplish a set goal.

117
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:27,086
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all want our kids to be safe, for example, right, we want the younger people, even if you don't have kids, right, we want the younger people in our city to feel safe, like they can go to school, and they're not worried about their safety, whether it's from their peers, from an outside source, and not just physical safety, but emotional safety to intellectual safety, these are real things that we're working through.

118
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, COVID really changed the change the narrative.

119
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:31,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

120
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:37,736
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us know how to navigate this quite yet because none of us have the training, no one's prepared quite, quite, quite yet.

121
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:45,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think acknowledgement that we're in a really, really turning point as a city, right, I think it's the first step.

122
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:48,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, being a high schooler more recently,

123
00:10:49,348 --> 00:11:09,424
[SPEAKER_00]: than some maybe some other people on the you know that have run in the past for example I think does give me a lived experience perspective that others might not have not to suggest or leverage the fact that you know because you weren't in high school more recently that you don't have really really useful advice or suggestions or platform to run on but I think that

124
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,346
[SPEAKER_00]: representation is crucial, right?

125
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:19,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can at least say that I know what it was like to feel unsafe for a period of time in the school system.

126
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily a fault of anyone in particular, right?

127
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:30,323
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's this finger pointing phenomenon that happens all the time when something like this happens, but it's acknowledgement that these issues are not new.

128
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,065
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look a little differently.

129
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when I was in high school,

130
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every year.

131
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was questioning myself questioning how I fit in.

132
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:46,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that came out differently, whether I was not focusing on my grades, I was having, you know, problems, maybe with other peers of mine.

133
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:54,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't respecting teachers, like whatever that whatever way that kind of manifested outwardly, I think comes up and I think with

134
00:11:54,612 --> 00:12:00,634
[SPEAKER_00]: post COVID kind of responses we're having, the kids aren't feeling as safe with themselves and with each other.

135
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:08,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So that comes up a little bit more, um, uh, notably, I guess is probably the best term I would use, you know, given a couple of months ago, right.

136
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:11,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus it's happening behind closed doors or it's happening in the homes.

137
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:17,939
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not hearing about it as much, um, because there was a way to kind of keep a lid on it, you know, if that makes sense.

138
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,080
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I really want to,

139
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I mentioned earlier, open up that conversation.

140
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:33,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give the students first the platform, like a daily platform to discuss what they're working through.

141
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not gonna be an immediate, well, now that I'm saying on Monday, you can tell me how you're feeling that it's gonna fix everything, right?

142
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:50,130
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a working experience because again, we understand that younger folks aren't quite there yet sometimes with their ability to articulate what's going on for them.

143
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,691
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't feel like they have the space to do that, then they're never going to.

144
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, at least, or not honestly.

145
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:05,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to us as adults to, again, give them the tools, give them the system so that they can feel like they can work through it.

146
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:13,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ideally, or hopefully, in the best case scenario, a situation like that happened five years ago or last year doesn't happen again.

147
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:19,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And kids feel safe amongst themselves, amongst their own person, and amongst the city that we're in.

148
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

149
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:30,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I move on, I just wanted to say that when I was introducing that question, the comment that I made about white moms on school committee, I think it sounded like an insult.

150
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean it to be that.

151
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very valuable school committee members who are moms and I think they have really important perspectives.

152
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,990
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, thank you.

153
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a very thorough answer.

154
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So many dope points.

155
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:49,178
[SPEAKER_01]: My mind is whirling, but I think I might pull if you mentioned

156
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,658
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual and emotional safety.

157
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really, really resonates for me.

158
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just for folks listening, I will keep it 100.

159
00:13:56,946 --> 00:14:02,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I am invested in Aaron's intelligence, but my son looks like Aaron, right.

160
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:04,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my boy is a district student.

161
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:12,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would mean the world for my son to be able to look out into his leadership world and see a person who literally represents what he's living.

162
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:28,048
[SPEAKER_01]: To that end, I have had lots of conversation in the district around what violence means and for who and when, but also what pieces might mitigate that and how, as you mentioned, the adults in the community can work collectively to push the needle.

163
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:53,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder if you might talk on what education means for you and what some steps around building intrinsic commitment and creating, like you said, platforms for our kids to invest in themselves, and maybe also sort of get comfortable with trial and error and realize that every adult has tried more than kind of a novice, you know, has been willing to look at, whatever the thing is.

164
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what might your thoughts be?

165
00:14:55,633 --> 00:15:04,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think that, you know, education, um, you know, is, is important, right, of course, and I think that, you know, first and foremost, education looks differently for different people.

166
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:17,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just in the classroom or in the, you know, the, in the, the, how we identify education, like in the textbook, in the classroom, lecturing, right, education, it comes up in different ways in different places in the day.

167
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:28,968
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're a toddler, or a young young child like of course you're you're not going to class really you're learning just from everything you're seeing day to day right and as you get older, then it becomes a little bit more uniform and a little bit more.

168
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:36,933
[SPEAKER_00]: As we understand by the book right so you're learning a lot of the content that you're being taught by your teacher or by your professor if you decide to go to college.

169
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:45,199
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we, in some ways, forget that once you leave school, kind of at whatever level that is, your education doesn't stop, right?

170
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,880
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you learn isn't stopping.

171
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,944
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, it's opening up again because you're not in a controlled space anymore, right?

172
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,346
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more opportunity to learn a lot more.

173
00:15:54,806 --> 00:16:02,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be educated, I think, is like the first, is really how you become a more holistic person.

174
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:07,296
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not just about the four core classes in a language, right?

175
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:17,084
[SPEAKER_00]: There is education and learning that comes from every walk of life, from different cultures, different religions, different perspectives, different sexual identities, different religions.

176
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,366
[SPEAKER_00]: There is learning in all facets of life.

177
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:24,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we, as humans, I think naturally want to learn more.

178
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:25,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And so,

179
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:43,892
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to why I value education, I think that it goes to what I just mentioned, where to be a holistic person, to be a multifaceted person, I think you have to be conscientious of the fact that education doesn't stop once you stop going to, you know, eight to three school.

180
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:44,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

181
00:16:45,814 --> 00:17:01,130
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for some people, as I mentioned, don't want to go to college, or don't feel like that's a need for them they're not they're not that isn't their that isn't their path and that's completely okay, we should, if, for one thing we should be more, you know, supportive of that endeavor because again there are lots of people who find that.

182
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,196
[SPEAKER_00]: post-secondary, you know, higher education, post-secondary education isn't for them.

183
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:09,381
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, those people aren't any lesser or aren't learning still.

184
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,644
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning so much, just in a different way.

185
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:17,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to acknowledge that education comes differently and people learn differently.

186
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:38,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, something that I really am empowered by, something that I really want to start pushing for, if elected, is comprehensive-based learning initiatives, where it really discusses the importance of equipping students at any age the tools necessary to be a productive member of their own life, of their families, of society.

187
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,938
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about if you can check off a box and get a high score on an exam.

188
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,039
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about having the skills necessary to live a fully functioning life

189
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any life you may choose.

190
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:58,390
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, unfortunately, that's not that's not as easy as I'm suggesting it to be that requires a lot of hard work and a lot of as you kind of mentioned your question.

191
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:07,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults participating in the conversation because they're the ones that make those decisions about the type of education, the type of learning we're giving our students in the, in the community.

192
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:29,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can think back, again, when I was in high school or even in middle school, where what I was learning, I don't know if I was even cognizant of the fact that I thought I was missing out, for example, on certain perspectives or certain authors or engineers or people who did really groundbreaking work in different of the four core classes, for example.

193
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,730
[SPEAKER_00]: At that age, you're not really as thoughtful about that.

194
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, on average, you're not as thoughtful about it because you don't know to ask the question quite yet.

195
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:59,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It's until, for me at least, when I was in college where I started recognizing there are so many stories out there about these types of things that I'm focusing on, you know, regardless of its economic, political science, engineering, medicine, law, whatever the thing I was kind of pursuing at that point in school where I was realizing there are so many stories and so many, you know, iconic people in that industry that I had never heard of before.

196
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to myself, well, why is that?

197
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,213
[SPEAKER_00]: They did really groundbreaking work, really life-changing stuff.

198
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:08,797
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's stuff that they change really would have been nice to know earlier on.

199
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:09,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

200
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:23,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, if we as adults are capable of considering changing the curricula, right, you know, it doesn't have to be an insane overhaul right out the gate right there can be, you know, step by step changes.

201
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:24,073
[SPEAKER_00]: right?

202
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:36,879
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start introducing more, you know, of color authors, for example, in English class, we start considering the possibility of opening up a little bit more historical context to different events that happened throughout our American history or, you know, or a broad history, right?

203
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about the types of people that, you know, improve the sciences, right?

204
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,382
[SPEAKER_00]: There's opportunities start slowly.

205
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:47,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be, again, rapid change is good sometimes, but for some people it's a little too quick.

206
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:53,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so we want to again we want to try to include people every walk of life as quickly as much as possible.

207
00:19:53,628 --> 00:20:03,836
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a way to slowly but but progressively start introducing more educational experiences or more learning into the day to day teaching.

208
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:24,793
[SPEAKER_00]: For the students, I think that would really start to give students again that competency based learning right you start giving them more information sooner, so that when they make those decisions about going to college or pursuing a trade or whatever may be post high school, right, they feel like they have a little bit more world experience a little bit more cultural experience.

209
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:35,188
[SPEAKER_00]: just experience is the term really I would say more experience to make decisions for themselves they don't feel as though they're haphazardly deciding things because they feel like they're being told to.

210
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:39,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I again when I was kind of thinking about college or post high school.

211
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my friends, I think, would say, I'm kind of going to college or I'm doing this thing because I don't really know what else to do.

212
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:47,884
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's what my parents want me to do.

213
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:49,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that's what society tells me to do.

214
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:56,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, adults have more experience, right, more often than not.

215
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's not unreasonable to assume that your parents might supposedly know best.

216
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:01,553
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that

217
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:16,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving kids some independence earlier isn't a bad thing, right, but you can only really do that if they have all the facts right or they have more facts, and I think that that comes from introducing more education.

218
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:33,151
[SPEAKER_00]: or different educational styles and educational pieces over time at younger ages, for example, to give kids that slow independence to feel like they know a little bit more about themselves, about their culture, their identity, about the world, to make decisions a little sooner.

219
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:37,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that, you know, a lot of people that I went to college with who graduated with a degree are saying,

220
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:39,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what I'm going to do.

221
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:44,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm 22, 23 years old with a full degree and a lot of debt.

222
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:50,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I pursued this subject matter, and I found myself saying, why did I do this?

223
00:21:50,540 --> 00:22:06,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible, had I had a little bit more experience or had a little bit more independence earlier on, even if that was freshman year, sophomore year of college, or first, second year of a trade, or just a regular 9 to 5 job, would you have been able to make a decision sooner

224
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,347
[SPEAKER_00]: to shift what you were doing.

225
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't feel so stuck where you were.

226
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:17,270
[SPEAKER_00]: But that starts again from education, from learning, from just soaking up what's going on in the world.

227
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,011
[SPEAKER_00]: In a weird way, let's revert back to infancy.

228
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:22,312
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what kids do.

229
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:24,893
[SPEAKER_00]: They take in, they just absorb that information.

230
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:27,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And why can't we keep doing that?

231
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:31,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we give that opportunity and that option to the younger folks?

232
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:31,855
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

233
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:35,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

234
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:40,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm hearing osmosis and zone of proximal distance, but fire discussion.

235
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,469
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Medford doing right?

236
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.

237
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking to my mom about this actually.

238
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:51,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Medford does a lot of things really right.

239
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:52,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's

240
00:22:53,564 --> 00:23:07,069
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of what keeps me keep coming to conversation that keeps me invested I think that keeps a lot of people in the community invested is that there are those changes we're seeing I think that there is a want from a lot of people in the community for change.

241
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:26,836
[SPEAKER_00]: In change at every every level I think we there is a lot of push for like more greenery in the city, more, you know, more city wide events, more, you know, Medford Recreation Department events during the summertime or just during the school year, I think that there's a intentional choice to.

242
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:30,678
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss the question about diversity, equity, inclusion, right?

243
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:35,240
[SPEAKER_00]: What that looks like, what that looks like for different communities in Medford, right?

244
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:46,946
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've had a lot of different nonprofits kind of pop up over the last five, 10 years who are doing really solid work, really intentional work about these questions about inclusion and equity.

245
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the thing that I would say, the blanket statement is that Medford is intentional.

246
00:23:52,329 --> 00:24:13,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people in the city, not just in the city hall, not just in the office, but people in the community that live in West, North, South Medford, in the center, want to see certain things happen for themselves, for their families, for their children, for the next generation to come after them of a progressive mission.

247
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,396
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes up differently, as I mentioned.

248
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,137
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different...

249
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:23,221
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms and issues, not issues, platforms and different types of motivations for different groups.

250
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is intentional work.

251
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard work.

252
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:26,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes time.

253
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've said this a couple of times.

254
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:30,046
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quick fixes.

255
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:33,068
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not knee-jerk responses to fixing an issue.

256
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:37,011
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, for real, comprehensive change.

257
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:38,112
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take time.

258
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:41,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of people in the city want to see those and are willing to take the time.

259
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:45,738
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the temperament and the patience to see that happen.

260
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:59,832
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will also say that in the same side, I think, again, post COVID has really, I think, the burnout is a little bit is seeping through a little bit in some cases where you're seeing the conversation start to die down a little bit, unfortunately.

261
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:04,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it starts to level, you know, I don't say die down, it's the wrong term, it starts to level out a little bit.

262
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:15,519
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I think we're all trying to kind of recuperate from the three-year still ongoing blur of what kind of COVID did for us as individuals and as a community.

263
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:23,341
[SPEAKER_00]: But again that intentionality I think really is what makes Medford special for me as someone who's lived in a couple different places over my life.

264
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:32,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that I'm not a religion from Medford but as a younger person who grew up here that really has kept me wanting to come back here even after graduation is to

265
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:35,885
[SPEAKER_00]: set roots here and call this place my home, so.

266
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:39,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Aaron.

267
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:48,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our next question, so we started this podcast to sort of help provide kind of like a human element to people running for political office.

268
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So this question is less about your campaign, more about you.

269
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if there is something that you might want to share with us that might surprise us, something we might not know about you.

270
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,541
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

271
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:12,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's, it's obvious about my appearance, I would say, but I'm a very organized person.

272
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:18,514
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not really, you know, anything crazy or super cool, but I'm a very space picky guy.

273
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:22,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like, I like, especially my own personal spaces.

274
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:28,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I like things very uniform just because it gives me, you know, a sense of some semblance of control.

275
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:43,575
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, not to suggest I'm a control freak, definitely not that, but I think that with how life kind of comes at us both fast and slow day to day, I think having certain, um, things feel very, uh, controlled, I think really grounds me.

276
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:48,318
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I do, I have a very set structure to my day.

277
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:53,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the same thing every morning and I've been doing it kind of for the last four years of college.

278
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:57,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, you know, I'll get up in the morning, I'll make my bed.

279
00:26:57,606 --> 00:27:06,873
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing I do pretty much just because, you know, there was an army general, I think, who had this really famous graduation speech years ago.

280
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,115
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talked about the importance of making your bed.

281
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:11,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched it probably when I was like 14.

282
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, that's super, that's super on point.

283
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:14,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start making my bed.

284
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:30,028
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make my bed every morning, you know, and the motive or the moral of that general speech, I think, was if you've had the worst day ever, right, nothing went the way you thought it would, you know, you at least accomplished one thing, which was making your bed, right?

285
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:33,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So these little accomplishments really are, they start to stack up.

286
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I think that,

287
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:46,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know that uniformness of things that I have control over does ground me in the type of work that I want to do that isn't as controllable or isn't quick.

288
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, I really like setting things up a certain way.

289
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make my bed every morning.

290
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:54,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I was a collegiate rower.

291
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:55,609
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in, in college.

292
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,831
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I, I wrote crew and I still do that.

293
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:01,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So every morning I will make my bed and then I'll go row.

294
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:02,455
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do that pretty much every day.

295
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:05,218
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can help myself, I'll make my bed no matter what I do.

296
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:05,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I can row.

297
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,319
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get in the morning, I'll go do that.

298
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And that again, sets me up and get the physical activity out of the way.

299
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:15,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It catches me just in a, in a, in a productive mood because I do this really early.

300
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this at about five 30 in the morning.

301
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,354
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had to do that for school and I still do it now.

302
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:28,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's probably something you wouldn't know is like really early and I make my bed and I row and that's what sets me up for the rest of my day.

303
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:31,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing that I don't know.

304
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that you were a rower from your mom's social media, but that's something people might not know.

305
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you also row for Medford High?

306
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:38,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, yeah.

307
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:42,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So Medford High, surprisingly, had a rowing team.

308
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:43,082
[SPEAKER_00]: They still do.

309
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:48,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started freshman year, or I technically started in middle school.

310
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:53,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my brother, uh, went to college and he had a couple of buddies that were on the rowing team at his school.

311
00:28:54,352 --> 00:29:01,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, when we moved to Medford, when we were looking to Medford rec department, trying to find like camp to do, my mom was like, Oh, you would row.

312
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:02,677
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a great thing to do.

313
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:07,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was, you know, in the middle school, I was a smaller, more lengthy, uh, lengthy guy.

314
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't really fit in my brain.

315
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:12,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I also didn't know anything about it, but my brother thought, you know, that's a great physical activity.

316
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,044
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get in great shape.

317
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:14,585
[SPEAKER_00]: You should do that.

318
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, uh, I did it and it was the worst thing ever.

319
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:18,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to do it anymore.

320
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:22,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stuck, I maintained that opinion for like three years.

321
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was like, this is the worst activity.

322
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it.

323
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather do anything else.

324
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't until probably sophomore year of high school where I thought, you know, this is a really cool activity.

325
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:33,714
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool sport.

326
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:40,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think it was more acceptance that I can't do any other sport more than actual want to row.

327
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:44,400
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a, if you can't get out of it, get into it type mentality.

328
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I just was like, you know what, I was able to keep it going.

329
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of good at it.

330
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taller now.

331
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,706
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of works out.

332
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:53,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it through high school.

333
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, all right, I'm not that bad.

334
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kept doing it in college.

335
00:29:56,811 --> 00:30:02,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I was a captain, both high school and college, which was really, you know, I felt really proud of.

336
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:03,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really cool.

337
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, yeah, again, it really does.

338
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:12,786
[SPEAKER_00]: It grounds you because it's a rowing is a very team oriented sport almost entirely team oriented.

339
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:23,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that for me it's informed a lot of the decisions I've made in my life or the mentalities I have going into different opportunities is what I would call them with other people.

340
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:28,837
[SPEAKER_00]: is that teamwork makes the dream work in a bit of a cliche way.

341
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:34,699
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to win a race or you want to be productive in the competitive season, you have to kind of get past yourself.

342
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:49,143
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get out of your own way and acknowledge that there might be a person in the boat with you who's faster than you, speed-wise, or has more technical capacity than you do, or someone who you may feel, though, is a little behind you in those

343
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:56,104
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those, uh, ways of gauging your overall rowing success, you still need to lead them.

344
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:57,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

345
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:03,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, you know, very much like setting up those little perspective changes is how I kind of keep going.

346
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:16,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So waking up really early feels like a thing I don't need to do anymore because like, I'm not in school anymore and I don't have anywhere I need to be at, you know, 8 00 AM for school, but you know, I did it all through high school and it worked out for me and I felt like I was really productive.

347
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,028
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I wake up at five, five 30,

348
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:22,157
[SPEAKER_00]: and I make my bed and I get out on the river and I do that for an hour and a half.

349
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:26,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if it isn't broke, again, another cliche, don't fix it.

350
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,681
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's kind of, that's, that's part of that.

351
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:29,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

352
00:31:30,982 --> 00:31:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little envious, not the five o'clock wake up part, but envious of that routine.

353
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:34,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds lovely.

354
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:36,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

355
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:37,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

356
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:40,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that we like haven't mentioned?

357
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:44,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anything that you want to mention that you're also involved in or any events that you want people to know about?

358
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:56,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think there's a couple things that I would say about myself that I think would be good to kind of give some people some more understanding about me is that, you know, as I mentioned, like I've been doing this for a long time.

359
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first and foremost, I think that at any age, you can be involved.

360
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're too young or too old.

361
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:06,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any age offers.

362
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:12,358
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have the opportunity to be locally engaged, communally engaged, right?

363
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:18,062
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be in politics, it can be in different types of work, different types of non-profit stuff, different types of aid work.

364
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:23,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that you can participate in if there's a want to, slash I think you should.

365
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:30,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's something that I really, you know, goes back to kind of my mom's upbringing that like being of service to other people really is a fulfilling endeavor.

366
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:40,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's from a faith religious perspective like it is for me or from another perspective of just like an ethical ethical moral kind of belief system.

367
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:48,924
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you know, first and foremost, really understand that being of service to people being service to the community really is an enriching experience.

368
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:54,230
[SPEAKER_00]: As an individual really helps you put into perspective, the world around you.

369
00:32:55,511 --> 00:33:04,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And partly for me I kept finding myself in opportunities where that was my, that was how I felt you know I, I was named the youth coordinator.

370
00:33:05,382 --> 00:33:09,424
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Mystic Valley branch of the NAACP, and I still do do that.

371
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:23,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I still act in that role, and I've been doing that for a little over two years now, and so it's my job to reach out to the youth of the Mystic Valley branch, right, not just of Medford, but the surrounding cities, to see how our youth are changing.

372
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:31,817
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned earlier a question about how has Medford shifted a little bit, or do I feel as though what happened last year, is that similar to what I was seeing when I was in high school five years ago,

373
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:43,480
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of questions is the way we were as a youth, you know, 510 1520 years ago however long ago is that in any way different than the kids that are going to schools to this day.

374
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And again it's the answer is yes and no.

375
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yes.

376
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that it's a different world we live in now not just post coded but just in general tech technology advancements medical advancements cultural differences.

377
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:06,477
[SPEAKER_00]: The integration of different different religions like these are all things that are in there's more of this we're seeing in Massachusetts or in America, for example.

378
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:24,979
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, though, there are a lot of the same problems a lot of the same things we're seeing 510 15 years ago that we're still seeing today, a lack of communication, a miss mismanagement of schools, a lack of respect towards one another because we might be different supposedly different again right we might

379
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:47,295
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly, you know, normative, right, whatever, whatever you want to suggest about being someone who might not identify with the supposed status quo causes a misunderstanding of one another that creates discrimination, segregation, racism, bigotry, right, whatever that may be, or a dislike of someone at the most basic level, you know, when you're like in kindergarten, right, because they might not look like you.

380
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:55,642
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I outreach to the youth as an NWCP member and as a youth coordinator, that really is something I run into a lot.

381
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:56,483
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that.

382
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:57,504
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still going on.

383
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:05,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's hard to hear stories from students and from young people about how to navigate that, those issues that they're having, those things that they're working through.

384
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,673
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when they don't know if they have someone to go speak to.

385
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:23,296
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have representation in schools, for example, or in their city council school committee, mayor's office, whatever adult position that they look to for support, and they're not sure who to talk to about it.

386
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I found myself so enamored with working with the young folks.

387
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:34,018
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept wanting to do it more and more, and that's really, again, another thing that led to the school committee decision of mine.

388
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: to run for.

389
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:54,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there's such an opportunity for me as someone who is who is motivated by these things and who wants to work with the youth and want to understand them better and then be able to be an advocate for them to the greater area to really enact that change and again be a service to a cause like you know greater than myself as much as I can.

390
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:57,464
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I so I've done that.

391
00:35:57,544 --> 00:36:01,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I really pursued more engagement in the local Medford community.

392
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,586
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a community liaison

393
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:05,467
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Medford Health Department.

394
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:06,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for over a year.

395
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:15,756
[SPEAKER_00]: The department was given a grant to fund outreach of five liaisons of different cultural communities.

396
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:18,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I was African-American and Black community liaison.

397
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:25,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an Arabic liaison, a Haitian Creole speaking Haitian community liaison.

398
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Different individuals that were Medford residents,

399
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:32,198
[SPEAKER_00]: who wanted to be part of the conversation, right?

400
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:35,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that endeavor, it was the same kind of thing, just for an older demographic.

401
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,822
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these different communities, these different demographics in the city feel about what's going on?

402
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:42,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do they know what's going on?

403
00:36:43,124 --> 00:36:46,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the answer was, no, they don't, for the most part.

404
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:54,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a swooping statement, of course, but I thought a majority of the people that I was running into don't know or don't know where to go to find this information, really.

405
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:56,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, again, a lack of information

406
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or language barrier is a big thing, right?

407
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:01,717
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't speak English as a first language.

408
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:08,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if they are wanting to be involved in the community or have their kids be involved, the language barrier is a big problem, right?

409
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:14,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the speech, the language being used on the websites, for example, is a big, a big blockade for a lot of people, you know, they're like,

410
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,213
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what's going on, but I can't read what's going on.

411
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:24,700
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how to, I don't know who to talk to about it, because there might not be a translator in the City Hall's department, or there might not be someone who understands what I'm trying to say.

412
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:38,994
[SPEAKER_00]: My accent might be a little stronger than they're able to handle, or I might not have the language as someone who's been speaking English as a first language to articulate what I'm trying to understand is going on with like town hall meetings or different community events or whatever it may be.

413
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:39,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So

414
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:50,483
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I've kind of recurrently found myself pursuing different opportunities in the city and the greater area to understand people better first.

415
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:55,547
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand people better, that's really then when you get the opportunity.

416
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:59,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are all opportunities, how I'm mining them in my brain.

417
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,632
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this opportunity to then advocate for people differently.

418
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:14,902
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that didn't happen for me quickly, and it took time for me to kind of be able to acknowledge that that's where I was going with my life, and I wanted to pursue that wholeheartedly for my career, is being of service.

419
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:28,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the school committee offers me that opportunity to be an advocate and a voice for people who, again, who might not have the language quite yet, or feel like they have the platform or the space to do that for themselves yet.

420
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:37,647
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best way I can say that of the things that I've done that I'm still doing, or things that I've done in the past, I think have informed where I'm at right now.

421
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:41,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

422
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:49,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that you have a kickoff event coming, and I would love for folks listening to, you know, everybody bring a person to Aaron's event.

423
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

424
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:53,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I have a kickoff.

425
00:38:54,055 --> 00:39:00,938
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dual kickoff with another fellow new coming school committee candidate.

426
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:07,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name was Erica Reinfeld, and we are both OR, Our Revolution Endorsed Candidates.

427
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:17,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that having a dual kickoff felt like a really great way to get both our names out there even more, to meet each other's bases and just people in the community.

428
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:23,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a two birds, one stone kind of setup, it felt like that was the right thing to do.

429
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:31,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we agree on a lot of different platforms, that OR as a nonprofit kind of push forward for the Medford community.

430
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:36,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are really in this together as progressive candidates.

431
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:38,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on August 28th.

432
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:46,988
[SPEAKER_00]: So about, I think, 17 days from today, it is a... I'm gonna find out before I take a look.

433
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:49,189
[SPEAKER_00]: The 28th is a Monday.

434
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,111
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before school starts.

435
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:55,374
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully all the parents and families will be back right before school starts.

436
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:00,699
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll kind of be back from their last summer hurrah that I think most of us want to go on.

437
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the 28th on Monday from 7 to 9.

438
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:06,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see me.

439
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:07,863
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see Erica.

440
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:20,191
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see, I think, a lot of other candidates, both incumbents and newcomers to the event, where we really want everyone to be able to come and feel like they have a place to hear us talk about our platforms and talk to each other.

441
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:21,772
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a community event.

442
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:22,492
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about us.

443
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:23,573
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about us as a community.

444
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:29,316
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a part of my platform is that it's not joining the Olapoday team.

445
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:30,697
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about joining our team.

446
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:36,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Use me as a person who's going to be there for you.

447
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:45,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to prop me up, but it's a prop up the wants and needs of the city and what they deserve.

448
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Erica would agree that's the same mentality she might be going to.

449
00:40:48,622 --> 00:41:00,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to speak just for her, but I think that we are in agreement that we want people to feel like they have a platform to come talk to us as candidates and in the greater community about what they're experiencing.

450
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,247
[SPEAKER_00]: So be there if you can be.

451
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:07,712
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to have you to come have some food, have some nosh, have some good conversation.

452
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:09,734
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping that it'll be good weather.

453
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:13,498
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still the end of summer, so it won't be too hot, won't be too cold.

454
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,060
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the nighttime, so hopefully we'll kind of skip the sun.

455
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, we'll move inside if the weather doesn't allow us to do that.

456
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:22,466
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be great, and I hope everyone can come.

457
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:23,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you having it?

458
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:33,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 7, so the number 7 Ronale Road in West Medford.

459
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:40,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right near Oak Grove Cemetery, like the entrance of Oak Grove, near the 134 bus stop or the 95.

460
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

461
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.

462
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:44,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

463
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:50,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

464
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:51,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.

465
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:51,847
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.

466
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:52,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I had such a fun time.

467
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:53,269
