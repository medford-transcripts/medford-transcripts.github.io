1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,221
All right, everybody, my name's Lieutenant Canava.

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:21,228
I'm here with Sergeant Covino, Sergeant Rogers, Chief Covino, and Commissioner, sorry, Chief Secretary is Alva Erickson, along with Commissioners, Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner McGiven, Commissioner Silva, and Commissioner Brzezinski is here.

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:34,598
absent and I believe Brenda Pike and Sarah McDermott are here as well from the city and Todd Blake, so we just want to introduce them and introduce everybody here.

4
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:41,162
That will be starting with the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday, the 14th at 5.08 PM.

5
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,464
Roll call, Alba, please.

6
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:46,305
Commissioner McGiven?

7
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:47,846
Here.

8
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:49,427
Commissioner Hunt?

9
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:50,068
Here.

10
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:52,529
Commissioner Silva?

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,510
Yes.

12
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:56,833
Commissioner Brzezinski, absent.

13
00:00:57,654 --> 00:00:58,395
Chief Covino?

14
00:00:58,655 --> 00:00:58,835
Yes.

15
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:06,975
vote with the commissioner present, the roll call has been added.

16
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:16,156
And if somebody would make a motion here to approve September's minutes, they are not on the traffic agenda.

17
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:17,636
That's our apologies.

18
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:23,778
Um, but the minutes were from, uh, September 9th, I believe is the commission minutes.

19
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:28,178
Motion to approve.

20
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,979
Motion approved, seconded by Chief Covino.

21
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,079
Roll call, Alva.

22
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,183
Commissioner McGibbon?

23
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:34,944
Yes.

24
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:36,504
Commissioner Hunt?

25
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:37,084
Yes.

26
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:38,725
Commissioner Silva?

27
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:39,445
Yes.

28
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,066
Chief Covino?

29
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:41,806
Yes.

30
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:47,548
And we're not done with one absent, the minutes have been approved for September 9th.

31
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:57,012
And moving forward, I believe you have some new business that we'd like to- I'd like to, Chief, may I take an item out of order?

32
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:58,933
Sure, yes.

33
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:11,513
Could we take item 2025-65 proposed on street EV charging stations from Brenda Pike so that Brenda can then have the rest of her evening back?

34
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:14,175
Absolutely.

35
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,016
Thank you.

36
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:16,957
Okay.

37
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:21,841
Motion and seconded by... I'll second.

38
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,322
Seconded by Chief Covino.

39
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:24,203
Roll call, Alba.

40
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:25,564
Commissioner McGibbon?

41
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:26,705
Yes.

42
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,270
Commissioner Hunt?

43
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,151
Yes.

44
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:30,752
Commissioner Silva?

45
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:31,433
Yes.

46
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:32,955
Chief Covino?

47
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:33,495
Yes.

48
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,922
And the motion passed for what happened to move, is it 20-65?

49
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:40,002
20-65.

50
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,284
To the first item for new business.

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,767
So Commissioner Hunt, are you speaking on it or?

52
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,549
I know Brenda Pike from my office is here.

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,192
She's been managing all the electric vehicle charging stations and she'll be speaking to this item.

54
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:03,276
I made Brenda, I made you a call so you can kind of share whatever you need and uh, whatever else you have.

55
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:04,877
Wonderful.

56
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:09,680
So I'm just sharing the map of the location that we'll be talking about here.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,241
Let me know if you can see that.

58
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:12,862
Great.

59
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:19,286
Um, so at the last traffic commission meeting, there was some negative feedback at the, um,

60
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:26,954
Cummings Park and Capon Park locations that we'd proposed for the on-street electric vehicle charging stations.

61
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:36,261
So Todd and I went back to the consultants that we were working with and looked at a few other possibilities for locations.

62
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:44,387
And what seemed like the best option was this location near 200 Boston Ave.

63
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:55,894
And so we're taking the 2 charging stations that would have been at those 2 separate locations and having 2 chart to charging stations at this 1 location instead.

64
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:03,660
So they would be between the crosswalk to the start at the driveway here.

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,786
And I can actually actually, let me share another screen.

66
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,708
So you can see the actual locations of the charging stations.

67
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,571
Um, in between the trees there.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:41,057
Okay, so this shows, um, the 2 charging stations that are an orange here, um, in between the, the trees that are in green.

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:59,529
And then it shows the locations of the existing telephone poles in blue, and then the electrical cabinet that would go next to one of those telephone poles across the driveway from the location of the charging stations.

70
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:10,314
So it would be four parking spaces here with these two charging stations.

71
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,100
So these are kind of this close.

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:30,528
So the idea of this grant, again, is to serve neighborhoods where people don't necessarily have their own driveways or access to driveways to neighborhoods that are lower income.

73
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,894
Or that have smaller multifamily buildings where people are more likely to be having to park on the street.

74
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:39,675
Great.

75
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:47,288
And so this is an area that's directly in front of a parking garage that is privately owned for a private building.

76
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:53,430
And do you know if they were able to do some outreach on this?

77
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,571
Did you put out some flyers at this location?

78
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:57,472
Yes.

79
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:06,054
So we posted signs at the locations where the actual chargers would be and then distributed flyers

80
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:20,277
nearby butters, not direct to butters necessarily, but to everyone who is along those couple of blocks there on that street.

81
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:25,262
And then a robocall went out to the larger neighborhood.

82
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:32,789
What are the green diamonds in the diagram?

83
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:45,560
Those are the trees that are there, so part of what we're looking at here was just trying to make sure that we were positioning the charging stations in such a way that it wouldn't damage the roots of the trees.

84
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:52,962
And did you guys do some measurement out in the field as far as where these things actually will sit?

85
00:06:55,455 --> 00:07:05,024
In terms of one of the things that we were looking at was making sure that there would be enough room on the sidewalk that it would be a compliant.

86
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,547
Clearances all out of those yellow things bollards.

87
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:15,154
There's they're not intended to be bollards at that location is my understanding because of the curve.

88
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:16,836
Yeah, where are those yellow dots?

89
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,723
Charging stations.

90
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,524
Oh, you mean the 2 yellow dots next to each.

91
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:32,469
Yeah, well, next to each 1 that just might be a holdover from another proposal that they had put together that had.

92
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,571
Bollards there, but we're not intending to have bollards.

93
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,372
There's my understanding because the curb.

94
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:44,256
Access that for this and I know you.

95
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,857
Sent this over to engineering for review.

96
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:47,898
Did those guys get back to you?

97
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:53,635
Yes, and what you're seeing here is an edited version of this that reflects.

98
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:58,237
Owens feedback on the project.

99
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,498
And then there's enough clearance.

100
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:10,922
I'm presuming there's enough clearance for the crosswalk there that your 4th space, the end of your space bank.

101
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:14,623
Oh, yes, definitely.

102
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:22,005
I don't think there's there's room there for five parking spaces, but there's definitely more than more than enough room for four.

103
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,306
Is the picture showing just three?

104
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,106
No, it's four cars.

105
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,367
See the existing photo in the background is that three cars?

106
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,708
I think that is three cars right now.

107
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,409
But it's four spaces, basically.

108
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,189
Yeah.

109
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,430
And I can share Google Maps again, because that might be

110
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,743
Clear way to look at it.

111
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:55,267
Yeah.

112
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:05,391
So, the charger would be 1 of the charges would be directly in the middle between these 2 trees.

113
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:11,734
And then the other 1 would be on the other side of this tree.

114
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:13,235
Okay.

115
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,694
Plenty of sidewalk there and you're in the furniture zone.

116
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,317
Underground, you're good with the conduits.

117
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,538
I don't know what's in the street there.

118
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,580
But there's usually a lot of utilities.

119
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:26,722
Yes, yep.

120
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:30,425
And that was part of the feedback that Owen had about it.

121
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,146
Yep.

122
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,152
Sounds good.

123
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,093
Those are my questions.

124
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:41,334
Thanks, Brenda.

125
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,046
Randy, can I ask a question?

126
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:52,011
You said that robo call did it go out to Harris Road, Stoughton, that area?

127
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,095
Was it in the whole Cape and Park area?

128
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,416
Just curious.

129
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:02,803
Oh, I don't know the exact sort of the exact streets that it went to.

130
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:07,988
Let me see if it's in the email where they confirmed it.

131
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:25,390
The only reason why I ask is there are a lot of folks who live on Boston Avenue that are not capable of having resident parking on the side streets.

132
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,011
And as you know, Boston Avenue is a street sweeping street.

133
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:34,472
So I was just curious if that had gone out to that particular location.

134
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:42,733
I don't have the information for exactly what streets were included in the robocall.

135
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:52,369
I just know it was a larger area than what I had flyered, which was really just on Boston Ave here.

136
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:59,994
So I flyered this stretch of Boston Ave from North Street to, what is the side street?

137
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,035
Irvington Road.

138
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,036
Some of the line.

139
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:04,117
Yep.

140
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:04,917
Yep.

141
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:05,878
Thank you.

142
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:12,642
And if I may, as a reminder, this is the,

143
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:23,659
Alternate or compromise location as opposed to the previous 2 locations in the previous meeting closer to keep in park and.

144
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,721
The other park, right?

145
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:26,002
Brenda.

146
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:30,222
Yes, and this is partway between the 2 locations.

147
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:36,948
If you're since you're in Google maps, can you just zoom out a little bit so that those of us on the call and then you can just point down there.

148
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,190
There's Cape and park just came on the screen.

149
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,492
And there's Cummings up above.

150
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,073
So this is kind of in between the 2.

151
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:52,062
It makes sense to me as a location.

152
00:11:54,865 --> 00:12:04,149
Because it definitely doesn't interfere with the business there because anybody who's there for the Cummings properties is going to be parking in their parking garage or their surface parking.

153
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,370
There would never be a reason for them to be using the street.

154
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:15,173
I think we've observed that this area, I mean, I've been in that area a bunch and street parking is lightly used.

155
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:19,795
It sounds like, Todd, were you saying that on street sweeping days people park

156
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:28,543
Isn't it that when Boston Ave gets street sweeping, then people from Boston can park on the permit roads on the sides for that one night?

157
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:32,987
Or maybe it was Jim that knew that.

158
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,329
It's just one side at a time.

159
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,530
It's just one side at a time.

160
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,672
So, yeah, it was Larry.

161
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:40,392
Yep.

162
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,173
Yes.

163
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,835
Park on one side of the street on one night and another side.

164
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:51,775
On the other side, you might be thinking of, you might be thinking of snow emergencies and there's a snow emergency.

165
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,456
They can park on the permit streets.

166
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,659
Yeah, so I have a question.

167
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,124
In a case go in the future, if it becomes an issue for overnight type street sweeping.

168
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:12,001
can we allow the residents to park there for the overnight situation only and block those spots where they're less likely to be abused?

169
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,842
There's only a two hour limit for the use of those, right?

170
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:28,705
So in the future, if it becomes an issue for us, would we be able to allow, we put a restriction there so on those certain nights residents can park there and block those four spots if needed.

171
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,364
Yeah, that would that would be an option there.

172
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:43,169
Um, the, the requirements of the grant that we have for this, um, they're, they just require that the spaces be reserved for electric vehicles for 12 hours a day.

173
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,771
So, if it does become an issue, we have some flexibility.

174
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:53,734
Okay, well, they're already be restricted for street sweeping for whatever night boss and not get swept.

175
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:58,774
So, that restriction exists and then it's a snow route to so.

176
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:05,538
Anyway, to what it's worth, I just figured those would automatically still be in play.

177
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,542
Yeah, and I'm in favor of this location.

178
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,584
I. At the benefit of a preview of it, so.

179
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:27,145
Yeah, I think we should see if there's any public comments because there was a lot of public comment on the last one.

180
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:34,673
I mean, I could motion to approve pending public comment, but I'd rather and actually, I think it would be better if somebody else motions because it's from my office.

181
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:35,534
Yeah.

182
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,014
Okay.

183
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:37,276
Okay.

184
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,558
Well, if the commissioners are all.

185
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:56,010
So with any questions, if there's anybody in the public that would like to speak against this, if you could raise your hand and or type in the chat, if you're not allowed to raise, or if you're not able to raise your hand, please do so now.

186
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:57,531
And we can kind of.

187
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:14,945
Seeing none in the public with their hand raised, or I can't see the chat right now, so let me just.

188
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,165
There's nothing in the chat.

189
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,586
Okay, we got 1 hand.

190
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:18,987
Sorry.

191
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:29,751
If there's no, if there's no public feedback, then I make a motion.

192
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,331
There's somebody raised there.

193
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,452
You have somebody right now that has their hand raised Nina.

194
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,472
We're just going to ask you to unmute.

195
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:38,898
obviously you're spot on, so.

196
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,925
Just ask you to unmute and then you're free to speak.

197
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,645
Okay, can you hear me?

198
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,468
Oh, I thought we were motioned in favor.

199
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,190
I misunderstood.

200
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:51,752
What's that, sorry?

201
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:56,643
I thought this was raising hands in favor.

202
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,884
We're going to get to the in favor or just against right now.

203
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,765
So we're more than happy to see if there was anybody against.

204
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:06,106
So we're going to have you speak on behalf of it.

205
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,466
These are the motions in favor.

206
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:09,107
So speak now.

207
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,168
You have to re-unmute her again.

208
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:16,189
Sorry, usually we just take public comment.

209
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,289
We don't take comments for and against.

210
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,530
We just take public comment.

211
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,250
Yeah.

212
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:24,965
Sorry, I have no comment.

213
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,445
I misunderstood.

214
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:27,546
Okay.

215
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,386
That was my fault.

216
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:28,686
Sorry.

217
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,308
Okay.

218
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,109
I make a motion to approve.

219
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,511
Second.

220
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:38,831
I second.

221
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,552
Seconded by Chief Camino.

222
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,332
Roll call.

223
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:44,114
Commissioner McGiven?

224
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:44,974
Yes.

225
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:47,675
Commissioner Hunt?

226
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:48,376
Yes.

227
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:52,138
Commissioner Silva?

228
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:52,718
Yes.

229
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:55,457
Chief Kavina.

230
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:56,037
Yes.

231
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:01,779
For a pass with a four vote yes and then one is absent.

232
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,780
The motion has been approved.

233
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,281
Moving on to.

234
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:14,283
Back to the 275-70 permit parking variant.

235
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,105
Melissa Bowden 201 Riverside Ave.

236
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,625
I believe it's on here.

237
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,446
I'm just going to ask you on mute and then

238
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:34,512
We can have you speak on the parking there.

239
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:37,274
Hi, I'm actually on here with my landlord.

240
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:47,820
I think she's gonna start it off explaining the situation and then I can kind of add on and show the Google Maps and what it looks like and everything to explain further.

241
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,481
So we can pull up Google Maps for you here.

242
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,683
So that way, I'm not sure if you're able to share.

243
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,726
I should be able to.

244
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:02,831
Oh, she just told me she can't unmute, so I can explain this.

245
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,812
I can have her unmute.

246
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,633
What's her name under?

247
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:09,315
Jing, J-I-N-G.

248
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,677
She should be on the call.

249
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, I think she's unmuted.

250
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,761
Okay, I'm here.

251
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,402
Can you hear me?

252
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,587
Yes, good evening.

253
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:21,887
Okay.

254
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:35,270
Yeah, so I think Melissa can share or maybe you guys can help share the screen where so the property address that we're discussing today is 201 Riverside Avenue.

255
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,391
As you all know, Riverside is a public street, right?

256
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:45,212
So we cannot like that street is just like two sides of traffic and we cannot.

257
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,173
park any car there.

258
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:54,637
And I have this property where I rented out two units and we have six tenants living there.

259
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:03,022
The parking that we have on the house is not big enough to accommodate six cars.

260
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:09,406
So we do have tenants like Melissa and she has to deal with the parking herself.

261
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:10,186
And

262
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:20,852
In the past, you know, we're able to park in the ship Avenue, which is like one street behind this, and she never had any issue.

263
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:31,897
But this this year, starting from the summer, she start getting like parking ticket because ship Avenue is permit enforced and.

264
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:45,090
So after that, you know, like she has been really struggling on finding the parking space and we have got in touch with the parking office and traffic commissioner book times.

265
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:50,936
They recommend us to look into the marine street, which is the street that intersect with.

266
00:19:51,577 --> 00:20:11,642
the riverside but marine street only have four parking space so often of a time you know like it's occupied so it's very hard to find like any additional parking and then there's also instance where melissa park her car there and then she got a parking ticket even though the space is not permit enforced

267
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:17,900
So we are kind of stuck here where it's really hard to find any parking stop nearby.

268
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:30,925
And what we are asking is just like to for us to be able to apply for a variance parking permit in the ship Avenue, because that's the one that's closest to the house.

269
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:35,966
And it's very, there's like a lot of parking space on that street.

270
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,127
I don't think Melissa will be.

271
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,109
you know, have hard time finding any space there.

272
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,590
Um, so that's basically, you know, what we are asking.

273
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,872
And I will let Melissa to add any additional details.

274
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,273
Okay, thank you, Melissa.

275
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,534
Just I'm not sure I'm mute.

276
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,775
Is this blue house to a one for you?

277
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,616
Um, yes, that blue one on the left right there.

278
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:59,818
I just it's to the commissioners.

279
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,879
If I go any further for, uh, up Riverside Ave.

280
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:03,840
It doesn't represent the

281
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:12,534
If you want to look at the satellite view of the whole street up above, that might be a little easier, not the street view.

282
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,156
Okay, yeah, we'll do the satellite view.

283
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:16,097
Okay.

284
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:20,520
Because then you can also see Marine Street and Ship Ave, what we're talking about.

285
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,421
Yep.

286
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,983
So yeah, if you zoom in a little bit.

287
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,589
Yes, so yeah, that's where I live at 201.

288
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:31,790
Like Jing said,

289
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:36,201
parking the driveway we have doesn't accommodate six cars.

290
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:37,761
There's six residents.

291
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:43,224
So since I moved here in 2023, I've been parking on Ship Ave, that street right behind it.

292
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:55,089
And I had no issues whatsoever until recently I started getting ticketed, even though where I was parking had no signs up saying I couldn't park there on Ship Ave, that street right behind.

293
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,371
So I started getting tickets and it was really frustrating trying to find

294
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:04,387
any additional side roads to park on.

295
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:08,429
There is that little short street Marine Street right off of Riverside on that left side.

296
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:14,573
But the only public spots are those first four right at the beginning of Riverside and Marine.

297
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,254
You can't park further down on that street.

298
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:22,077
So that's like my only option right now is those if there's those four spots available.

299
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:31,403
So yeah, I'm requesting a variance permit for ship app because that street has a lot of available

300
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:32,902
spots on the street.

301
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:39,323
I've noticed that the actual residents of Ship Ave have their own driveways, or they tend to park on the left side.

302
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,344
So it's a very long street.

303
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,164
It's a one-way street.

304
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,124
Also, there's condos further down on Ship Ave.

305
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,865
They have a huge parking lot for them and visitor parking.

306
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:53,866
So I don't think that I would be taking any spot from an actual resident of Ship Ave by parking there.

307
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:57,706
And it would solve my very frustrating problem.

308
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:01,467
And I would very much appreciate a permit.

309
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:13,339
Chief, if I could just comment, and Alva can ship out, obviously, as permanent parking, but there are no signs from the boat club or yacht club after.

310
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,541
Alva is working on it to have more signs put up.

311
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,561
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:24,224
Yeah, because I was getting tickets when there were no signs there, and that was frustrating, but yeah.

313
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:34,058
Sorry, you are a co-host, so you can believe on yourself.

314
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
You're all set, Sarah?

315
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,120
Yeah.

316
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,141
Actually, there are more signs on Ship Ave now.

317
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:51,023
Joe and his crew put them up recently after a couple of requests from the condo people.

318
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,484
Yeah, so just know the entirety of Ship Ave is now signed.

319
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:56,324
That's all.

320
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,105
Thank you.

321
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:05,580
So actually, um, since we have Sarah, um, I just wanted to clarify.

322
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,841
So she's looking at ship out because that's on her side of the street, I assume.

323
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:14,083
And she doesn't have to cross Riverside to get there.

324
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:19,405
Um, but I actually didn't realize there was any permit parking in this area.

325
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:27,488
And so maybe we should understand, um, about the parking across the street on park street and Thatcher and, um,

326
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:36,167
Whether what would be the problem with just parking over there where it's allowed, although I do recognize you have to cross.

327
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:41,549
Yeah, yeah, so I'd have to cross the road and also I work late at night.

328
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,690
I don't want to be walking in the dark alone across the street.

329
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,351
Also, those streets tend to be pretty busy from what I've.

330
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:56,013
Observed and ship have there is literally like, never any cars really parked on that actual street.

331
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:08,223
Yeah, I have tried to, you know, park in the sorry, I forgot the name of the street, but the street that you're talking about, I've only been there a couple of times in the evening, it's very busy.

332
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:14,385
So I have to definitely walk sometimes, like few blocks to find a parking space.

333
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:22,287
And I think it is like, you know, for safety reasons, unsafe during late night, and then in the winter, if there's like, snow,

334
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:35,074
I can agree that it may be at night crossing Riverside might not feel safe.

335
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,436
I will tell you that Medford is very safe.

336
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,717
And so you shouldn't be worried about personal safety.

337
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:43,439
Although I make no promises around the cars.

338
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,540
Yeah.

339
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:55,505
But yeah, like I said, ship out, I've never observed it being really busy.

340
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,406
I've never seen it completely full.

341
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:00,989
I don't believe I would be taking any spots from an actual resident.

342
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,770
Like I said, the condos, they have a huge parking lot.

343
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,410
They also have the visitor parking across the street on Ship Ave.

344
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,312
The actual residents, which I've spoke to and they know me by name, they all park on the left side of that street.

345
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:20,393
I would just be taking out one tiny little spot and it would really help me and I would appreciate it.

346
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,014
And it's something you're already doing.

347
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:32,053
It's something I've been doing since, um, up until from December 1st, 2023 until about a month or two ago when I started getting ticketed.

348
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:36,276
And then now, as Sarah said, there's signs up saying that it's all permit parking.

349
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:48,344
So I haven't, I've been trying my luck with Marine street and hoping that I can keep a spot in those four little spots that are available, but, um, it's very frustrating.

350
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:58,957
Uh, public comments, public comments.

351
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:05,727
Oh, um.

352
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:10,634
Sarah.

353
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:23,207
Yeah, so just, I mean, acting as a member of the public who is not on the commission, but it gets, I get frequent emails from residents on ship Avenue about vehicles parking on their street that are not residents.

354
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:29,408
I've gotten C, click fixes more than a couple of times a week in the last 2 months.

355
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,028
I would say.

356
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,849
About this vehicle and that vehicle also just.

357
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,390
I just think we need to use some caution considering that.

358
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:52,319
Unit 201 is 1 of 1 to at least 10, 15 residences between Maverick street and Marine street that all might face similar circumstances.

359
00:27:52,939 --> 00:28:02,403
And if we let 1 person on to ship out, who's to say that we won't get requests from all the other cars that park on ship Avenue that they then complain to me about.

360
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:10,029
I know it's just 1 car now, but there are multiple cars that I get complaints about.

361
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,794
And a lot of them just looking at their citations when they're tied in a lot of them are residents of Riverside Avenue.

362
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,335
So that's my 2 cents.

363
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:24,639
I mean, I know you guys on the commission take that into consideration, setting a precedent for the future.

364
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,765
But I just wanted to say that I do get frequent complaints from ship Avenue residents about vehicles parking there that do not live on ship Avenue.

365
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:41,219
Yeah, we understand, but I think to Melissa's point, Sheff Avenue is never like very busy, right?

366
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,201
Yeah, it's never full at all.

367
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,203
There's so many, so many, so many spaces.

368
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:49,124
It's a long road.

369
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,125
I've never seen it completely full.

370
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:55,527
And again, I've never had any issues until recently.

371
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,850
And I just think it would make sense.

372
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:20,686
So when we were doing all the public meetings for the Clipper Ship Connector, which I assume everybody on the commission is aware goes right through there along Ship Ave and along the river, one of the big concerns that the neighbors had was that people would come and park there in order to access the park and the path.

373
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:30,129
That may have been why, I don't remember when permit parking was put in there, but that was one of their big concerns was that

374
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:36,438
people would crowd the street, they'd never be able to find their own parking, because people would come to use the path.

375
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:41,299
Maybe that's why it's getting enforced now.

376
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,202
Yeah, I could understand thinking that, but I've never seen it busy at all.

377
00:29:50,462 --> 00:29:58,065
And yeah, I would just really appreciate a permit

378
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:04,369
Yeah, either Todd, Sarah, or police units.

379
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,850
What do you guys see for capacity on Ship Avenue?

380
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,132
I mean, I'm being told by Ms.

381
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:13,193
Bowden that there's plenty of room.

382
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:17,636
Does that match your experience or is it something different?

383
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:19,937
I'm not that familiar with the street.

384
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:23,739
If you want to go on the Google Maps too and go on the actual Ship Avenue, maybe you can

385
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,495
I can give you a heads up.

386
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,117
I want to hear the other folks' experiences.

387
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:49,355
I've been there recently to check on the signs and such, and it does usually have quite a few spaces available on Ship Ave, but I'll tell you, I have a friend who lives at 25 Park Street, and I'm there usually on Tuesdays when I'm not here, because we go for a walk on the Clippership Connector, and it also frequently has more than adequate street parking.

388
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:50,994
on Park Street.

389
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:55,036
So that's my anecdotal experience from those two streets.

390
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:57,078
So not just Shabab.

391
00:30:57,118 --> 00:31:04,923
Shabab has adequate parking because they have permits required and we've been enforcing because the residents request it quite frequently.

392
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:09,907
And Park Street, I park there myself.

393
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:15,511
I've never had trouble finding a space from 25 Park Street down to Riverside.

394
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:19,594
And that's 4.30 in the afternoon.

395
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:20,999
That I'm going over there.

396
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,502
Yeah, I think we're talking about late evening.

397
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:27,785
So the experience could be a little bit different here.

398
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:29,066
Um.

399
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:41,536
Yeah, even though, like, you can grant us something, say, this permit is only working in after, like, say, I don't know what time 1, at least to get back home.

400
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:43,238
I think that will be really appreciated.

401
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,490
or even like Jordan Larry, what about you guys?

402
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,431
Any of your officers?

403
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,672
What do you guys experience?

404
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,414
So Sergeant Kavino.

405
00:31:53,454 --> 00:32:02,561
So to Sarah's point, there are a lot of people or a handful of people who don't have permits that have been parking on ship and we have been enforcing that.

406
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:08,226
But there's also seems to be abundant parking on ship.

407
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:13,550
If you go down there any time of night or during the day, there's there's plenty of street parking.

408
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,152
Also, to Sarah's point,

409
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:22,335
Park Street and the streets on the other side of Riverside Ave that aren't permanent parking do have abundant parking as well.

410
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:22,756
So.

411
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:23,156
All right.

412
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:24,997
So there's lots of parking available around here.

413
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,902
And there's other, granted, there are people who live in those other apartments for sure.

414
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:31,903
I get that.

415
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,586
I don't know the answer to the question, and I doubt anybody does.

416
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:36,787
Is there room for all of them?

417
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:37,728
I'm not sure.

418
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:43,712
I feel like we try not to set precedents, but at the same time, we're not bound to any precedent that we set.

419
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:48,333
So anyway.

420
00:32:48,373 --> 00:33:03,963
Maybe we could do a count on the different times of day and night, how many cars we see down there, how many vacant spots we see, and then we could accommodate a certain number of additional resident parking.

421
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:09,606
So it's not everybody on Riverside Ave suddenly decide, oh, I'm going to go park.

422
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,429
I'm going to get a variance and park on ship Ave.

423
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:17,468
And I think what's most relevant is actually the nighttime.

424
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:24,454
Like, that is actually the most relevant, because it is true that a lot of people take their cars and leave during the day.

425
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, and like I said, I get back from work super late, sometimes at like 2-3am.

426
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,603
And everyone's parked in a spot.

427
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,966
So I, it's a struggle.

428
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:41,148
And especially with winter coming, it's gonna get dark way earlier.

429
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:41,609
And

430
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:49,163
As a female, I don't want to be walking any super long distance alone at night just to get back to my house.

431
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:56,350
I'd rather stick to where I've been familiar with and this would just really, really help me.

432
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,052
Yeah, we heard you.

433
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,053
Todd, what do you have to say?

434
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:04,354
I don't want to ruin the moment.

435
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:04,974
Yeah.

436
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:08,136
Anecdotally, in the daytime, I agree with Space.

437
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,257
I couldn't say for sure at nighttime.

438
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:15,559
One thing I wanted to comment on, because we've talked about precedent, is consistency.

439
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:18,540
I'm not arguing for or against them.

440
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,881
I'm just bringing something up that I've noticed at other meetings.

441
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:28,450
This commission has approved similar situations on Winthrop Street, a street that doesn't have any on-street parking.

442
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:41,777
And then I think last month, this commission may have approved a variance for someone on Main Street, near Summerville, from the major, and that street does have on-street parking.

443
00:34:41,817 --> 00:34:46,920
So I would say Riverside's pretty similar to the Winthrop Street section with no parking on either side.

444
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:54,596
So whatever has been consistent in the past, that's what I would just throw that out there to remind folks.

445
00:34:55,497 --> 00:35:02,960
The other thing that's sort of relevant about the Winthrop Street one is that we made a big deal about wanting them to be parking on the same side they were living on.

446
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,903
But the big difference there was that there was no crosswalk for quite a distance.

447
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:16,180
between that home and where they would have, we would be basically condoning them jaywalking.

448
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:33,815
There is in fact a real crosswalk at this location, but we did express a preference for having people to park on the side street on the same side as their home so that we weren't pushing more people to be crossing the very busy roads, particularly in the middle of the night.

449
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,658
Do we have a motion from the commissioners?

450
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:39,657
Yeah, I'm motion to approve.

451
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:41,638
Great, second.

452
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:44,200
Thank you, Ms.

453
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,460
Bowdoin.

454
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,141
I have a roll call.

455
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,562
Commissioner McGibbon?

456
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:48,222
Yes.

457
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:49,623
Commissioner Hunt?

458
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:50,304
Yes.

459
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,085
Commissioner Silva?

460
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:53,006
Yes.

461
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,207
Chief Covino?

462
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:55,888
Yes.

463
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:55,928
4-0.

464
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:04,573
When absent, the motion passes.

465
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:09,296
And Melissa, it looks like your landlord is not on the call anymore.

466
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:23,043
Can you just make sure that she's aware that this kind of permit is for you, it's not for everybody in your building, and if she rents to somebody else, they would have to come back for it?

467
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:24,503
That's okay, yeah.

468
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:26,184
Thank you so much, by the way, everyone.

469
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,205
I really appreciate it.

470
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:30,687
Does that go into effect immediately so I can

471
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,803
Well, yeah, you can, you can come by the permit.

472
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:39,506
Okay, as soon as we're open tomorrow, I'm going to put you on the variance list.

473
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:45,812
So, if you stop by as early as tomorrow, 830, you can buy the past from my office and you'll be good to go.

474
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:46,652
Okay.

475
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,513
Thank you so much.

476
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:47,874
Everyone.

477
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:48,754
I appreciate it.

478
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:54,219
Okay, moving on 2025 7, 1, permit parking variance Nina.

479
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:00,657
Barcomani, 292 Boston Ave.

480
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:03,459
Is your petitioner here?

481
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,600
Hello.

482
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,561
Yes, I'm here.

483
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:13,426
So yes, I am requesting a similar variance to the previous Ms.

484
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:13,806
Bowden.

485
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:18,490
I live on 292 Boston Ave.

486
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,131
I did not check the Google Maps.

487
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:25,754
I didn't think to do that, but I am situated between

488
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:34,496
Is it Winthrop and Piggott, and I am requesting a variance to park, ideally on Piggott.

489
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:41,342
I live on the right side of, or on the even side of the street for street sweeping.

490
00:37:42,162 --> 00:38:03,262
And I've found since moving here in August that during street sweeping, specifically Monday and Tuesday, there isn't consistently enough room to park on the opposite side of the street for street sweeping, which has led me to need to park either in a parking lot further down the street, about a 10-minute walk, or to park

491
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,287
much further down the street in order to secure parking.

492
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:14,193
I also have a similar work situation where I'm leaving my house at about 5 a.m.

493
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:18,757
when it's very dark and arriving again at about 7 or 8 p.m.

494
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:19,758
depending on the day.

495
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:28,708
So I, yeah, often when I arrive home there isn't parking available anywhere near my house.

496
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:42,659
And I'm okay with walking, but I think more than anything, what I would like is to just know that I will have a consistent place to park that's, you know, ideally within a 10 minute walk would be nice.

497
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:51,184
It wouldn't have to be, I guess if I'm requesting a variance, it would just be a permit variance that isn't specific to time.

498
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:55,047
But the biggest issue is on street sweeping days, either Monday or Tuesday.

499
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,737
Anna, do you have a particular street you'd like to park on?

500
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:01,858
Piggott.

501
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:03,058
Piggott?

502
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:03,879
Piggott Road.

503
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:07,221
Okay, open that up to commissioners' comments.

504
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,245
What are you looking like for capacity on that road?

505
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:26,095
The residents on the left side there typically have one or two cars, and occasionally there are a few student vehicles there, but there's always at least one or two spots on the right side.

506
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:29,941
before the dog leg.

507
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,323
I could also park further down, too.

508
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,524
That would be completely fine.

509
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:34,445
Yeah.

510
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:35,986
Thanks, Nina.

511
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,226
I should have been more specific.

512
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:43,531
I'm mostly speaking to my colleagues when I ask the question and staff as well.

513
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:53,858
As long as there's parking on both sides of Pickett Road, it looks like there should be adequate parking.

514
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:58,933
stretch with the trees there where there are no houses.

515
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:01,955
Yeah.

516
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:04,736
And they have some driveways there, I'm seeing.

517
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:07,078
I don't know if it's posted, no parking though.

518
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:10,180
There are driveways that most of those houses get though, yeah.

519
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:25,088
I was just reviewing that the one sign I can see from Street View on Piggott does say, permit parking both sides of the street.

520
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:31,050
Well, there's supposed to be no parking anywhere other than the park.

521
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,371
But I'm only seeing one.

522
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:37,335
I've only so far found one sign for the entire street in my perusal here.

523
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:44,220
I was just more concerned with that stretch where the trees are along the tracks, if it's wide enough to park houses on both sides of the street.

524
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:50,284
That actually looks wider than the park that has houses on both sides.

525
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:51,065
Yeah.

526
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:54,948
Yeah, I see at least one driveway.

527
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,569
Can you pan down the street a little bit?

528
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:57,330
We've got driveways.

529
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:04,257
Or is it street parking, some driveways?

530
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:05,778
Yeah.

531
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm in favor of this.

532
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,441
I don't see why not.

533
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,682
Can I just get clarified?

534
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:21,688
So the rule is when there is no parking for street sweeping on one side of the street, there's just this expectation that everybody will just find parking on the other side of the street that night?

535
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:23,809
Seems so.

536
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:24,630
Yeah.

537
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,652
That must be dated.

538
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:28,692
Yeah.

539
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:39,493
As I understand it though, you also don't actively ticket, or we don't actively ticket on the side streets on those nights either.

540
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:42,475
I think we understand that there's some overflow.

541
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:45,097
But anyway.

542
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:46,759
May I comment?

543
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,104
In my experience, the tickets happen on street sweeping.

544
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:54,645
Yeah.

545
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:55,986
Oh, they do?

546
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:56,186
OK.

547
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:58,288
On the streets.

548
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:03,755
side streets.

549
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:10,499
I know the police department, we don't go out looking for that at late at night in response to calls.

550
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:23,005
I don't know about the parking department, if they have anyone overnight that makes that, but that's what Tim was referring to.

551
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:27,067
May I ask a question of Todd?

552
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,449
Do we know what the capacity of parking is on Pivot Road?

553
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,280
I don't necessarily know if I need.

554
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:43,203
It'll be ending November 1st anyways.

555
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,864
Yeah, it comes back in the spring.

556
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,627
Yeah, Jim's question.

557
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:57,471
I don't have any numbers on that, but I would say my opinion on this situation is Boston have.

558
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:04,055
This has on street parking on, like, the last situation and it's unrestricted.

559
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:06,356
It has unrestricted parking.

560
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:22,861
So if there was a problem finding parking on Boston Ave itself, then anyone on those streets could petition for resident permit parking to limit the competition instead of immediately going to the side streets that have residents.

561
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:24,363
Thank you.

562
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:32,889
And then in terms of streets, even in snow plowing, just like designing a parking lot for a mall, you don't design for the worst case scenario.

563
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:42,609
Although streets we've been snow plowing do have issues with parking, that's only, you know, maybe 10 times a year out of 365 days.

564
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:48,012
Sometimes, you know, maybe on some outages it's more, but it's not the normal situation.

565
00:43:52,514 --> 00:43:52,994
Thank you.

566
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:56,836
Well, so then there's, um,

567
00:43:58,123 --> 00:44:02,546
So is the issue that there's not enough parking on Boston Avenue available for you?

568
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,908
Sorry, I'm talking to the petitioner now.

569
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,829
Specifically on those nights, yes.

570
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,951
And it's really a consistency problem.

571
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:14,293
Sometimes there is parking, and sometimes there isn't.

572
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,114
And I have to walk a good 10 minutes.

573
00:44:17,515 --> 00:44:22,598
I'm all the way down at Whole Foods by that point to get back to my house.

574
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,461
So there often is, but it's really a consistency problem.

575
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:39,826
Sarah.

576
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:43,710
Yeah, just to chime in, like, I did for ship out.

577
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,532
It is not 1 that we get a lot of complaints about.

578
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:52,477
It's not something that I'm consistently hearing from residents saying, get over here and enforce.

579
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:53,578
I think they have.

580
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:56,800
Based only on that adequate space.

581
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:02,425
More so, I mean, ship out to 2, but they were more, maybe a little more territorial.

582
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:02,906
Who knows?

583
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:04,167
But.

584
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:13,259
Yeah, and I will say too, if you go too low on Boston Ave, like if you go below 195, you end up in Somerville.

585
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:22,368
So there is a possibility too that people moving their cars for Medford street sweeping may end up in Somerville by accident and then get a Somerville ticket.

586
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:30,155
But also I wanted to clarify that we do still enforce, we have one overnight parking control specialist who works

587
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:34,705
starting at 3 a.m., and he's not changing his route based on street sweeping.

588
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:42,110
So we will enforce permit parking overnight still during street sweeping, even if the streets are adjacent to those being swept.

589
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:46,113
Just to be clear on that, because it seemed like it was not clear.

590
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:52,578
But yeah, not a lot of feedback from residents of Piggott, so that's my two cents on that.

591
00:45:55,188 --> 00:46:01,090
Yeah, I just like to add this area in particular, because it's in Hillside, sort of close to Somerville.

592
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:11,715
It's similar to the main street situation that was described in my mind last month, because their main arteries in residential areas that are unrestricted.

593
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:13,856
So there's a lot of competition.

594
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:22,880
So anyone that doesn't want to pay a Somerville permit, or has an out of state, you know, or has a plate situation that they don't want to change the insurance to garage and Medford or Somerville.

595
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,242
you know, they're all going to Boston Ave, so a way to fix that in our toolbox is to make it residential.

596
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:41,869
Or in a lot of major arteries in cities like ours, they'll have two-hour park in daytime, except by permit, resident permit, and then that kind of limits the competition.

597
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,184
during non-business hours.

598
00:46:44,564 --> 00:47:00,471
Yeah, it almost seems like a better way to go, Todd, as far as dealing with this issue, because it doesn't have regulated parking now, so eliminating some of the competition for, what's her name, Miss Quattromonte on Boston Avenue.

599
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:08,975
It's a different way of looking at the solution and granting a variance, but anyway.

600
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:13,285
I don't know how other commissioners feel about that.

601
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:20,629
Does Boston Avenue need some residential permit parking instead of granting variances?

602
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:24,991
It would come into the next zone that we're talking about.

603
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,893
I think that, so I'm of two minds here.

604
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:37,137
I don't think we should just put off this residence problem because I think we're going to solve this in the next six months to a year.

605
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:40,909
But it could take us a full year before we do.

606
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:48,110
But this is the area that we are talking about with having one of the next rounds of doing a zoned parking.

607
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,031
And if we did zoned parking, I think we would include Boston Ave with exactly what we're describing here.

608
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:57,212
And that would solve her problems.

609
00:47:57,312 --> 00:48:03,453
But I'd hate to see her have to get tickets and walk 20 minutes, more than 10 minutes late at night.

610
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,023
while we spend a year doing that.

611
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:12,785
Because to do the public process right, it takes at least six months.

612
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:15,047
It's not just that we're slow.

613
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:19,390
It's that we want to really need to approach it and do a good public process.

614
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:21,151
That's a really good point.

615
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,774
Makes it less important for us, I guess, because we've got to dispose of it at that point anyway.

616
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:25,994
Right.

617
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:34,240
And at which point, her permit would then, of course, be valid because it would allow the regional and she'd be able to park on Piggott under the new system.

618
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:34,881
Yeah.

619
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,663
So I'm in favor of this one.

620
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:39,384
Yeah, me too.

621
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:41,085
We already have a motion.

622
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:41,706
Tim.

623
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,206
All right.

624
00:48:42,326 --> 00:48:43,487
Somebody motion to approve.

625
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,248
We can open it up to the public first.

626
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:46,249
Oh, did I?

627
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:49,831
I'm going to reinforce my motion.

628
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:50,091
Bold.

629
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:57,455
All right, do we have a motion?

630
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:01,318
I'll file a motion.

631
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:03,299
Give granted.

632
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,995
Somebody, I'll second.

633
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:13,616
There we go.

634
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:15,197
Commissioner McGiven?

635
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:15,997
Yes.

636
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:17,578
Commissioner Hunt?

637
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:18,238
Yes.

638
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:19,958
Commissioner Silva?

639
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:21,019
Yes.

640
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,519
Chief Covino?

641
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:23,039
Yes.

642
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,101
Motion passes 4-0 with one absent.

643
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:30,202
Nina, you're all set.

644
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:31,882
Thank you.

645
00:49:32,322 --> 00:49:33,603
Sarah, is she going to see you?

646
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,426
Yes, she's on the variance list.

647
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:45,492
And if she stops by our office anytime during City Hall business hours, you can purchase a permit, a permit variance for bigger roads.

648
00:49:46,413 --> 00:49:48,274
Okay, am I able to do that digitally?

649
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:49,515
Or do I need to show up in person?

650
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:54,018
Unfortunately, variances are not available for purchase online, you have to stop by the office.

651
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:56,119
Okay, I'll be there on Thursday.

652
00:49:56,399 --> 00:49:57,140
Thank you very much.

653
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,361
Have a good one.

654
00:50:00,868 --> 00:50:07,730
Moving on 2025-72 permanent parking variance, Edward Freeland, 343 Main Street.

655
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,931
Is Edward available?

656
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:15,572
I don't see him on here.

657
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,054
Edward Freeland?

658
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:30,710
Do we want to table and come back to this in case he joins us?

659
00:50:33,311 --> 00:50:38,455
Also, is somebody able to have the map of permit parking available when we look at this one?

660
00:50:38,475 --> 00:50:40,857
I was just looking to see if I had a copy on my desk.

661
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:44,700
Yes, I believe it's the G zone.

662
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,361
It's between Princeton and Bowdoin.

663
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:47,542
Am I correct?

664
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,083
Correct.

665
00:50:50,123 --> 00:50:50,464
Yeah.

666
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:56,234
I have a copy of that.

667
00:50:56,434 --> 00:51:02,399
Unlike the Boston Ave situation, Main Street folks are in fact in the location of the G-Zone.

668
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:12,567
We issued, I believe, the next door neighbor a few months ago a variance for the G-Zone.

669
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,256
But main street itself is not in the zone.

670
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,096
Sorry, I'm not looking for, you know.

671
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:24,418
But they're on that side of the Princeton and Bowdoin, Yale.

672
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:25,558
Well, she's.

673
00:51:25,658 --> 00:51:31,040
All right, so this is.

674
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,129
In fact, a new point where he could park anyway he wants.

675
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,190
No, he can't.

676
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,051
He's not in the zone.

677
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,632
I thought he was on the G zone.

678
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:46,073
He's on the side of the G zone on those streets.

679
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,515
If you were to move the variance to they are G zone streets.

680
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:57,818
There is someone there on.

681
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,221
Hi, I'm here for the road permit.

682
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:00,481
Okay.

683
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:00,581
Okay.

684
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:01,542
We'll get to you.

685
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:02,342
Sorry.

686
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:02,803
Thank you.

687
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:04,144
Thank you.

688
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:09,368
Did he say he'd be.

689
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,259
I sent him an email.

690
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:29,059
Okay.

691
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:30,679
Well, I'm here.

692
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,499
This one's yours.

693
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:31,979
Matt.

694
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:32,820
Yeah, it's on.

695
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,480
I'm on mute.

696
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,320
So I asked.

697
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,282
We have issued variance to the house aside.

698
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:48,064
Household wasn't transferred to their cell phone number.

699
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:48,924
There's a household.

700
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:50,624
I must have transferred to their cell.

701
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:51,304
Yeah.

702
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:52,405
Yeah.

703
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:52,645
Yeah.

704
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:27,312
never going to know do we want to table this yeah it says you have to be here to pass it or should we just table it do we place on the file the table no you wouldn't place it on file you'd have to give them a chance to come to the next meeting okay okay so table

705
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:31,069
Yeah, one month table until we can contact them.

706
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:32,369
Table to the next meeting.

707
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,291
All right, councillors, I have a motion to table this.

708
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:40,052
I will not be able to get ahold of Edwin till the November meeting.

709
00:53:49,555 --> 00:53:55,157
And I'm inclined to table it unless he shows up in this meeting later, I would take it back off the table.

710
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:59,629
Because I do, you know, we have to, why is he using the parking in this house?

711
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:06,055
I assume he's not allowed, but, and we don't have an email on this, do we?

712
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:09,338
Sorry, I didn't, I don't remember everything that was in the packet we were sent.

713
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,081
Do we have an email on him?

714
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:14,463
Do we have an email address for him?

715
00:54:14,703 --> 00:54:14,924
Yes.

716
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:19,304
Oh, Edward Freeland.

717
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,825
We have an email from him.

718
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:22,386
Recently moved in.

719
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,668
This makes me ineligible for residential permit parking.

720
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:27,409
Parking, right.

721
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:28,549
So we all have this email.

722
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:30,510
Parking for my home is not practical.

723
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:35,873
There is a bus stop directly there, and the nearby spaces are limited to short-term convenience store parking.

724
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:44,478
I'd like to request your guidance on how I might apply for an exemption that would allow me to park on Princeton Street or an alternative nearby with a residential parking permit.

725
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:59,429
He was emailed an invitation to this meeting from Alva and a letter with his options to send a letter in or electronically attend the Zoom meeting or send a letter in to us.

726
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,871
He hasn't sent the letter, right?

727
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:06,174
The only letter I have is his request for the appearance.

728
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:12,460
So I would say we table this until either he shows up tonight or we address it the next meeting.

729
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:20,280
Okay, I think somebody may reach out to him and explain that he has to come to the meeting to help us understand the situation.

730
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,543
Alicia, you making a motion?

731
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:26,685
Yeah, she did.

732
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:28,046
I'll motion to table it.

733
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:28,426
Second?

734
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:29,687
I'll second.

735
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:30,768
Chief Covino?

736
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:32,589
Alva, roll call vote.

737
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:34,811
Commissioner McGiven?

738
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:35,552
Yes.

739
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:37,753
Commissioner Hunt?

740
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:38,914
Yes.

741
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:40,435
Commissioner Silva?

742
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:41,296
Yes.

743
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:42,977
Chief Covino?

744
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:43,518
Yes.

745
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:50,774
By vote of 4-0, 1 absent, motion passes.

746
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:58,019
2025-73, permit parking variance, Tom Jennings, 400 Main Street, Apartment 3.

747
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,679
Is Tom here?

748
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,720
Yes, sir.

749
00:56:08,138 --> 00:56:10,080
What, what just happened?

750
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,081
Oh, thank you.

751
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:17,306
So I just, I just moved back to the area 400 Medford or 400 Main Street Medford.

752
00:56:17,326 --> 00:56:23,431
I lived in Somerville for four years, Cambridge for four years, Arlington for two years.

753
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:31,516
Uh, so I, like when I signed up for the lease, I didn't think anything of the parking because I never had a situation like this where it wouldn't be available based on the location.

754
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:36,118
Um, and unfortunately the landlord never explains the parking situation.

755
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:44,803
Uh, so I'm hoping for an exception in this case, just because I have a job where, um, you know, I'm a lab and facilities manager.

756
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:47,845
I'm on call 24 seven.

757
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:52,788
So I could get called in for, you know, building emergencies, like a leak or,

758
00:56:53,548 --> 00:57:13,055
Safety issues like someone gets hurt And I have been walking, you know, I moved in only a couple weeks ago but on the streets that are adjacent to 400 Main Street, it's Bonner and Alexander I've noticed, you know at night and the morning the same spots and

759
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:14,555
are typically available.

760
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:18,276
I think I've seen like, you know, five or six openings at least on either side.

761
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:22,838
And then also, um, you know, like give or take in the surrounding areas.

762
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:30,860
So I just wanted to explain my situation, see what you guys thought about it and, um, see if you need anything more from me to make a decision off of that.

763
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,001
Thank you commissioners.

764
00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:37,936
Yes, I'd like to ask you a question.

765
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:41,199
Do you have parking, off-street parking?

766
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,783
There seems to be a driveway to the right of your house, looking at the front of your house.

767
00:57:45,344 --> 00:57:49,268
Yeah, and that's the only thing that was explained to me, that I would not have access to that driveway.

768
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:11,118
And Jim, again, I don't have the maps, but isn't this, this is, is directly across the street from him is the G zone.

769
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:12,318
I need a map.

770
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:13,519
Sorry.

771
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:20,782
And on his side is one of the areas that are, is under consideration for the next round of zoned permit.

772
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:23,403
That's where we talked about making a South Medford zone.

773
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:27,365
And in theory, if we did that, his side of main street.

774
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:29,206
So that's what I don't understand.

775
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:30,026
Why wouldn't,

776
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:40,468
The left side, the even side of Main Street be part of the G zone, and then the odd side of Main Street be part of the quote South Medford zone.

777
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,512
The other way around, the odd side.

778
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:53,033
The G was within the green line proximity.

779
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:55,094
So that's how they looked at it.

780
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:56,996
So that's how we sort of adjusted it.

781
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:01,858
The other streets are for the secondary, as you mentioned, the South Medford.

782
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:12,244
I think the process was based on either you were East or West, and you would fall within that criteria.

783
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:16,467
So those on the West side would be G, those in the others would

784
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:22,069
if variants were approved would be on those streets that have got names.

785
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:32,612
Yeah and one other thing to note in these g-zones or any future zone is in this g-zone we kind of did an experiment with two different scenarios.

786
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:43,216
Main street is not included as part of the g-zone but part of Medford street is included one side with a three-hour except by permit.

787
00:59:43,736 --> 00:59:46,777
So if we were to go forward and include the major streets I would

788
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,421
Think that we would model it after the Medford street portion.

789
00:59:51,582 --> 01:00:01,432
Either 2 or 3 hour, except by permit, so businesses could have turnover because right now, the section of main street is unrestricted just like that boss now, except there are some.

790
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:10,821
Like, nail a cautious and some other short term parking, but outside the meter zones, it's essentially unrestricted.

791
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:11,121
I mean.

792
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:12,698
Right.

793
01:00:13,178 --> 01:00:23,064
It seems to me that if we put the zones in, we would need the properties on main street to be in one zone or another.

794
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:28,367
Like, it wouldn't be fair to them to be like, yeah, but now you can't park anywhere.

795
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,942
So I'm, I'm good with this one too.

796
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:38,222
It makes sense to me.

797
01:00:38,382 --> 01:00:39,403
Oh, we need to decide.

798
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:42,124
So he would not get a G zone parking though.

799
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:47,567
We would, because we're on the same side, it would either be Alexander or Bonner and we would have to choose.

800
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,508
Is that correct?

801
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:59,634
Um, and therefore I guess we need, uh, our professionals to weigh in on, um, does one have more space than the other?

802
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:06,159
That would be our next step.

803
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,486
If we give him the G Zone one, which is across the street, he's got several streets to pick from.

804
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:16,432
If we keep him on his side of the street, he's either Bonner or Alexander in that area.

805
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,431
Does anybody have an idea of how busy those streets are for parking?

806
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:31,111
Jim, I asked a question about Alexander Avenue, the resident parking.

807
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:35,972
Is it only during the day on that stretch from Maine to Willis?

808
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:38,193
That's a good question.

809
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:39,253
No, it's overnight.

810
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,053
It's overnight.

811
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:50,355
Yeah, Jim, it used to be only between 5 PM and 8 PM, but that changed in, it looks like, 2019.

812
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:59,863
To, oh, no, I'm sorry 2024. it's the North side from mystic to pierce.

813
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:01,964
There's different sections.

814
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:04,345
There's not there's none that are just in the morning.

815
01:02:04,365 --> 01:02:08,308
It's like, it's my block.

816
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:09,048
Yeah.

817
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,869
Yeah.

818
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:13,932
So, I think, yeah, go ahead.

819
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:18,975
Alexander closest closest to ground to cafe is not permanent in the daytime.

820
01:02:19,715 --> 01:02:21,396
Because I frequent the area for lunch.

821
01:02:21,897 --> 01:02:23,458
It's only nighttime.

822
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:26,359
Whereas Barner is full time, I believe.

823
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:32,803
And additionally, just both of them, as you get closer to Mystic Ave, become resident or business permit parking.

824
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:37,626
So they both have a section that accommodates both types of permits as you get down to Mystic Ave.

825
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:44,750
Gee, if I'd say Barner is more busier than I was in.

826
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:48,813
Why don't we look at where him and what's the next one going towards the park there around?

827
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:55,046
Maryam and Wareham are both the G-Zone, so it's a little bit different.

828
01:02:55,086 --> 01:03:11,595
I will mention as Todd alluded to, when the zones were implemented, the pushback was from the community on Wareham, Maryam, anything close proximity to the business because of the overflow already.

829
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,761
So we're looking at Bonner, is that what you said, Bonner?

830
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,943
Bonner's more residential.

831
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:25,165
Alexander, you're going to have the overflow also for the residents.

832
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:25,586
Okay.

833
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:34,371
And he actually has been looking, so he said Bonner and Alexander, there seems to be adequate space for him, so let's just pick one.

834
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,092
Oh, yes.

835
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,734
We'll pick Bonner.

836
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,135
I said Alexander.

837
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:51,304
And can I ask the resident quick question is this you find that parking is during the street sweeping time that becomes problematic.

838
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,588
Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a combination of that.

839
01:03:55,628 --> 01:04:00,751
Again, I just moved to the area, but it's making sure that I'm properly parked in the area that I'm supposed to be.

840
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:10,935
Um, and just not like, you know, parking somewhere I'm not, and that's, you know, whether it's, you know, trying to park on the main street and play the game of like taking up spots in front of the businesses.

841
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:17,358
Um, I just want to ensure that like, I'm, I'm where I'm supposed to be and that's okay that I'm allowed to be there.

842
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:30,014
I know it's a little bit different than what you've experienced from other communities, but we're in the process of doing the zone parking in the more urban parts of Medford.

843
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:39,819
Unfortunately, it seems a little disjointed at this point, but again, hopefully, we can put you somewhere where you can park.

844
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,340
That'd be great.

845
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:45,542
I said you're not going up to public.

846
01:04:46,422 --> 01:04:47,243
Do you have any comments?

847
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:47,923
I have a comment.

848
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:53,738
Yeah.

849
01:04:53,758 --> 01:04:55,179
I don't think anyone's raising their hand.

850
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,640
All right.

851
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,522
Seeing none, does the commission is having motion?

852
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:01,163
Alicia.

853
01:05:02,183 --> 01:05:02,804
Did you make a motion?

854
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:03,644
I would motion.

855
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:05,685
Oh, we just need to know which side did.

856
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:07,146
Sorry, I didn't follow that.

857
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:09,448
In the end, did we decide that Alexander was better?

858
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,481
Yeah, I apologize.

859
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:14,604
I didn't quite process.

860
01:05:14,884 --> 01:05:19,569
Alexander is closer than Bonner, I would believe, and might be more practical.

861
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:26,015
People are telling us that Alexander is probably a little more space on it.

862
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:33,542
So I had motion to give him a permit for Alexander.

863
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,783
I second.

864
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:38,683
Alva, roll call roll, please.

865
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:39,664
Commissioner McGibbon?

866
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:40,344
Yes.

867
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:42,465
Commissioner Hunt?

868
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:43,466
Yes.

869
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:45,147
Commissioner Silva?

870
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:51,990
Yes, with the caveat that we look at the zone option for this particular location.

871
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:57,233
Chief Covino?

872
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:57,934
Yes.

873
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,925
Vote for zero.

874
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:04,187
One absent, the motion passes.

875
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:11,150
Tom, can you see the parking department at City Hall, and they'll take care of you.

876
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:11,831
Thank you.

877
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:12,751
Thank you, guys.

878
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,272
Appreciate it.

879
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:22,136
Moving on, 20-25-74, one petition, permit parking 24-7 Pickham Road.

880
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:25,518
Do we have someone to speak?

881
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:29,466
It was so important.

882
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:29,927
Yeah.

883
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,069
That telephone number one, five, six.

884
01:06:32,149 --> 01:06:32,509
Hi.

885
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:40,756
Um, so I did not, um, like sign the per, um, the petition or submit it.

886
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:43,598
Um, I I'm a resident of Pinkham road.

887
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:46,520
Okay.

888
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,202
Could you have your name and your address please?

889
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:53,166
Jenna Boland, uh, 23 Pinkham road.

890
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:54,507
Okay.

891
01:06:56,498 --> 01:07:01,354
petition because the petition was presented before she moved into that home.

892
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:11,285
Yeah, but I reached out because I was having issues finding parking on my road in the evening.

893
01:07:11,785 --> 01:07:21,590
So I tried to get a permit and was told that because it was non-permitted street, I couldn't get a permit, but a petition had already been filed.

894
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:26,313
So I am for Pinkham Road being permit only.

895
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,114
Okay, thank you.

896
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:30,795
Do we have anyone else to speak?

897
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:36,963
I see Michael Hickey is raising his hand.

898
01:07:41,944 --> 01:07:42,624
Yes, unmute.

899
01:07:44,805 --> 01:07:46,425
Did you send him the message to unmute?

900
01:07:47,145 --> 01:07:47,665
Yeah, yeah.

901
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:48,305
Okay.

902
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,787
Who are the two people that sent us letters that were against?

903
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:58,807
There's a negative?

904
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,307
Yeah.

905
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,788
I received two letters in opposition.

906
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:02,588
Would I go?

907
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:03,048
Names.

908
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:08,310
The name is, name's Kathleen Beebe.

909
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,531
Anyone else raising their hand for this?

910
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:13,972
And that was Andrea Ganji.

911
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:14,853
Hello.

912
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,774
Oh, this is the gentleman whose name is on the petition.

913
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,434
Thanks.

914
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:25,116
So I was one of the two people who went around the neighborhood to have people sign the petition.

915
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:32,379
And I want to thank you for allowing me to speak and for also considering our petition for resident sticker parking only.

916
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,541
It's been a long while that we've been able to park all the time on our street.

917
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:42,323
A lot of people from Boston have park on our street and from surrounding areas.

918
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:45,944
And so it's been very difficult for us to find places to park.

919
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:55,026
And the majority of the people on the street would love to see this resident sticker parking only so we know we can have places to park when we come home at night or we get home from our jobs.

920
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:13,764
Alva, I saw the message that he sent a petition, but were we, was there a separate email that actually had it or all the signatures or whatever?

921
01:09:13,784 --> 01:09:18,689
I'm not finding that, but maybe it's just lost in my email.

922
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:20,971
We didn't email it.

923
01:09:21,252 --> 01:09:23,514
I didn't send the signatures on the petition.

924
01:09:23,794 --> 01:09:24,475
You have them though?

925
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:25,095
I have them.

926
01:09:25,115 --> 01:09:25,196
Yes.

927
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:27,470
Oh, okay.

928
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,952
So it didn't get scanned in and emailed to us.

929
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:30,812
Exactly.

930
01:09:31,012 --> 01:09:31,493
Exactly.

931
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:36,937
One of the third page.

932
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:37,618
Yeah.

933
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,620
We're told to just drop it off at the police station.

934
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,182
So my partner dropped it off after we completed it.

935
01:09:43,482 --> 01:09:44,523
Yeah.

936
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:52,750
She's just talking about the members in the, yeah.

937
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:05,580
So could we get some information from the police station about, you know, how many people signed the petition?

938
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:11,183
Are they, you know, represent how many house, how many addresses on the street?

939
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:17,307
That's what we usually look to see if there's at least 50% of the street is signed on to something like this in the past.

940
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:18,748
We have 18 signatures.

941
01:10:18,868 --> 01:10:20,349
And I sent 35 notices.

942
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:30,339
And does 18 signatures represent 18 different households?

943
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,281
I'm done now, Alicia.

944
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:33,782
Okay, thank you.

945
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:41,869
Mr. Carey has his hand raised.

946
01:10:46,433 --> 01:10:48,194
Michael, how many houses are on the street?

947
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:49,896
We have 14 different households.

948
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:53,300
Uh, we went to 18 different households.

949
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:53,881
We didn't do it.

950
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:56,182
We just did it by, um, street numbers.

951
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:04,167
And I sent 35 notices and I take them as from the ward book.

952
01:11:04,507 --> 01:11:05,548
Yeah.

953
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:09,150
There's two or 32 or three is 134.

954
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:10,651
That's three.

955
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:15,193
It looks like 16 facing Pinkham.

956
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:16,474
And if they're all two family, that's 32.

957
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,955
So it sounds about right.

958
01:11:18,643 --> 01:11:20,664
Yeah, 14 of different addresses.

959
01:11:20,684 --> 01:11:24,725
Some of them may be in the same house, but they're different addresses.

960
01:11:24,745 --> 01:11:27,386
18 signatures, 14 residences.

961
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:29,366
Okay, thank you.

962
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:34,088
And it's just because I think we've said it said before that it's important.

963
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:44,211
The last one that came in front of us, one of the things that we asked for was to make sure we had good turnout from or that we'd heard from a majority of the people on the street.

964
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:47,719
We do have two people that emailed us about that.

965
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:48,739
They were against this.

966
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,861
This gentleman, Paul, has been waiting to talk to you.

967
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:53,502
He's, I think he's one of the petitioners.

968
01:11:53,682 --> 01:11:53,962
Okay.

969
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:57,404
So I'm, my name's Paul Carey.

970
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:59,606
I also just recently moved to the area.

971
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:04,209
I'm living at 23 Pinkham Road and I moved here after the petition.

972
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:11,453
Had I been here at the time that it was circulating, I also would have signed the petition just to put that in there.

973
01:12:13,447 --> 01:12:16,008
All right, so there's two more people that would have signed this petition.

974
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:28,295
So one of my concerns and actual reasons why I would support permit parking here is because we're very close to the Somerville border.

975
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:43,043
And it seems to me that it could very well be that people who can't park in Somerville and anybody who lives in Somerville and registers their car in Somerville can get a parking permit in Somerville.

976
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:52,937
And anybody who lives in Medford and lives on a street with permit parking and registers their car in Medford could get a permit here.

977
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:58,279
The key is registering your car, which means that you pay the excise taxes to the city.

978
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:08,884
But I do feel like it's only appropriate for us to have heard from the neighbors.

979
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:16,233
I think that passing this is going to put more pressure on Boston Ave.

980
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:22,378
But I think that this is, again, another area that we really need to move this process forward of looking at zone parking.

981
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:28,622
So was the result 50%?

982
01:13:29,463 --> 01:13:32,084
We have 50% of the households signed on with those added to?

983
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:33,025
Sounds like it.

984
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:37,648
Yeah, if you count those houses, the end ones seem to be on Caden Street and Boston Ave.

985
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:40,210
So you've got one on my right side, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

986
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:52,193
go across the street, again, the N1 Boston app, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and the next one's on Capon Street.

987
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:53,413
So there's 16 houses.

988
01:13:53,934 --> 01:14:03,119
We have, with the two people who just signed in and supported it, we have 18 signatures with 14 different addresses.

989
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,502
And the two additional ones would make up the difference.

990
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:12,105
So I'd say we're number one with 50% of the residents there.

991
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:18,338
Also, the biggest problem up in that area is there's many tough students that have out-of-state plates.

992
01:14:18,418 --> 01:14:21,899
They don't want to register their cars in the city for whatever reason.

993
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:27,982
So, again, is it gonna cause a problem in Boston?

994
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,243
Of course.

995
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,924
Those people are gonna have to find somewhere to go.

996
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:32,625
And there are many people that do.

997
01:14:35,226 --> 01:14:41,529
We've had an issue over the years where people who live in Somerville, again, college students or what have you, they don't register their car in Somerville

998
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,623
It appears that we've got well over 50% of the street for support.

999
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:58,828
Simple numbers for me, so I'm in favor.

1000
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:02,210
I was back at it.

1001
01:15:05,813 --> 01:15:07,695
We have no one else to speak on the phone.

1002
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:13,159
I'm going to just double check that no one's in the chat.

1003
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,281
Two emails that came.

1004
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:19,279
the email that those two people sent in that were opposed to it.

1005
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:20,240
Do you have them?

1006
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:20,800
Can I see them?

1007
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:29,744
I want to see what they're asking.

1008
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:34,165
Not seeing it.

1009
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:43,629
Okay, just for the record, we have two emails that came in from two different people, and one basically lives at 15,

1010
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:57,128
And the other one is someone that does not have a driveway access and needs to park on the street.

1011
01:15:57,628 --> 01:16:00,129
Most often can't find this on street parking.

1012
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:05,310
So the other person, it seems, parks there but does not live right on that street.

1013
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,551
So that's it.

1014
01:16:09,591 --> 01:16:12,592
Those are the two people that emailed us that were in opposition to this.

1015
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,909
I have a roll call vote, a motion on the table.

1016
01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:19,930
I didn't get who motioned.

1017
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:21,910
I motioned.

1018
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:25,232
I don't know if someone seconded that.

1019
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,012
I did get that.

1020
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:27,812
Commissioner McGibbon?

1021
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:28,633
Yes.

1022
01:16:29,313 --> 01:16:30,053
Commissioner Hunt?

1023
01:16:30,613 --> 01:16:30,894
Yes.

1024
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,694
Commissioner Silva?

1025
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:39,837
Yes, with the caveat that zone parking needs to be addressed in this area within the next year.

1026
01:16:43,652 --> 01:16:44,352
Chief Covino?

1027
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:45,033
Yes.

1028
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:49,074
The vote of 4-0, 1 absent, motion passes.

1029
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,336
Congratulations, Michael and everyone.

1030
01:16:52,356 --> 01:16:52,976
Thank you very much.

1031
01:16:53,356 --> 01:16:58,618
I really appreciate your listening to us and your time and energy and what you do in the parking commission.

1032
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,160
Thank you.

1033
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:04,681
Thank you.

1034
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:12,524
2025-75, permanent parking variance for Sarah Rebecca Gaglio, 465 Broadway, apartment 4.

1035
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:15,363
She's not in attendance.

1036
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:19,105
She called me and she's had to work late tonight.

1037
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:19,925
Okay.

1038
01:17:21,466 --> 01:17:23,347
We have gone back and forth with this woman.

1039
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:30,110
Her only question is she has a mother that comes from out of state to visit and wants to be able to get her a parking spot.

1040
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:36,354
This woman lives at the infamous 25 Sherbrook Court where there is no parking.

1041
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:37,514
She has no car.

1042
01:17:37,554 --> 01:17:42,937
She just wants to get a barriers for a park permit so her mother can park on

1043
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:44,195
Braymore?

1044
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:45,616
Braymore or Strathmore?

1045
01:17:45,636 --> 01:17:47,257
Strathmore when she comes here.

1046
01:17:48,437 --> 01:17:51,078
She couldn't make the meeting tonight because she's working.

1047
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:59,742
Was this the letter that says the problem is that the house is literally the front of the house is in Somerville.

1048
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:03,504
So Medford doesn't recognize Broadway as a street to give her a permit.

1049
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:12,328
And Somerville doesn't recognize her as a Somerville resident because she technically lives in Somerville, in Medford.

1050
01:18:13,717 --> 01:18:17,999
Pretty much the street is some of all the address is Medford.

1051
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,802
So, the buildings in Medford, their Medford residents, they pay Medford excise taxes.

1052
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:25,463
They are.

1053
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:29,480
Within the zone, and they do have permit parking.

1054
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:36,103
I believe this individual is asking for a visitor pass and we don't issue.

1055
01:18:36,203 --> 01:18:37,064
It's my understanding.

1056
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:48,450
We don't issue for sure born court visitor passes because of the limited parking on the streets that you mentioned, including both street.

1057
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,160
Thank you.

1058
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,481
I would concur with Jim.

1059
01:18:53,521 --> 01:19:02,024
The consistency from this commission has been to grant variances for the permit holder, but not for visitor on the side streets usually.

1060
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:08,266
If this is a visitor on Broadway, there is plenty of visitor parking on Broadway, isn't there?

1061
01:19:08,386 --> 01:19:16,008
Unfortunately, the signs in Somerville, it's permit only between 8 and 2.30 AM or something.

1062
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:23,312
crazy in front of, if you look at 465, you can see what that sign is.

1063
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:40,301
But Medford Street, two blocks down on the east side is open parking in Medford, as well as Main Street, two streets the other way, which is, with the exception of street sweeping, provides open parking.

1064
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:47,785
Broadway at Trump Field is open, even though it's insummable, it's open without any restriction.

1065
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:57,905
Yeah, and I want to point out to everyone in attendance that Somerville is hosting a public meeting tomorrow night regarding.

1066
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:02,853
a redesign or planning of Magoon Square, which is this area.

1067
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:13,520
So any Medford residents should attend that meeting and could contribute to questions like this about providing more visitor parking on Broadway or whatnot, whatever people feel.

1068
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,282
But I wanted to make people aware of that public meeting happening tomorrow.

1069
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:17,963
Right.

1070
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:24,747
So it does sound like she's having overnight guests is her problem, is that it's overnight guests that are coming, not just daytime visitors.

1071
01:20:25,828 --> 01:20:26,748
They don't get it.

1072
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:33,534
Yeah, so, at that public meeting, you could discuss anything under the world that someone might need or want, you know, as an issue.

1073
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:39,319
Yes, I'm having in public comment.

1074
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,444
I don't see it.

1075
01:20:47,506 --> 01:20:49,568
Seeing none, we revert back to the commissioners.

1076
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:51,509
Does someone have a motion?

1077
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:57,294
Oh, I think we're going to have to come up with some sort of a.

1078
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,881
I call the motion not to approve.

1079
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:11,043
Seconded.

1080
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,287
You mean to deny it?

1081
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:18,447
Correct.

1082
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:25,011
I think you're right that we've denied these before and that there are options for visitors.

1083
01:21:30,002 --> 01:21:34,424
Like this wouldn't be eligible to buy like one of those three day visitor passes.

1084
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:38,146
You're shaking your head.

1085
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:39,467
No, they're not.

1086
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:44,129
I think again, I don't know what the rule is out there.

1087
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,850
There's always been not much parking up in that.

1088
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:55,554
So no, I'm inclined to say I'd love to see this person get a visitor pass for when her mother comes to visit, but

1089
01:21:56,076 --> 01:21:59,097
The other idea is, you know, where do we draw the line?

1090
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:07,421
And to brought up a valid point that we've denied people access to these other streets before.

1091
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:14,704
So I'd like to say, sure, it's only gonna happen once in a blue moon, but do we know that?

1092
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:22,087
Yeah, I'm noticing a lack of accessible parking spaces on Broadway, Somerville.

1093
01:22:22,107 --> 01:22:24,908
So I'm gonna make a note to email Somerville about that.

1094
01:22:25,498 --> 01:22:33,501
Because no matter what city or, you know, business district something's in, there should be adequate, you know, every once in a while, accessible parking.

1095
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:40,264
So if that existed in this case, this visitor could use an accessible park space that would be open to anyone, not just Somerville residents, right?

1096
01:22:40,724 --> 01:22:47,126
So I just looked up and down Broadway, and it didn't seem like there's any accessible spaces on either side of the street for quite a distance.

1097
01:22:47,186 --> 01:22:51,228
So that's something that could be fixed potentially by Somerville.

1098
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:56,462
Have a roll call vote.

1099
01:22:59,163 --> 01:23:00,044
Commissioner McGibbon?

1100
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:04,666
Yes, it's a deny, correct?

1101
01:23:05,507 --> 01:23:05,727
Yes.

1102
01:23:06,508 --> 01:23:07,228
Commissioner Hunt?

1103
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:08,489
Yes.

1104
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:10,390
Commissioner Silva?

1105
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:10,950
Yes.

1106
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:12,531
Chief Cabino?

1107
01:23:13,131 --> 01:23:13,872
Yes.

1108
01:23:14,332 --> 01:23:16,754
The 4-0 vote, one absent.

1109
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:18,154
The motion is denied.

1110
01:23:18,174 --> 01:23:22,357
The guy in the corner, Braymore and Broadway, has a letter I can describe.

1111
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:38,140
Moving on, 2025-76, no parking outside the south side of Lewis Street from the corner of Fulton, extending approximately 25 feet east of Fulton Street.

1112
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:40,801
This is Todd Blake.

1113
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:50,263
Just for the commissioners, we do have numerous complaints coming from Lewis Street just for this reason and other reasons.

1114
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:51,123
So, Todd?

1115
01:23:58,622 --> 01:23:58,942
Was it?

1116
01:23:59,182 --> 01:24:03,163
No, I pulled 25 feet from 25 feet from the intersection.

1117
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:06,104
You'll see a full street on Louis Street.

1118
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:08,305
Yeah, where it intersects with full correct.

1119
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:14,066
Right.

1120
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:23,049
God, you're up.

1121
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:29,128
Sorry, I'm trying to.

1122
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:37,853
Having difficulty sharing my screen.

1123
01:24:37,893 --> 01:24:40,435
Can you pull up Lewis Street, please, near Fulton?

1124
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:47,439
Todd, do you want to pull it up now?

1125
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:50,041
We took ours off, so you should be able to pull it up now.

1126
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:05,386
I may be, okay, here we go.

1127
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:39,354
Can you all see this Lewis Street?

1128
01:25:44,457 --> 01:25:45,757
It's still loading.

1129
01:25:45,777 --> 01:25:46,317
Can you hear me?

1130
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:47,638
We're having internet issues.

1131
01:25:58,263 --> 01:26:00,664
All right, I'm going to stop sharing.

1132
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,202
Yeah, please.

1133
01:26:03,382 --> 01:26:06,865
I think it's overlaying my system when I'm trying to share and speak at the same time, I guess.

1134
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:15,532
So, Lewis street is basically that I got a, I got informed of a situation from a council city counselor.

1135
01:26:16,308 --> 01:26:22,952
who informed me that the residents had experienced an emergency vehicle trying to reach Lewis Street and had difficulty making the turns.

1136
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:31,337
So myself and DTW representatives, Highway Foreman met with Metro Fire to check the turns from Fulton Street onto Lewis.

1137
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:37,121
And we determined it would be helpful to them to sign and no parking, hit a corner.

1138
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:41,433
uh, on the South side, Lewis, 25 feet from the corner.

1139
01:26:42,094 --> 01:26:43,755
Normally 20 feet's already approved.

1140
01:26:44,156 --> 01:26:48,920
In this case, the extra five didn't take away any other parking to the next driveway.

1141
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,043
It's still afforded the space for two parking spaces.

1142
01:26:52,103 --> 01:26:57,388
So that five feet, you know, was, was good to help the Medford fire department.

1143
01:26:57,428 --> 01:27:01,912
So, um, that's where this originally, and that's what the reason is for.

1144
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:08,574
So it's only five more feet than the standard 20 feet, and we're signing it as well.

1145
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:18,257
But it doesn't take away any parking, because there were only two spaces that could fit between the 20 feet and the driveway anyways on the south side.

1146
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:30,482
Yeah, so it would be that right turn from Fulton Street onto Lewis if it was the fire department coming from Salem Street, and if it's the one coming from the Heights, they'd take the left turn.

1147
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:37,805
And it's pretty much a public safety thing.

1148
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:39,226
I would move to approve.

1149
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:45,849
Second.

1150
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:47,910
Commissioner McGibbon?

1151
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:49,211
Yes, indeed.

1152
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:50,772
Commissioner Hunt?

1153
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:51,632
Yes.

1154
01:27:52,473 --> 01:27:53,313
Commissioner Silva?

1155
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:53,994
Yes.

1156
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:55,655
Chief Covino?

1157
01:27:56,035 --> 01:27:56,235
Yes.

1158
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:04,428
Before nothing vote, one absent motion is approved.

1159
01:28:05,188 --> 01:28:06,769
Tim, just one thing.

1160
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:10,832
Could we get hash marks maybe painted in this area?

1161
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:15,376
It really helps at some point.

1162
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:18,398
With the no parking lane, you mean?

1163
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:19,439
Correct.

1164
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:21,961
Okay.

1165
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:22,802
I'll think about it.

1166
01:28:22,822 --> 01:28:24,703
All right.

1167
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:25,944
I'll talk to Todd about it.

1168
01:28:26,004 --> 01:28:26,885
I'll see what makes sense.

1169
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:29,046
I'm reluctant because it's,

1170
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:34,004
putting paint on a side street, but anyway.

1171
01:28:34,264 --> 01:28:36,025
All right, moving on.

1172
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:41,027
20-25-77, Daylight Crossing, higher picture.

1173
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:53,753
Posted no parking north side of High Street from crosswalk extending east approximately 32 feet and no parking south side of High Street from crosswalk extending west approximately 32 feet.

1174
01:28:54,393 --> 01:28:58,215
Todd Blake, this area we have been getting complaints.

1175
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,164
And the city councils have also chimed in on this.

1176
01:29:03,145 --> 01:29:03,425
Go ahead.

1177
01:29:04,285 --> 01:29:11,990
Yeah, a resident reached out and pointed out that it's difficult to cross the street coming from behind a parked vehicle.

1178
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:18,494
And it's in line with what we've been doing elsewhere with daylight and crosswalks for improved visibility, improved safety.

1179
01:29:19,094 --> 01:29:26,879
So the 32 feet in this case, roughly, if you look at a high street, would go from the crosswalk to right about the walkway for each of these houses.

1180
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:37,403
And one, we needed to go a little further, 32 versus say, 28, because there was a utility obstruction for the physical pole.

1181
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:44,489
So 32 feet on high street prior to the crosswalk would help with visibility, just like we've done elsewhere.

1182
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:47,311
So that's what we're asking for.

1183
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,935
Commissioner, no one has an issue.

1184
01:29:51,115 --> 01:29:51,935
I'd like to combine 77 and 78.

1185
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:58,271
78 is stop sign on Pitcher Ave at High Street.

1186
01:29:58,412 --> 01:29:58,912
Todd Blake.

1187
01:29:59,092 --> 01:29:59,332
Yeah.

1188
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:11,718
So while I was looking at this situation and pre-marking some crosswalks that we hope to paint across Pitcher, I noticed that Pitcher does not have a stop sign entering High Street.

1189
01:30:12,759 --> 01:30:14,820
So it would be helpful to have a stop sign.

1190
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:20,083
We're going to, next time we paint High Street, we hope to paint,

1191
01:30:21,393 --> 01:30:25,056
Edgelines on picture to to kind of guide people to the middle of that road.

1192
01:30:25,196 --> 01:30:27,817
That's the most advantageous for sight lines.

1193
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:39,666
So, with the new painting, the hopefully new crosswalk soon and stop signs and the daylighting this theory, we hope to vastly improve the safety for everyone in the area.

1194
01:30:41,787 --> 01:30:44,229
Motion well, I'll let someone else motion.

1195
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,692
Approve second sounds great.

1196
01:30:50,723 --> 01:30:51,704
I have a roll call vote.

1197
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:53,165

1198
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:53,906

1205
01:31:03,116 --> 01:31:09,242
With a 4-0 count, one missing, motion is approved.

And he will be chairing the meetings.

1210
