3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:34,598
[SPEAKER_08]: absent and I believe Brenda Pike and Sarah McDermott are here as well from the city and Todd Blake, so we just want to introduce them and introduce everybody here.

4
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:41,162
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be starting with the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday, the 14th at 5.08 PM.

[SPEAKER_08]: And if somebody would make a motion here to approve September's minutes, they are not on the traffic agenda.

17
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:17,636
[SPEAKER_08]: That's our apologies.

18
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:23,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but the minutes were from, uh, September 9th, I believe is the commission minutes.

19
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:28,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

20
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,979

[SPEAKER_08]: And we're not done with one absent, the minutes have been approved for September 9th.

31
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:57,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And moving forward, I believe you have some new business that we'd like to- I'd like to, Chief, may I take an item out of order?

32
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:58,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, yes.

33
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:11,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Could we take item 2025-65 proposed on street EV charging stations from Brenda Pike so that Brenda can then have the rest of her evening back?

34
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:14,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

35
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

36
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:16,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

37
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:21,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion and seconded by... I'll second.

38
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Chief Covino.

39
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:24,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, Alba.

40
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:25,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

41
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

42
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

43
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

44
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:30,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

45
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:31,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

46
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:32,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Covino?

47
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:33,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

48
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And the motion passed for what happened to move, is it 20-65?

49
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:40,002
[SPEAKER_08]: 20-65.

50
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,284
[SPEAKER_08]: To the first item for new business.

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So Commissioner Hunt, are you speaking on it or?

52
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I know Brenda Pike from my office is here.

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,192
[SPEAKER_22]: She's been managing all the electric vehicle charging stations and she'll be speaking to this item.

54
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:03,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I made Brenda, I made you a call so you can kind of share whatever you need and uh, whatever else you have.

55
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:04,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful.

56
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:09,680
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm just sharing the map of the location that we'll be talking about here.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me know if you can see that.

58
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:12,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

59
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:19,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so at the last traffic commission meeting, there was some negative feedback at the, um,

60
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:26,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Cummings Park and Capon Park locations that we'd proposed for the on-street electric vehicle charging stations.

61
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:36,261
[SPEAKER_19]: So Todd and I went back to the consultants that we were working with and looked at a few other possibilities for locations.

62
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:44,387
[SPEAKER_19]: And what seemed like the best option was this location near 200 Boston Ave.

63
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:55,894
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we're taking the 2 charging stations that would have been at those 2 separate locations and having 2 chart to charging stations at this 1 location instead.

64
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:03,660
[SPEAKER_19]: So they would be between the crosswalk to the start at the driveway here.

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can actually actually, let me share another screen.

66
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,708
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see the actual locations of the charging stations.

67
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, in between the trees there.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:41,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so this shows, um, the 2 charging stations that are an orange here, um, in between the, the trees that are in green.

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:59,529
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it shows the locations of the existing telephone poles in blue, and then the electrical cabinet that would go next to one of those telephone poles across the driveway from the location of the charging stations.

70
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:10,314
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would be four parking spaces here with these two charging stations.

71
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,100
[SPEAKER_22]: So these are kind of this close.

72
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:30,528
[SPEAKER_22]: So the idea of this grant, again, is to serve neighborhoods where people don't necessarily have their own driveways or access to driveways to neighborhoods that are lower income.

73
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Or that have smaller multifamily buildings where people are more likely to be having to park on the street.

74
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:39,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

75
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:47,288
[SPEAKER_22]: And so this is an area that's directly in front of a parking garage that is privately owned for a private building.

76
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:53,430
[SPEAKER_22]: And do you know if they were able to do some outreach on this?

77
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,571
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you put out some flyers at this location?

78
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:57,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

79
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:06,054
[SPEAKER_19]: So we posted signs at the locations where the actual chargers would be and then distributed flyers

80
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:20,277
[SPEAKER_19]: nearby butters, not direct to butters necessarily, but to everyone who is along those couple of blocks there on that street.

81
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:25,262
[SPEAKER_19]: And then a robocall went out to the larger neighborhood.

82
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:32,789
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the green diamonds in the diagram?

83
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:45,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the trees that are there, so part of what we're looking at here was just trying to make sure that we were positioning the charging stations in such a way that it wouldn't damage the roots of the trees.

84
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:52,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you guys do some measurement out in the field as far as where these things actually will sit?

85
00:06:55,455 --> 00:07:05,024
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of one of the things that we were looking at was making sure that there would be enough room on the sidewalk that it would be a compliant.

86
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearances all out of those yellow things bollards.

87
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:15,154
[SPEAKER_19]: There's they're not intended to be bollards at that location is my understanding because of the curve.

88
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:16,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, where are those yellow dots?

89
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Charging stations.

90
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you mean the 2 yellow dots next to each.

91
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:32,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, next to each 1 that just might be a holdover from another proposal that they had put together that had.

92
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Bollards there, but we're not intending to have bollards.

93
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,372
[SPEAKER_19]: There's my understanding because the curb.

94
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:44,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Access that for this and I know you.

95
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Sent this over to engineering for review.

96
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:47,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Did those guys get back to you?

97
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:53,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and what you're seeing here is an edited version of this that reflects.

98
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:58,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Owens feedback on the project.

99
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's enough clearance.

100
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:10,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm presuming there's enough clearance for the crosswalk there that your 4th space, the end of your space bank.

101
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:14,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yes, definitely.

102
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:22,005
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think there's there's room there for five parking spaces, but there's definitely more than more than enough room for four.

103
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the picture showing just three?

104
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,106
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's four cars.

105
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,367
[SPEAKER_06]: See the existing photo in the background is that three cars?

106
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,708
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that is three cars right now.

107
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's four spaces, basically.

108
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,189
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

109
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,430
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can share Google Maps again, because that might be

110
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Clear way to look at it.

111
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:55,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

112
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:05,391
[SPEAKER_19]: So, the charger would be 1 of the charges would be directly in the middle between these 2 trees.

113
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:11,734
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the other 1 would be on the other side of this tree.

114
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:13,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

115
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty of sidewalk there and you're in the furniture zone.

116
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Underground, you're good with the conduits.

117
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's in the street there.

118
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's usually a lot of utilities.

119
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:26,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, yep.

120
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:30,425
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was part of the feedback that Owen had about it.

121
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

122
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

123
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my questions.

124
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:41,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Brenda.

125
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Randy, can I ask a question?

126
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:52,011
[SPEAKER_11]: You said that robo call did it go out to Harris Road, Stoughton, that area?

127
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it in the whole Cape and Park area?

128
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Just curious.

129
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:02,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I don't know the exact sort of the exact streets that it went to.

130
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:07,988
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see if it's in the email where they confirmed it.

131
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:25,390
[SPEAKER_11]: The only reason why I ask is there are a lot of folks who live on Boston Avenue that are not capable of having resident parking on the side streets.

132
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you know, Boston Avenue is a street sweeping street.

133
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:34,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just curious if that had gone out to that particular location.

134
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:42,733
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the information for exactly what streets were included in the robocall.

135
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:52,369
[SPEAKER_19]: I just know it was a larger area than what I had flyered, which was really just on Boston Ave here.

136
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:59,994
[SPEAKER_19]: So I flyered this stretch of Boston Ave from North Street to, what is the side street?

137
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Irvington Road.

138
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:03,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the line.

139
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:04,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

140
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:04,917
Yep.

141
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:05,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

142
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:12,642
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I may, as a reminder, this is the,

143
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:23,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Alternate or compromise location as opposed to the previous 2 locations in the previous meeting closer to keep in park and.

144
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,721
[SPEAKER_15]: The other park, right?

145
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:26,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Brenda.

146
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:30,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and this is partway between the 2 locations.

147
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:36,948
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're since you're in Google maps, can you just zoom out a little bit so that those of us on the call and then you can just point down there.

148
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,190
[SPEAKER_22]: There's Cape and park just came on the screen.

149
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,492
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's Cummings up above.

150
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,073
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is kind of in between the 2.

151
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:52,062
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes sense to me as a location.

152
00:11:54,865 --> 00:12:04,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it definitely doesn't interfere with the business there because anybody who's there for the Cummings properties is going to be parking in their parking garage or their surface parking.

153
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,370
[SPEAKER_22]: There would never be a reason for them to be using the street.

154
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:15,173
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've observed that this area, I mean, I've been in that area a bunch and street parking is lightly used.

155
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:19,795
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds like, Todd, were you saying that on street sweeping days people park

156
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:28,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't it that when Boston Ave gets street sweeping, then people from Boston can park on the permit roads on the sides for that one night?

157
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:32,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Or maybe it was Jim that knew that.

158
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,329
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one side at a time.

159
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:37,530
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one side at a time.

160
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it was Larry.

161
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:40,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

162
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

163
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Park on one side of the street on one night and another side.

164
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:51,775
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other side, you might be thinking of, you might be thinking of snow emergencies and there's a snow emergency.

165
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,456
[SPEAKER_03]: They can park on the permit streets.

166
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I have a question.

167
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,124
[SPEAKER_10]: In a case go in the future, if it becomes an issue for overnight type street sweeping.

168
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:12,001
[SPEAKER_10]: can we allow the residents to park there for the overnight situation only and block those spots where they're less likely to be abused?

169
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,842
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only a two hour limit for the use of those, right?

170
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:28,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the future, if it becomes an issue for us, would we be able to allow, we put a restriction there so on those certain nights residents can park there and block those four spots if needed.

171
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that would that would be an option there.

172
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:43,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, the, the requirements of the grant that we have for this, um, they're, they just require that the spaces be reserved for electric vehicles for 12 hours a day.

173
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,771
[SPEAKER_19]: So, if it does become an issue, we have some flexibility.

174
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, they're already be restricted for street sweeping for whatever night boss and not get swept.

175
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:58,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that restriction exists and then it's a snow route to so.

176
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:05,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, to what it's worth, I just figured those would automatically still be in play.

177
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I'm in favor of this location.

178
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,584
[SPEAKER_22]: I. At the benefit of a preview of it, so.

179
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:27,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think we should see if there's any public comments because there was a lot of public comment on the last one.

180
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:34,673
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I could motion to approve pending public comment, but I'd rather and actually, I think it would be better if somebody else motions because it's from my office.

181
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:35,534
Yeah.

182
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:36,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

183
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:37,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

184
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if the commissioners are all.

185
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:56,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So with any questions, if there's anybody in the public that would like to speak against this, if you could raise your hand and or type in the chat, if you're not allowed to raise, or if you're not able to raise your hand, please do so now.

186
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:57,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can kind of.

187
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none in the public with their hand raised, or I can't see the chat right now, so let me just.

188
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,165
[SPEAKER_22]: There's nothing in the chat.

189
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we got 1 hand.

190
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:18,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

191
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:29,751
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's no, if there's no public feedback, then I make a motion.

192
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,331
[SPEAKER_08]: There's somebody raised there.

193
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You have somebody right now that has their hand raised Nina.

194
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,472
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just going to ask you to unmute.

195
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:38,898
[SPEAKER_08]: obviously you're spot on, so.

196
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ask you to unmute and then you're free to speak.

197
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can you hear me?

198
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought we were motioned in favor.

199
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I misunderstood.

200
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that, sorry?

201
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:56,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was raising hands in favor.

202
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,884
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get to the in favor or just against right now.

203
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,765
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're more than happy to see if there was anybody against.

204
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:06,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to have you speak on behalf of it.

205
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,466
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the motions in favor.

206
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:09,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So speak now.

207
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,168
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to re-unmute her again.

208
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:16,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, usually we just take public comment.

209
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,289
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't take comments for and against.

210
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,530
[SPEAKER_22]: We just take public comment.

211
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:24,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I have no comment.

213
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I misunderstood.

00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:27,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

215
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my fault.

216
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:28,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

217
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,308

[SPEAKER_08]: For a pass with a four vote yes and then one is absent.

232
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,780
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion has been approved.

233
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to.

234
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:14,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the 275-70 permit parking variant.

235
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Melissa Bowden 201 Riverside Ave.

236
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's on here.

237
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to ask you on mute and then

238
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:34,512
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have you speak on the parking there.

239
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:37,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I'm actually on here with my landlord.

240
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:47,820
[SPEAKER_21]: I think she's gonna start it off explaining the situation and then I can kind of add on and show the Google Maps and what it looks like and everything to explain further.

241
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can pull up Google Maps for you here.

242
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,683
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way, I'm not sure if you're able to share.

243
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,726
[SPEAKER_21]: I should be able to.

244
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:02,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, she just told me she can't unmute, so I can explain this.

245
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I can have her unmute.

246
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,633
[SPEAKER_08]: What's her name under?

247
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:09,315
[SPEAKER_21]: Jing, J-I-N-G.

248
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,677
[SPEAKER_21]: She should be on the call.

249
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I think she's unmuted.

250
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm here.

251
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me?

252
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, good evening.

253
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:21,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

254
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:35,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I think Melissa can share or maybe you guys can help share the screen where so the property address that we're discussing today is 201 Riverside Avenue.

255
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,391
[SPEAKER_12]: As you all know, Riverside is a public street, right?

256
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:45,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So we cannot like that street is just like two sides of traffic and we cannot.

257
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,173
[SPEAKER_12]: park any car there.

258
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:54,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have this property where I rented out two units and we have six tenants living there.

259
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:03,022
[SPEAKER_12]: The parking that we have on the house is not big enough to accommodate six cars.

260
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:09,406
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do have tenants like Melissa and she has to deal with the parking herself.

261
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:10,186
[SPEAKER_12]: And

262
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:20,852
[SPEAKER_12]: In the past, you know, we're able to park in the ship Avenue, which is like one street behind this, and she never had any issue.

263
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:31,897
[SPEAKER_12]: But this this year, starting from the summer, she start getting like parking ticket because ship Avenue is permit enforced and.

264
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:45,090
[SPEAKER_12]: So after that, you know, like she has been really struggling on finding the parking space and we have got in touch with the parking office and traffic commissioner book times.

265
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:50,936
[SPEAKER_12]: They recommend us to look into the marine street, which is the street that intersect with.

266
00:19:51,577 --> 00:20:11,642
[SPEAKER_12]: the riverside but marine street only have four parking space so often of a time you know like it's occupied so it's very hard to find like any additional parking and then there's also instance where melissa park her car there and then she got a parking ticket even though the space is not permit enforced

267
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:17,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are kind of stuck here where it's really hard to find any parking stop nearby.

268
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:30,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we are asking is just like to for us to be able to apply for a variance parking permit in the ship Avenue, because that's the one that's closest to the house.

269
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:35,966
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's very, there's like a lot of parking space on that street.

270
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think Melissa will be.

271
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,109
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, have hard time finding any space there.

272
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so that's basically, you know, what we are asking.

273
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,872
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will let Melissa to add any additional details.

274
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, Melissa.

275
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Just I'm not sure I'm mute.

276
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this blue house to a one for you?

277
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, yes, that blue one on the left right there.

278
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:59,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I just it's to the commissioners.

279
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,879
[SPEAKER_08]: If I go any further for, uh, up Riverside Ave.

280
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:03,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't represent the

281
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:12,534
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to look at the satellite view of the whole street up above, that might be a little easier, not the street view.

282
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, we'll do the satellite view.

283
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:16,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

284
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:20,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Because then you can also see Marine Street and Ship Ave, what we're talking about.

285
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

286
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,983
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, if you zoom in a little bit.

287
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, so yeah, that's where I live at 201.

288
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:31,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Like Jing said,

289
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:36,201
[SPEAKER_21]: parking the driveway we have doesn't accommodate six cars.

290
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:37,761
[SPEAKER_21]: There's six residents.

291
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:43,224
[SPEAKER_21]: So since I moved here in 2023, I've been parking on Ship Ave, that street right behind it.

292
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:55,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had no issues whatsoever until recently I started getting ticketed, even though where I was parking had no signs up saying I couldn't park there on Ship Ave, that street right behind.

293
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,371
[SPEAKER_21]: So I started getting tickets and it was really frustrating trying to find

294
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:04,387
[SPEAKER_21]: any additional side roads to park on.

295
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:08,429
[SPEAKER_21]: There is that little short street Marine Street right off of Riverside on that left side.

296
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:14,573
[SPEAKER_21]: But the only public spots are those first four right at the beginning of Riverside and Marine.

297
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,254
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't park further down on that street.

298
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:22,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's like my only option right now is those if there's those four spots available.

299
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:31,403
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, I'm requesting a variance permit for ship app because that street has a lot of available

300
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:32,902
[SPEAKER_21]: spots on the street.

301
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:39,323
[SPEAKER_21]: I've noticed that the actual residents of Ship Ave have their own driveways, or they tend to park on the left side.

302
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,344
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a very long street.

303
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,164
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a one-way street.

304
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, there's condos further down on Ship Ave.

305
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,865
[SPEAKER_21]: They have a huge parking lot for them and visitor parking.

306
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:53,866
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't think that I would be taking any spot from an actual resident of Ship Ave by parking there.

307
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:57,706
[SPEAKER_21]: And it would solve my very frustrating problem.

308
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:01,467
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would very much appreciate a permit.

309
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:13,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief, if I could just comment, and Alva can ship out, obviously, as permanent parking, but there are no signs from the boat club or yacht club after.

310
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Alva is working on it to have more signs put up.

311
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah.

312
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:24,224
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because I was getting tickets when there were no signs there, and that was frustrating, but yeah.

313
00:23:29,937 --> 00:23:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, you are a co-host, so you can believe on yourself.

314
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all set, Sarah?

315
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

316
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there are more signs on Ship Ave now.

317
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe and his crew put them up recently after a couple of requests from the condo people.

318
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:55,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just know the entirety of Ship Ave is now signed.

319
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:56,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

320
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:58,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

321
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:05,580
[SPEAKER_22]: So actually, um, since we have Sarah, um, I just wanted to clarify.

322
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,841
[SPEAKER_22]: So she's looking at ship out because that's on her side of the street, I assume.

323
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:14,083
[SPEAKER_22]: And she doesn't have to cross Riverside to get there.

324
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:19,405
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but I actually didn't realize there was any permit parking in this area.

325
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:27,488
[SPEAKER_22]: And so maybe we should understand, um, about the parking across the street on park street and Thatcher and, um,

326
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:36,167
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether what would be the problem with just parking over there where it's allowed, although I do recognize you have to cross.

327
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:41,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, so I'd have to cross the road and also I work late at night.

328
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,690
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to be walking in the dark alone across the street.

329
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, those streets tend to be pretty busy from what I've.

330
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:56,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Observed and ship have there is literally like, never any cars really parked on that actual street.

331
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:08,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have tried to, you know, park in the sorry, I forgot the name of the street, but the street that you're talking about, I've only been there a couple of times in the evening, it's very busy.

332
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:14,385
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have to definitely walk sometimes, like few blocks to find a parking space.

333
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:22,287
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it is like, you know, for safety reasons, unsafe during late night, and then in the winter, if there's like, snow,

334
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:35,074
[SPEAKER_22]: I can agree that it may be at night crossing Riverside might not feel safe.

335
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,436
[SPEAKER_22]: I will tell you that Medford is very safe.

336
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,717
[SPEAKER_22]: And so you shouldn't be worried about personal safety.

337
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:43,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I make no promises around the cars.

338
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

339
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:55,505
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, like I said, ship out, I've never observed it being really busy.

340
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,406
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never seen it completely full.

341
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:00,989
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe I would be taking any spots from an actual resident.

342
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,770
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, the condos, they have a huge parking lot.

343
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,410
[SPEAKER_21]: They also have the visitor parking across the street on Ship Ave.

344
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,312
[SPEAKER_21]: The actual residents, which I've spoke to and they know me by name, they all park on the left side of that street.

345
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:20,393
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just be taking out one tiny little spot and it would really help me and I would appreciate it.

346
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something you're already doing.

347
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:32,053
[SPEAKER_21]: It's something I've been doing since, um, up until from December 1st, 2023 until about a month or two ago when I started getting ticketed.

348
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:36,276
[SPEAKER_21]: And then now, as Sarah said, there's signs up saying that it's all permit parking.

349
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:48,344
[SPEAKER_21]: So I haven't, I've been trying my luck with Marine street and hoping that I can keep a spot in those four little spots that are available, but, um, it's very frustrating.

350
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:58,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, public comments, public comments.

351
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:05,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, um.

352
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:10,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah.

353
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so just, I mean, acting as a member of the public who is not on the commission, but it gets, I get frequent emails from residents on ship Avenue about vehicles parking on their street that are not residents.

354
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:29,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten C, click fixes more than a couple of times a week in the last 2 months.

355
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say.

356
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,849
[SPEAKER_03]: About this vehicle and that vehicle also just.

357
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think we need to use some caution considering that.

358
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:52,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Unit 201 is 1 of 1 to at least 10, 15 residences between Maverick street and Marine street that all might face similar circumstances.

359
00:27:52,939 --> 00:28:02,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we let 1 person on to ship out, who's to say that we won't get requests from all the other cars that park on ship Avenue that they then complain to me about.

360
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:10,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's just 1 car now, but there are multiple cars that I get complaints about.

361
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them just looking at their citations when they're tied in a lot of them are residents of Riverside Avenue.

362
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my 2 cents.

363
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:24,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know you guys on the commission take that into consideration, setting a precedent for the future.

364
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,765
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to say that I do get frequent complaints from ship Avenue residents about vehicles parking there that do not live on ship Avenue.

365
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:41,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we understand, but I think to Melissa's point, Sheff Avenue is never like very busy, right?

366
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's never full at all.

367
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,203
[SPEAKER_21]: There's so many, so many, so many spaces.

368
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:49,124
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a long road.

369
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:52,125
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never seen it completely full.

370
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:55,527
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, I've never had any issues until recently.

371
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,850
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just think it would make sense.

372
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:20,686
[SPEAKER_22]: So when we were doing all the public meetings for the Clipper Ship Connector, which I assume everybody on the commission is aware goes right through there along Ship Ave and along the river, one of the big concerns that the neighbors had was that people would come and park there in order to access the park and the path.

373
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:30,129
[SPEAKER_22]: That may have been why, I don't remember when permit parking was put in there, but that was one of their big concerns was that

374
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:36,438
[SPEAKER_22]: people would crowd the street, they'd never be able to find their own parking, because people would come to use the path.

375
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:41,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that's why it's getting enforced now.

376
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I could understand thinking that, but I've never seen it busy at all.

377
00:29:50,462 --> 00:29:58,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, I would just really appreciate a permit

378
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, either Todd, Sarah, or police units.

379
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys see for capacity on Ship Avenue?

380
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm being told by Ms.

381
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:13,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowden that there's plenty of room.

382
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:17,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that match your experience or is it something different?

383
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:19,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that familiar with the street.

384
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:23,739
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to go on the Google Maps too and go on the actual Ship Avenue, maybe you can

385
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you a heads up.

386
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to hear the other folks' experiences.

387
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:49,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there recently to check on the signs and such, and it does usually have quite a few spaces available on Ship Ave, but I'll tell you, I have a friend who lives at 25 Park Street, and I'm there usually on Tuesdays when I'm not here, because we go for a walk on the Clippership Connector, and it also frequently has more than adequate street parking.

388
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:50,994
[SPEAKER_03]: on Park Street.

389
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:55,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my anecdotal experience from those two streets.

390
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:57,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So not just Shabab.

391
00:30:57,118 --> 00:31:04,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Shabab has adequate parking because they have permits required and we've been enforcing because the residents request it quite frequently.

392
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:09,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And Park Street, I park there myself.

393
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had trouble finding a space from 25 Park Street down to Riverside.

394
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:19,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's 4.30 in the afternoon.

395
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:20,999
[SPEAKER_03]: That I'm going over there.

396
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think we're talking about late evening.

397
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:27,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So the experience could be a little bit different here.

398
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:29,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

399
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:41,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, even though, like, you can grant us something, say, this permit is only working in after, like, say, I don't know what time 1, at least to get back home.

400
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:43,238
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that will be really appreciated.

401
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,490
[SPEAKER_06]: or even like Jordan Larry, what about you guys?

402
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of your officers?

403
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,672
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys experience?

404
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,414
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sergeant Kavino.

405
00:31:53,454 --> 00:32:02,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So to Sarah's point, there are a lot of people or a handful of people who don't have permits that have been parking on ship and we have been enforcing that.

406
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:08,226
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's also seems to be abundant parking on ship.

407
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:13,550
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go down there any time of night or during the day, there's there's plenty of street parking.

408
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, to Sarah's point,

409
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:22,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Park Street and the streets on the other side of Riverside Ave that aren't permanent parking do have abundant parking as well.

410
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:22,756
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

411
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

412
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's lots of parking available around here.

413
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:30,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's other, granted, there are people who live in those other apartments for sure.

414
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:31,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I get that.

415
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the answer to the question, and I doubt anybody does.

416
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:36,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there room for all of them?

417
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:37,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

418
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:43,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we try not to set precedents, but at the same time, we're not bound to any precedent that we set.

419
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:48,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

420
00:32:48,373 --> 00:33:03,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we could do a count on the different times of day and night, how many cars we see down there, how many vacant spots we see, and then we could accommodate a certain number of additional resident parking.

421
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:09,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not everybody on Riverside Ave suddenly decide, oh, I'm going to go park.

422
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get a variance and park on ship Ave.

423
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:17,468
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think what's most relevant is actually the nighttime.

424
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:24,454
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, that is actually the most relevant, because it is true that a lot of people take their cars and leave during the day.

425
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:31,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and like I said, I get back from work super late, sometimes at like 2-3am.

426
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,603
[SPEAKER_21]: And everyone's parked in a spot.

427
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,966
[SPEAKER_21]: So I, it's a struggle.

428
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:41,148
[SPEAKER_21]: And especially with winter coming, it's gonna get dark way earlier.

429
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:41,609
[SPEAKER_21]: And

430
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:49,163
[SPEAKER_21]: As a female, I don't want to be walking any super long distance alone at night just to get back to my house.

431
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:56,350
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd rather stick to where I've been familiar with and this would just really, really help me.

432
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we heard you.

433
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd, what do you have to say?

434
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:04,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to ruin the moment.

435
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:04,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

436
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:08,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Anecdotally, in the daytime, I agree with Space.

437
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't say for sure at nighttime.

438
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:15,559
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I wanted to comment on, because we've talked about precedent, is consistency.

439
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:18,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not arguing for or against them.

440
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just bringing something up that I've noticed at other meetings.

441
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:28,450
[SPEAKER_15]: This commission has approved similar situations on Winthrop Street, a street that doesn't have any on-street parking.

442
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:41,777
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I think last month, this commission may have approved a variance for someone on Main Street, near Summerville, from the major, and that street does have on-street parking.

443
00:34:41,817 --> 00:34:46,920
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would say Riverside's pretty similar to the Winthrop Street section with no parking on either side.

444
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:54,596
[SPEAKER_15]: So whatever has been consistent in the past, that's what I would just throw that out there to remind folks.

445
00:34:55,497 --> 00:35:02,960
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing that's sort of relevant about the Winthrop Street one is that we made a big deal about wanting them to be parking on the same side they were living on.

446
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,903
[SPEAKER_22]: But the big difference there was that there was no crosswalk for quite a distance.

447
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:16,180
[SPEAKER_22]: between that home and where they would have, we would be basically condoning them jaywalking.

448
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:33,815
[SPEAKER_22]: There is in fact a real crosswalk at this location, but we did express a preference for having people to park on the side street on the same side as their home so that we weren't pushing more people to be crossing the very busy roads, particularly in the middle of the night.

449
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a motion from the commissioners?

450
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm motion to approve.

451
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:41,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, second.

452
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:44,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

453
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowdoin.

454
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a roll call.

455
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:47,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

456
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:48,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

457
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:49,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

458
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:50,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

459
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

460
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:53,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

461
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Covino?

462
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:55,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

463
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:55,928
[SPEAKER_11]: 4-0.

464
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:04,573
[SPEAKER_13]: When absent, the motion passes.

465
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:09,296
[SPEAKER_22]: And Melissa, it looks like your landlord is not on the call anymore.

466
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:23,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you just make sure that she's aware that this kind of permit is for you, it's not for everybody in your building, and if she rents to somebody else, they would have to come back for it?

467
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:24,503
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay, yeah.

468
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:26,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much, by the way, everyone.

469
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,205
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate it.

470
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:30,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that go into effect immediately so I can

471
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you can, you can come by the permit.

472
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, as soon as we're open tomorrow, I'm going to put you on the variance list.

473
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you stop by as early as tomorrow, 830, you can buy the past from my office and you'll be good to go.

474
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:46,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

475
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,513
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

476
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:47,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone.

477
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:48,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

478
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:54,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, moving on 2025 7, 1, permit parking variance Nina.

479
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:00,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Barcomani, 292 Boston Ave.

480
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:03,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Is your petitioner here?

481
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

482
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm here.

483
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:13,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I am requesting a similar variance to the previous Ms.

484
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:13,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowden.

485
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:18,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on 292 Boston Ave.

486
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not check the Google Maps.

487
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think to do that, but I am situated between

488
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:34,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Winthrop and Piggott, and I am requesting a variance to park, ideally on Piggott.

489
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:41,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on the right side of, or on the even side of the street for street sweeping.

490
00:37:42,162 --> 00:38:03,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've found since moving here in August that during street sweeping, specifically Monday and Tuesday, there isn't consistently enough room to park on the opposite side of the street for street sweeping, which has led me to need to park either in a parking lot further down the street, about a 10-minute walk, or to park

491
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,287
[SPEAKER_02]: much further down the street in order to secure parking.

492
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:14,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a similar work situation where I'm leaving my house at about 5 a.m.

493
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:18,757
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's very dark and arriving again at about 7 or 8 p.m.

494
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:19,758
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the day.

495
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:28,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, yeah, often when I arrive home there isn't parking available anywhere near my house.

496
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:42,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm okay with walking, but I think more than anything, what I would like is to just know that I will have a consistent place to park that's, you know, ideally within a 10 minute walk would be nice.

497
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:51,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have to be, I guess if I'm requesting a variance, it would just be a permit variance that isn't specific to time.

498
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:55,047
[SPEAKER_02]: But the biggest issue is on street sweeping days, either Monday or Tuesday.

499
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna, do you have a particular street you'd like to park on?

500
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:01,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Piggott.

501
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:03,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Piggott?

502
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:03,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Piggott Road.

503
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:07,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, open that up to commissioners' comments.

504
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,245
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you looking like for capacity on that road?

505
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:26,095
[SPEAKER_02]: The residents on the left side there typically have one or two cars, and occasionally there are a few student vehicles there, but there's always at least one or two spots on the right side.

506
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:29,941
[SPEAKER_02]: before the dog leg.

507
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I could also park further down, too.

508
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,524
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be completely fine.

509
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:34,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

510
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:35,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Nina.

511
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have been more specific.

512
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:43,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mostly speaking to my colleagues when I ask the question and staff as well.

513
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:53,858
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as there's parking on both sides of Pickett Road, it looks like there should be adequate parking.

514
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:58,933
[SPEAKER_10]: stretch with the trees there where there are no houses.

515
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:01,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

516
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:04,736
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have some driveways there, I'm seeing.

517
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:07,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's posted, no parking though.

518
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:10,180
[SPEAKER_10]: There are driveways that most of those houses get though, yeah.

519
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:25,088
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just reviewing that the one sign I can see from Street View on Piggott does say, permit parking both sides of the street.

520
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:31,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's supposed to be no parking anywhere other than the park.

521
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,371
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm only seeing one.

522
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:37,335
[SPEAKER_22]: I've only so far found one sign for the entire street in my perusal here.

523
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:44,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just more concerned with that stretch where the trees are along the tracks, if it's wide enough to park houses on both sides of the street.

524
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:50,284
[SPEAKER_22]: That actually looks wider than the park that has houses on both sides.

525
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:51,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

526
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I see at least one driveway.

527
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you pan down the street a little bit?

528
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:57,330
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got driveways.

529
00:41:00,455 --> 00:41:04,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it street parking, some driveways?

530
00:41:04,938 --> 00:41:05,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

531
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in favor of this.

532
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why not.

533
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just get clarified?

534
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:21,688
[SPEAKER_22]: So the rule is when there is no parking for street sweeping on one side of the street, there's just this expectation that everybody will just find parking on the other side of the street that night?

535
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:23,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems so.

536
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:24,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

537
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,652
[SPEAKER_22]: That must be dated.

538
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:28,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

539
00:41:33,008 --> 00:41:39,493
[SPEAKER_06]: As I understand it though, you also don't actively ticket, or we don't actively ticket on the side streets on those nights either.

540
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:42,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we understand that there's some overflow.

541
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:45,097
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

542
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:46,759
[SPEAKER_02]: May I comment?

543
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,104
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience, the tickets happen on street sweeping.

544
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

545
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they do?

546
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:56,186
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

547
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:58,288
[SPEAKER_10]: On the streets.

548
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:03,755
[SPEAKER_10]: side streets.

549
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:10,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the police department, we don't go out looking for that at late at night in response to calls.

550
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:23,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about the parking department, if they have anyone overnight that makes that, but that's what Tim was referring to.

551
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:27,067
[SPEAKER_11]: May I ask a question of Todd?

552
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:31,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we know what the capacity of parking is on Pivot Road?

553
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't necessarily know if I need.

554
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:43,203
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be ending November 1st anyways.

555
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it comes back in the spring.

556
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Jim's question.

557
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:57,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have any numbers on that, but I would say my opinion on this situation is Boston have.

558
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:04,055
[SPEAKER_15]: This has on street parking on, like, the last situation and it's unrestricted.

559
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:06,356
[SPEAKER_15]: It has unrestricted parking.

560
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:22,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there was a problem finding parking on Boston Ave itself, then anyone on those streets could petition for resident permit parking to limit the competition instead of immediately going to the side streets that have residents.

561
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:24,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

562
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:32,889
[SPEAKER_15]: And then in terms of streets, even in snow plowing, just like designing a parking lot for a mall, you don't design for the worst case scenario.

563
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:42,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Although streets we've been snow plowing do have issues with parking, that's only, you know, maybe 10 times a year out of 365 days.

564
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:48,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes, you know, maybe on some outages it's more, but it's not the normal situation.

565
00:43:52,514 --> 00:43:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

566
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:56,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so then there's, um,

567
00:43:58,123 --> 00:44:02,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So is the issue that there's not enough parking on Boston Avenue available for you?

568
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm talking to the petitioner now.

569
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically on those nights, yes.

570
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really a consistency problem.

571
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:14,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there is parking, and sometimes there isn't.

572
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to walk a good 10 minutes.

573
00:44:17,515 --> 00:44:22,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all the way down at Whole Foods by that point to get back to my house.

574
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So there often is, but it's really a consistency problem.

575
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah.

576
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:43,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just to chime in, like, I did for ship out.

577
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not 1 that we get a lot of complaints about.

578
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:52,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that I'm consistently hearing from residents saying, get over here and enforce.

579
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:53,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have.

580
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:56,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Based only on that adequate space.

581
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:02,425
[SPEAKER_03]: More so, I mean, ship out to 2, but they were more, maybe a little more territorial.

582
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

583
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:04,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But.

584
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:13,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I will say too, if you go too low on Boston Ave, like if you go below 195, you end up in Somerville.

585
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:22,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a possibility too that people moving their cars for Medford street sweeping may end up in Somerville by accident and then get a Somerville ticket.

586
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:30,155
[SPEAKER_03]: But also I wanted to clarify that we do still enforce, we have one overnight parking control specialist who works

587
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: starting at 3 a.m., and he's not changing his route based on street sweeping.

588
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will enforce permit parking overnight still during street sweeping, even if the streets are adjacent to those being swept.

589
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:46,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear on that, because it seemed like it was not clear.

590
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:52,578
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, not a lot of feedback from residents of Piggott, so that's my two cents on that.

591
00:45:55,188 --> 00:46:01,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just like to add this area in particular, because it's in Hillside, sort of close to Somerville.

592
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:11,715
[SPEAKER_15]: It's similar to the main street situation that was described in my mind last month, because their main arteries in residential areas that are unrestricted.

593
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:13,856
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot of competition.

594
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:22,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyone that doesn't want to pay a Somerville permit, or has an out of state, you know, or has a plate situation that they don't want to change the insurance to garage and Medford or Somerville.

595
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,242
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, they're all going to Boston Ave, so a way to fix that in our toolbox is to make it residential.

596
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:41,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Or in a lot of major arteries in cities like ours, they'll have two-hour park in daytime, except by permit, resident permit, and then that kind of limits the competition.

597
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,184
[SPEAKER_15]: during non-business hours.

598
00:46:44,564 --> 00:47:00,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it almost seems like a better way to go, Todd, as far as dealing with this issue, because it doesn't have regulated parking now, so eliminating some of the competition for, what's her name, Miss Quattromonte on Boston Avenue.

599
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:08,975
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different way of looking at the solution and granting a variance, but anyway.

600
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:13,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how other commissioners feel about that.

601
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:20,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Boston Avenue need some residential permit parking instead of granting variances?

602
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:24,991
[SPEAKER_22]: It would come into the next zone that we're talking about.

603
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,893
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that, so I'm of two minds here.

604
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:37,137
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think we should just put off this residence problem because I think we're going to solve this in the next six months to a year.

605
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:40,909
[SPEAKER_22]: But it could take us a full year before we do.

606
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:48,110
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is the area that we are talking about with having one of the next rounds of doing a zoned parking.

607
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:53,031
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we did zoned parking, I think we would include Boston Ave with exactly what we're describing here.

608
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:57,212
[SPEAKER_22]: And that would solve her problems.

609
00:47:57,312 --> 00:48:03,453
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'd hate to see her have to get tickets and walk 20 minutes, more than 10 minutes late at night.

610
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,023
[SPEAKER_22]: while we spend a year doing that.

611
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:12,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Because to do the public process right, it takes at least six months.

612
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:15,047
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not just that we're slow.

613
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:19,390
[SPEAKER_22]: It's that we want to really need to approach it and do a good public process.

614
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:21,151
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good point.

615
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes it less important for us, I guess, because we've got to dispose of it at that point anyway.

616
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:25,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

617
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:34,240
[SPEAKER_22]: And at which point, her permit would then, of course, be valid because it would allow the regional and she'd be able to park on Piggott under the new system.

618
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

619
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,663
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm in favor of this one.

620
00:48:37,683 --> 00:48:39,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.

621
00:48:39,845 --> 00:48:41,085
[SPEAKER_22]: We already have a motion.

622
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:41,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim.

623
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,206
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

624
00:48:42,326 --> 00:48:43,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody motion to approve.

625
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,248
[SPEAKER_13]: We can open it up to the public first.

626
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:46,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, did I?

627
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:49,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to reinforce my motion.

628
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:50,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Bold.

629
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:57,455
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, do we have a motion?

630
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:01,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll file a motion.

631
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:03,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Give granted.

632
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody, I'll second.

633
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:13,616
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

634
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:15,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

635
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:15,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

636
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:17,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

637
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:18,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

638
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:19,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

639
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:21,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

640
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Covino?

641
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:23,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

642
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes 4-0 with one absent.

643
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:30,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Nina, you're all set.

644
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:31,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

645
00:49:32,322 --> 00:49:33,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Sarah, is she going to see you?

646
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she's on the variance list.

647
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:45,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And if she stops by our office anytime during City Hall business hours, you can purchase a permit, a permit variance for bigger roads.

648
00:49:46,413 --> 00:49:48,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, am I able to do that digitally?

649
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:49,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do I need to show up in person?

650
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:54,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, variances are not available for purchase online, you have to stop by the office.

651
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll be there on Thursday.

652
00:49:56,399 --> 00:49:57,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

653
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

654
00:50:00,868 --> 00:50:07,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on 2025-72 permanent parking variance, Edward Freeland, 343 Main Street.

655
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Edward available?

656
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see him on here.

657
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Edward Freeland?

658
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:30,710
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we want to table and come back to this in case he joins us?

659
00:50:33,311 --> 00:50:38,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, is somebody able to have the map of permit parking available when we look at this one?

660
00:50:38,475 --> 00:50:40,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just looking to see if I had a copy on my desk.

661
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:44,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I believe it's the G zone.

662
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It's between Princeton and Bowdoin.

663
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:47,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I correct?

664
00:50:47,562 --> 00:50:50,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

665
00:50:50,123 --> 00:50:50,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

666
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:56,234
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a copy of that.

667
00:50:56,434 --> 00:51:02,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike the Boston Ave situation, Main Street folks are in fact in the location of the G-Zone.

668
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:12,567
[SPEAKER_11]: We issued, I believe, the next door neighbor a few months ago a variance for the G-Zone.

669
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,256
[SPEAKER_22]: But main street itself is not in the zone.

670
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I'm not looking for, you know.

671
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:24,418
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're on that side of the Princeton and Bowdoin, Yale.

672
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:25,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she's.

673
00:51:25,658 --> 00:51:31,040
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so this is.

674
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,129
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, a new point where he could park anyway he wants.

675
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,190
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he can't.

676
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,051
[SPEAKER_22]: He's not in the zone.

677
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,632
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought he was on the G zone.

678
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:46,073
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on the side of the G zone on those streets.

679
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,515
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were to move the variance to they are G zone streets.

680
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:57,818
[SPEAKER_10]: There is someone there on.

681
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm here for the road permit.

682
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:00,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

683
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:00,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

684
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:01,542
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to you.

685
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:02,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

686
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:02,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

687
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:04,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

688
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:09,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Did he say he'd be.

689
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent him an email.

690
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:29,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

691
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm here.

692
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,499
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's yours.

693
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:31,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt.

694
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:32,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's on.

695
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on mute.

696
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So I asked.

697
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We have issued variance to the house aside.

698
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:48,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Household wasn't transferred to their cell phone number.

699
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:48,924
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a household.

700
00:52:48,964 --> 00:52:50,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I must have transferred to their cell.

701
00:52:51,124 --> 00:52:51,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

702
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

703
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:52,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

704
00:52:58,979 --> 00:53:27,312
[SPEAKER_07]: never going to know do we want to table this yeah it says you have to be here to pass it or should we just table it do we place on the file the table no you wouldn't place it on file you'd have to give them a chance to come to the next meeting okay okay so table

705
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:31,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, one month table until we can contact them.

706
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:32,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Table to the next meeting.

707
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,291
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, councillors, I have a motion to table this.

708
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:40,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I will not be able to get ahold of Edwin till the November meeting.

709
00:53:49,555 --> 00:53:55,157
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm inclined to table it unless he shows up in this meeting later, I would take it back off the table.

710
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:59,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I do, you know, we have to, why is he using the parking in this house?

711
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:06,055
[SPEAKER_22]: I assume he's not allowed, but, and we don't have an email on this, do we?

712
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:09,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I didn't, I don't remember everything that was in the packet we were sent.

713
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have an email on him?

714
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:14,463
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have an email address for him?

715
00:54:14,703 --> 00:54:14,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

716
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:19,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Edward Freeland.

717
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,825
[SPEAKER_22]: We have an email from him.

718
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:22,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Recently moved in.

719
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,668
[SPEAKER_22]: This makes me ineligible for residential permit parking.

720
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:27,409
[SPEAKER_22]: Parking, right.

721
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:28,549
[SPEAKER_22]: So we all have this email.

722
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:30,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Parking for my home is not practical.

723
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:35,873
[SPEAKER_22]: There is a bus stop directly there, and the nearby spaces are limited to short-term convenience store parking.

724
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:44,478
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to request your guidance on how I might apply for an exemption that would allow me to park on Princeton Street or an alternative nearby with a residential parking permit.

725
00:54:47,138 --> 00:54:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: He was emailed an invitation to this meeting from Alva and a letter with his options to send a letter in or electronically attend the Zoom meeting or send a letter in to us.

726
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,871
[SPEAKER_10]: He hasn't sent the letter, right?

727
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:06,174
[SPEAKER_10]: The only letter I have is his request for the appearance.

728
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:12,460
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would say we table this until either he shows up tonight or we address it the next meeting.

729
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:20,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I think somebody may reach out to him and explain that he has to come to the meeting to help us understand the situation.

730
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia, you making a motion?

731
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:26,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, she did.

732
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:28,046
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll motion to table it.

733
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:28,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Second?

734
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:29,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second.

735
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:30,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief Covino?

736
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:32,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Alva, roll call vote.

737
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:34,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

738
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:35,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

739
00:55:36,993 --> 00:55:37,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

740
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:38,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

741
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:40,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

742
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:41,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

743
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:42,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Covino?

744
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:43,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

745
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:50,774
[SPEAKER_13]: By vote of 4-0, 1 absent, motion passes.

746
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:58,019
[SPEAKER_13]: 2025-73, permit parking variance, Tom Jennings, 400 Main Street, Apartment 3.

747
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Tom here?

748
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

749
00:56:08,138 --> 00:56:10,080
[SPEAKER_17]: What, what just happened?

750
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, thank you.

751
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:17,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just, I just moved back to the area 400 Medford or 400 Main Street Medford.

752
00:56:17,326 --> 00:56:23,431
[SPEAKER_17]: I lived in Somerville for four years, Cambridge for four years, Arlington for two years.

753
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:31,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, so I, like when I signed up for the lease, I didn't think anything of the parking because I never had a situation like this where it wouldn't be available based on the location.

754
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:36,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and unfortunately the landlord never explains the parking situation.

755
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:44,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, so I'm hoping for an exception in this case, just because I have a job where, um, you know, I'm a lab and facilities manager.

756
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:47,845
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm on call 24 seven.

757
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:52,788
[SPEAKER_17]: So I could get called in for, you know, building emergencies, like a leak or,

758
00:56:53,548 --> 00:57:13,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Safety issues like someone gets hurt And I have been walking, you know, I moved in only a couple weeks ago but on the streets that are adjacent to 400 Main Street, it's Bonner and Alexander I've noticed, you know at night and the morning the same spots and

759
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:14,555
[SPEAKER_17]: are typically available.

760
00:57:14,595 --> 00:57:18,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I've seen like, you know, five or six openings at least on either side.

761
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:22,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And then also, um, you know, like give or take in the surrounding areas.

762
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:30,860
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to explain my situation, see what you guys thought about it and, um, see if you need anything more from me to make a decision off of that.

763
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you commissioners.

764
00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:37,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'd like to ask you a question.

765
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:41,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have parking, off-street parking?

766
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: There seems to be a driveway to the right of your house, looking at the front of your house.

767
00:57:45,344 --> 00:57:49,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and that's the only thing that was explained to me, that I would not have access to that driveway.

768
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:11,118
[SPEAKER_22]: And Jim, again, I don't have the maps, but isn't this, this is, is directly across the street from him is the G zone.

769
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:12,318
[SPEAKER_22]: I need a map.

770
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:13,519
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

771
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:20,782
[SPEAKER_22]: And on his side is one of the areas that are, is under consideration for the next round of zoned permit.

772
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:23,403
[SPEAKER_22]: That's where we talked about making a South Medford zone.

773
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:27,365
[SPEAKER_22]: And in theory, if we did that, his side of main street.

774
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:29,206
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's what I don't understand.

775
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:30,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Why wouldn't,

776
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:40,468
[SPEAKER_22]: The left side, the even side of Main Street be part of the G zone, and then the odd side of Main Street be part of the quote South Medford zone.

777
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,512
[SPEAKER_10]: The other way around, the odd side.

778
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:53,033
[SPEAKER_11]: The G was within the green line proximity.

779
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:55,094
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how they looked at it.

780
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:56,996
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how we sort of adjusted it.

781
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:01,858
[SPEAKER_11]: The other streets are for the secondary, as you mentioned, the South Medford.

782
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:12,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the process was based on either you were East or West, and you would fall within that criteria.

783
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:16,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So those on the West side would be G, those in the others would

784
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:22,069
[SPEAKER_11]: if variants were approved would be on those streets that have got names.

785
00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:32,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah and one other thing to note in these g-zones or any future zone is in this g-zone we kind of did an experiment with two different scenarios.

786
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:43,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Main street is not included as part of the g-zone but part of Medford street is included one side with a three-hour except by permit.

787
00:59:43,736 --> 00:59:46,777
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we were to go forward and include the major streets I would

788
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Think that we would model it after the Medford street portion.

789
00:59:51,582 --> 01:00:01,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Either 2 or 3 hour, except by permit, so businesses could have turnover because right now, the section of main street is unrestricted just like that boss now, except there are some.

790
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:10,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, nail a cautious and some other short term parking, but outside the meter zones, it's essentially unrestricted.

791
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:11,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean.

792
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:12,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

793
01:00:13,178 --> 01:00:23,064
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems to me that if we put the zones in, we would need the properties on main street to be in one zone or another.

794
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:28,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, it wouldn't be fair to them to be like, yeah, but now you can't park anywhere.

795
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,942
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm, I'm good with this one too.

796
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:38,222
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes sense to me.

797
01:00:38,382 --> 01:00:39,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we need to decide.

798
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:42,124
[SPEAKER_22]: So he would not get a G zone parking though.

799
01:00:42,184 --> 01:00:47,567
[SPEAKER_22]: We would, because we're on the same side, it would either be Alexander or Bonner and we would have to choose.

800
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that correct?

801
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:59,634
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and therefore I guess we need, uh, our professionals to weigh in on, um, does one have more space than the other?

802
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:06,159
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be our next step.

803
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,486
[SPEAKER_10]: If we give him the G Zone one, which is across the street, he's got several streets to pick from.

804
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:16,432
[SPEAKER_10]: If we keep him on his side of the street, he's either Bonner or Alexander in that area.

805
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anybody have an idea of how busy those streets are for parking?

806
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:31,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim, I asked a question about Alexander Avenue, the resident parking.

807
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:35,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it only during the day on that stretch from Maine to Willis?

808
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good question.

809
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:39,253
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's overnight.

810
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's overnight.

811
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Jim, it used to be only between 5 PM and 8 PM, but that changed in, it looks like, 2019.

812
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:59,863
[SPEAKER_03]: To, oh, no, I'm sorry 2024. it's the North side from mystic to pierce.

813
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different sections.

814
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not there's none that are just in the morning.

815
01:02:04,365 --> 01:02:08,308
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, it's my block.

816
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:09,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

817
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

818
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:13,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think, yeah, go ahead.

819
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:18,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Alexander closest closest to ground to cafe is not permanent in the daytime.

820
01:02:19,715 --> 01:02:21,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I frequent the area for lunch.

821
01:02:21,897 --> 01:02:23,458
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only nighttime.

822
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:26,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas Barner is full time, I believe.

823
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:32,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And additionally, just both of them, as you get closer to Mystic Ave, become resident or business permit parking.

824
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:37,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So they both have a section that accommodates both types of permits as you get down to Mystic Ave.

825
01:02:39,787 --> 01:02:44,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Gee, if I'd say Barner is more busier than I was in.

826
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:48,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't we look at where him and what's the next one going towards the park there around?

827
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:55,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Maryam and Wareham are both the G-Zone, so it's a little bit different.

828
01:02:55,086 --> 01:03:11,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I will mention as Todd alluded to, when the zones were implemented, the pushback was from the community on Wareham, Maryam, anything close proximity to the business because of the overflow already.

829
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,761
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at Bonner, is that what you said, Bonner?

830
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Bonner's more residential.

831
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:25,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Alexander, you're going to have the overflow also for the residents.

832
01:03:25,265 --> 01:03:25,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

833
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:34,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And he actually has been looking, so he said Bonner and Alexander, there seems to be adequate space for him, so let's just pick one.

834
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

835
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,734
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll pick Bonner.

836
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I said Alexander.

837
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:51,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And can I ask the resident quick question is this you find that parking is during the street sweeping time that becomes problematic.

838
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's a combination of that.

839
01:03:55,628 --> 01:04:00,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I just moved to the area, but it's making sure that I'm properly parked in the area that I'm supposed to be.

840
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:10,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and just not like, you know, parking somewhere I'm not, and that's, you know, whether it's, you know, trying to park on the main street and play the game of like taking up spots in front of the businesses.

841
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:17,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I just want to ensure that like, I'm, I'm where I'm supposed to be and that's okay that I'm allowed to be there.

842
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:30,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a little bit different than what you've experienced from other communities, but we're in the process of doing the zone parking in the more urban parts of Medford.

843
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:39,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, it seems a little disjointed at this point, but again, hopefully, we can put you somewhere where you can park.

844
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That'd be great.

845
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:45,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I said you're not going up to public.

846
01:04:46,422 --> 01:04:47,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any comments?

847
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:47,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a comment.

848
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:53,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

849
01:04:53,758 --> 01:04:55,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anyone's raising their hand.

850
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,640
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

851
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, does the commission is having motion?

852
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:01,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia.

853
01:05:02,183 --> 01:05:02,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you make a motion?

854
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:03,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I would motion.

855
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:05,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, we just need to know which side did.

856
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:07,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I didn't follow that.

857
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:09,448
[SPEAKER_22]: In the end, did we decide that Alexander was better?

858
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I apologize.

859
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:14,604
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't quite process.

860
01:05:14,884 --> 01:05:19,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Alexander is closer than Bonner, I would believe, and might be more practical.

861
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:26,015
[SPEAKER_10]: People are telling us that Alexander is probably a little more space on it.

862
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:33,542
[SPEAKER_22]: So I had motion to give him a permit for Alexander.

863
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I second.

864
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:38,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Alva, roll call roll, please.

865
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:39,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

866
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:40,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

867
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:42,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

868
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:43,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

869
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:45,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

870
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:51,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, with the caveat that we look at the zone option for this particular location.

871
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:57,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief Covino?

872
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:57,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

873
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:00,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Vote for zero.

874
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:04,187
[SPEAKER_13]: One absent, the motion passes.

875
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:11,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom, can you see the parking department at City Hall, and they'll take care of you.

876
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:11,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

877
01:06:12,031 --> 01:06:12,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, guys.

878
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.

879
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:22,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on, 20-25-74, one petition, permit parking 24-7 Pickham Road.

880
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:25,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have someone to speak?

881
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so important.

882
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:29,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

883
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,069
[SPEAKER_07]: That telephone number one, five, six.

884
01:06:32,149 --> 01:06:32,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

885
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:40,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so I did not, um, like sign the per, um, the petition or submit it.

886
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:43,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I I'm a resident of Pinkham road.

887
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:46,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

888
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you have your name and your address please?

889
01:06:49,483 --> 01:06:53,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Jenna Boland, uh, 23 Pinkham road.

890
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:54,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

891
01:06:56,498 --> 01:07:01,354
[SPEAKER_07]: petition because the petition was presented before she moved into that home.

892
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:11,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but I reached out because I was having issues finding parking on my road in the evening.

893
01:07:11,785 --> 01:07:21,590
[SPEAKER_16]: So I tried to get a permit and was told that because it was non-permitted street, I couldn't get a permit, but a petition had already been filed.

894
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:26,313
[SPEAKER_16]: So I am for Pinkham Road being permit only.

895
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

896
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:30,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have anyone else to speak?

897
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:36,963
[SPEAKER_22]: I see Michael Hickey is raising his hand.

898
01:07:41,944 --> 01:07:42,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, unmute.

899
01:07:44,805 --> 01:07:46,425
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you send him the message to unmute?

900
01:07:47,145 --> 01:07:47,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

901
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:48,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

902
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Who are the two people that sent us letters that were against?

903
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:58,807
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a negative?

904
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

905
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I received two letters in opposition.

906
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:02,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Would I go?

907
01:08:02,808 --> 01:08:03,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Names.

908
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:08,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The name is, name's Kathleen Beebe.

909
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else raising their hand for this?

910
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:13,972
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was Andrea Ganji.

911
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:14,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

912
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, this is the gentleman whose name is on the petition.

913
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,434
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

914
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was one of the two people who went around the neighborhood to have people sign the petition.

915
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:32,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank you for allowing me to speak and for also considering our petition for resident sticker parking only.

916
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long while that we've been able to park all the time on our street.

917
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:42,323
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people from Boston have park on our street and from surrounding areas.

918
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:45,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's been very difficult for us to find places to park.

919
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:55,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And the majority of the people on the street would love to see this resident sticker parking only so we know we can have places to park when we come home at night or we get home from our jobs.

920
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:13,764
[SPEAKER_22]: Alva, I saw the message that he sent a petition, but were we, was there a separate email that actually had it or all the signatures or whatever?

921
01:09:13,784 --> 01:09:18,689
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not finding that, but maybe it's just lost in my email.

922
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:20,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't email it.

923
01:09:21,252 --> 01:09:23,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't send the signatures on the petition.

924
01:09:23,794 --> 01:09:24,475
[SPEAKER_07]: You have them though?

925
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:25,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I have them.

926
01:09:25,115 --> 01:09:25,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

927
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:27,470
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

928
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,952
[SPEAKER_22]: So it didn't get scanned in and emailed to us.

929
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:30,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

930
01:09:31,012 --> 01:09:31,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

931
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:36,937
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the third page.

932
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

933
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,620
[SPEAKER_04]: We're told to just drop it off at the police station.

934
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So my partner dropped it off after we completed it.

935
01:09:43,482 --> 01:09:44,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

936
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:52,750
[SPEAKER_15]: She's just talking about the members in the, yeah.

937
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:05,580
[SPEAKER_22]: So could we get some information from the police station about, you know, how many people signed the petition?

938
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:11,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Are they, you know, represent how many house, how many addresses on the street?

939
01:10:11,303 --> 01:10:17,307
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what we usually look to see if there's at least 50% of the street is signed on to something like this in the past.

940
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:18,748
[SPEAKER_10]: We have 18 signatures.

941
01:10:18,868 --> 01:10:20,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I sent 35 notices.

942
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:30,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And does 18 signatures represent 18 different households?

943
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done now, Alicia.

944
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:33,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

945
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:41,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Carey has his hand raised.

946
01:10:46,433 --> 01:10:48,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael, how many houses are on the street?

947
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:49,896
[SPEAKER_13]: We have 14 different households.

948
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we went to 18 different households.

949
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:53,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't do it.

950
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:56,182
[SPEAKER_04]: We just did it by, um, street numbers.

951
01:10:59,044 --> 01:11:04,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And I sent 35 notices and I take them as from the ward book.

952
01:11:04,507 --> 01:11:05,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

953
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:09,150
[SPEAKER_10]: There's two or 32 or three is 134.

954
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:10,651
[SPEAKER_10]: That's three.

955
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:15,193
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like 16 facing Pinkham.

956
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:16,474
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they're all two family, that's 32.

957
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:17,955
[SPEAKER_15]: So it sounds about right.

958
01:11:18,643 --> 01:11:20,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, 14 of different addresses.

959
01:11:20,684 --> 01:11:24,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them may be in the same house, but they're different addresses.

960
01:11:24,745 --> 01:11:27,386
[SPEAKER_10]: 18 signatures, 14 residences.

961
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:29,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

962
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:34,088
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's just because I think we've said it said before that it's important.

963
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:44,211
[SPEAKER_22]: The last one that came in front of us, one of the things that we asked for was to make sure we had good turnout from or that we'd heard from a majority of the people on the street.

964
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:47,719
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have two people that emailed us about that.

965
01:11:47,839 --> 01:11:48,739
[SPEAKER_10]: They were against this.

966
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,861
[SPEAKER_09]: This gentleman, Paul, has been waiting to talk to you.

967
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:53,502
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, I think he's one of the petitioners.

968
01:11:53,682 --> 01:11:53,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

969
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:57,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, my name's Paul Carey.

970
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:59,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just recently moved to the area.

971
01:11:59,786 --> 01:12:04,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm living at 23 Pinkham Road and I moved here after the petition.

972
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:11,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I been here at the time that it was circulating, I also would have signed the petition just to put that in there.

973
01:12:13,447 --> 01:12:16,008
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so there's two more people that would have signed this petition.

974
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:28,295
[SPEAKER_22]: So one of my concerns and actual reasons why I would support permit parking here is because we're very close to the Somerville border.

975
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:43,043
[SPEAKER_22]: And it seems to me that it could very well be that people who can't park in Somerville and anybody who lives in Somerville and registers their car in Somerville can get a parking permit in Somerville.

976
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:52,937
[SPEAKER_22]: And anybody who lives in Medford and lives on a street with permit parking and registers their car in Medford could get a permit here.

977
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:58,279
[SPEAKER_22]: The key is registering your car, which means that you pay the excise taxes to the city.

978
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:08,884
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do feel like it's only appropriate for us to have heard from the neighbors.

979
01:13:12,991 --> 01:13:16,233
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that passing this is going to put more pressure on Boston Ave.

980
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:22,378
[SPEAKER_22]: But I think that this is, again, another area that we really need to move this process forward of looking at zone parking.

981
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:28,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So was the result 50%?

982
01:13:29,463 --> 01:13:32,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 50% of the households signed on with those added to?

983
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like it.

984
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:37,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you count those houses, the end ones seem to be on Caden Street and Boston Ave.

985
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:40,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got one on my right side, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

986
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:52,193
[SPEAKER_10]: go across the street, again, the N1 Boston app, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and the next one's on Capon Street.

987
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:53,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's 16 houses.

988
01:13:53,934 --> 01:14:03,119
[SPEAKER_10]: We have, with the two people who just signed in and supported it, we have 18 signatures with 14 different addresses.

989
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And the two additional ones would make up the difference.

990
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:12,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd say we're number one with 50% of the residents there.

991
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:18,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the biggest problem up in that area is there's many tough students that have out-of-state plates.

992
01:14:18,418 --> 01:14:21,899
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to register their cars in the city for whatever reason.

993
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:27,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, is it gonna cause a problem in Boston?

994
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

995
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people are gonna have to find somewhere to go.

996
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:32,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are many people that do.

997
01:14:35,226 --> 01:14:41,529
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had an issue over the years where people who live in Somerville, again, college students or what have you, they don't register their car in Somerville

998
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,623
[SPEAKER_10]: It appears that we've got well over 50% of the street for support.

999
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:58,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple numbers for me, so I'm in favor.

1000
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:02,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I was back at it.

1001
01:15:05,813 --> 01:15:07,695
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no one else to speak on the phone.

1002
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:13,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to just double check that no one's in the chat.

1003
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Two emails that came.

1004
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: the email that those two people sent in that were opposed to it.

1005
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:20,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have them?

1006
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:20,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I see them?

1007
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:29,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see what they're asking.

1008
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:34,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing it.

1009
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:43,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, just for the record, we have two emails that came in from two different people, and one basically lives at 15,

1010
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:57,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other one is someone that does not have a driveway access and needs to park on the street.

1011
01:15:57,628 --> 01:16:00,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Most often can't find this on street parking.

1012
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:05,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other person, it seems, parks there but does not live right on that street.

1013
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,551
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it.

1014
01:16:09,591 --> 01:16:12,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the two people that emailed us that were in opposition to this.

1015
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a roll call vote, a motion on the table.

1016
01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:19,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get who motioned.

1017
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:21,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I motioned.

1018
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:25,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if someone seconded that.

1019
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get that.

1020
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:27,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1021
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:28,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1022
01:16:29,313 --> 01:16:30,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1023
01:16:30,613 --> 01:16:30,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1024
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

1025
01:16:33,174 --> 01:16:39,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, with the caveat that zone parking needs to be addressed in this area within the next year.

1026
01:16:43,652 --> 01:16:44,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief Covino?

1027
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:45,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1028
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:49,074
[SPEAKER_13]: The vote of 4-0, 1 absent, motion passes.

1029
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, Michael and everyone.

1030
01:16:52,356 --> 01:16:52,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1031
01:16:53,356 --> 01:16:58,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate your listening to us and your time and energy and what you do in the parking commission.

1032
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1033
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:04,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1034
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:12,524
[SPEAKER_13]: 2025-75, permanent parking variance for Sarah Rebecca Gaglio, 465 Broadway, apartment 4.

1035
01:17:13,902 --> 01:17:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: She's not in attendance.

1036
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:19,105
[SPEAKER_07]: She called me and she's had to work late tonight.

1037
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:19,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1038
01:17:21,466 --> 01:17:23,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We have gone back and forth with this woman.

1039
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:30,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Her only question is she has a mother that comes from out of state to visit and wants to be able to get her a parking spot.

1040
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:36,354
[SPEAKER_10]: This woman lives at the infamous 25 Sherbrook Court where there is no parking.

1041
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:37,514
[SPEAKER_10]: She has no car.

1042
01:17:37,554 --> 01:17:42,937
[SPEAKER_10]: She just wants to get a barriers for a park permit so her mother can park on

1043
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Braymore?

1044
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:45,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Braymore or Strathmore?

1045
01:17:45,636 --> 01:17:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Strathmore when she comes here.

1046
01:17:48,437 --> 01:17:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: She couldn't make the meeting tonight because she's working.

1047
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:59,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Was this the letter that says the problem is that the house is literally the front of the house is in Somerville.

1048
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:03,504
[SPEAKER_22]: So Medford doesn't recognize Broadway as a street to give her a permit.

1049
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:12,328
[SPEAKER_22]: And Somerville doesn't recognize her as a Somerville resident because she technically lives in Somerville, in Medford.

1050
01:18:13,717 --> 01:18:17,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much the street is some of all the address is Medford.

1051
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:23,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the buildings in Medford, their Medford residents, they pay Medford excise taxes.

1052
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:25,463
[SPEAKER_11]: They are.

1053
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:29,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Within the zone, and they do have permit parking.

1054
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:36,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe this individual is asking for a visitor pass and we don't issue.

1055
01:18:36,203 --> 01:18:37,064
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my understanding.

1056
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:48,450
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't issue for sure born court visitor passes because of the limited parking on the streets that you mentioned, including both street.

1057
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1058
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I would concur with Jim.

1059
01:18:53,521 --> 01:19:02,024
[SPEAKER_15]: The consistency from this commission has been to grant variances for the permit holder, but not for visitor on the side streets usually.

1060
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:08,266
[SPEAKER_22]: If this is a visitor on Broadway, there is plenty of visitor parking on Broadway, isn't there?

1061
01:19:08,386 --> 01:19:16,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, the signs in Somerville, it's permit only between 8 and 2.30 AM or something.

1062
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:23,312
[SPEAKER_11]: crazy in front of, if you look at 465, you can see what that sign is.

1063
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:40,301
[SPEAKER_11]: But Medford Street, two blocks down on the east side is open parking in Medford, as well as Main Street, two streets the other way, which is, with the exception of street sweeping, provides open parking.

1064
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:47,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Broadway at Trump Field is open, even though it's insummable, it's open without any restriction.

1065
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:57,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I want to point out to everyone in attendance that Somerville is hosting a public meeting tomorrow night regarding.

1066
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:02,853
[SPEAKER_15]: a redesign or planning of Magoon Square, which is this area.

1067
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:13,520
[SPEAKER_15]: So any Medford residents should attend that meeting and could contribute to questions like this about providing more visitor parking on Broadway or whatnot, whatever people feel.

1068
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,282
[SPEAKER_15]: But I wanted to make people aware of that public meeting happening tomorrow.

1069
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:17,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1070
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:24,747
[SPEAKER_22]: So it does sound like she's having overnight guests is her problem, is that it's overnight guests that are coming, not just daytime visitors.

1071
01:20:25,828 --> 01:20:26,748
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't get it.

1072
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:33,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so, at that public meeting, you could discuss anything under the world that someone might need or want, you know, as an issue.

1073
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:39,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'm having in public comment.

1074
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see it.

1075
01:20:47,506 --> 01:20:49,568
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, we revert back to the commissioners.

1076
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:51,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Does someone have a motion?

1077
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:57,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think we're going to have to come up with some sort of a.

1078
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I call the motion not to approve.

1079
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:11,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded.

1080
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,287
[SPEAKER_22]: You mean to deny it?

1081
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:18,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1082
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:25,011
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you're right that we've denied these before and that there are options for visitors.

1083
01:21:30,002 --> 01:21:34,424
[SPEAKER_22]: Like this wouldn't be eligible to buy like one of those three day visitor passes.

1084
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:38,146
[SPEAKER_22]: You're shaking your head.

1085
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:39,467
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they're not.

1086
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:44,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I think again, I don't know what the rule is out there.

1087
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,850
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always been not much parking up in that.

1088
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:55,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, I'm inclined to say I'd love to see this person get a visitor pass for when her mother comes to visit, but

1089
01:21:56,076 --> 01:21:59,097
[SPEAKER_10]: The other idea is, you know, where do we draw the line?

1090
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:07,421
[SPEAKER_10]: And to brought up a valid point that we've denied people access to these other streets before.

1091
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:14,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to say, sure, it's only gonna happen once in a blue moon, but do we know that?

1092
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:22,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm noticing a lack of accessible parking spaces on Broadway, Somerville.

1093
01:22:22,107 --> 01:22:24,908
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm gonna make a note to email Somerville about that.

1094
01:22:25,498 --> 01:22:33,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Because no matter what city or, you know, business district something's in, there should be adequate, you know, every once in a while, accessible parking.

1095
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:40,264
[SPEAKER_15]: So if that existed in this case, this visitor could use an accessible park space that would be open to anyone, not just Somerville residents, right?

1096
01:22:40,724 --> 01:22:47,126
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just looked up and down Broadway, and it didn't seem like there's any accessible spaces on either side of the street for quite a distance.

1097
01:22:47,186 --> 01:22:51,228
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something that could be fixed potentially by Somerville.

1098
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:56,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a roll call vote.

1099
01:22:59,163 --> 01:23:00,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1100
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:04,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a deny, correct?

1101
01:23:05,507 --> 01:23:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1102
01:23:06,508 --> 01:23:07,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1103
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:08,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1104
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:10,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

1105
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:10,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1106
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:12,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Cabino?

1107
01:23:13,131 --> 01:23:13,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1108
01:23:14,332 --> 01:23:16,754
[SPEAKER_13]: The 4-0 vote, one absent.

1109
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:18,154
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion is denied.

1110
01:23:18,174 --> 01:23:22,357
[SPEAKER_13]: The guy in the corner, Braymore and Broadway, has a letter I can describe.

1111
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:38,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on, 2025-76, no parking outside the south side of Lewis Street from the corner of Fulton, extending approximately 25 feet east of Fulton Street.

1112
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:40,801
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Todd Blake.

1113
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:50,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Just for the commissioners, we do have numerous complaints coming from Lewis Street just for this reason and other reasons.

1114
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:51,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Todd?

1115
01:23:58,622 --> 01:23:58,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it?

1116
01:23:59,182 --> 01:24:03,163
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I pulled 25 feet from 25 feet from the intersection.

1117
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:06,104
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see a full street on Louis Street.

1118
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:08,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, where it intersects with full correct.

1119
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:14,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1120
01:24:14,246 --> 01:24:23,049
[SPEAKER_13]: God, you're up.

1121
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:29,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I'm trying to.

1122
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:37,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Having difficulty sharing my screen.

1123
01:24:37,893 --> 01:24:40,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you pull up Lewis Street, please, near Fulton?

1124
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:47,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd, do you want to pull it up now?

1125
01:24:47,639 --> 01:24:50,041
[SPEAKER_09]: We took ours off, so you should be able to pull it up now.

1126
01:25:01,224 --> 01:25:05,386
[SPEAKER_15]: I may be, okay, here we go.

1127
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:39,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you all see this Lewis Street?

1128
01:25:44,457 --> 01:25:45,757
[SPEAKER_22]: It's still loading.

1129
01:25:45,777 --> 01:25:46,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear me?

1130
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:47,638
[SPEAKER_22]: We're having internet issues.

1131
01:25:58,263 --> 01:26:00,664
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'm going to stop sharing.

1132
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, please.

1133
01:26:03,382 --> 01:26:06,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's overlaying my system when I'm trying to share and speak at the same time, I guess.

1134
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:15,532
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Lewis street is basically that I got a, I got informed of a situation from a council city counselor.

1135
01:26:16,308 --> 01:26:22,952
[SPEAKER_15]: who informed me that the residents had experienced an emergency vehicle trying to reach Lewis Street and had difficulty making the turns.

1136
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:31,337
[SPEAKER_15]: So myself and DTW representatives, Highway Foreman met with Metro Fire to check the turns from Fulton Street onto Lewis.

1137
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:37,121
[SPEAKER_15]: And we determined it would be helpful to them to sign and no parking, hit a corner.

1138
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:41,433
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, on the South side, Lewis, 25 feet from the corner.

1139
01:26:42,094 --> 01:26:43,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Normally 20 feet's already approved.

1140
01:26:44,156 --> 01:26:48,920
[SPEAKER_15]: In this case, the extra five didn't take away any other parking to the next driveway.

1141
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,043
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still afforded the space for two parking spaces.

1142
01:26:52,103 --> 01:26:57,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So that five feet, you know, was, was good to help the Medford fire department.

1143
01:26:57,428 --> 01:27:01,912
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, that's where this originally, and that's what the reason is for.

1144
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:08,574
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's only five more feet than the standard 20 feet, and we're signing it as well.

1145
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:18,257
[SPEAKER_15]: But it doesn't take away any parking, because there were only two spaces that could fit between the 20 feet and the driveway anyways on the south side.

1146
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:30,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so it would be that right turn from Fulton Street onto Lewis if it was the fire department coming from Salem Street, and if it's the one coming from the Heights, they'd take the left turn.

1147
01:27:34,243 --> 01:27:37,805
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's pretty much a public safety thing.

1148
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:39,226
[SPEAKER_22]: I would move to approve.

1149
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:45,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1150
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:47,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1151
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:49,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, indeed.

1152
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1153
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1154
01:27:52,473 --> 01:27:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Silva?

1155
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:53,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1156
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:55,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Covino?

1157
01:27:56,035 --> 01:27:56,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1158
01:28:00,645 --> 01:28:04,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Before nothing vote, one absent motion is approved.

1159
01:28:05,188 --> 01:28:06,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim, just one thing.

1160
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:10,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we get hash marks maybe painted in this area?

1161
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:15,376
[SPEAKER_13]: It really helps at some point.

1162
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:18,398
[SPEAKER_06]: With the no parking lane, you mean?

1163
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:19,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1164
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1165
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll think about it.

1166
01:28:22,822 --> 01:28:24,703
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1167
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:25,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk to Todd about it.

1168
01:28:26,004 --> 01:28:26,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see what makes sense.

1169
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reluctant because it's,

1170
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:34,004
[SPEAKER_06]: putting paint on a side street, but anyway.

1171
01:28:34,264 --> 01:28:36,025
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, moving on.

1172
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:41,027
[SPEAKER_13]: 20-25-77, Daylight Crossing, higher picture.

1173
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:53,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Posted no parking north side of High Street from crosswalk extending east approximately 32 feet and no parking south side of High Street from crosswalk extending west approximately 32 feet.

1174
01:28:54,393 --> 01:28:58,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Todd Blake, this area we have been getting complaints.

1175
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And the city councils have also chimed in on this.

1176
01:29:03,145 --> 01:29:03,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

1177
01:29:04,285 --> 01:29:11,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, a resident reached out and pointed out that it's difficult to cross the street coming from behind a parked vehicle.

1178
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:18,494
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's in line with what we've been doing elsewhere with daylight and crosswalks for improved visibility, improved safety.

1179
01:29:19,094 --> 01:29:26,879
[SPEAKER_15]: So the 32 feet in this case, roughly, if you look at a high street, would go from the crosswalk to right about the walkway for each of these houses.

1180
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:37,403
[SPEAKER_15]: And one, we needed to go a little further, 32 versus say, 28, because there was a utility obstruction for the physical pole.

1181
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:44,489
[SPEAKER_15]: So 32 feet on high street prior to the crosswalk would help with visibility, just like we've done elsewhere.

1182
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:47,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what we're asking for.

1183
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner, no one has an issue.

1184
01:29:51,115 --> 01:29:51,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to combine 77 and 78.

1185
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:58,271
[SPEAKER_13]: 78 is stop sign on Pitcher Ave at High Street.

1186
01:29:58,412 --> 01:29:58,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Todd Blake.

1187
01:29:59,092 --> 01:29:59,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1188
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:11,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So while I was looking at this situation and pre-marking some crosswalks that we hope to paint across Pitcher, I noticed that Pitcher does not have a stop sign entering High Street.

1189
01:30:12,759 --> 01:30:14,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be helpful to have a stop sign.

1190
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:20,083
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to, next time we paint High Street, we hope to paint,

1191
01:30:21,393 --> 01:30:25,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Edgelines on picture to to kind of guide people to the middle of that road.

1192
01:30:25,196 --> 01:30:27,817
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the most advantageous for sight lines.

1193
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:39,666
[SPEAKER_15]: So, with the new painting, the hopefully new crosswalk soon and stop signs and the daylighting this theory, we hope to vastly improve the safety for everyone in the area.

1194
01:30:41,787 --> 01:30:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion well, I'll let someone else motion.

1195
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Approve second sounds great.

1196
01:30:50,723 --> 01:30:51,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a roll call vote.
