1
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:10,195
Motion to table number three fiscal year 24 budget allocation approval pending city council vote of budget.

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,380
Motion by member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,422
Can we get an explanation if you guys don't mind?

4
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,205
The council hasn't approved the budget yet.

5
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,547
And so are we able to have

6
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,606
conversation about anything right now or now?

7
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:46,495
Yes, about anything related to the fiscal year 24 budget allocation approval, which is pending City Council vote of the final budget.

8
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:47,636
Okay.

9
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,017
Potentially on the 20th.

10
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:50,058
Potentially.

11
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:51,019
Okay, then may I?

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,881
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

13
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,042
Thank you.

14
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,104
So I had a question on

15
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,318
in the special education section.

16
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,640
Can I point of information?

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,302
Isn't a motion to table undebatable?

18
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:05,242
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:05,543
You're right.

20
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:06,343
It is undebatable.

21
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:07,924
Unless it's withdrawn.

22
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:08,685
Let's take a vote.

23
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,086
Unless it's withdrawn.

24
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:14,750
Can I just ask a question also?

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,632
Point of information, Democrats?

26
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,309
Yes, I just wanted to know so because, you know, each year I kind of forget the process.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,753
So, we voted in the committee as a whole.

28
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:33,738
So, tonight we were supposed to vote to approve it to then send the number to city council, and then

29
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,201
Because when I talked to recover yellow.

30
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,644
He said that the meeting they had yesterday.

31
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:50,492
I watched some of it was a discussion in not a meeting to approve the budget because usually we vote to approve the budget, and then we send them our number.

32
00:01:50,953 --> 00:02:00,761
And then, you know, we, we wait to hear back for their approval so I guess I'm confused with the process now is the process different or did I just forget, because it's been another year.

33
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,503
May I remember Graham.

34
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:11,969
Um, we voted our municipal request at our June 5th meeting.

35
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,130
So we voted on to send a request to the municipality for $71,995,165.

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,951
There were six in favor, one abstention.

37
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,372
Um, so that work has been done.

38
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:33,213
The next vote we would need to take is once the municipal allocation is

39
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:38,702
formally approved by put forward by the mayor and approved by the council.

40
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,044
And that has not happened yet.

41
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:48,751
So I don't believe there's really anything for us to discuss until that happens because we don't know what that number will be.

42
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:57,178
Okay, so then our next meeting will just be the final number and then we approve it overall.

43
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,601
I would assume so yeah.

44
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:04,502
Okay, so we don't have a date yet it's just something that we just have to wait.

45
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:05,983
Yeah, we'll have to wait.

46
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:06,623
Okay.

47
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:10,583
Go ahead and put information member McLaughlin.

48
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:22,946
Thank you, because the some of the line items for some things that we may not have had access to before that we might have a question on, which I do, when are we addressing those.

49
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:29,074
I feel like we're debating a motion to table at this point.

50
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:33,796
Motion to table, I'll just, yeah, I'll call the roll.

51
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:44,600
I think you would discuss anything either with the superintendent privately or at our next meeting after the council approves or denies the budget.

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,541
Member Russo, if you could call the roll.

53
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:52,623
Member Graham?

54
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:53,463
Yes.

55
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:55,739
Member Hayes?

56
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:56,519
Yes.

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,420
Member Kretz?

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Yes.

59
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,541
Member McLaughlin?

60
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:02,601
No.

61
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,042
Member McStone?

62
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:06,782
No.

63
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:09,303
Member Rossell, yes.

64
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:10,283
Mayor Longo, current?

65
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:13,844
No.

66
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,885
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,145
Motion to table passes.

68
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:24,567
Negotiations and legal matters, executive session pursuant to general law 30A section

69
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:40,800
A3, Memphis School Committee will convene an executive session to discuss strategy in preparation for negotiations with Teamsters Local 25 security monitors and Local 25 administrators and custodians because an open meeting law will have a detrimental effect on the bargaining position of the committee.

70
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:53,965

71
00:04:54,821 --> 00:05:05,948

The Memphis School Committee will not reconvene in public session subsequent to the executive session.

74
00:05:22,892 --> 00:05:24,512
Is there a motion to move into executive session?

75
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:28,634
Motion to enter executive session.

76
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:30,574

82
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:41,717
Yes.

83
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:43,698
Member Kratz?

84
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,919
Member Kratz, did we just lose you?

85
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,780
I think she's gone to the breakout room.

86
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:56,472
Oh, okay.

87
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:58,412
Somehow I got into another room.

88
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,793
I don't know what happened, but now I'm back again.

89
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:06,774
Would you vote on the motion to enter executive session?

90
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:07,574

91
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:09,495

Motion's approved.

100
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,911
Yeah, I think I'm going to need to link again, because I got it too early.

101
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:51,432
The link.

102
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,213
You're not muted, just FYI.

103
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,994
And you're in the breakout room.

104
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:56,475
I'm in the breakout room.

105
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:57,695
Oh.

106
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,156
Oh, you're not in the breakout room.

107
00:06:59,176 --> 00:06:59,877
You're in the main room.

108
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:00,417
And I got that.

109
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,058
Yeah, I think my link disappeared too.

110
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:03,578
All right, let me.

111
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:05,099
Let me put it on to.

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,220
Let me put a chat.

113
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,601
Or let me just let Peter know.

114
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:09,562
Sure.

115
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,203
He needs to give us the breakout again.

116
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:13,944
Yeah.

117
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,617
Hey, Peter, we need the breakout again.

118
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:19,697
Yep.

119
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:20,938
Let me help you out.

120
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:21,798
Thanks.

121
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,920
Um, okay.

122
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,380
Just give me one second here.

123
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,061
Oh, there's a, on the bottom it says breakout room.

124
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,361
Kathy, you should be able to click on breakout room.

125
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:36,821
I was good.

126
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:40,242
What I was going to do is I was going to try to move you and that trigger is another welcome.

127
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:46,384
So Kathy can go.

128
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:47,144
All right.

129
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,653
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in executive session and thank you.
