1
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:03,880
Bye.

2
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,211
Are you sitting in a dark mirror?

3
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,872
You look like you're in a horror movie.

4
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,815
It is gonna be a ghost story.

5
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,256
Okay, good.

6
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:50,996
Let's start.

7
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:51,697
It looks good.

8
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:52,978
Who's behind you?

9
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:53,558
You get Cody.

10
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:56,380
That was Cody.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,360
Oh, it did.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,001
Oh, no, it did.

13
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:58,361
And I'm home.

14
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:06,946
but it's supposed to go back on in a half hour.

15
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,607
So we're gonna make this work.

16
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:09,528
Okay.

17
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:15,393
We just saw a floating head behind you, which made me, you know, it made the whole horror vibe work for you, so.

18
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,538
I'll shut my camera off, but okay.

19
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,860
So it is 6.30.

20
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,524
We have a Medford School Committee meeting, January 10th, 2021, regular meeting.

21
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:27,964
It is by Zoom.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,401
You can call in by dialing 1-929-205-6099.

23
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,302
Meeting ID when prompted is 958-3358-9191.

24
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,344
If you may call, I can call the roll.

25
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:39,964
Member Graham?

26
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:40,084
Here.

27
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:41,565
Member Kratz?

28
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:41,806
Here.

29
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:03,507
Member McLaughlin?

30
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:04,688
Here.

31
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:06,570
Member McStone?

32
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,330
Here.

33
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:10,113
Member Hayes?

34
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:11,894
Here.

35
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:18,519
And myself, that's seven present, zero absent, if we may all rise.

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,320
Member Russo.

37
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:20,121
I'm here.

38
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,742
Oh, Member Russo, I'm so sorry.

39
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,365
So if we all may rise to salute the flag.

40
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,530
I pledge allegiance to the flag

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:40,284
of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

42
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:57,894
First up, we have the organization of the school committee, election of school committee officers.

43
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:01,974
Is there a motion, member Rousseau?

44
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:05,715
I'd like to motion to nominate Jenny Graham for vice chair.

45
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:12,017
There's a motion by member Rousseau for Ms.

46
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,817
Jenny Graham for vice chair.

47
00:03:13,857 --> 00:03:14,737
Is there a second?

48
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:17,118
Second.

49
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,340
Motion by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,061
If there's nobody else who would like to speak, I will call the roll.

51
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,306
Member Hayes?

52
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:37,446
Yes.

53
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:42,428
Would you just maybe state Jenny Graham?

54
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:43,849
Sorry.

55
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,589
Yes, Jenny Graham.

56
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,391
Member Kratz?

57
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,251
Yes, Jenny Graham.

58
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:54,473
Member Russo?

59
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,153
Yes, Jenny Graham.

60
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:57,694
I don't know why I'm saying yes, Jenny Graham.

61
00:03:58,974 --> 00:03:59,835
Member McLaughlin?

62
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:00,975
Jenny Graham.

63
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:06,872
Member Graham.

64
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:08,893
Jenny Graham.

65
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:13,974
Member McStone, Mayor.

66
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,214
Member McStone.

67
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:16,534
Jenny Graham.

68
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:17,854
Thank you.

69
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:19,395
And myself, Jenny Graham.

70
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:25,896
That's seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative for member Jenny Graham to be elected as vice chair.

71
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:26,836
Congratulations.

72
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:28,277
Thank you.

73
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,858
And next up we have, is there a nomination for secretary?

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,160
Mayor.

75
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:38,862
Member Graham.

76
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:42,985
I'd like to nominate Paul Rousseau for the role of secretary.

77
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,649
Paul Rousseau is nominated as secretary.

78
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,750
Is there a second?

79
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:51,512
Second.

80
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:53,974
Second by Member Kratz.

81
00:04:55,596 --> 00:05:01,241
If there's nobody else who would like to speak, I'm gonna call the roll for Member Rousseau as secretary.

82
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,164
Member Hayes.

83
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:08,097
Yes, Paul Russo.

84
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:09,939
Member Kratz.

85
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,540
Yes, Paul Russo.

86
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:14,643
Member McLaughlin.

87
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,024
Paul Russo.

88
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:17,846
Member Graham.

89
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:19,307
Paul Russo.

90
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,269
Member McStone.

91
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,631
Paul Russo.

92
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,013
And Member Russo.

93
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:26,474
Paul Russo.

94
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,697
And myself, Paul Russo.

95
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,319
So that's seven in the affirmative.

96
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:37,682
zero in the negative for Paul Rousseau to be our next 2022 secretary.

97
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,044
And you can take over the roll call from now on.

98
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,125
Thank you.

99
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,634
Number four, we have good of the order.

100
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,460
Yes, member McLaughlin.

101
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:56,751
Thank you.

102
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:11,520
And as folks know, good of the order is a review of school committee, sort of best practices and sort of moving things forward and I'm wanted to mention sort of two colleagues and see where folks are at.

103
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:28,231
seems to me that there's not much in the way of orientation for school committee members, and I'm thinking particularly of new school committee members, but also school committee members who are fairly new, refreshers, what have you, for an orientation.

104
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:35,437
And so I'm wondering, I'd like to open that up to colleagues and see where folks are on that in terms of good of the order, because I think

105
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:48,969
orientation specifically with regard to parliamentary procedure, where to go when, how to get information, policies, all those things.

106
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,650
So I'd like to open that up as part of the order.

107
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:02,475
From the chair, I would just state, I think what we had two years ago was a great start.

108
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,936
And I know Superintendent Edward Vinson is

109
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:17,457
especially once the surge is over, is gonna try to get us all together to have a session where we can kind of collaborate and get to know each other some and ask questions.

110
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,698
But would anybody else like to add to that?

111
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,900
Member Russo.

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,940
Thank you.

113
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:27,742
I think this particular go to the order is,

114
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:36,385
relevant to something I'll be putting on the next agenda, which is a full set of rules that I spent three years writing.

115
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:43,008
And in there is a set of parts related to orientation.

116
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:50,451
And I will be sending that to the committee tonight so that we will have plenty of, individually have time to read the entire set of rules.

117
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:58,875
And I hope that there can be a whole section built out on orientation and what it means

118
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:23,113
what we mean by orientation, because I think that is definitely something that is, I've asked our new member, Hayes, when I sent her the rules tonight to bring a truly unique, we all were in her position at one point of not knowing how to be a school committee member at all.

119
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:36,329
Um, so I've asked her to write as many notes as possible as she reads the rules, because I feel a little concerned that our rules that I'm going to send you all tonight, um, we are all sort of living it already.

120
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:51,340
So, um, her perspective as somebody who does not have any rules and will surely have lots of questions is probably the most valuable one, but, um, around orientation, I could not agree more that we need to, we really need to build that out.

121
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,161
What do we even mean?

122
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:53,656
So thank you.

123
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:54,457
Member McLaughlin.

124
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:56,238
Mayor.

125
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:58,719
Member McLaughlin.

126
00:08:59,439 --> 00:08:59,899
Thank you.

127
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:00,300
Yes.

128
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,942
And to that point, I think it does need to be spelled out in terms of what orientation exactly means.

129
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:17,168
And I did also appreciate the event that Dr. Edward Vincent had hosted with the MASC two years ago, but I think it was also several weeks into the term.

130
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:22,815
You know, at that point, there was a lot of learning curve that had already happened and so in some ways I want.

131
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:48,576
committee also to be thinking about, you know, new members are elected in November, you know, is there an opportunity for a new member orientation before members come on board so that they're not potentially feeling so lost and or, you know, very much like, you know, first year teachers, a mentor position in school committee so that, you know, perhaps as a mentor to new school committee members or something along those lines, but I do think that it's something that really needs to be

132
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,371
considered for the good of the order.

133
00:09:51,651 --> 00:10:00,038
And I would also just follow up to member Russo's comment regarding the rules that he was gonna send to us tonight.

134
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:11,887
Member Russo, are these from what's posted on the website that you're referring to in terms of the school committee MPS policies, or is this something different that you're referring to?

135
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:13,909
I won't, I'll let you.

136
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:17,583
I'll leave it to suspense for tonight.

137
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:23,506
There's 84 of them so far, and they're not really part.

138
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,007
Some of them are part of our policies.

139
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,087
Much of them are not.

140
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,970
A lot of them are just past practice that I've observed in my four years.

141
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,633
And then I trolled school committees all around the state for their rules.

142
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:42,036
Interestingly, we're not the only school committee that has no written set of rules, which shocked me.

143
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:50,220
But a bunch of them do have rules written down and they were really quite good documents to serve as the springboard.

144
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,940
But I'll send that tonight.

145
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:59,423
I didn't want to put it on the agenda tonight because it's, it's, it's not a small effort to read the full 18 pages.

146
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:03,845
But I think it'll be worth it once we have something approved.

147
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:16,151
Mayor, I just wanted to say that for the good of the order.

148
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:24,715
I thought that the orientation that the superintendent put on and I think it was Dorothy from the MSC she had come out.

149
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:33,079
It was very informative and a refresher for all of us as we're, you know, getting back into a new term.

150
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,340
you know, because sometimes we can, we know what we're doing, but sometimes we can forget and get away from what we should be doing.

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,821
So I think it would be great and, you know, look forward to doing that.

152
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:49,502
Thank you, Mayor.

153
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:52,802
Member McLaughlin.

154
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:54,783
Oh, it was me.

155
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:59,863
So I just wanted to, that's okay.

156
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,604
I just wanted to say welcome to Sharon.

157
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,520
Thank you for joining us.

158
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
We're excited to have you.

159
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:12,905
And you should not hesitate to reach out to any of us if you have questions between now and then.

160
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,048
Did we lose the mayor?

161
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:53,421
I was just looking for the mayor and... Jenny Graham, vice chair, might get to be the fastest vice chair actually running a meeting in history.

162
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,123
Mayor, did we lose you?

163
00:12:56,444 --> 00:13:00,187
I see her square, but I don't know if she's still here.

164
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:16,756
Okay, well, I will do my best to take over while she deals with her technical difficulties.

165
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,942
Are there any other comments under the good of the order?

166
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:31,182
I will definitely be pursuing doing that retreat again for us, because I did enjoy that.

167
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:34,624
And I am too going to wait just for the surge to pass.

168
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:45,389
So hopefully by the end of February, maybe after break or something like that, we'll be able to participate in that retreat.

169
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:52,032
Great.

170
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,293
I see we have the mayor back.

171
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:54,419
Are you there?

172
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,161
Yeah, I'm here.

173
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,262
Thanks, I'm sorry.

174
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:58,223
That's okay.

175
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:12,615
If there's no other business under good of the order, we can move on to number five, which is the consent agenda, approval of bills, payrolls, and approval of the regular school committee meeting minutes from 12-20-2021.

176
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,496
Motion to approve.

177
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:14,056
Second.

178
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:20,282
Motion to approve by member Laughlin, seconded by member Graham.

179
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:21,683
Member Russo, if you'll call the roll.

180
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,962
I don't remember the proper order.

181
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,502
Member Hayes?

182
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:32,644
Yes.

183
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:35,266
Member Graham?

184
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:36,086
Yes.

185
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,948
Member Kratz?

186
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:41,929
Yes.

187
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:46,211
I feel like I'm in third grade learning the alphabet or whatever that was.

188
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,812
Member McLaughlin?

189
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:49,853
Yes.

190
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:51,894
Member McStone?

191
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:52,454
Yes.

192
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:59,953
Remember, that's me remember so is yes, and Mayor logo car.

193
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:06,235
Yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative, the consent agenda has been approved.

194
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:13,697
We have no reports of subcommittee, but we do have a number of reports of the superintendent.

195
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:18,279
First up is superintendents updates and comments, Dr Maurice Edward Vincent.

196
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:24,928
Thank you.

197
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,749
I want to say good evening to everyone.

198
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:27,710
Happy New Year.

199
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:36,595
This is our first meeting of school year 2022 so that's pretty exciting and I'm looking forward to this new year.

200
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:44,698
So without much further ado, today, our COVID-19 update will be presented after this report.

201
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:55,306
It will be an official report presented by Assistant Superintendent David Murphy and our Director of Health Services, Mrs. Avery Hines.

202
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:04,374
As I mentioned in my communication earlier today, the weather forecast for Medford Public Schools area tomorrow

203
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,894
is calling for extremely cold temperatures.

204
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:17,240
As a result, we have taken numerous steps within our schools to prepare for the wind chill temperatures that may hover around zero degrees.

205
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,204
Please prepare your children by making sure they are properly dressed with warm and layered clothing.

206
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:30,148
Our custodial staff is doing everything possible to make sure our heating systems are up to challenge.

207
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:41,276
In addition, we are working with our bus vendors to make sure that their transportation equipment, meaning all buses, is operational despite the cold temperatures.

208
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:54,945
While we are doing everything that we can operationally to prepare to have a successful day tomorrow, there is an ongoing risk of unexpected staff or bus driver absences tomorrow.

209
00:16:55,045 --> 00:17:00,028
So please be aware of that due to our COVID related personnel challenges.

210
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:11,114
In light of this, I am asking all families to minimize to the greatest extent possible the time that your child is waiting at the bus stop in the morning.

211
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:17,729
Students at the elementary schools will be allowed to enter their schools by 8.15 a.m.

212
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,650
tomorrow morning and at our middle schools 7.30 a.m.

213
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,531
and high school at 7.20 a.m.

214
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:31,233
We want to make sure that all of our students are kept safe and ready to learn throughout the district.

215
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:45,275
So as many of you are aware, unfortunately, again, due to COVID, the original inaugural plans had to change, but I was able to watch them on the computer.

216
00:17:47,003 --> 00:18:04,390
As the mayor said in her inaugural address, we are proud that the Medford public schools, due to our collaboration with Tufts University was able to bring our students back into school sooner than most surrounding districts, the teamwork of the city Tufts, and the schools

217
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:08,128
working hand in hand to make in-person school a reality.

218
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:18,635
And thanks to the collaboration with our full school committee, I wanna just say thank you and I wanna congratulate all of you and especially extend a warm welcome to Ms.

219
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,716
Sharon Hayes, our newest member.

220
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:27,601
So congratulations again to all of you on a new term and I'm looking forward to this new school year.

221
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:36,457
I want the community to know that today the Medford Public Schools opened kindergarten registration for all students.

222
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,840
If you have questions, please reach out to our Parent Information Center.

223
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:50,366
We have a few upcoming events this Wednesday, January 12th.

224
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,488
Very important notice, we have another vaccine clinic.

225
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:58,050
Again, a vaccination clinic is this Wednesday

226
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:03,515
January 12th from 3 to 6 p.m at Medford High School.

227
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:11,001
This vaccination clinic is for students 5 to 11 and for staff and students 12 and up.

228
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:18,687
So we will be giving boosters and first shots or second shots depending on where you are in your series.

229
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:20,708
So please take advantage of that.

230
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:29,371
I am really pleased to say that we had over 100 people participate in last Wednesday's clinic, and I hope that we continue to have more.

231
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:37,334
I also want to extend a special thank you to the Medford Board of Health for their continued collaboration with the Medford Public Schools.

232
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:46,278
I'd like to thank Nurse Director Avery Hines and all of our hardworking nurses in the Medford Public Schools for the

233
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:51,975
incredible work that they are doing, leading us during this COVID time.

234
00:19:53,536 --> 00:20:09,527
I also would like to announce for the community that this Wednesday, January 12th, between six and eight o'clock, we are going to be having a CPAC meeting and the Zoom, the topic will be disability awareness curriculum.

235
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:14,410
Again, this Wednesday, January 12th, from six to 8 p.m.

236
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:16,572
All are invited to attend.

237
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:25,315
On Thursday of this week, that's going to be our first Building Bridges to Kindergarten presentation.

238
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,537
That presentation is taking place by Zoom.

239
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,698
It's from 630 to 730 PM this Thursday, January 13th.

240
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:40,136
I also want to share that on Monday, January 17.

241
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:49,462
Next Monday, it is a holiday, it is no school, we will be celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

242
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:50,503
and his legacy.

243
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:54,546
The West Medford Community Center.

244
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:59,083
along with many of our students from CCSR.

245
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,712
We will be hosting it at the high school.

246
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:07,239
It will be remotely due to COVID.

247
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,926
due to our COVID concerns.

248
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:17,789
So it will be available on Zoom and we are working to see if we can collaborate with the TV studio to have that aired.

249
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,231
So I will be sending additional communications regarding our Martin Luther King Jr.

250
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:27,273
event on Monday, January 17th.

251
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:35,596
I also wanna say that I'd like to warmly welcome to our community, the West Medford Community Center,

252
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:41,461
has hired their new executive director in the person of Lisa Crossman.

253
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,843
And so I would like to warmly welcome Lisa.

254
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:50,788
Lisa comes to Medford with over 20 years of experience working with youth and community organizations.

255
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:56,233
So we welcome her to our community as she will be interfacing with many, many of our students.

256
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:09,200
I also would like to take this brief moment to just share with the committee that the Medford Public Schools will be working with the equity process.

257
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:19,642
They will be conducting our preliminary equity audit in light of the pandemic and many of the concerns that we had.

258
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:25,603
We are starting our equity audit in phases.

259
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:27,284
So phase one,

260
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:33,080
We will be working and looking at a lot of documentation.

261
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:46,487
And so some of the things that will be taking place during phase one, which is this portion of the year between January and June of this school year, is the equity process.

262
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:49,728
They will be examining many of our documents and relevant data.

263
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:56,432
They will be looking at our policies and practices around school culture.

264
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,529
They will be...

265
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,053
providing feedback and guidance to our race equity task force.

266
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:17,198
They will be offering our school committee members voluntary interviews, but they would like to have some one-on-one interviews with school committee members.

267
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:30,246
They would also like to begin conversations with students and families in the forms of potential focus groups and or surveys.

268
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:41,547
And so this first phase of the work that they're going to be doing is going to help us begin to think about the systems and structures that we have in place.

269
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:48,350
The founder is Cindy Weeks Bradley and the co-founder is Elizabeth Redley.

270
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:59,356
I would like to share a little bit of their, how could I say, what their mission statement

271
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,493
and vision statement is for the work that they're going to be doing in Medford.

272
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:15,904
So the equity process, their mission statement is through social and academic discourse, coaching, leadership, and the implementation of research and evidence-based practices.

273
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:24,933
Our mission is to create a symbiotic relationship between equity, anti-bias, and culturally inclusive practices.

274
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:54,992
They focus on incorporating systems and structures that allow school districts and other clients to foster positive relations and relationships with people of all races, cultures, ethnicities, ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations to create learning environments wherein all people feel valued

275
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:56,352
and welcomed.

276
00:24:56,812 --> 00:25:18,100
So I am really excited about beginning this process with the equity process and I look forward to having them come and present more detailed information to the school committee so they will come at one of our upcoming meetings to just you know introduce themselves to you so you'll be able to

277
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,692
have a greater understanding of the work that they're gonna do with us during this season.

278
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:36,655
But I just wanted to officially present to you that we are working with the equity process and I look forward to getting them in front of you at either our next meeting or the meeting after that.

279
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:41,176
So in closing, what I would like to say from my- Oh, sorry.

280
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:42,237
Do you want me to wait to close?

281
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:45,018
I just had a question, Mayor, on that specific.

282
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:53,790
Dr. Edwin Vincent, how would you like to, would you like to finish and then member McLaughlin can ask a question?

283
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:58,172
Yes, yes, I would just finish and then I will take your question.

284
00:25:58,332 --> 00:25:58,672
Thank you.

285
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:14,279
As we begin 2022, I would like to share a few lines from our poet, Amanda Gorman's New Days lyric that she wrote to celebrate the new year and honor the hurt and humanity of last year.

286
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:20,756
She says, this hope is our door, our portal.

287
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:30,420
Even if we never get back to normal, someday we can venture beyond it to leave the known and take the first steps.

288
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:36,943
So let us not return to what was normal, but reach toward what is next.

289
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:38,564
Thank you.

290
00:26:40,905 --> 00:26:42,226
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

291
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:43,026
Member McLaughlin?

292
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:45,088
Thank you.

293
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,710
Thank you for those inspiring words, Dr. Edwin-Vincent.

294
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,351
It's always good to hear.

295
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:54,495
For the equity process, is that actually the name of the company?

296
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:56,896
So if we want to Google it, it's equity process?

297
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:59,238
Yes, it is equity process.

298
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:08,664
Okay, and so I'm from what I heard you say there's going to there's an equity audit that's taking place in this will be phase one of how many did you say how many phases.

299
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:20,591
Due to the pandemic, I really felt like there, there is a portion where they will go into schools and also do you know more in depth.

300
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:32,999
review of what's happening in schools, but in light of the pandemic and in light of all of the testing, I asked to hold off on that portion of the equity audit until next school year.

301
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:43,647
And so, this first preliminary phase will be them really looking at a lot of our documents, conducting interviews,

302
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:56,913
working with central leadership and really limiting them going into every single building just in light of all that we're dealing with with the pandemic right now.

303
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:59,114
And so that's how they've been working.

304
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:05,177
And they just completed their process in Linfield.

305
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:10,340
So that is something that I could possibly just share with you as well.

306
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:14,552
So phase one of two, then since we'll delay, yeah.

307
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:27,915
Depending on where we are with the pandemic, it could potentially be a three-year process for us to get all of the information and be able to start implementing changes.

308
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:37,116
So as part of the document review, they will be spending time looking at documents, human resources, hiring.

309
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:39,677
They'll be looking at a lot of

310
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:50,704
other pieces that don't involve too much direct involvement with people in light of the pandemic and just trying to be extra safe right now.

311
00:28:51,204 --> 00:28:51,925
That's great news.

312
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,426
I'm really excited to hear about that.

313
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,026
Thank you.

314
00:28:54,367 --> 00:29:09,337
And I know, I'm sure it was just an oversight in terms of the reading of the statement, but I know that said you were saying equity in terms of culture, gender, you know, you were listing a number of different items and I just didn't hear ability, but I'm sure that's part of it, right?

315
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:14,218
It definitely is part of the work that they're doing.

316
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:20,859
And when they present, you definitely can drill down and ask some targeted questions around that.

317
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:24,520
But they're not looking at it as just one lane.

318
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,641
They're looking at it as a much wider scope of work.

319
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,581
OK, great.

320
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:30,301
Thank you so much.

321
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,021
Sounds great.

322
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,021
Thank you.

323
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:34,402
Thank you.

324
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,226
There are no other questions.

325
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:55,011
We're going to move on to number two, which is a COVID update, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, David Murphy, and Avery Hines, Director of Health Services, who will both report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Medford Public Schools.

326
00:29:55,411 --> 00:30:03,593
The topics will include COVID protocols, COVID testing, vaccination clinics, quarantining, sports, transportation, and staffing attendance.

327
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:06,314
I'm gonna turn it over to Mr. Murphy and Ms.

328
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:06,614
Hines.

329
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:14,252
Dr. Cushing, if you could just put that one slide up to help us frame the conversation.

330
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,253
Tonight, Ms.

331
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:23,338
Hines and I will be focusing on these three sort of primary pillars of our COVID-19 response and defense.

332
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:27,294
And they break down basically along three buckets.

333
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:32,076
And we can talk a little bit about athletics, transportation, and how those things intersect with these areas.

334
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:40,721
But generally speaking, we should think of this conversation from a starting point, at least, along the lines of vaccines, testing, and the protocols that we have in place.

335
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:50,486
With respect to the vaccines, as the superintendent mentioned in her comments, we are running a vaccine clinic at Medford High School that's staffed by our health services staff.

336
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:53,148
So the school nurses that the superintendent

337
00:30:54,369 --> 00:31:10,076
correctly described as leading us through this difficult period and certainly being stretched beyond any reasonable expectation with regard to capacity are running these clinics from three to six every Wednesday for the foreseeable future under Ms.

338
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,236
Hines' leadership.

339
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:23,922
In addition to those clinics, and we mentioned this in a few of the communications that have gone out recently, our nurses are also phone banking and contacting families of students who are as yet unvaccinated

340
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:27,566
and encouraging them to register to participate in the clinics.

341
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:31,008
We've had a very successful start to these clinics.

342
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:31,989
Ms.

343
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:42,597
Hines can read through some of the numbers, but essentially we've either vaccinated or boosted hundreds of individuals already and have hundreds more signed up for Wednesday.

344
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:49,323
Not surprisingly, we did have a number of students who were signed up to get vaccinated on January 5th

345
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:55,685
unfortunately were unable to participate because they had been identified either as a close contact or had tested positive.

346
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:59,008
That is something to be expected with regard to the surge.

347
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:07,313
But even with that, with dozens of individuals being disqualified temporarily, we've still seen a very successful rollout.

348
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:11,275
And it's our hope that that will continue over the course of the next several weeks.

349
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:18,480
With regard to testing, testing has been a centerpiece of our COVID strategy for over a year now.

350
00:32:19,365 --> 00:32:27,231
As you know, we've had a partnership with Tufts University that has allowed us to put together one of the more robust surveillance testing programs in the state.

351
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:48,788
One of the topics that we wanted to introduce tonight, and I expect that we will be communicating to the school committee additional information in the coming days and weeks, our surveillance testing program, while highly successful, both with regard to participation, and we think keeping COVID out of the schools, was not designed for the current COVID environment.

352
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:53,397
It was not designed for a situation in which we have this level of positivity.

353
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:59,900
Frankly, it was not designed for a post-vaccine period of the pandemic.

354
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:08,205
And so we are, at the moment, facing significant sustainability issues with regard to the surveillance testing program.

355
00:33:08,705 --> 00:33:16,789
And while we will continue individual PCR testing, as we did last week, as opposed to full testing, and I'll get into that distinction in a moment,

356
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:25,126
both this week and next week, there is a critical need for us to transition back to pooled testing before the end of the month.

357
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:41,336
It is our hope that that transition will correspond with a reduction in positivity that is generally being forecasted, although obviously no one has a crystal ball of this and we all know how unpredictable the virus has been to date.

358
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,185
But assuming that those numbers do begin to decline, it would make sense for us to transition into pool testing.

359
00:33:49,086 --> 00:34:00,496
But more to the point, the lab that we are partnering with has communicated to us quite clearly that pool testing will be all that's available toward the end of this month.

360
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,737
And so we are preparing for that transition.

361
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,362
We are going to institute some changes in practice with regards to the pool testing toward the end of the month.

362
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:21,037
essentially will lessen the size of the pools, reduce the size of the pools, and that will, we think, allow us to maintain some degree of sustainability for the surveillance program through the end of January.

363
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:37,329
At that point in February, and again, obviously, we'll be looking at the data all along and making decisions that are data-driven, there's a likelihood that we will need to begin to transition from the surveillance testing phase to the diagnostic testing phase.

364
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:44,136
And we've been asked several questions in this forum and others about when Medford would eventually adopt the test and stay program.

365
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:48,159
We've been very clear that we want our vaccination rates to be higher.

366
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,121
Before we make that transition.

367
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:59,226
That is a sort of a principal position that we adopted earlier this school year and we think it was the right decision at the time.

368
00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:08,361
but the level of positivity as a result of the surge does have an impact on the sustainability of that position as well.

369
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:19,095
And so there should be an expectation that at some point in February, we will likely make that transition away from surveillance testing and toward a diagnostic testing phase.

370
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,902
The third bucket is with regard to the protocols that are in place.

371
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:34,369
We've had a lot of questions in recent weeks about whether the district will adopt the now CDC-endorsed five-day isolation period, which also Ms.

372
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,971
Hines can speak to how that affects the quarantine period for those who are deemed close contacts.

373
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,394
We are anticipating at this point making that transition effective next week.

374
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,193
This is being done in coordination with the Board of Health and the city who have already endorsed the five-day provision.

375
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:54,235
There are a variety of reasons as to why we think that's the right decision.

376
00:35:55,116 --> 00:36:06,382
We've tried to stick with the science and with the data throughout this period and deferring to the CDC and DPH has generally been a practice that has worked for us.

377
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:09,004
In addition to wanting to follow the science,

378
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:13,511
There are some questions around just our ability to communicate clearly.

379
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:22,957
It's very difficult for families who are being told potentially by a family physician that the isolation period is five days, and then they're being told by their school nurse that it's 10 days.

380
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:26,619
That's leading to some difficulty and some challenges.

381
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,244
And so, again, the science can walk through the specifics of what are the other elements of those protocols around the five-day isolation period.

382
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:39,028
But ultimately, we feel that that's a transition that we'll need to make next week.

383
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:59,461
The DESE mandate with regard to face masks, we will have to make our own decision at a local level eventually with regard to masking, but at least through the end of February, that decision is essentially out of our hands as the commissioner has mandated a mask mandate for all employees and students in a school environment through the end of February.

384
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:08,105
Our distancing guidelines remain the same and our contact tracing protocols, of which I know there are a lot of questions, will likely evolve

385
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:15,630
consistent or there'll be a corresponding with our transition into the diagnostic testing.

386
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:30,462
So that is both a sort of a lay of the land as to where we are right now with regard to our COVID protocols, testing and vaccines, and what members and community members should expect over the course of the next month.

387
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:31,703
I'm going to ask Ms.

388
00:37:31,743 --> 00:37:36,527
Hines to talk a little bit about the data that we have collected over the course of the last week.

389
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:42,326
I think as the committee knows, and anyone who's been following the news know, it has been a difficult week.

390
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:48,649
It's been a week in which we have seen the effects of this COVID surge firsthand.

391
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:59,113
It has posed, as it has over the course of the pandemic, a significant disruption to the continuity of learning that students need and that families in Medford expect.

392
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:05,236
And it's something that we're doing our best to have as whole of an organization response to as possible.

393
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:11,508
I know that there are some questions with regard to specifics around student absenteeism and staff absenteeism.

394
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:21,813
I want to say at the outset that we've had, as you can expect, a higher than usual rate of absenteeism amongst both students and staff, concentrated mostly amongst students.

395
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:32,298
Our staff absences have been challenging, but because we do have over a 90% vaccination rate amongst our staff, our staffing situation, while challenging, has not been debilitating.

396
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:37,833
And I say that understanding that within individual school communities, those challenges are disproportionate.

397
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:44,298
And I don't mean in any way to diminish them, but we're not at a place where we've been unable to function.

398
00:38:44,338 --> 00:38:46,500
And I think that's important for members of the community to know.

399
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,744
Before the end of the week, we'll provide some more specifics related to student absenteeism.

400
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:57,269
We don't have specific numbers right now because these numbers are complicated and they fluctuate day to day.

401
00:38:57,912 --> 00:39:06,315
there can be a classroom with a third of the students that are out one day, and then only half of those turn out to be COVID related, and the following day there's only one or two students absent.

402
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:11,497
So we're looking at that closely and making sure that those are coded correctly within our student information platform.

403
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,398
And we're gonna try to provide a summary for the committee before the end of the week.

404
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:20,260
But the answer right now is exactly how bad is the absenteeism is.

405
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,142
It's higher than normal, but it's not debilitating, and that's hopefully

406
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:32,097
helpful in terms of tiding everyone over until we're able to really collect that data, scrub it, and make sure that we're reporting accurately.

407
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:41,466
So on the data note, Dr. Cushnie, you can, I think, remove this slide and assign some data that's been collected over the course of the last week that we'd like to share with the committee.

408
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:43,208
Thank you.

409
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:47,378
Good evening.

410
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:53,442
So the data that I will be speaking to is what we collected last week, our week back from break.

411
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:55,883
I'm sure that these numbers.

412
00:39:57,202 --> 00:39:58,442
I know that these numbers are high.

413
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:14,326
I think they're probably higher, but with the number of rapid tests and us relying on people to self-report symptoms and self-report at-home rapids, I don't know how accurate it is, but this is what people have given us, and this is what we have found from our health services department and our surveillance testing.

414
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:16,967
Last week, we did 3,271 individual PCR tests.

415
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:18,807
From that, we found 233 positive individuals.

416
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:19,387
Outside of that,

417
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:34,469
We had also had 126 positive individuals report to us their outside testing results.

418
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:43,693
In our in-school surveillance testing, so the 233, that gave us a 7.1% positivity, which is the highest that we've been all year.

419
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:50,096
Again, not surprising, because we see our surrounding communities and also what the nation is going through.

420
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:56,199
It's still just shocking to see the numbers, even though we know that we should have expected this.

421
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:06,052
Um, in terms of the vaccination clinic last week, we did 153 vaccinations.

422
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:09,993
35 of those were five to 11 year olds who got their first dose, which is really encouraging.

423
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:19,055
Uh, seven of those were 12 to 18 year olds that got their first dose 45, 16 through 18 year olds got their booster dose and 35, 18 and over.

424
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:23,377
individuals got their booster doses.

425
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:29,603
We already have 218 appointments scheduled for this Wednesday, which again is very encouraging.

426
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:39,231
My hope is last week we had 210 scheduled and we ended up vaccinating 153 because of the positive individuals in the contact tracing.

427
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:42,954
I hope that we can stay as close to 218 for Wednesday as we are right now, but we'll see.

428
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:56,402
In terms of visits to the nursing office, I think it's important to put into perspective just how much this is affecting us in health services.

429
00:41:57,303 --> 00:42:04,465
We had 111 students come to school with symptoms seeking a test last week, and we only had four days of school.

430
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:09,347
And this is with constant messaging, asking them not to come to school when having symptoms.

431
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:15,750
We can recognize that there are very few testing sites, and even though rapid tests are available,

432
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:23,985
They're only available if they're on the shelves and not many places have them on the shelves, but it's really bogging down our nursing offices.

433
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:33,290
And as much as we would love to provide a free testing site for everyone, individuals are coming into school with symptoms and exposing others for the sake of a free and fast test.

434
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:43,075
We also had 326 people call or email our nursing offices reporting exposure, whether that be from outside of school or in the home.

435
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:49,868
Our phones are ringing off the hook and it's very hard to keep up between testing and seeing students in the offices.

436
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:56,933
In our four days throughout the district, we had 1,769 visits to the health offices.

437
00:42:57,653 --> 00:42:59,074
So that's even outside of COVID.

438
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:03,657
Those are our daily visits for kids with medications, diabetes, seizure disorders.

439
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:11,442
When we say that this is unsustainable, I mean, we all knew the surge was coming, but I think it's a little,

440
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:26,734
it's skyrocketing the amount of work that these nurses are doing daily in their offices on top of continuing to agree to come to the, and do these vaccine clinics and, you know, stay late and contact trace or do it on the weekends.

441
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:33,217
I think numbers are really important and they speak volumes when words might not be enough.

442
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:35,078
So I just wanted to share those numbers with you.

443
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:38,260
Thank you, Avery.

444
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,321
So we understand that

445
00:43:40,697 --> 00:44:02,009
This is obviously a lot of information and this surge and the implications of the surge are not going to be sort of wrapped up in a bow this evening, but we did want to communicate as clearly as possible to the school committee and to the community that some of the systems that we put in place

446
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:10,902
additional maintenance activities, for instance, or upgraded filters are pieces that are going to outlast or outlive the pandemic in any phase of it.

447
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:22,546
Other pieces were set up for a period of time that has now passed, and we have a responsibility to be nimble enough to respond to that.

448
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:27,987
That doesn't mean we pull the rug out and start changing things right now, particularly at the height of a surge.

449
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:29,348
That's not going to be the case.

450
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,889
But it is important from a planning perspective and from

451
00:44:33,456 --> 00:44:47,562
the perspective of working with our partners at Tufts and Broad, and eventually with the CIC through the state's test and stay program, we have a responsibility to keep you as informed as possible as to the need to eventually make that transition.

452
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:50,344
And that is part of what we wanted to communicate tonight.

453
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:54,846
So with that, we're happy to answer your questions as best as we are able to.

454
00:44:57,907 --> 00:44:58,967
Thank you, Mr. Murphy and Ms.

455
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,408
Hines.

456
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:02,309
If there's no question,

457
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:04,064
Member McLaughlin.

458
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:06,185
Yeah, that's me.

459
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:06,585
Thank you.

460
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:08,807
Thank you for this report.

461
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:09,287
And Ms.

462
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,409
Hines, thank you for all the hard work you guys are doing.

463
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:13,030
And special thank you to the nurses.

464
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,912
I just can't imagine all that you guys are going through.

465
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:17,473
Those numbers are really revealing.

466
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:19,395
So data definitely tells a story.

467
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:21,356
Thank you for collecting that data.

468
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:22,357
It's important to hear.

469
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:27,714
I'm wondering about the at-home testing.

470
00:45:28,354 --> 00:45:43,344
So I've talked to a few community members who have had extended quarantining, having been exposed more than once and having to quarantine back-to-back which has led to a significant amount of time out of school.

471
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:53,729
And in some of these particular cases for students with disabilities, learning disabilities, which exacerbates the learning issue even more, as you can imagine.

472
00:45:54,509 --> 00:46:01,994
And is it accurate that a negative at-home test does not qualify for return to school?

473
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,735
It can only be a PCR test?

474
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:12,161
Because what I'm hearing from families is PCR testing can be an additional week to obtain, you know, several hours outside in the below,

475
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:18,041
you know, freezing temperatures, trying to wait in line to get a PCR test and what have you.

476
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:23,667
So unless parents are able to get PCR tests for students, they're not able to return.

477
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:30,675
But with at-home tests, I know several districts do use the at-home test for negative acceptability.

478
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:32,878
And are we or are we not allowing that?

479
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:40,069
So previously the DESI guidance and the DPH guidance has been that we would not accept rapid home tests.

480
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:48,716
When we transition to the five-day quarantine for close contacts, we will then accept rapid tests.

481
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:55,101
So that would be next week because it is a new DESI guidance that we have not yet adopted.

482
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,283
Okay, so that's next week, so that's January 17th, Dave, is that what was on the slide?

483
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:02,424
That's correct, yep, next week.

484
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:19,296
And the reason for that, just for purposes of providing some context was, I mean, I think most people are familiar with this, the CDC's guidance sort of came out in a somewhat clunky fashion around shortening the 10-day to a five-day period.

485
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:25,921
So wanting both to, for the CDC's sort of

486
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:48,458
delayed rollout of their own guidance to have presumably been completed, and also knowing that given that we are at the height of a surge and wanting to examine the data as best we could at a local level, that is why we held off from immediately making the transition in the way that DESE, frankly, did to endorsing the CDC's guidance.

487
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:55,039
But at this point, particularly with those additional safeguards and further articulation that CDC provided,

488
00:47:55,586 --> 00:48:01,013
and working in coordination with the Board of Health, we're comfortable making that transition next week.

489
00:48:02,475 --> 00:48:02,775
Thank you.

490
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,797
And just a follow up question.

491
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:09,985
So if students are out, for example, getting, you know, exposure, because there's so much out there right now, I understand that we're all

492
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:32,224
getting exposed, I think, and having to experience this, but for, you know, young ones who are being exposed multiple times and missing significant amount of school, in some cases, weeks, is there any opportunity for remediation or, you know, or something like that?

493
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:33,504
Thank you.

494
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:37,926
It's a really important question, and it was actually raised by an administrator earlier this evening.

495
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:43,237
And I think the last time we reported on this, if I'm remembering correctly, was on December 7th.

496
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:55,560
And on that meeting, we referred back to some guidance that the administration put out in late October, early November, which was guidance that we developed in consultation with our largest bargaining partner, the Teachers Union.

497
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,721
What we said at the time was that the type of additional support

498
00:49:01,425 --> 00:49:04,427
has to be individualized to the situation.

499
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:12,894
So sometimes that will mean additional after-school hours, which a number of schools have provided, and teachers have been very cooperative in supporting us in.

500
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:17,717
Other times it's been with concurrent instruction in a virtual environment.

501
00:49:18,258 --> 00:49:28,285
And the sort of three prongs that we said that each situation should be reviewed under is what is the grade level, what is the content area, what is the particular lesson.

502
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:29,046
And

503
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:43,482
We continue to encourage administrators to work with teachers and to make sure that each of their classrooms in their school and each of the programs in their school are being looked at on a case-by-case basis to see how we can best provide that additional support.

504
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:53,610
I think in addition to that, we're going to need to roll out a variety of acceleration and remedial support measures in the spring using the ESSER funding.

505
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:58,094
And in doing that, my hope is that we're able to bridge those gaps even further.

506
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:11,828
All that being said, this is a huge disruption to students education and the continuity of instruction and that disruption has a disproportionate impact on some of our more vulnerable learners.

507
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:25,882
We know that and that's something that it is going to be incumbent upon us to be highly vigilant, both this school year during the summer and beyond to make sure that these students educational careers are not defined entirely by this disruption.

508
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:33,771
So I say that only to say, like, we're providing a lot of support and I think we're being very innovative and we're being very vigilant about the work that needs to be done.

509
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:39,956
we should not in any way underestimate the scale of the challenge that is before us.

510
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:49,743
And it gets worse each time we have to send students out, which again, the way to avoid that in many cases is to get vaccinated.

511
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:54,886
And which is why, well, I understand that this is a message that is received differently in different corners.

512
00:50:55,587 --> 00:51:02,872
It is the position of the district that the best way to bring this chapter in our history to a close is for everyone to get vaccinated.

513
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:11,384
Mayor.

514
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:13,165
Thank you.

515
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:20,971
First of all, thank you, Mayor Hines and all of your staff and actually all the staff of MPS.

516
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:33,340
It's hard to fathom that after the exhaustion that was already upon everybody, that somehow that could look like a good day after this last couple of weeks.

517
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:43,299
I have a couple of sort of detailed questions about test and stay.

518
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:50,226
Other districts that have done test and stay, what I've heard from

519
00:51:51,758 --> 00:52:13,427
school committee members and other districts is that because of an inability to have 10,000 tests available per week or more, the nursing staff has had to ration it and decide which symptoms are bad enough to suggest that the students should actually get a rapid test.

520
00:52:14,027 --> 00:52:17,449
And that just seems to me to be reckless and playing with fire.

521
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:20,090
In my mind,

522
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:26,737
If we do test and stay, if a kid comes in and goes sniffles once, we use a test.

523
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:32,482
Are there hopes that we're going to be able to have enough tests to implement test and stay?

524
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:47,854
I mean, I don't know if the supply chain is different for schools than it is for literally the rest of us, but as somebody wrote a funny little thing about trying to get a test on walmart.com, and I almost cried, I laughed so hard.

525
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:54,756
because I mean, I don't know about you all, but I've been to walmart.com probably a thousand times and gotten tests once.

526
00:52:56,377 --> 00:53:04,261
So I just want us to not dangle test and stay if we're not gonna have thousands of tests a week coming in.

527
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:14,986
I also wanna remind everybody who's on the call, not us, not on the members, but that test and stay has nothing to do with your unvaccinated child.

528
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:18,048
It's a friendly reminder that

529
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:25,187
And I did have one question other than the volume of inventory.

530
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:33,189
Is the isolation timeframe the same for unvaccinated students as it is for vaccinated?

531
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,270
Yes.

532
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:41,452
So the isolation timeline would be the same whether you are vaccinated and positive or unvaccinated and positive.

533
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,553
What really determines it is your symptomology.

534
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:47,014
So whether you have symptoms or not when you test positive.

535
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:59,310
That would determine it's a base of five days, meaning a full five day isolation earliest you could return is day six, because you always want to end do that full five days.

536
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:05,898
And then, if you continue to have symptoms or your symptoms aren't improving they're getting worse or you continue with fever.

537
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:08,640
we would not want you coming in on that sixth day.

538
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:14,704
You would continue to isolate because if you're still having symptoms, you're still shedding the virus and you're still infectious.

539
00:54:15,665 --> 00:54:31,956
To touch on the rapid test production and test and stay and having to ration, the test that would be provided for test and stay would be through the state program with CIC who would be doing the test and stay in our offices.

540
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,559
We also have our own ration of rapid tests

541
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:39,762
that our nurses would be administering with symptomatic individuals.

542
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:55,815
If they, you know, after a full nursing assessment, where we're looking at every symptom or even doing some motivational interviewing to see if they have symptoms they might not recognize as symptoms, we would then have our own ration of tests that we could use for those students in our offices.

543
00:54:56,136 --> 00:55:02,241
Whereas test and stay students upon arrival to school, whether they have symptoms or not, are being tested.

544
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:04,803
If they have symptoms and they are close contact,

545
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,224
they would be dismissed until they could get a PCR.

546
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:18,198
Just because they had that exposure and now they're having symptoms, most likely if they're having symptoms, they would test positive on that rapid test during their test and stay procedure.

547
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,502
But again, test and stay is only for

548
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,307
unvaccinated close contacts in the school setting.

549
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:36,230
And it just means they can go to school during that five day timeline where they're being tested daily before school, they would still be required to quarantine outside of school.

550
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:51,995
So it's not a get out of jail free card, it's a be able to go to school and learn safely, but still go home and, you know, try and reduce the amount of people you're seeing between now and when your quarantine period ends to try and, you know, reduce the risk of

551
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:53,768
infecting others.

552
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:58,892
Point of information.

553
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:03,415
Member Hayes is next, but point of information, Member McLaughlin?

554
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:04,876
No, I'll wait for Member Hayes.

555
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:06,517
I just wanted to follow up on something Ms.

556
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,018
Hines said to articulate.

557
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:12,302
I had a question on something she said, so I'll wait for after Member Hayes.

558
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:12,602
Thank you.

559
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:13,889
Thanks.

560
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:14,450
Member Hayes?

561
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:15,871
Hi.

562
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:16,311
Thank you.

563
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:21,475
I want to reiterate what everyone else has said, and thank you all for the work you're doing.

564
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:23,216
This is a really tough time.

565
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:29,741
And I've seen Avery Hines on updating the tracker late at night when I've been checking the tracker.

566
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:32,583
So I know the hours you're putting in, and they're incredible.

567
00:56:32,603 --> 00:56:34,064
And the school nurses have been wonderful.

568
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:37,667
My question is about communication.

569
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:48,061
I know the last meeting there was discussion again of written communication going home rather than just the website and the email.

570
00:56:48,441 --> 00:57:05,352
You know, I think we're at a point given the incredible surge we're in and that we're changing a lot of our procedures that putting some written communication home in backpacks, in folders, I think now is a time to do that.

571
00:57:05,392 --> 00:57:08,835
I know we've been holding off on that with the belief that we could be over

572
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:15,515
over inundating people with information and they might overlook it or ignore it or just feel overwhelmed.

573
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:31,898
But at this point, I think as much communication as we can get to people as possible, even this, I know it would have to be updated because it's already out of date, but the written for tonight that you put together Ms.

574
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:36,919
Hines, something like that with the updated procedures and

575
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:40,064
especially because we really do want to get people vaccinated.

576
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,424
As Mr. Murphy said, that's the key now.

577
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:51,167
So making sure people know about the vaccination clinics, know how to register, I think every way possible that we can get the communication out as necessary.

578
00:57:51,187 --> 00:57:52,947
Thank you, Ms.

579
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:53,187
Hayes.

580
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:55,648
I think that's a point well taken.

581
00:57:55,668 --> 00:58:03,210
And I think with regard to the vaccine clinics, we're trying to, as I'm sure members of the community, I hope have noticed,

582
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:07,769
communicate in every way we possibly can to try to get as much information out there as possible.

583
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:18,717
And I would agree that utilizing the tried and true method of the backpack delivery with regard to the vaccination clinics is a good idea and something that we can work toward in the next week.

584
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:28,164
With regard to some of the other elements, I think you're right that we should broaden the platforms by which we're communicating this information.

585
00:58:29,488 --> 00:58:32,850
I would just ask that we hold off until we're actually implementing some of these changes.

586
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:37,092
So tonight is sort of a forecast of changes that will go into effect in the coming weeks.

587
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:50,059
And I think as we get closer to that period, keeping an eye on the data in the interim period, so that we can confirm that we actually do make some of these shifts, which we think are inevitable, and we'll also

588
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:55,620
Again, we're hoping that it corresponds with some of the projections around the data of the surge.

589
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:04,622
But I think assuming that the next week, the 10 days plays out as we hope it will, that will be the time that we will likely put some information out there.

590
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:15,104
And I think that proceeding that could very well be the vaccination clinics wanting to make sure that it's out there in as many different languages and as many different methods as we possibly can.

591
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:20,005
So thank you for that suggestion, and we'll put that into practice in the coming days.

592
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:24,939
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

593
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:27,693
Yes, thank you.

594
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:36,941
I want to reiterate member Hayes to the chair as well for that need for communication and friendly suggestion for a visual flow chart communication for these things.

595
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:43,606
I think visuals help a lot of families and a lot of people do the TLDR sort of method, too long, didn't read.

596
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:55,196
And so, you know, a simple visual where, you know, if you're this, yes, if you're not, no, and sort of, you know, what the next thing is with the vaccination clinics at the bottom, one page could be really helpful.

597
00:59:55,814 --> 00:59:59,438
and even a ticker on Medford Community Meter on the vaccination methods.

598
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:01,500
I think there's a lot of ways to sort of reach folks.

599
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,386
But the follow-up question that I had was, I'm not sure that I understood you correctly.

600
01:00:07,426 --> 01:00:17,057
Did you say that it's the unvaccinated that will get the test for the test and stay or the unvaccinated will get the test for the test and stay?

601
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:22,955
Vaccinated individuals are not required to quarantine or test after exposure.

602
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:30,179
So it would be those that are unvaccinated in our schools that have in-school exposure that are able to participate in test and stay.

603
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:36,043
If they have an outside of school exposure, they are not able to participate in test and stay for that exposure.

604
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,726
It is only for in-school exposure for unvaccinated individuals.

605
01:00:40,256 --> 01:00:43,037
Okay, and then if they have an out-of-school, that's good to know.

606
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:44,718
That's a really big differentiation.

607
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:45,419
It is.

608
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,060
And so, yeah, that has to be really driven home.

609
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:56,965
And so for out-of-school exposure, it will likely change, though, from what we're hearing.

610
01:00:57,025 --> 01:01:05,249
We don't know, Dave, but it seems like as of January 17th, it will change from requiring a PCR test to an at-home test.

611
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,791
Yeah, in conjunction with the reduction of the isolation period.

612
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:11,347
Reduction to five days, you mean?

613
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:12,168
Correct.

614
01:01:12,328 --> 01:01:12,888
Yeah.

615
01:01:12,928 --> 01:01:13,649
From 10 to five.

616
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:20,093
Yeah, in conjunction with, so if they have a positive five days, if they have a negative, obviously they can come back to school, right?

617
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,474
If they don't have a fever.

618
01:01:22,275 --> 01:01:35,164
As Avery pointed out, and I think symptomology was the word that was used, I'm going out on a limb using myself, but it's really contingent upon the levels, the symptoms that the person is experiencing.

619
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:37,226
Okay, thank you.

620
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:41,596
Thank you both.

621
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:43,999
Oh, member Graham?

622
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:52,670
Member Graham?

623
01:01:55,598 --> 01:01:56,579
Sorry, I was on mute.

624
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:11,666
Has there been any talk amongst the CDC or the DPH about changes to the protocol for vaccinated students, meaning vaccinated students are not required to quarantine today if they are a close contact, correct?

625
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:14,507
They're only required to quarantine if they test positive.

626
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:19,049
Has there been any discussion of a change to that with the

627
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:28,184
sort of significant spread happening with Omicron, or has that not been in the medical realm?

628
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:34,386
Not that it's been shared with us, and we can, I think we can only draw inferences as to why that would be the case.

629
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:35,727
Ms.

630
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:40,949
Hines, as the medical professional, can speak to any of that.

631
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:50,793
I think the inferences, it's about the severity of the illness, but it's an inference, no explicit guidance or anything along those lines.

632
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:59,024
So we're not foreseeing a change that would require vaccinated students to do something different than they are doing today.

633
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:19,855
No, and I think the CDC's endorsement of the test and stay for unvaccinated students would be an indication that, I think that makes it less likely that we're going to see guidance that moves further in the direction of pulling students out of the school environment.

634
01:03:20,812 --> 01:03:25,975
And that is the inference I would draw from their endorsement of the test and stay with respect to unvaccinated individuals.

635
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:37,820
That if unvaccinated individuals are being allowed to stay, provided that they're taking a daily test, then the likelihood that a vaccinated individual will be told that they have to quarantine seems remote to me.

636
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:43,674
And are we seeing or is there data available at the state level yet?

637
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:52,682
I know there's a lot of talk about breakthrough infections and I know plenty of folks who are fully vaccinated adults who have experienced breakthrough infections.

638
01:03:53,123 --> 01:04:04,473
Is there data about breakthrough infections amongst our school age population yet that is worth discussing just in terms of like the data points that it might provide?

639
01:04:06,272 --> 01:04:15,682
So I'm sure I mean we track all of the positives again that we know about that data could be pulled, it would take some time, especially with the current search just now.

640
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:22,752
happening just from being back from break and being so busy, but it is available.

641
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:26,014
It would be a manner of pulling it together and making it make sense.

642
01:04:26,494 --> 01:04:29,155
But again, I don't know how accurate it would be.

643
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:32,056
It's only as accurate as people are truthful with us.

644
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:43,562
It'll include all of our surveillance testing data, but it doesn't necessarily include the district as a whole community because we're relying on a lot of people reporting those rapid at-home tests.

645
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:52,842
Yeah, where we probably have a slightly more reliable data set because there's a few other variables and incentives at stake amongst our employees.

646
01:04:53,483 --> 01:05:01,326
And I think we can say certainly anecdotally that our staff that is vaccinated and boosted, we're seeing a lower positivity rate.

647
01:05:02,227 --> 01:05:04,668
We're not seeing a sky-high positivity rate amongst staff.

648
01:05:04,788 --> 01:05:06,009
I'm not going to say this.

649
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:12,772
And I don't think it's a stretch to say that that is attributable in whole or in part.

650
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:16,352
to the very high level of vaccination amongst our staff.

651
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:29,776
We're not at 100%, which is why we've asked nurses to take on the role of telethon workers in addition to vaccinators and testers, because we want to push that number up as high as we can possibly go.

652
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:34,618
And that's a conversation that we continue to have with each of our bargaining partners, and we've made our position very clear.

653
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:49,210
and may well be making requests to the committee in the near future regarding the possibility of setting out definitive rules and policy with respect to vaccination amongst staff.

654
01:05:49,270 --> 01:06:02,314
So there is, again, it's anecdotal, but we can definitely say that being vaccinated and boosted, it seems to be putting you in a different category around positivity rates.

655
01:06:03,944 --> 01:06:10,985
And last week, leading up to the vaccine clinics, I heard and saw a number of people

656
01:06:12,773 --> 01:06:29,684
commenting about how the system was full and it wasn't at various points in time, but I think the question I have is like, is there a lit, like if a thousand people showed up on Wednesday, do you have a thousand doses to dish out or is there an upper limit?

657
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:41,011
Like, I just want as many people to go to those clinics as possible because the way for your child to go to school every day is for them to get fully vaccinated, which does take time.

658
01:06:42,052 --> 01:06:47,236
the sooner you start, the sooner you can sort of be in that clear space.

659
01:06:48,117 --> 01:06:49,258
That's a really good question.

660
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:54,102
It's really a question for the Board of Health because that's our supplier.

661
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:56,664
What I can say, and Ms.

662
01:06:56,684 --> 01:07:01,427
Hines obviously correct me if I misspeak, but we've got 218 people signed up right now.

663
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:06,831
We've definitely got 218, a supply that will cover that.

664
01:07:07,312 --> 01:07:08,913
We have a supply that will cover more than that.

665
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:09,914
And

666
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:39,610
While we did accept walk-ins at the last clinic, and we are likely to be able to accept walk-ins at this clinic, part of our marketing strategy, if you will, is to implement a registration system, which one, there are organizational logistical reasons that we need to do that, but the registration is also a way of sort of creating a supply-demand equation

667
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,743
that we hope incentivizes people to come out.

668
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:50,906
But if you find yourself in a situation in which you didn't register, it would be a good idea to come to the clinic anyway.

669
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:53,047
It's likely you'll get vaccinated.

670
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:56,288
And if we're fortunate enough to have the types of numbers that Ms.

671
01:07:56,308 --> 01:08:05,172
Graham is suggesting, at a minimum, you'll leave with a free of charge registration for the next clinic, which is always a good thing as well.

672
01:08:10,776 --> 01:08:11,096
Thank you.

673
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:12,677
Thank you for the presentation.

674
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:17,941
We're going to move on to our member credits member credits.

675
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:22,784
Hi.

676
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:23,905
Hi.

677
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,046
Yes, thank you.

678
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:32,231
Miss Hines Mr Murphy and everybody for the report, and, you know, all the nurses for everything you're doing.

679
01:08:33,392 --> 01:08:35,473
So I just wanted to know if.

680
01:08:36,534 --> 01:08:42,517
Currently on our website, we do have the Medford School COVID exposure guidance.

681
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:46,338
So will that be updated for next week?

682
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:54,362
Because it still has some of the information, you know, tested positive for COVID-19, must isolate for 10 days.

683
01:08:54,382 --> 01:09:02,846
I think that will have to be updated, you know, if we could, you know, in preparation for next week,

684
01:09:05,356 --> 01:09:06,676
Yeah, I agree.

685
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:17,079
This presentation is actually the first time that we're publicly committing to a, I think anyway, publicly committing to making that transition.

686
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:25,701
So we've got people, frankly, that are on a 10-day quarantine or isolation period right now, and we're trying to be as clear as we possibly can.

687
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:33,003
But all that information will eventually be updated upon implementation of this or shortly before that.

688
01:09:35,154 --> 01:09:40,099
If we weren't confident we're gonna make this transition, we wouldn't be obviously speaking about it publicly tonight.

689
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:48,107
At the same time, we are looking at the data on a day-to-day basis and we want the data to drive these decisions.

690
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:55,655
So that's why we're just being somewhat careful and moving at a somewhat methodical pace to make some of these changes.

691
01:09:57,016 --> 01:09:57,337
Thank you.

692
01:09:58,658 --> 01:10:10,683
Mayor, can I also ask where's the, I'm on the website trying to find the vaccination clinic information and maybe I'm just overlooking it, but is it on the main page or is there a link to the clinic?

693
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:12,924
MedfordMA.org.

694
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:19,086
It's in a couple of different places, but we can take a look at it and make sure that it's more front and center if we need to.

695
01:10:19,955 --> 01:10:22,159
Yeah, it's not on the main page for the school site.

696
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:31,455
So medfordma.org for folks that want to register just to put that out there now, but on the school page, maybe we could have it in a prominent place for folks too.

697
01:10:31,495 --> 01:10:32,036
That'd be great.

698
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:32,397
Thank you.

699
01:10:33,266 --> 01:10:36,709
And Mayor, I just had one more request.

700
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:48,040
When we communicate about this change that's upcoming to the guidance, I think we need to be really abundantly clear about what an in school exposure is and what it is not.

701
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:52,345
So I'm, I'm assuming that if your child is exposed

702
01:10:53,117 --> 01:10:58,242
through youth sports in Medford that that does not qualify as an in school exposure.

703
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:10,314
I don't know what that means for like school sponsored athletics, but I just want us to be really like upfront and clear about which exposures count because my.

704
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:28,016
My commentary from folks in other districts are that there's like really very few people getting COVID from school, which means there's very few people doing test and stay, but it doesn't mean that kids are not exposed elsewhere, but they will not qualify.

705
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:32,099
They will still have to quarantine if they are exposed elsewhere.

706
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,161
So I just want to make sure that all of those

707
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:49,182
like car bots are really clear to people so that, you know, if and when their child is exposed that it's clear what that means based on like where that exposure came from.

708
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:55,764
Yes, we can definitely do our best to get that information out there.

709
01:11:57,185 --> 01:12:02,427
And I think the sort of add on to that is we wanna provide as much information

710
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:11,853
families and community members as possible as to what the steps are that they should take when there's exposure anywhere.

711
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:14,394
We think that's a valuable service to provide to families.

712
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:32,285
At the same time, part of the challenge that we're dealing with now is, at least this is my view anyway, and again, I think it might be there's some opinion embedded in this, but we've become a very good resource

713
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:35,839
for all things COVID in the community.

714
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,441
We have a very good testing program.

715
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:43,606
We have a tremendous amount of vaccine accessibility that we've been able to build up through the schools.

716
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:54,515
We have a responsibility to make sure that our desire to be a resource for the community does not diminish our capacity to execute our core mission of educating children.

717
01:12:55,095 --> 01:13:01,080
And I think that we have a pronounced responsibility to do that as the nature of the,

718
01:13:03,918 --> 01:13:06,379
role the virus plays in society changes.

719
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:11,641
So as we, we're not transitioning tonight to endemic phase, right?

720
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:12,821
We all recognize that.

721
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:28,326
But as we sort of grapple with the reality that COVID is going to be present in our lives indefinitely, there's a need for us to change the way in which we as a school system focused on education operationalize our response.

722
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:32,745
And I think what we owe to the community is to be as clear as possible.

723
01:13:32,765 --> 01:13:40,930
And when we make those transitions, provide as much context as we can and provide as much accurate information to the community as we can.

724
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:44,873
Thank you very much.

725
01:13:44,893 --> 01:13:53,899
I know member McLaughlin just put the link in the chat so you can go on that school link or you can go to medfordma.org to register.

726
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,564
Next, we have number three.

727
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,765
There, I think there's one more hand, sorry.

728
01:14:01,465 --> 01:14:01,805
Thank you.

729
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:16,928
One last question, just can you give an update on the possibility of, it was discussed last time, the in-school, school day vaccinations for those who might not be able to access the high school, afterschool?

730
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:18,288
Honestly, Ms.

731
01:14:18,308 --> 01:14:19,348
Hayes, thank you for that question.

732
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:22,049
As I said the last time, we definitely want to do that.

733
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:23,749
We think that's really important, particularly for our 11,

734
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:28,927
excuse me, our five to 11 year old population, we don't have a specific date yet.

735
01:14:29,307 --> 01:14:39,391
And I don't, it is something we are, we're gonna have to work closely with the board of health because it's gonna change a little bit the registration process, but it's something that we're gonna work on.

736
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:41,992
And my hope would be that we'd be able to do that within the coming weeks.

737
01:14:43,933 --> 01:14:44,273
Thank you.

738
01:14:46,514 --> 01:14:46,794
Thank you.

739
01:14:48,888 --> 01:14:55,233
We have report number three, which is an assessment update.

740
01:14:55,313 --> 01:15:05,782
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education, Dr. Peter Cushing, will present on the status of upcoming assessments at the secondary level, grades six through 12.

741
01:15:06,403 --> 01:15:07,003
Dr. Cushing.

742
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,586
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

743
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:13,829
It's great to speak on something that is part of our core academic function.

744
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:24,317
assessment, um, and making sure that we're, uh, really understanding where our students are and how, uh, we can best move forward.

745
01:15:24,337 --> 01:15:30,240
Uh, last week we received a verbal update from the state that was confirmed in the commissioner's written update today.

746
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:40,545
Uh, and Mr. Teixeira will talk more about this in his update, but, um, the window for access testing has been extended to March 4th.

747
01:15:40,705 --> 01:15:43,386
It's original end was, uh, February 10th.

748
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:54,747
So that will then give us a little bit of an opportunity to shift around what was our planned NWA math growth test.

749
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:59,871
So we're going to be, we are talking about shifting our assessments.

750
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:03,614
We don't want to line these assessments up so that students are over-assessed.

751
01:16:03,974 --> 01:16:06,216
It's definitely something that we want to be wary of.

752
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,739
And following this second assessment at

753
01:16:11,423 --> 01:16:23,228
the secondary level, we will be issuing reports to parents that will show growth from the first assessment that was done in the fall as compared to the second assessment, and then there'll be a third assessment at the end of the year.

754
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:35,733
We anticipate the reports will be given to parents and caregivers in early February, and we're currently targeting the first week of February in light of the potential to move up the assessment window.

755
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:38,514
The secondary team will also be providing a,

756
01:16:40,874 --> 01:16:48,618
an information session with other opportunities for parents to learn about their student scores, what they mean.

757
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:52,240
There's gonna be some new language that'll be new to parents.

758
01:16:52,340 --> 01:17:09,769
So we wanna provide multiple opportunities, one main opportunity, but then multiple other opportunities for parents to be able to understand the data and to understand these reports that will be part of their child's academic portfolio moving forward in our district.

759
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:14,033
I also wanted to provide an update on PSAT for grades 10 and 11.

760
01:17:14,753 --> 01:17:24,864
So earlier this year in October, we provided free to all students, which is a really great thing because it's about equity and access.

761
01:17:25,805 --> 01:17:33,273
And while college is not the only answer for students looking at their post-secondary life, many students do go that route.

762
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:45,699
So 550 10th and 11th graders out of a population of 627, so that's approximately 88% in that grade span took the assessment.

763
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,340
Some students opted out, that was their choice, it wasn't a requirement.

764
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:55,562
Data was returned to the district last week and we have just begun our analysis.

765
01:17:56,362 --> 01:18:01,724
As I mentioned previously, one of the great things about the PSAT being delivered in grades 10 and 11,

766
01:18:02,805 --> 01:18:07,348
is it allows us access to a tool called AP Potential.

767
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:15,513
And what AP Potential does is it allows us to identify students who are likely to score a three or higher on an AP exam.

768
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:16,554
Why is that important?

769
01:18:17,014 --> 01:18:28,662
Well, because if those students score three or higher on an AP exam, they may have their cost of college or the number of courses required reduced, which for,

770
01:18:29,127 --> 01:18:43,190
Many students will then offer them an opportunity to say, add a master's degree within four years, or may offer the opportunity just to reduce the overall burden of the exorbitant cost at colleges, right?

771
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:47,011
So this gives us a real recruitment tool to go and find students.

772
01:18:47,651 --> 01:18:51,112
This is not a tool to discourage anyone.

773
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:56,953
So if you don't hit on AP potential, but you wanna take on the mantle, you wanna take on the challenge,

774
01:18:58,023 --> 01:19:05,247
It also helps us to identify non-traditional students, students that would not necessarily be recognized or be seen.

775
01:19:06,048 --> 01:19:09,810
And I've seen it work great to really actively recruit students.

776
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:19,736
And finally, last week during the commissioner's call, the MCAS is still currently slated to take place.

777
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:20,936
We don't have any updates.

778
01:19:20,976 --> 01:19:22,317
There was no updates on it.

779
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:25,599
The question was asked about the MCAS

780
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:46,026
DESE was participating in a call with the United States Department of Education last Thursday, and we expect any updates on the accountability and assessment measures that were going to be discussed on Thursday, that they will be forthcoming to us as soon as DESE has them.

781
01:19:46,046 --> 01:19:50,028
I'm happy to take any questions at this time.

782
01:19:50,048 --> 01:19:50,829
I apologize.

783
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,871
Does anybody have any questions?

784
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,711
hearing and seeing none, I will.

785
01:20:03,274 --> 01:20:04,536
I know member Graham has her hand up.

786
01:20:06,297 --> 01:20:07,799
So thank you.

787
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:11,962
I think the mayor may be having some technical challenges.

788
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:24,454
I think my question is really around those parents who are actively inquiring about the results of the first assessment being told that they can't see them until the second assessment is completed.

789
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:30,806
And at the middle school level, I think that is a huge struggle.

790
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:36,312
There are no parent teacher conferences built into the academic curriculum for middle school families.

791
01:20:37,153 --> 01:20:39,516
And right now, there's lots of families who are

792
01:20:40,438 --> 01:20:45,700
disproportionately involved in their child's education with kids being out on quarantine and everything else.

793
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:58,243
And I'm just struggling with the wisdom of telling parents that they have to wait until February to understand sort of where their kids are at baseline, if the school knows this information.

794
01:20:58,263 --> 01:21:06,065
In working with our partner, where we didn't have conferences, we didn't have an opportunity to

795
01:21:08,717 --> 01:21:15,264
to get that information across the way that we would want to like the elementary schools can with conferences and.

796
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:28,397
With the early literacy screener that's done for K through two, we just didn't have that opportunity, as you mentioned, with conferences to really sit down and talk one-on-one with parents.

797
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:33,381
And NWEMAP, when we were discussing this, thought it was best that we would wait.

798
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:45,330
We thought it would be good to wait as well so that parents would have the understanding of like, okay, here's where they were and here's where they grow to, not an immediate panic of, oh my God, this is where they are.

799
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:56,183
And, you know, where it's a new assessment, some students may have struggled simply with taking the assessment and those types of problems that come with a new assessment.

800
01:21:56,443 --> 01:22:03,967
So, you know, I can understand people's frustration, but that frustration will be coming to an end very soon.

801
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:08,629
And the reports will be distributed so that they can have that information.

802
01:22:13,613 --> 01:22:39,872
I think the other question I had, we had on the list of approved reports that the school committee passed a year ago or so, we had routine aggregated reports for the screener tools being used at the early literacy level, and I haven't seen them yet, but I wanna make sure that this committee is getting results each and every time these tests are administered so that we can understand

803
01:22:40,632 --> 01:22:44,954
at baseline where folks are, what the growth opportunities are, et cetera.

804
01:22:44,974 --> 01:22:53,158
I know map is a new tool, but I've been on the committee for two years now and I've never seen an aggregated report that's been produced out of a screener.

805
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:58,521
So I think that was approved by this committee in the last year and a half or so.

806
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:08,326
And I would like to see those reports be presented to us in a more systemic fashion going forward so that we can have some understanding of

807
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:20,834
you know, the, where our students are at, because we actually are responsible for academic success and we have zero tools really to know that right now.

808
01:23:22,315 --> 01:23:23,656
And I appreciate that.

809
01:23:23,696 --> 01:23:30,299
And I don't want to speak for Suzanne Galussi, who's also on the call but we will definitely provide you that information.

810
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,601
And we'll definitely provide those reports to you so that you can understand.

811
01:23:35,733 --> 01:24:00,565
How, like, what I really appreciate about NWA MAP and the frequency of the assessment is that it will really give us an opportunity to litmus test and to measure our curriculum enhancements, the work that we're doing, supporting faculty and staff to help them to grow, and also the investments that we're making across the board in a variety of tools to support our students that go beyond

812
01:24:01,864 --> 01:24:05,669
say FOSS science or whatever the curriculum package might be.

813
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,734
So that's where I really appreciate this.

814
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:18,064
Yeah, and I I've heard very good things about the quality of the data that can be provided to us, which is exciting.

815
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:27,907
I think my final question is this withholding of information from parents happening this year because it's the first outing will not happen next year during the first test.

816
01:24:27,987 --> 01:24:28,547
Is that true?

817
01:24:28,828 --> 01:24:30,188
This will not happen again.

818
01:24:30,228 --> 01:24:32,389
This is simply just as we launched.

819
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:38,691
This was a conscientious decision to make sure that we were not giving data that was going to cause.

820
01:24:42,094 --> 01:24:53,989
potential parent problems and concerns when it was the first assessment and really wanted to make sure that we were providing parents with detailed information that shows growth over a period of time.

821
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,731
Okay, thank you.

822
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:05,744
I'm not able to see who, and if there's hands up, would anybody else like to ask a question before I move on?

823
01:25:06,344 --> 01:25:15,650
I just wanted to say, Mayor, that I'm so excited that as a district, we finally have a tool that can actually present, give us data.

824
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:24,475
And I know that this is year one, so we're kind of like at ground zero, but moving forward, we will now have that data available that was never available before.

825
01:25:24,615 --> 01:25:27,397
So I'm looking forward to being able to really

826
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:46,472
dig deeply into this internal data, K-12 as a district to be able to watch and monitor our progress, especially now more than ever, since our MCAS cycle, which we used to use in the past as a result of the pandemic has been interrupted.

827
01:25:47,032 --> 01:25:50,354
So we will have a different source that isn't gonna be interrupted.

828
01:25:50,414 --> 01:25:54,236
So I just wanted to add that piece of information for context.

829
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:54,937
Thank you.

830
01:25:57,964 --> 01:26:01,826
Thank you, Dr. Wood, and thank you for the presentation, Dr. Cushing.

831
01:26:03,387 --> 01:26:12,912
We have report number four, which is English Learners EL Updates.

832
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:22,276
Director of English Learners, Paul Texera, will report on 2021 WIDA access scores and English Learners Department updates.

833
01:26:22,937 --> 01:26:23,577
Mr. Texera.

834
01:26:25,203 --> 01:26:26,123
Good evening, everyone.

835
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:26,864
Happy New Year.

836
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:28,884
Welcome to Member Hayes.

837
01:26:30,165 --> 01:26:40,048
Every January, we administer the ACCESS test, which is a single test comprised of four domains, listening, reading, writing, and speaking.

838
01:26:40,108 --> 01:26:44,630
So it's actually four different tests that measure students' English language development.

839
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:50,432
And we do compare from year to year, and students get a report, and families get a report from year to year.

840
01:26:52,193 --> 01:27:00,721
The test is taken online in grades 1 through 12, with the exception of grades 1 through 3, the writing portion of the test is paper-based.

841
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:05,385
And for kindergarten students, the entire test is paper-based.

842
01:27:05,465 --> 01:27:06,265
It's given one to one.

843
01:27:07,446 --> 01:27:07,967
one-to-one.

844
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:12,991
As Dr. Cushing just mentioned, they extended the date out to March 4th.

845
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:23,138
Typically, we have a six-week window because, and especially at the elementary schools, because the tests are given to students based on their language proficiency and their grade level.

846
01:27:23,578 --> 01:27:29,663
So it's a big puzzle to put together when you're administering the tests for the students.

847
01:27:30,303 --> 01:27:32,265
So we staggered the tests throughout the district.

848
01:27:32,745 --> 01:27:40,230
Because we used Chromebooks last year, 100% of the online assessments were done on the Chromebooks.

849
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,351
We had no issues.

850
01:27:41,491 --> 01:27:47,896
The technology department is working diligently right now to ensure that everything's up to date so the students can take their tests.

851
01:27:50,017 --> 01:27:52,079
And then we get the score reports.

852
01:27:52,539 --> 01:27:54,580
They didn't announce with the change in dates.

853
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:57,903
Typically, we get the score reports at the end of June.

854
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:10,811
But now, I mean, at the end of May, beginning of June, but now with the delay, I don't know if they're going to give them to us in August again, which is what they did this year for the 2021 access test.

855
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,134
So I put together last year's 2021 data.

856
01:28:15,174 --> 01:28:20,457
So if you look at page two of your packet that has figure 1.1, this will give you the,

857
01:28:24,929 --> 01:28:30,231
basic rundown of last year's access test for the overall test score for our students.

858
01:28:30,991 --> 01:28:36,393
So this information compares Medford to the state access results and surrounding districts.

859
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:46,996
You know, with the surrounding districts, the districts I chose are the districts that we have our English learner students transferring between.

860
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:51,017
So these are the, you know, and coming into us from.

861
01:28:53,246 --> 01:29:06,944
Students can be exited from the EL program if they achieve an overall score of 4.2 so that's why you won't see a lot of students in level five and six because they exit typically before they hit that level.

862
01:29:07,945 --> 01:29:27,516
At the end of every school year, again, depending upon when we get the results, we have what we call language acquisition team meetings where I meet with all of the teachers and we use this data and other data to determine students' placements and if we reclassify them as a former English learner, if they can exit newcomers, how many periods of EL they need a day.

863
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:31,398
Access is a big part of it, but it's not the only part of it.

864
01:29:32,515 --> 01:29:40,581
Going back to the data if you look Medford had the highest participation rate of our neighboring districts we had a 95% participation rate on the test.

865
01:29:41,101 --> 01:29:44,184
There was no remote option for access.

866
01:29:44,824 --> 01:29:46,325
So it was all done in person.

867
01:29:47,786 --> 01:30:03,452
Medford had the highest percentage of students making progress on the access test, which is 44%, and 44% doesn't sound like a huge number, but compared to other districts during this, the pandemic, Medford definitely stood out.

868
01:30:04,472 --> 01:30:22,500
So this data supports, you know, Medford Public Schools pledge to equity because central office, the school committee ensured that our English learner students were back in school for in-person learning safely on September 28th, 2020.

869
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:31,144
And if we compare the other districts that did not do that, the results stand out that that was the right decision to support student learning.

870
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:35,503
And this data supports the hard work that the teachers did last year.

871
01:30:35,523 --> 01:30:38,647
Again, it was a very trying year this year too.

872
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:50,801
And then it's also, these results are a reflection of the amazing work that the EL teachers in the district did because they were among the first in the building to bring in-person learning back to our students.

873
01:30:52,284 --> 01:31:02,748
So I've said this before in previous meetings that yes, we can compare ourselves to the state because essentially Medford is a microcosm of ELs across the state.

874
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:10,651
And then we can compare ourselves to other districts, but I always like to compare ourselves to ourselves year from year.

875
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:21,195
And so looking at the previous year's data, so we administered the 2020 access test in January, February of 2020, and that was before the shutdown.

876
01:31:21,756 --> 01:31:28,300
So that data is an accurate reflection of a typical school year for us.

877
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:33,784
We administered the 2021 access test in April of 2021, because they did extend the window.

878
01:31:34,764 --> 01:31:46,497
And so the shutdown in March of 2020 and the hybrid learning for most of the 2021 school year and then increased student absences, this all accounted for an immeasurable loss of instruction.

879
01:31:46,957 --> 01:31:50,641
And when I say immeasurable, I'm not saying a huge loss of instruction.

880
01:31:50,661 --> 01:31:53,605
I'm saying it literally can't be measured.

881
01:31:54,429 --> 01:32:04,434
And so when we look at our percentages, the percentage of students that were not making progress compared to the previous year increased by 9%.

882
01:32:06,275 --> 01:32:18,401
And so that obviously is not an increase we wanna see, but given the year that we had in the previous year, a 9% increase, it isn't huge.

883
01:32:18,441 --> 01:32:19,761
It's not bad data.

884
01:32:21,175 --> 01:32:26,256
for what our students actually, you know, did on the assessments.

885
01:32:27,057 --> 01:32:34,398
And then when I drilled down further, I looked at, you know, the highest increase of students not making progress that was in grade six through eight, which was 22%.

886
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:46,602
And what that tells me is our co-teaching model and grade six to eight is critically important for our EL students because we did not have the same co-teaching model during the 2021 school year.

887
01:32:48,379 --> 01:32:56,189
And on your paper, if you go back to the previous page, I gave you a quick graph of students in grade six through eight making progress.

888
01:32:56,730 --> 01:33:02,678
So in 2019 46% of our middle school students made progress on the access test.

889
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,782
We did have co-teaching in math that year only.

890
01:33:06,368 --> 01:33:10,589
In 2020, we had co-teaching in math and science.

891
01:33:10,749 --> 01:33:13,850
And so our progress jumped up to 54%.

892
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:23,272
Last year, because of COVID and we couldn't cross teams and we couldn't integrate into other classrooms, our progress at the middle school level was 32%.

893
01:33:24,992 --> 01:33:33,094
So if this data tells me anything, it's that we need to continue with our co-teaching model and that the co-teaching model is

894
01:33:34,095 --> 01:33:36,545
a successful measure for our ELL students.

895
01:33:38,413 --> 01:33:57,918
So then if we go to the numbers and percentages page, I like to give you the updates on our enrollment for EL students and using data from going back as far as 15, 16, and it tells the number of EL students and what percentage of our population that is.

896
01:33:58,638 --> 01:34:02,419
And so if we just compare us to last year, 2021, our numbers were down.

897
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:09,228
We knew they were down, the borders were closed, people weren't permitted into the country.

898
01:34:09,688 --> 01:34:13,695
So we ended the school year with 410 students.

899
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,920
At this moment in time, we are currently up to 511 students.

900
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:21,602
So we've experienced, and this is our biggest increase.

901
01:34:21,983 --> 01:34:37,632
We've had over 500 EL students in the district at any given moment in the past, because we have a very fluid population of students coming in, registering, being settled for a small period of time, finding permanent housing somewhere else.

902
01:34:38,653 --> 01:34:41,334
But right now, these are our current numbers in real time.

903
01:34:41,354 --> 01:34:48,299
And so that's 12.2% of the student population are current English learner students.

904
01:34:49,019 --> 01:34:55,587
So our numbers are, you know, as we've shown historically over the years, are growing and continue to grow.

905
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:59,472
And then down below the student registration data,

906
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:10,774
This I always give you around this time in January when I present to you, to give you the number of students tested and the number of EL students that actually qualified for services.

907
01:35:11,334 --> 01:35:16,276
So for 2021, the data wasn't available because of COVID-19.

908
01:35:16,697 --> 01:35:20,578
Our typical format for identifying EL students was not the same.

909
01:35:21,019 --> 01:35:25,981
The state allowed us just to use the home language survey, do phone interviews, we could

910
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:31,225
use transfer paperwork from other districts, we didn't have to test every student who came through the door.

911
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:39,732
They allowed us to actually use the access test to confirm our preliminary decision that the students were EL.

912
01:35:39,832 --> 01:35:43,335
So we didn't do the testing in 2021 like we typically did.

913
01:35:44,216 --> 01:35:45,396
or like we typically do.

914
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:53,778
But as of now, we've tested 301 students, which is, again, a huge increase from 2020 when we were collecting this data.

915
01:35:54,358 --> 01:36:00,199
And of those 301 students, 244 have qualified for EL services.

916
01:36:01,019 --> 01:36:03,960
So again, our numbers do continue to grow.

917
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,380
Most of our growth is coming at the newcomer level.

918
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:10,721
And I've given you a chart to show you

919
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:14,634
where the newcomers are at each grade level.

920
01:36:15,168 --> 01:36:21,332
So of our current 511 EL students, 195 are level one or level two newcomer students.

921
01:36:21,832 --> 01:36:26,835
And the greatest increase is in grade two at the Mississippi and grades nine through 10 at MHS.

922
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:34,780
And member Graham and member Russo, you were on the tours with Mr. Murphy and me back in September.

923
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,923
And we went into that grade two classroom and there were only six students in it at that time.

924
01:36:40,463 --> 01:36:41,704
And we now have 27 students.

925
01:36:41,744 --> 01:36:42,084
So we did,

926
01:36:45,905 --> 01:36:47,086
We did split the class.

927
01:36:47,206 --> 01:36:56,592
We hired a new teacher and we ended up splitting the class into two because 27 newcomers is not feasible for anyone.

928
01:36:58,373 --> 01:37:08,419
And so, you know, that took place right before the Christmas break or winter break that the split happened.

929
01:37:08,559 --> 01:37:12,662
And now we have two grade two newcomer classrooms, which is the first time that

930
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:16,914
I've ever had to split classroom in the district.

931
01:37:18,316 --> 01:37:27,672
And then we've been capitalizing on you know as our funds, the title three grant to provide additional support because the numbers are high in the other classrooms as well.

932
01:37:28,763 --> 01:37:32,025
providing in-class tutors, EL aids.

933
01:37:33,466 --> 01:37:38,049
We have the two Lesley interns who are in grades three and grade two.

934
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:50,416
We have a bilingual in-class tutor at the high school, and we have an in-class tutor at the middle school, all to support teachers and students.

935
01:37:50,676 --> 01:37:52,577
But these numbers will continue to grow.

936
01:37:52,637 --> 01:37:53,878
We do get another surge.

937
01:37:54,438 --> 01:37:58,765
at this time of year, especially from Brazil because their school year ended in December.

938
01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:04,455
So I am expecting these numbers to grow pretty quickly this year.

939
01:38:06,215 --> 01:38:10,438
And then on the last page, I just want to talk about some family engagement activities.

940
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:16,463
We're in the process of building a partnership with an organization called Tech Goes Home.

941
01:38:17,624 --> 01:38:24,449
Actually, last year's Harvard resident, Tom Maliszewski, was the one who introduced me to this organization.

942
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:30,131
And we tried partnering with them last year, but they weren't accepting any new districts.

943
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:37,013
So I've stayed in touch with them and they've now opened up where they can take Medford on as a partner.

944
01:38:38,434 --> 01:38:44,436
And so this organization provides training to educate caregivers on technology usage.

945
01:38:45,236 --> 01:38:54,006
Tech Goes Home will train the teachers to administer the test, I mean to administer the class on technology.

946
01:38:54,547 --> 01:38:59,913
The caregivers will get a Chromebook and they'll get a year of free internet.

947
01:39:01,692 --> 01:39:04,414
If they successfully complete the 10 hour course.

948
01:39:04,934 --> 01:39:08,696
So I've recruited for EL teachers who will take the tech goes home training.

949
01:39:08,716 --> 01:39:17,020
I'm partnering I'm using title three funds to pay for the EL teachers to teach the courses.

950
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:27,104
If they can complete the training early spring, we can offer a training this year and then start the school year with yet another training.

951
01:39:27,685 --> 01:39:33,587
And we can continue this partnership as long as TechPost Home can continue to provide the technology with it.

952
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:38,990
I can use Title III to pay for the teachers to administer it.

953
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:43,552
And then other areas of family engagement,

954
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:51,032
Our family engagement begins the moment that the students arrive at the high school for their EL testing.

955
01:39:51,732 --> 01:39:55,294
Emily Plini is our new assessment specialist.

956
01:39:55,354 --> 01:39:59,215
If you recall, Jesse Reinhold retired last year in February.

957
01:40:00,095 --> 01:40:01,796
Emily has taken on that position.

958
01:40:03,077 --> 01:40:04,898
She immediately connects with families.

959
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:07,000
She sets them up with talking points.

960
01:40:07,481 --> 01:40:14,106
She provides them all the information for Medford's multilingual resource line, the resiliency hub.

961
01:40:14,527 --> 01:40:18,770
She's the connection between the school and the registration.

962
01:40:19,952 --> 01:40:25,997
And she's really done an amazing job building this position even greater than it was under Jesse.

963
01:40:27,808 --> 01:40:36,493
She does a great job at making families feel welcome and supported by the entire Medford community, not just the Medford school community.

964
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:40,455
And then we're doing our building-based family engagement nights.

965
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:47,538
They were originally scheduled for fall, but given the constant arrival of new students and families, the Yale teachers decided to wait until January.

966
01:40:48,218 --> 01:40:53,321
But due to the uptick in COVID numbers, we're now delaying until February, March for these.

967
01:40:53,942 --> 01:40:55,623
and those dates will be forthcoming.

968
01:40:56,204 --> 01:41:02,789
And then the District English Learner Advisory Council meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, May 24th at 6 p.m.

969
01:41:02,809 --> 01:41:04,290
in the Library of Medford High School.

970
01:41:09,775 --> 01:41:11,016
Thank you, Mr. Tixera.

971
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:13,298
Mayor?

972
01:41:13,978 --> 01:41:15,259
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

973
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,200
Thank you.

974
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,314
Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.

975
01:41:18,354 --> 01:41:19,195
That was really great.

976
01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:21,536
As always, outstanding.

977
01:41:22,297 --> 01:41:25,139
Can I ask how much the Tech Goes Home costs annually?

978
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:30,003
I know it's for teachers to teach to the families in the 10 hours of training.

979
01:41:30,063 --> 01:41:32,725
Is that over a divided amount of time?

980
01:41:32,845 --> 01:41:35,827
Or I'm assuming, obviously, you wouldn't train 10 hours at once, but how many?

981
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:37,483
It's over.

982
01:41:37,503 --> 01:41:45,508
It's up to the teachers who are delivering the classes to kind of make their own schedule for the 10 hours.

983
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:49,210
We pay the contractual rate of $33 an hour.

984
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:59,016
And then I'm actually paying them to go through the training with Tech Goes Home because that's technically their prep time for the course.

985
01:41:59,656 --> 01:42:00,457
How long does that take?

986
01:42:01,833 --> 01:42:03,193
It's a 10-hour training course.

987
01:42:03,273 --> 01:42:04,774
Okay, 10 hours for them too.

988
01:42:04,874 --> 01:42:05,854
Okay, great.

989
01:42:05,894 --> 01:42:06,234
Thank you.

990
01:42:06,274 --> 01:42:09,455
That will help me ballpark the amount.

991
01:42:10,115 --> 01:42:15,656
And then the resiliency hub, can you tell me about that?

992
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:27,799
So it's on the, it's part of the Medford City Hall website and that supports families with where the food banks are and

993
01:42:30,393 --> 01:42:44,820
I think food banks and they help with housing and any issues that somebody's coming up with, especially for a new newcomer family coming into the district to get information.

994
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,122
They have the multilingual resource line.

995
01:42:47,142 --> 01:42:50,323
I'm not sure if they're connected to each other physically.

996
01:42:51,804 --> 01:42:53,405
Is that what it's called, the resiliency hub?

997
01:42:54,878 --> 01:43:03,206
The vulnerability preparedness grant that we're working off of is the goal is to create resiliency hubs.

998
01:43:04,047 --> 01:43:04,327
Okay.

999
01:43:04,988 --> 01:43:08,352
And so on that's on the district website, I mean on the city website.

1000
01:43:08,789 --> 01:43:10,830
On the city website, somebody dropped off.

1001
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:16,433
We have the magnets that have like the telephone numbers for the multilingual resource lines.

1002
01:43:16,593 --> 01:43:18,374
We give them that information.

1003
01:43:18,834 --> 01:43:23,957
Emily directs them to the Medford City Hall website.

1004
01:43:25,338 --> 01:43:25,978
Great, thank you.

1005
01:43:25,998 --> 01:43:27,119
I'm gonna look into that a little bit.

1006
01:43:27,499 --> 01:43:33,302
And then can you just share with folks, I know that you said the 24th, I'm looking forward to the DLAC.

1007
01:43:34,163 --> 01:43:36,184
Can you share with folks the mission of the DLAC?

1008
01:43:37,023 --> 01:43:42,708
So the DELAC is the District English Learner Advisory Council, similar to CPAC.

1009
01:43:43,369 --> 01:44:02,527
It's supposed to be a self-run parent caregiver organization that will advise central office, advise the school on what they would like to see for their children and their students.

1010
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:03,890
Thank you.

1011
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:15,138
And so I know that before there had been some concern around participation with that, but it seems like with the other family engagement models, that might be a rich opportunity to recruit folks for the DELAC.

1012
01:44:15,418 --> 01:44:17,119
I'm assuming you're already thinking that.

1013
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:30,228
And that's why that's pushed out that way, because what we find is that caregivers will respond more to something happening at a building level than a district level.

1014
01:44:30,328 --> 01:44:33,170
So we're using the building level

1015
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:39,171
events to then springboard into the district level.

1016
01:44:39,191 --> 01:44:41,092
Right, to build those relationships.

1017
01:44:41,412 --> 01:44:42,652
Always thinking, Mr. Tichara.

1018
01:44:42,692 --> 01:44:43,492
Thank you so much.

1019
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:44,593
Great stuff.

1020
01:44:44,773 --> 01:44:45,193
Thank you.

1021
01:44:47,953 --> 01:44:49,394
Thank you, Mr. Tichara.

1022
01:44:49,414 --> 01:44:54,535
Let me just grab the agenda.

1023
01:45:01,027 --> 01:45:08,368
We have number eight, presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m.

1024
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:19,731
Regular meetings of the Memphis School Committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

1025
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:22,311
A resident may only present once at any meeting.

1026
01:45:23,071 --> 01:45:27,232
The presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee

1027
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:30,302
but are not an opportunity for dialogue with the committee.

1028
01:45:30,362 --> 01:45:38,486
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

1029
01:45:40,287 --> 01:45:49,011

Member Russo, do you have access to the email address yet?

1039
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:04,530
I do not.

1040
01:47:05,091 --> 01:47:08,173
The password has been changed since I last had access to it.

1041
01:47:08,233 --> 01:47:14,377
So I see Dr. Cushing is probably going to send that over to me.

1042
01:47:14,917 --> 01:47:15,177
Great.

1043
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,081
Then I'll continue on.

1044
01:47:20,121 --> 01:47:22,762
I'm not sure if there's any emails in that email box.

1045
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:27,686
We do not have any continued business, but we do have new business.

1046
01:47:28,046 --> 01:47:31,028
Number one, we have a resolution offered by member Russo.

1047
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:35,789
given at this, yes.

1048
01:47:37,249 --> 01:47:43,532
I'd be fine with waiving the reading, since we have read it several times, unless somebody else wants to hear it.

1049
01:47:46,834 --> 01:47:52,237
Motion to waive the reading by Member Rousseau, seconded by?

1050
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:53,617
Second.

1051
01:47:54,258 --> 01:47:56,018
Member Graham, all those in favor?

1052
01:47:56,038 --> 01:47:59,380
Roll call, Mayor, sorry.

1053
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,040
Roll call.

1054
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:02,402
Member Graham?

1055
01:48:02,942 --> 01:48:03,142
Yes.

1056
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:05,879
Member Hayes?

1057
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:06,800
Yes.

1058
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:08,641
Member Kretz?

1059
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:09,461
Yes.

1060
01:48:10,922 --> 01:48:11,563
Member McLaughlin?

1061
01:48:12,983 --> 01:48:13,324
Yes.

1062
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:15,925
Member McStone?

1063
01:48:16,405 --> 01:48:16,646
Yes.

1064
01:48:18,427 --> 01:48:19,487
Member Stowe, yes.

1065
01:48:19,947 --> 01:48:20,668
Mayor Longo, current.

1066
01:48:21,696 --> 01:48:39,707
Yes, 70 affirmatives are in the negative, we can waive the portion of the resolution and I'll just summarize that this is just asking our administration for a plan on implementation of the out-of-school suspension policy that we passed about a year ago.

1067
01:48:39,727 --> 01:48:40,628
Member Rousseau?

1068
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:43,462
Thank you, Mayor.

1069
01:48:44,263 --> 01:49:01,098
So, this is a motion asking that the administration prepare a presentation to us that includes what the plan was, implementations, details, and this was offered

1070
01:49:05,846 --> 01:49:08,307
On December 6th, there it is under the table, sorry.

1071
01:49:09,368 --> 01:49:16,972
So the date that I was looking for data was between the start of school and October 31st.

1072
01:49:16,992 --> 01:49:25,316
I would like to change that to be December 31st, unless somebody has already done the work to do the present, to gather the data.

1073
01:49:25,536 --> 01:49:30,739
But if nobody has gathered the data, it makes sense to just get the first half of the year.

1074
01:49:33,661 --> 01:49:36,103
So that is my request.

1075
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:45,813
I would like to hear from, I'm assuming Dr. Cushing, whether he has gathered any data before changing that.

1076
01:49:47,774 --> 01:49:49,856
It's not a problem to change the date.

1077
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,681
Thank you.

1078
01:49:54,901 --> 01:49:55,382
So that's,

1079
01:49:56,581 --> 01:50:03,784
That's my motion to move that ahead with December 31st date, or wherever the last day of school was in December.

1080
01:50:03,804 --> 01:50:05,425
Is there a motion to approve?

1081
01:50:09,426 --> 01:50:12,288
Motion to approve by member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau.

1082
01:50:13,108 --> 01:50:13,728
Roll call, please.

1083
01:50:15,589 --> 01:50:16,389
Member Graham?

1084
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:17,130
Yes.

1085
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:18,930
Member Hayes?

1086
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:19,791
Yes.

1087
01:50:21,291 --> 01:50:22,052
Member Kretz?

1088
01:50:22,692 --> 01:50:22,892
Yes.

1089
01:50:23,952 --> 01:50:25,053
Member McLaughlin?

1090
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:26,489
Yes.

1091
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,150
Member Miss Stone.

1092
01:50:31,012 --> 01:50:32,273
Member Rousseau, yes.

1093
01:50:32,533 --> 01:50:33,514
Mayor Langevin.

1094
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:34,335
Yes.

1095
01:50:34,395 --> 01:50:36,116
Seven the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1096
01:50:36,556 --> 01:50:37,597
The motion is approved.

1097
01:50:37,617 --> 01:50:39,138
Thank you.

1098
01:50:47,512 --> 01:50:58,016
Resolution number two, be it resolved that the administration will present the proposed rate for the before and after school program to the Medford School Committee for approval no later than March 1st.

1099
01:50:58,656 --> 01:51:08,300
Be it further resolved the rate recommendation will take into account the cost of the current program and the market rates and area programs offered by member Graham and member Rousseau.

1100
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:13,069
Thank you, Mayor.

1101
01:51:13,229 --> 01:51:31,634
I think we've talked in past years about the before and after school program being a considerable challenge for families on a whole number of fronts, but one of the biggest of which is access to the program, because there's just simply not enough of it to go around.

1102
01:51:32,235 --> 01:51:39,917
And I think last year when we talked about the rate increase, which was, I believe, tied to

1103
01:51:40,987 --> 01:51:55,500
the increases associated with the voucher program, we indicated at that time that we wanted to see the rate increases be more commiserate with making sure that the program could be expanded and could take into account the costs of the program.

1104
01:51:55,820 --> 01:52:07,471
And I know all of this happens, kindergarten registration just opened, and I wanna make sure we're in a position to set these rates sooner rather than later so that registration can open for the program.

1105
01:52:10,325 --> 01:52:11,086
Thank you, Member Graham.

1106
01:52:11,266 --> 01:52:13,387
Member Russo, would you like to add anything?

1107
01:52:16,869 --> 01:52:17,309
Oh, thank you.

1108
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:20,071
Is there a motion on the floor?

1109
01:52:20,091 --> 01:52:22,973
Mayor, could I just comment briefly before you vote?

1110
01:52:23,553 --> 01:52:24,054
Mr. Murphy?

1111
01:52:24,674 --> 01:52:24,994
Thank you.

1112
01:52:25,735 --> 01:52:28,796
This is an action that we've been anticipating, and Ms.

1113
01:52:28,836 --> 01:52:34,380
Fidelicari has been researching various options with her counterparts at different districts.

1114
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:39,223
I think we will definitely be able to bring forth a recommendation and report

1115
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:42,031
prior to March 1st.

1116
01:52:43,492 --> 01:52:53,158
Some of that report will be a continuation of the conversation we had last spring when you'll recall that we expanded our intended number of seats.

1117
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:57,141
One of the variables that's changed since last spring

1118
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:14,593
is we have run into both with respect to after school positions and a number of other positions, a significant workforce depletion challenge that every district is confronting and the after school program is one of the places in which those challenges have been most pronounced.

1119
01:53:16,044 --> 01:53:28,329
And so that I think will need to be part of the conversation since even if that situation is thawing to some degree, there's no indication that there's gonna be a significant turnaround in the coming months.

1120
01:53:28,749 --> 01:53:36,973
That being said, we are preparing just as a sort of a note of preparation for the committee and to give you the opportunity to provide us feedback.

1121
01:53:37,513 --> 01:53:44,356
Based on the conversations from last spring, we're preparing a presentation that would essentially spell out the options for the committee with a potential

1122
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:49,979
potential fee increase.

1123
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:55,003
And we're looking at the ways in which that could essentially be income dependent.

1124
01:53:57,405 --> 01:54:10,517
Because we have a healthy surplus in that particular revolving fund, that's how we were able to sustain the significant wage increases that we implemented in order to try to build up a bigger staff.

1125
01:54:10,557 --> 01:54:14,140
But as I said, that strategy was not wholly successful.

1126
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:29,030
And so there will be a question that we'll have to have a discussion with the committee over whether or not increasing the fees so that we can then hopefully attract a wider applicant pool to have more staff in order to have more seats.

1127
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:36,034
If all that sequence plays out and then at the end of the day we have, there aren't available workers

1128
01:54:36,499 --> 01:54:41,423
we're running into the challenge of basically having raised the fee without having expanded the seats.

1129
01:54:41,643 --> 01:54:54,652
So this is just by way of saying that this is a conversation that we've been waiting for, that we're looking forward to, that Mr. Licari has been asking me when we will be having and has been understandably eager to present me with the information.

1130
01:54:55,452 --> 01:54:58,094
So my guess is we would do that in early February.

1131
01:54:58,835 --> 01:55:04,479
And I just want everyone to sort of be thinking about some of the challenges that we'll have to articulate

1132
01:55:04,923 --> 01:55:06,003
when we have that conversation.

1133
01:55:06,243 --> 01:55:10,105
So thank you for raising it and we look forward to further conversation.

1134
01:55:12,365 --> 01:55:13,206
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1135
01:55:14,386 --> 01:55:15,546
Is there a motion on the floor?

1136
01:55:15,566 --> 01:55:17,727
Motion to approve.

1137
01:55:18,767 --> 01:55:20,968
Motion to approve by member Russo, seconded by?

1138
01:55:20,988 --> 01:55:27,530
Second.

1139
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:29,671
Member Graham.

1140
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:42,164
And just from the chair, this is just to get a rate that the administration proposes for the afterschool and before school program by March 1st, is that correct?

1141
01:55:42,844 --> 01:55:50,588
Yes, and I think there'll be some policy discussion around how we're gonna structure those fees and what are the pros and cons of doing that.

1142
01:55:51,348 --> 01:55:53,109
Okay, thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1143
01:55:53,229 --> 01:55:54,149
Thank you, member Graham.

1144
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:55,930
Okay, roll call, please.

1145
01:55:57,871 --> 01:55:58,431
Member Graham.

1146
01:55:59,072 --> 01:55:59,292
Yes.

1147
01:56:00,713 --> 01:56:01,573
Member Hayes.

1148
01:56:02,162 --> 01:56:02,442
Yes.

1149
01:56:03,603 --> 01:56:04,104
Member Katz.

1150
01:56:04,744 --> 01:56:04,984
Yes.

1151
01:56:06,025 --> 01:56:06,966
Member McLaughlin.

1152
01:56:09,948 --> 01:56:10,228
Yes.

1153
01:56:11,349 --> 01:56:11,730
Member Ms.

1154
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,030
Jones.

1155
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:12,690
Yes.

1156
01:56:13,911 --> 01:56:14,832
Member Estella, yes.

1157
01:56:15,273 --> 01:56:16,734
Member Mayor Longo.

1158
01:56:17,815 --> 01:56:19,676
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1159
01:56:19,856 --> 01:56:21,718
The paper is approved.

1160
01:56:23,819 --> 01:56:30,705
Next we have, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee

1161
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:36,437
will amend policy BDE subcommittees of the school committee.

1162
01:56:36,977 --> 01:56:41,498
The school committee maintains a set of standing subcommittees during each term.

1163
01:56:41,758 --> 01:56:48,159
It may establish special committees for a specific purpose and to make recommendations for committee action per policy BDF.

1164
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:56,240
Number one, the committee chairperson subject to approval by the committee will establish standing committees in the first month of each term.

1165
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:59,521
The subcommittee will be established through action of the committee.

1166
01:57:00,236 --> 01:57:06,142
The committee chairperson subject to approve the committee will point the subcommittee chairperson and its members.

1167
01:57:11,687 --> 01:57:18,994
The subcommittee may only meet to carry out business referred to it by a majority vote of the committee.

1168
01:57:19,394 --> 01:57:25,180
Subcommittees will not meet to conduct business brought to the subcommittee by any other means or process.

1169
01:57:26,465 --> 01:57:29,986
will be provided with a list of its functions and duties.

1170
01:57:30,346 --> 01:57:36,608
The subcommittee may make recommendations for committee action, but it may not act for the school committee.

1171
01:57:36,628 --> 01:57:43,270
Number five, the committee chairperson and superintendent will be ex-official members of all special subcommittees.

1172
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:52,472
Six, the subcommittee will be dissolved by the committee upon completion of its assignment, or it may be dissolved by a vote of the committee at any time.

1173
01:57:52,912 --> 01:57:55,093
Cross-reference BEC executive session.

1174
01:57:56,471 --> 01:57:57,512
offered by member Graham.

1175
01:58:00,094 --> 01:58:00,574
Thank you.

1176
01:58:02,195 --> 01:58:19,729
As we were thinking, as I was thinking about subcommittees as we go forward, one of the things that struck me as awkward about the way that our subcommittees are handled today is that they tend to have a lot of different topics, so sort of all lumped in together.

1177
01:58:20,695 --> 01:58:37,890
And I know that I would personally like to see the committees be a little bit more sort of finite and clear, but that would, I think likely mean as we think about committees for this term, more committees than we have today, which I know is sort of undesirable for a variety of reasons.

1178
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:46,357
And the changes, and I sent you all a document that actually outlines the changes in track mode so that you can see them.

1179
01:58:46,917 --> 01:58:58,825
but a couple of the, I think the significant changes was just to strike the name of the committees from the policy and just say that they are subject to the organization of the committee at the beginning of the term.

1180
01:58:59,485 --> 01:59:10,312
And then number three being, I think the significant change, which is that the subcommittees really should only be meeting if they are carrying out business that's been sent there.

1181
01:59:11,387 --> 01:59:12,607
by the school committee.

1182
01:59:12,707 --> 01:59:25,831
And I know when I started, there was some conversation about how that's traditionally done, but also that there isn't a rule written down anywhere to the rules conversation earlier that says that that is necessary.

1183
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:37,414
And I do think if we are going to move to a model that where there's more finite subcommittees, I think it would be really important for us to make sure that the committee as a whole is voting to send things to subcommittees so that

1184
01:59:38,795 --> 01:59:44,499
the subcommittees are spending time on things that have this sort of conceptual and general support of the entire committee.

1185
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:51,085
And then I think there's just a couple of other changes around language of chair versus chairperson and things like that.

1186
01:59:51,185 --> 01:59:54,228
But those were the two big changes that I am proposing.

1187
01:59:54,528 --> 01:59:54,888
Mayor?

1188
01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:56,810
Yes.

1189
02:00:00,793 --> 02:00:01,073
Sorry.

1190
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:02,775
Member Graham.

1191
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,901
I mean, Member McLaughlin, my apologies.

1192
02:00:07,381 --> 02:00:09,001
I think Member Kretz had her hand up first.

1193
02:00:09,101 --> 02:00:13,643
I spoke first, sorry, but I'll- It doesn't, you can go first, Ms.

1194
02:00:13,663 --> 02:00:14,683
McLaughlin, that's fine.

1195
02:00:15,163 --> 02:00:17,084
Thank you, thank you, Member Kretz.

1196
02:00:18,204 --> 02:00:21,105
Thank you for the motion.

1197
02:00:21,525 --> 02:00:27,627
I guess the question I have is because there seems like there's a lot of details in this that I think they're discussion.

1198
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:34,089
And I'm wondering if I'd like to make a motion that this be moved actually to the rules subcommittee so that we can spend some time

1199
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:36,414
sort of digesting and going through this.

1200
02:00:36,474 --> 02:00:49,164
I know some of the links to the policy that was referred to in the agenda did not work as I was poking through them to see if they worked for community members to be able to have some insight into what this all meant.

1201
02:00:49,244 --> 02:00:58,752
And so I feel like that's part of the purpose of the subcommittees is for our community members to be able to access the school committee members in a more informal setting.

1202
02:00:59,292 --> 02:01:03,257
be able to discuss items that are on the agenda specifically.

1203
02:01:03,937 --> 02:01:14,269
So I also think there's, you know, some of the questions that, for example, are whether they're ad hoc or standing, you know, review what other district policies are in terms of the subcommittees.

1204
02:01:14,309 --> 02:01:18,974
I know that the subcommittees were sort of switched around at the beginning of our term last time around and

1205
02:01:20,888 --> 02:01:23,810
you know, some of them have been more involved than others.

1206
02:01:23,870 --> 02:01:26,771
And so I think it just begs a lot of conversation.

1207
02:01:26,871 --> 02:01:37,618
So I would make a motion to refer this to the rules subcommittee for a little bit of conversation with the community, as well as the rules committee members.

1208
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:38,478
Thank you.

1209
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:43,681
So motion to move this to the rules subcommittee by member McLaughlin.

1210
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:46,683
Member Kretz, you're up to speak next.

1211
02:01:47,526 --> 02:01:49,147
Okay, yep.

1212
02:01:49,247 --> 02:01:52,948
So I thank you for bringing this to us, Ms.

1213
02:01:52,968 --> 02:01:53,248
Graham.

1214
02:01:53,548 --> 02:01:58,490
So I have, I was reading number three and I just need some clarification.

1215
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:14,195
So do you mean that like, so for example, you know, I've been the chair for the building and grounds subcommittee and I have, you know, kind of developed the agenda with the assistance of Mr. Murphy, the superintendent,

1216
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:20,759
the Director of Building and Grounds, and then community member input, what they're interested in hearing about.

1217
02:02:20,839 --> 02:02:25,383
So for example, the Merritt High School sign was part of my agenda last year.

1218
02:02:26,063 --> 02:02:32,828
This year, something that might be of interest would be bike racks for middle school and high school.

1219
02:02:33,649 --> 02:02:34,769
I think I'm just confused.

1220
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:41,694
So are you saying that the chair would no longer create the agenda

1221
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:53,303
And I would have to, or the person who's the chair would have to wait for something to get referred to the committee and how will that happen?

1222
02:02:53,323 --> 02:02:56,565
I guess, you know, I had a lot of questions about number three.

1223
02:02:56,585 --> 02:02:58,426
I was confused about number three.

1224
02:03:04,088 --> 02:03:04,588
Member Roussell.

1225
02:03:08,396 --> 02:03:15,983
Number three is how the city council does their work, the state legislature, the federal government, all legislative bodies.

1226
02:03:16,723 --> 02:03:25,811
So I do think it's appropriate that when we spend our money, that the full committee has agreed to it.

1227
02:03:25,931 --> 02:03:33,298
And we are spending our money when we have the superintendent, assistant superintendents, directors,

1228
02:03:35,097 --> 02:03:40,740
principles all coming together to discuss something, that is an expense.

1229
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:49,324
And without a majority vote of the committee, I don't believe we have the authority as individual subcommittee chairs to spend resources.

1230
02:03:49,524 --> 02:03:52,666
So do I like it all the time?

1231
02:03:52,746 --> 02:03:54,046
No, because it can be clunky.

1232
02:03:54,707 --> 02:03:58,749
But it's literally how every legislative body in this country works.

1233
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:01,370
So I don't really feel like

1234
02:04:04,828 --> 02:04:09,933
It's a change, there's no question, but I certainly support it.

1235
02:04:09,993 --> 02:04:14,437
Not so much because I like things to just take longer, but because it's not free.

1236
02:04:15,177 --> 02:04:15,738
It's not free.

1237
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:24,485
And that we as individual subcommittees do not have the authority to spend money.

1238
02:04:26,147 --> 02:04:26,427
Thank you.

1239
02:04:28,452 --> 02:04:30,474
Just some clarification.

1240
02:04:31,394 --> 02:04:35,598
I guess I'm not following what you're saying I'm not talking about spending money.

1241
02:04:35,618 --> 02:04:42,384
I'm simply talking about, you know, when I've been the chair of the building and grounds.

1242
02:04:42,965 --> 02:04:50,512
I've received updates with exciting news from the vocational school, you know, different things the students are doing.

1243
02:04:52,117 --> 02:04:54,858
I'm not following what you're saying.

1244
02:04:54,878 --> 02:04:57,119
I mean, I'm not talking about spending money.

1245
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:16,205
You know, sometimes the meetings would be informational where I would be receiving information about updates or where we are with statuses of, you know, like let's say the walkie talkies or, you know, where we are with like last year, for example, where we were with the sign.

1246
02:05:17,886 --> 02:05:24,256
I'm not following and I'm sorry, maybe if there's somebody else that would be able to explain it to me a little bit easier.

1247
02:05:24,276 --> 02:05:31,427
I'm just not following like, how would items get referred to like, for example,

1248
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:52,381
Are you saying that the only way to have something referred to the subcommittee is what, what you've been doing all along which is like putting your resolution on the agenda so like if I wanted to have something on the, on my like let's say I was the chair of the building and grounds and I wanted to have.

1249
02:05:53,061 --> 02:05:56,964
a discussion on bike racks and what do we think we have?

1250
02:05:57,044 --> 02:05:58,425
What do we think we need?

1251
02:05:58,845 --> 02:06:00,526
We're not talking about money.

1252
02:06:00,826 --> 02:06:08,151
We're just talking about having a community discussion, which I did get some emails on earlier in September.

1253
02:06:08,171 --> 02:06:15,156
And we wanted to do something with that meeting, but we were held off because it was the election time.

1254
02:06:15,456 --> 02:06:17,137
So we couldn't have subcommittee meetings.

1255
02:06:17,197 --> 02:06:21,661
So at some point that might've been an agenda item.

1256
02:06:22,848 --> 02:06:24,709
I guess that I'm talking about that.

1257
02:06:25,109 --> 02:06:38,933
I'm still, I don't know what number three means in terms of how does an item get, if I'm the chair of a committee, how does the item get on that agenda for the committee?

1258
02:06:38,953 --> 02:06:43,174
Cause I used to be, or the chair would be the person who would build that agenda.

1259
02:06:44,774 --> 02:06:45,655
Does that help?

1260
02:06:48,195 --> 02:06:49,976
Mayor can I, could I respond to that?

1261
02:06:52,444 --> 02:06:53,344
Yes, member Graham.

1262
02:06:54,325 --> 02:06:57,586
So I think in that case I think actually that's a really good example.

1263
02:06:58,027 --> 02:07:11,593
So in that case, what you would be doing is putting an agenda, a resolution on our standing agenda saying the building and ground subcommittee is be resolved that they will hold a meeting that discusses bike racks.

1264
02:07:12,293 --> 02:07:23,103
at our various properties and we would all say yes or no to that, and that would be your signal, assuming it's a yes, that would be your signal to then go ahead and schedule your meeting as you see fit.

1265
02:07:23,503 --> 02:07:28,908
I think that also would be a clear directive that being held off because of an election or

1266
02:07:30,109 --> 02:07:49,281
something's people being too busy, like all of those reasons why meetings get held off go away, because the committee has then said, this is something we collectively want to put our energy behind, we want to hear from a subcommittee, we want you to go off and do this work, go off and do this work and come back and report back to us.

1267
02:07:51,246 --> 02:07:52,606
That is how it would work.

1268
02:07:52,646 --> 02:07:58,790
So you would just put it on this agenda, we would vote on it, we'd send it to your subcommittee and then you'd be free to meet like you always have.

1269
02:07:59,211 --> 02:08:16,041
I think the challenge is when we all have items that we think we should be meeting about that may or may not have the support of the whole committee, that requires a lot of time from the administration and their time is money because we pay them.

1270
02:08:16,561 --> 02:08:18,903
And when they're in our subcommittee meetings,

1271
02:08:19,423 --> 02:08:23,564
potentially talking about things that don't have the support of the entire committee.

1272
02:08:23,984 --> 02:08:28,945
We're spending their time and more importantly, taking them away from things that do have the support of the entire committee.

1273
02:08:29,005 --> 02:08:45,528
So that's the goal there is just to firm up our rules of operation around how do things get to subcommittee so that the community who tunes into these meetings, but maybe not the larger set of, you know, hundreds of subcommittee meetings across the year,

1274
02:08:46,175 --> 02:08:48,197
can anticipate when something is coming.

1275
02:08:48,217 --> 02:09:03,913
I know there's been plenty of times that had I known what was on the building and ground subcommittee agenda I would have probably attended because I was surprised to hear that things like boilers and things in like big ticket items frankly are being discussed in subcommittee that haven't been discussed here so

1276
02:09:04,654 --> 02:09:09,298
I think it's just a better way to say this is what the priority of the committee is.

1277
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:13,241
There's agreement to talk about this or to take some sort of action.

1278
02:09:14,723 --> 02:09:19,747
And then that also gives clarity to the administration what we're asking them to work on and what we're not.

1279
02:09:20,788 --> 02:09:22,289
So that is the goal of number three.

1280
02:09:27,956 --> 02:09:32,098
I just have another follow up.

1281
02:09:32,799 --> 02:09:38,041
So for example, I'm just thinking back to other agendas I've had.

1282
02:09:38,421 --> 02:09:55,229
So if I had four or five, six or seven things that I was going to put on the agenda, are you saying I would do seven resolutions or seven separate resolutions that I would be putting on the agenda?

1283
02:09:56,556 --> 02:10:05,250
It's just something new and, you know, I'm just, I'm not sure where the mayor is going to be forming our subcommittees, you know, I don't know what.

1284
02:10:06,434 --> 02:10:08,035
What, what is my responsibility?

1285
02:10:08,135 --> 02:10:14,339
I'm just, you know, I've been doing it the other way, building the agenda with the superintendent.

1286
02:10:14,519 --> 02:10:22,305
I've been working with the superintendent, the finance director, director of, you know, building and grounds and sometimes even city hall.

1287
02:10:22,365 --> 02:10:27,428
So, you know, I, I haven't been, let's say bypassing the committee.

1288
02:10:27,448 --> 02:10:31,731
We would only vote for things to move it out to the full committee.

1289
02:10:32,391 --> 02:10:34,693
And then the full committee would take a vote.

1290
02:10:35,153 --> 02:10:35,774
We never,

1291
02:10:36,634 --> 02:10:41,881
voted on anything without the full support of the committee.

1292
02:10:43,262 --> 02:10:56,438
The only thing that I'm seeing here differently is that in order for a chair to build their agenda, they first would have to add

1293
02:10:57,369 --> 02:11:08,261
The agenda items to the regular school committee as a resolution, get approval before they, the person could go and then schedule their subcommittee meeting.

1294
02:11:08,801 --> 02:11:15,628
Like I guess you know like I guess I was just looking for more instructions, you know, because if I take this vote tonight.

1295
02:11:18,429 --> 02:11:22,251
I have to know what I'm doing as a chairperson.

1296
02:11:22,691 --> 02:11:26,093
Do you see what I mean?

1297
02:11:26,533 --> 02:11:31,896
With instructions, because I've been doing it one way the whole time, this is just a new way.

1298
02:11:31,916 --> 02:11:33,957
I just have to know it all the way through.

1299
02:11:34,297 --> 02:11:37,139
How am I going to do that?

1300
02:11:37,659 --> 02:11:39,260
The way that I described it,

1301
02:11:40,402 --> 02:12:00,702
how it's going to be so like if I have four items that I don't have any items right now in fact but if I had four items I would put four resolutions you know that I would like this to be resolved that it would go on the building ground subcommittee because we would have to take a vote on each separate resolution which would be separate agenda item

1302
02:12:02,594 --> 02:12:09,158
So, I mean, I guess member cuts in that case, if you had four items, you could put a resolution that contains the four items.

1303
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:18,663
And then if the committee for some reason felt like item number three was not something they could, you know, there could be a motion to sever that out of your resolution and it could be voted on separately.

1304
02:12:18,743 --> 02:12:28,788
But I think the bigger concern is to make sure that if you are going to go and ask the administration to prepare

1305
02:12:29,249 --> 02:12:46,062
a presentation and an agenda and all those other things that this committee agrees that those four items are things that A, should be talked about at all and B, should be talked about in that subcommittee versus maybe there's something we would say, gee, I really think that should be something for a regular school committee meeting.

1306
02:12:46,142 --> 02:12:58,031
So yeah, I think, you know, if they were really different items or they came up over time, you could have many different resolutions, but I wouldn't see any reason to preclude you from also just having one resolution that says here's the,

1307
02:12:58,612 --> 02:13:00,413
you know, here's the things I want to schedule a meeting about.

1308
02:13:00,433 --> 02:13:08,495
I think both ways work as long as this voting body says, yes, we agree that that is worth spending our time on.

1309
02:13:10,956 --> 02:13:11,236
Ma'am.

1310
02:13:13,837 --> 02:13:18,599
Member Crezza, are you all finished?

1311
02:13:19,471 --> 02:13:20,312
Yes.

1312
02:13:20,412 --> 02:13:26,076
So the way I understand it is to add a resolution and then it would get voted on.

1313
02:13:26,556 --> 02:13:31,179
And then if it was approved, then I could go ahead and build the agenda.

1314
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,481
Okay.

1315
02:13:38,024 --> 02:13:39,465
Member McLaughlin.

1316
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:40,986
Yes.

1317
02:13:41,206 --> 02:13:43,188
And I'm just thinking some of this through as well.

1318
02:13:43,288 --> 02:13:45,950
I feel like part of what has been really beneficial

1319
02:13:47,065 --> 02:13:58,637
For subcommittees with the community members that I've been working with is that it's, it's been a big part of community engagement and I would really, especially since we know this has already been an identified.

1320
02:14:00,485 --> 02:14:06,510
uh, goal that is lacking in our district, um, that it would, that it would cause some of the community engagement that we have.

1321
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:07,831
And that's concerning to me.

1322
02:14:07,951 --> 02:14:16,938
I feel like, um, first we would have to get, you know, the delay that it would take even to make a subcommittee meeting is, you know, first we have to get approval.

1323
02:14:16,958 --> 02:14:21,502
Um, then we can schedule the agenda for the meeting and then we can schedule the meeting.

1324
02:14:21,542 --> 02:14:27,887
It just feels like a whole series of steps, a little bit like the, the, um, the cart before the horse in some ways.

1325
02:14:28,167 --> 02:14:28,207
Um,

1326
02:14:28,683 --> 02:14:42,711
because a lot of times I feel like the subcommittee meetings too are a way to arrive at what motion or policy that you want to get on the school committee through community input and administrative input.

1327
02:14:43,331 --> 02:14:50,875
And I also, one of the other items on the resolution was the subcommittee will be provided a list of its function and duties.

1328
02:14:51,075 --> 02:14:57,279
And it's just unclear to me who defines what the list of function and duties are for the subcommittee and how,

1329
02:14:57,919 --> 02:14:58,520
Are they defined?

1330
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:08,808
So I would amend my motion to move this to the rules subcommittee to move this to a committee of the whole because it seems like there's a lot of rich discussion here.

1331
02:15:08,828 --> 02:15:19,957
And I'd love to see this as a committee of the whole where we can really collaborate and work together on efficient use of our time and continuing to engage the community members.

1332
02:15:20,678 --> 02:15:23,020
So I make a motion to move this to a committee of the whole.

1333
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:29,159
I second.

1334
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:37,722
Motion to move this to Committee of the Whole by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McStone.

1335
02:15:39,543 --> 02:15:40,123
Roll call, please.

1336
02:15:47,625 --> 02:15:48,065
One moment.

1337
02:15:49,426 --> 02:15:51,806
Still getting used to the fact that when you say that, that's me.

1338
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:05,720
Yes.

1339
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:05,960
Yes.

1340
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:07,461
Yes.

1341
02:16:10,201 --> 02:16:10,361
Yes.

1342
02:16:10,401 --> 02:16:10,721
Yes.

1343
02:16:11,561 --> 02:16:11,821
Yes.

1344
02:16:13,862 --> 02:16:14,082
Yes.

1345
02:16:14,142 --> 02:16:14,462
Yes.

1346
02:16:15,202 --> 02:16:15,402
Yes.

1347
02:16:29,532 --> 02:16:33,215
Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1348
02:16:33,795 --> 02:16:36,077
This paper goes to Committee of the Whole.

1349
02:16:37,037 --> 02:16:37,298
Mayor.

1350
02:16:37,398 --> 02:16:37,778
Mayor.

1351
02:16:39,259 --> 02:16:42,321
Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

1352
02:16:43,662 --> 02:16:46,684
I'd like to make a motion that we schedule that immediately right this moment.

1353
02:16:49,526 --> 02:16:49,846
Second.

1354
02:16:50,787 --> 02:16:54,950
Okay, either January, maybe before our January 24th meeting,

1355
02:16:58,630 --> 02:17:02,672
I can discuss this with administration this week and get it scheduled.

1356
02:17:05,414 --> 02:17:06,454
The 24th works for me.

1357
02:17:09,436 --> 02:17:09,976
24th is great.

1358
02:17:09,996 --> 02:17:10,837
24th works for me.

1359
02:17:11,477 --> 02:17:11,918
Wonderful.

1360
02:17:13,198 --> 02:17:23,204
Next up we have number four, whereas students and families have been charged more than 200 per class for summer remediation and credit recovery.

1361
02:17:24,591 --> 02:17:54,377
And whereas students enrolled in summer mediation and credit recovery are disproportionately more vulnerable subgroups, including economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities and English learners, be resolved, Medford Public Schools will no longer charge student identified as belonging in the subgroups economically disadvantaged English learners and students with disabilities for mediation programming and credit recovery during summer programming

1362
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:58,221
and the academic year commencing June 1st, 2022.

1363
02:17:58,942 --> 02:18:12,627
Be it further resolved that all students requiring credit remediation to prevent retention be notified in writing through the United States Postal System and email 45 days before the last day of school.

1364
02:18:13,188 --> 02:18:15,429
Submitted by Member McLaughlin and Member McStone.

1365
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:21,471
Member McStone or Member McLaughlin.

1366
02:18:21,991 --> 02:18:22,652
Thank you, Mayor.

1367
02:18:24,218 --> 02:18:33,828
Yes, this, this came about as a result of the number of, you know, high instances of obviously remediation both with the pandemic and

1368
02:18:34,697 --> 02:18:50,489
Um, other issues that we had in our, you know, our most vulnerable subgroups are disproportionately, um, involved in that remediation, as we know, um, based on just some of the, um, items, mr. Murphy was talking about earlier tonight and, you know, other discussions that we've had.

1369
02:18:50,549 --> 02:18:58,915
And, um, it just seems unfair and unjust to charge students, um, who are already in our most vulnerable populations for.

1370
02:19:00,122 --> 02:19:08,724
remediation and credit recovery when we know that they're struggling and they're disproportionately a part of that remediation process.

1371
02:19:08,744 --> 02:19:11,804
So that was the genesis of this motion.

1372
02:19:11,824 --> 02:19:13,565
Thank you.

1373
02:19:15,085 --> 02:19:15,525
Thank you.

1374
02:19:15,725 --> 02:19:16,905
Member Stone.

1375
02:19:21,486 --> 02:19:22,087
Member Stone.

1376
02:19:22,927 --> 02:19:24,687
I heard a man's voice and it wasn't mine.

1377
02:19:25,287 --> 02:19:26,007
Okay.

1378
02:19:28,308 --> 02:19:29,088
Whoever wants to speak.

1379
02:19:30,455 --> 02:19:30,795
Thank you.

1380
02:19:34,176 --> 02:19:37,237
Do we have an analysis of the cost of this?

1381
02:19:37,357 --> 02:19:46,859
I don't certainly have any issue with the, conceptually, I mean, as everybody knows, I think we should charge nothing for anything if it's public school.

1382
02:19:47,999 --> 02:19:50,139
But, I mean, are we talking $10,000?

1383
02:19:50,599 --> 02:19:52,360
Are we talking a million dollars?

1384
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:52,960
Like, I don't know.

1385
02:19:59,215 --> 02:20:00,576
Mayor Mr Murphy has his hand up.

1386
02:20:02,818 --> 02:20:04,259
Yes, or if you jump in anytime.

1387
02:20:06,601 --> 02:20:10,944
I don't have an exact number Mr so but it would be a, it'd be fairly easy to calculate.

1388
02:20:11,764 --> 02:20:20,591
Previously in the school year we presented information to the committee with respect to the breakdown of subgroups of students who are enrolled in the summer school programming.

1389
02:20:22,488 --> 02:20:34,914
identifying what the potential deficit would be would essentially be based on just looking at as much of a representative sampling of school years as possible so that we could have an estimate.

1390
02:20:36,655 --> 02:20:48,281
The point that I wanted to raise was that I think that this is a, I think we all understand the intention behind this proposal and if it's something that the committee

1391
02:20:49,513 --> 02:20:53,116
would like us to move forward with, then we'll do our best to implement it.

1392
02:20:53,536 --> 02:21:14,570
We do have a set of criteria that the central office provided to schools earlier in the fall that essentially provides guidance to school administrators as to trying to create something of a standard as to when fees should be waived of any kind.

1393
02:21:15,311 --> 02:21:18,793
And that guidance, which we can circulate to you, just internal guidance that we

1394
02:21:19,318 --> 02:21:29,664
circulated because in the course of the school year, there's any number of items that the district would typically impose a fee in order for the service to be rendered.

1395
02:21:29,684 --> 02:21:35,888
And very frequently our administrators are waiving those fees because of individual situations.

1396
02:21:35,908 --> 02:21:48,376
So we essentially surveyed administrators as to when it was their practice to waive fees and when they thought it would be a good practice to waive fees and memorialize that in guidance that we circulated internally.

1397
02:21:48,951 --> 02:22:01,513
If the committee were to pass this policy, we would essentially tack on to that internal guidance, the language of this policy, and add those two subgroups for this specific fee, and it would be waived.

1398
02:22:02,013 --> 02:22:10,175
Now, typically, as I understand it in Medford, the summer program has run a modest deficit of a few thousand dollars.

1399
02:22:11,155 --> 02:22:15,836
If everyone in these two subgroups are waived, then that

1400
02:22:17,082 --> 02:22:18,783
deficit is going to grow.

1401
02:22:19,944 --> 02:22:24,869
And I think it would be beneficial for us to provide that specific information.

1402
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:32,435
And I think we could do so by the next meeting so that you can understand the magnitude of this expense.

1403
02:22:32,915 --> 02:22:36,638
It may very well, in the committee's view, be a worthwhile expense.

1404
02:22:37,579 --> 02:22:41,322
But I do think it's something that we'd be able to provide more specific information around.

1405
02:22:41,883 --> 02:22:44,665
Now, that's the financial piece of this.

1406
02:22:46,215 --> 02:23:09,263
I do think, and I think we've had some discussions previously, that there is a rationale to the fee with regard to the credit recovery program in that in some cases, not all, and we're not in any way implying that there's uniformity with regard to this, but there are cases in which the fee serves as an incentive

1407
02:23:10,261 --> 02:23:17,286
to make sure that the programming is being completed by students who are enrolled in it.

1408
02:23:17,546 --> 02:23:36,720
And I'm not sure that that's a strategy that I would personally endorse, but I think it's one that we have to at least take into account, because what we don't want to do is in any way diminish participation for students for whom this is a beneficial program.

1409
02:23:38,829 --> 02:23:43,730
If the committee votes on this tonight, we'll do our best to implement it and we'll still report back as to its implications.

1410
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:58,694
If it is tabled to the January 24th meeting, I think we would be able to provide some greater specificity of information, both in terms of the cost magnitude and then just what the administration's position is with regard to the rationale.

1411
02:23:59,397 --> 02:24:09,721
Mayor, I'm willing to table it to the January 24th meeting if Member Mastone is, but I just want to reply also to something that Mr. Murphy was saying, if I may.

1412
02:24:10,509 --> 02:24:11,690
Yes, member McLaughlin.

1413
02:24:12,371 --> 02:24:12,791
Thank you.

1414
02:24:13,352 --> 02:24:29,908
So I also I appreciate the introspection Mr Murphy around the policy and I also just, I guess I want to point to a few things around you know the, the identification of families who may need this type of support.

1415
02:24:31,149 --> 02:24:32,530
While I think that that's you know.

1416
02:24:34,831 --> 02:24:36,132
altruistic in its goal.

1417
02:24:36,232 --> 02:24:40,274
I think that we know that there can be implicit bias in our systems.

1418
02:24:40,334 --> 02:24:46,196
And I just want to make sure that we are ruling out implicit bias and that we can sort of offer this to it was actually three subgroups.

1419
02:24:46,276 --> 02:24:55,520
It's the EL students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged, who are disproportionately in this group and being charged for remediation, which

1420
02:24:56,044 --> 02:25:07,031
it just feels ironic to me that we're charging these populations for remediation when it's sort of a cycle of systemic sort of subgrouping.

1421
02:25:07,891 --> 02:25:13,895
And we're thinking about achievement gap opportunities and narrowing those for these particular subgroups.

1422
02:25:14,495 --> 02:25:21,440
And also just having been in one of these subgroups as a child myself, you know, sometimes parents don't ask for, you know,

1423
02:25:24,167 --> 02:25:30,992
a break, either because they don't want to, they're embarrassed, or because they're unavailable and the children aren't able to ask on their behalf.

1424
02:25:31,453 --> 02:25:34,415
So I think we really need to think about the whole child in this approach.

1425
02:25:34,455 --> 02:25:38,638
And I do think that the number would be helpful for the school committee to be able to understand.

1426
02:25:38,698 --> 02:25:50,107
But I do also want to just put forth to my colleagues that I think that this is, albeit, you know, some cost to the district, I do think that it's morally and ethically the right thing to do.

1427
02:25:50,428 --> 02:25:50,748
Thank you.

1428
02:25:52,486 --> 02:25:54,307
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1429
02:25:54,887 --> 02:26:01,669
Yes, Member McLaughlin, I did want to make one comment regarding the proposed policy.

1430
02:26:01,709 --> 02:26:14,334
I know it's being tabled to the next meeting, but as I was looking at the resolution, I should say, the last sentence

1431
02:26:15,682 --> 02:26:24,348
Be it further resolved that all students requiring credit remediation, and then going on to say that they be emailed 45 days before the last day of school.

1432
02:26:25,089 --> 02:26:32,194
And so what I did want to just comment on was that within the last 45 days of school there are those students.

1433
02:26:32,874 --> 02:26:37,758
that might be on the cusp or they thought they were passing.

1434
02:26:38,299 --> 02:26:46,125
And then it was the last, the second to last quiz that the scale ended up tipping in the opposite direction.

1435
02:26:46,505 --> 02:26:53,511
So there definitely are students that I know at the secondary level, high school levels that they're closely monitoring.

1436
02:26:54,312 --> 02:26:57,455
their GPAs and how they're doing over the course of the year.

1437
02:26:57,835 --> 02:27:02,760
And then there are some students that it really comes down to that last term.

1438
02:27:03,301 --> 02:27:06,745
So that 45 day window, there could be

1439
02:27:08,103 --> 02:27:09,804
we might not be capturing everyone.

1440
02:27:10,285 --> 02:27:24,497
And so that was something that I just wanted to put out there to say that within 45 days, there are some kids, once they get that final kind of, you know, you know, we're down to the wire, it's going to be summer school, it's going to be remediation.

1441
02:27:25,177 --> 02:27:27,559
Are you going to be able to make it or not?

1442
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:29,401
And so I just wanted to

1443
02:27:31,142 --> 02:27:34,624
that we would probably need to look at that 45 day mark.

1444
02:27:34,824 --> 02:27:48,872
And so if it is tabled, that'll give me an opportunity to work with Dr. Cushing and the secondary high school principals, secondary principals that are dealing with the summer school programming.

1445
02:27:49,369 --> 02:27:56,291
Thank you, I was thinking about that and I appreciate your looking at that for the appropriate timeframe I think that's really important, but I also think that sometimes.

1446
02:27:57,452 --> 02:28:05,634
The communication parents might not necessarily know or think they you know they know, but or the student thinks they know, but they don't so I think that's really helpful to look at a timeframe.

1447
02:28:06,054 --> 02:28:10,596
And then also, I just would add that I know you know, not for every student and.

1448
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:18,545
you know, I may have had some of these students, I may not have in my own home, but I will say that retention can be an incentive.

1449
02:28:19,485 --> 02:28:22,707
So I think that that's a really important piece to consider too.

1450
02:28:22,767 --> 02:28:28,571
So thank you all for looking at this and I motion to table this to January 24th meeting.

1451
02:28:28,611 --> 02:28:31,893
Motion to table by member McLaughlin, seconded by?

1452
02:28:32,294 --> 02:28:32,654
Second.

1453
02:28:33,354 --> 02:28:34,995
Member Graham, roll call.

1454
02:28:36,496 --> 02:28:36,997
Member Graham.

1455
02:28:37,657 --> 02:28:37,897
Yes.

1456
02:28:39,598 --> 02:28:40,679
Member Hayes.

1457
02:28:41,308 --> 02:28:41,548
Yes.

1458
02:28:42,688 --> 02:28:43,188
Member Kratz.

1459
02:28:43,928 --> 02:28:44,109
Yes.

1460
02:28:45,289 --> 02:28:46,349
Member McLaughlin.

1461
02:28:47,089 --> 02:28:47,349
Yes.

1462
02:28:48,549 --> 02:28:49,229
Member McStone.

1463
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:49,890
Yes.

1464
02:28:50,950 --> 02:28:51,590
Member Russell.

1465
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:52,050
Yes.

1466
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:53,670
Mayor Longo.

1467
02:28:54,550 --> 02:28:56,311
Yes, on the affirmative, zero on the negative.

1468
02:28:57,871 --> 02:29:00,071
Motion is tabled till next meeting.

1469
02:29:00,832 --> 02:29:08,693
Number five offered by Member Russell, Member Graham, policy BEDH section two will have the sentence written comments

1470
02:29:09,298 --> 02:29:24,382
must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the bracket in less than three minutes, or the comments will be summarized by the secretary of the school committee replaced with the sentence written comments be forwarded to all members of the school committee by the secretary of the school committee in a timely fashion.

1471
02:29:29,063 --> 02:29:29,884
Member Rousseau.

1472
02:29:30,964 --> 02:29:31,364
Thank you.

1473
02:29:31,464 --> 02:29:34,185
So we've had a year.

1474
02:29:36,124 --> 02:29:37,806
year or five years or something.

1475
02:29:39,047 --> 02:29:49,136
Sorry, I don't remember when we started doing this, where we were, since the pandemic started, where emails were read into the record.

1476
02:29:49,977 --> 02:29:53,040
I'll just be blunt, I don't think it works.

1477
02:29:53,641 --> 02:29:54,982
This results in

1478
02:29:55,834 --> 02:30:08,359
you know, presentations from the public health update, superintendent's update, and then we read in out loud questions from the public where they ask all the questions that were just answered moments ago.

1479
02:30:08,379 --> 02:30:11,020
It doesn't make any sense.

1480
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:23,065
There's, I honestly can't remember why we decided to start doing this, but the access that the public has to our meetings is greater than it has ever been.

1481
02:30:24,406 --> 02:30:31,171
As we can see there, well, we're down to 32, but we were up to 60 people on a meeting with, frankly, a rather boring agenda.

1482
02:30:32,773 --> 02:30:45,903
So if the public wishes to speak in our meetings, they can raise their hands and say their piece, as they have always been able to do and still could, even with this policy as it was written.

1483
02:30:47,004 --> 02:30:57,569
But I think reading the emails into the record is just not, it's not working and it's not something I see any other community doing.

1484
02:30:58,729 --> 02:31:04,932
So I recommend that we, the middle ground here that I recommend is

1485
02:31:05,816 --> 02:31:16,443
that we change it, that the secretary will continue to monitor the inbox as we expect the secretary to do, and that the secretary will forward those emails on.

1486
02:31:17,744 --> 02:31:28,751
My recommendation is just immediately upon seeing them, there's no reason to wait to the meeting because then the rest of us don't have a chance to see them because we're interacting in the meeting.

1487
02:31:29,291 --> 02:31:31,913
So this is my recommendation.

1488
02:31:31,933 --> 02:31:34,615
Motion to approve.

1489
02:31:35,509 --> 02:31:35,789
Mayor.

1490
02:31:36,029 --> 02:31:36,690
Thank you.

1491
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:39,671
Member Russo motion to approve by member Graham member McLaughlin.

1492
02:31:40,331 --> 02:31:40,551
Yes.

1493
02:31:40,611 --> 02:31:40,932
Thank you.

1494
02:31:41,412 --> 02:31:52,257
Um, through the chair, I'm wondering about, um, I think that this was started because actually because of the pandemic and we had moved to zoom and it was about, you know, being able to hear people.

1495
02:31:52,317 --> 02:31:55,278
We weren't sure how the zoom sort of protocol would work.

1496
02:31:55,338 --> 02:32:01,221
And I think that that was why it was started, but it was Paulette that was reading them last time, which was the chair, not the secretary.

1497
02:32:01,321 --> 02:32:02,462
So, you know, that was,

1498
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:05,036
Wasn't Paulette reading them?

1499
02:32:05,156 --> 02:32:08,067
I wasn't reading them in the last two years.

1500
02:32:09,918 --> 02:32:10,639
Member Rousseau.

1501
02:32:11,619 --> 02:32:12,000
Thank you.

1502
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:14,321
Yes, actually, you're right.

1503
02:32:14,482 --> 02:32:20,266
It was the vice chair that was doing the reading of them because I was the vice chair for the first year of the pandemic.

1504
02:32:21,747 --> 02:32:29,273
And so I just picked it up as the person who was at a gigantic screen and it was easiest, I thought.

1505
02:32:30,354 --> 02:32:36,479
But I've switched it in this change to be the secretary since I was hoping I would be the secretary.

1506
02:32:37,783 --> 02:32:41,684
I'm sure you've all noticed I bring my computer to the meetings.

1507
02:32:41,704 --> 02:32:51,326
I mean, doing this kind of work in our meeting on an iPhone is going to be a challenge.

1508
02:32:52,287 --> 02:32:59,568
And I certainly don't have any problems or qualms doing that task as the secretary.

1509
02:32:59,588 --> 02:33:01,489
You're right, it was the vice chair.

1510
02:33:02,179 --> 02:33:02,519
Thank you.

1511
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:14,049
I think the only question I have about this is that I know that there are some community members who have anxiety speaking publicly, right?

1512
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:21,936
So to do a presentation before the school committee, I know several community members who just won't do it because they're

1513
02:33:22,569 --> 02:33:23,390
anxious doing that.

1514
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:50,452
So is there a way that there could be an amendment to this just saying that unless the author specifically asked that it be read into the meeting so that that way we give people the window of opportunity if they really are, you know, among those folks who are anxious, being able to present before the subcommittee that they could still have input or have their question addressed or put out there.

1515
02:33:50,632 --> 02:33:50,932
Thank you.

1516
02:33:52,301 --> 02:33:52,541
May I?

1517
02:33:54,443 --> 02:33:55,043
Member Rousseau?

1518
02:33:56,504 --> 02:33:58,626
I don't actually inherently have a problem with that.

1519
02:33:58,746 --> 02:34:01,368
The issue I have is implementation.

1520
02:34:01,689 --> 02:34:10,796
So I mean, I would be okay with it if we would say something like the secretary can read the message and decide that it is not necessary.

1521
02:34:11,176 --> 02:34:18,442
So like in our most recent meetings, people email in and they list nine questions to ask.

1522
02:34:18,842 --> 02:34:21,865
And it's just like it's an interrogation of an administrator

1523
02:34:22,677 --> 02:34:39,893
from an email, not even from a person standing there asking questions which, and I, I'm particularly uncomfortable where I get to decide whether it gets read into the record or not, I don't feel, I don't know if other members would be comfortable with that, but it just feels like.

1524
02:34:41,593 --> 02:34:47,697
a good way for one of us to be targeted because we decided we weren't going to read it because we didn't think it was necessary or appropriate.

1525
02:34:49,218 --> 02:34:53,520
It's also worth noting, we sort of had this problem that we didn't address.

1526
02:34:53,761 --> 02:34:56,542
And we, I don't think we, well, I take it back.

1527
02:34:56,562 --> 02:35:06,428
Remember Vanderclue, a couple of times last year when she was reading emails, really declined to read the email because of the content.

1528
02:35:08,209 --> 02:35:10,531
People write things that they wouldn't say out loud.

1529
02:35:11,923 --> 02:35:20,386
And I'm not talking about questions about grading or something, I'm talking about things they wouldn't be willing to come to the podium and say, they will happily type it in.

1530
02:35:21,747 --> 02:35:28,289
And so, I mean, I didn't make a stink about it when member VanderKloof made that decision.

1531
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:33,531
But the bottom line is, is that she was, you know,

1532
02:35:34,369 --> 02:35:40,551
using her judgment to do something that I don't know that we all should be doing that we should be censoring the public comment.

1533
02:35:41,972 --> 02:35:52,596
So I prefer something more black and white, where I don't read them in that there may all emails received.

1534
02:35:53,288 --> 02:36:00,013
our public record and freedom member, it's not freedom, public records requests can be used to access them.

1535
02:36:01,574 --> 02:36:08,078
And obviously if they're forwarded to all the members, you know, we're free to do what we want with them as well.

1536
02:36:09,139 --> 02:36:14,362
I just find it, you know, the issue, I do think there is an issue we need to address around.

1537
02:36:15,162 --> 02:36:20,266
And I think member McLaughlin, you brought it up when we did the policy updates

1538
02:36:20,834 --> 02:36:27,396
around public comment where we expect members of the public to provide their name and residential address in Medford.

1539
02:36:27,837 --> 02:36:33,139
And that there are certain circumstances for which that's not safe for some people to do.

1540
02:36:33,639 --> 02:36:40,461
And I know Massachusetts has a law that, I forget what it's called, but there's a mechanism for that.

1541
02:36:42,542 --> 02:36:44,103
But that's not what you're talking about here.

1542
02:36:44,123 --> 02:36:47,324
You're talking about just like how uncomfortable it is to get up and speak.

1543
02:36:47,524 --> 02:36:49,365
And that I can certainly relate to.

1544
02:36:51,437 --> 02:37:03,884
I'm certainly open to finding another way, but using up tens of minutes, an hour meeting is just too much of mine on.

1545
02:37:04,665 --> 02:37:05,065
Thank you.

1546
02:37:05,085 --> 02:37:06,606
That explanation was very helpful.

1547
02:37:06,846 --> 02:37:15,351
And I guess if community members feel like there's something they want to address, they can reach out to their, any one of us and ask that it,

1548
02:37:16,158 --> 02:37:18,179
potentially be put on the agenda or what have you.

1549
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:26,405
And I didn't realize that there were some that could not be read into the session last year, but I'm not at all surprised, frankly.

1550
02:37:26,445 --> 02:37:28,427
So I think that that makes sense.

1551
02:37:28,467 --> 02:37:31,209
And if they're forwarded to the rest of us, sounds good.

1552
02:37:31,309 --> 02:37:31,669
Thank you.

1553
02:37:36,453 --> 02:37:36,773
