    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=40.97s">Are</a>  you sitting in a dark mirror?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=42.571s">You</a>  look like you're in a horror movie. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=47.514s">It</a>  is gonna be a ghost story. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=49.115s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=50.316s">Let's</a>  start. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=51.016s">It</a>  looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=52.217s">Who's</a>  behind you? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=53.018s">You</a>  get Cody.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=53.578s">That</a>  was Cody. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=57.08s">Oh,</a>  it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=57.4s">Oh,</a>  no, it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=58.041s">And</a>  I'm home. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=64.704s">but</a>  it's supposed to go back on in a half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=67.046s">So</a>  we're gonna make this work.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=69.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=69.808s">We</a>  just saw a floating head behind you, which made me, you know, it made the whole horror vibe work for you, so.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=79.076s">I'll</a>  shut my camera off, but okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=81.598s">So</a>  it is 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=84.021s">We</a>  have a Medford School Committee meeting, January 10th, 2021, regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=87.544s">It</a>  is by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=93.76s">You</a>  can call in by dialing 1-929-205-6099. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=95.421s">Meeting</a>  ID when prompted is 958-3358-9191. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=97.483s">If</a>  you may call, I can call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=99.404s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=99.984s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=101.145s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=101.605s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=121.886s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=124.388s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=125.849s">Member</a>  Mustone?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=279.502s">I'd</a>  like to nominate Paul Rousseau for the role of secretary.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=284.667s">Paul</a>  Rousseau is nominated as secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=287.829s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=291.252s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=292.894s">Second</a>  by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=295.596s">If</a>  there's nobody else who would like to speak, I'm gonna call the roll for Member Ruseau as secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=304.503s">Member</a>  Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=307.256s">Yes,</a>  Paul Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=309.318s">Member</a>  Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=340.064s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=347.612s">Number</a>  four, we have good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=354.399s">Yes,</a>  member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=356.291s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=356.771s">And</a>  as folks know, good of the order is a review of school committee, sort of best practices and sort of moving things forward and I'm wanted to mention sort of two colleagues and see where folks are at. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=373.137s">seems</a>  to me that there's not much in the way of orientation for school committee members, and I'm thinking particularly of new school committee members, but also school committee members who are fairly new, refreshers, what have you, for an orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=388.251s">And</a>  so I'm wondering, I'd like to open that up to colleagues and see where folks are on that in terms of good of the order, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=396.283s">orientation</a>  specifically with regard to parliamentary procedure, where to go when, how to get information, policies, all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=409.729s">So</a>  I'd like to open that up as part of the order.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=417.573s">From</a>  the chair, I would just state, I think what we had two years ago was a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=422.515s">And</a>  I know Superintendent Edouard-Vincent is <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=425.512s">especially</a>  once the surge is over, is gonna try to get us all together to have a session where we can kind of collaborate and get to know each other some and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=437.577s">But</a>  would anybody else like to add to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=441.199s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=443.52s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=445.201s">I</a>  think this particular go to the order is, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=450.202s">relevant</a>  to something I'll be putting on the next agenda, which is a full set of rules that I spent three years writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=458.226s">And</a>  in there is a set of parts related to orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=463.488s">And</a>  I will be sending that to the committee tonight so that we will have plenty of, individually have time to read the entire set of rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=471.392s">And</a>  I hope that there can be a whole section built out on orientation and what it means <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=480.049s">what</a>  we mean by orientation, because I think that is definitely something that is, I've asked our new member, Hayes, when I sent her the rules tonight to bring a truly unique, we all were in her position at one point of not knowing how to be a school committee member at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=503.94s">Um,</a>  so I've asked her to write as many notes as possible as she reads the rules, because I feel a little concerned that our rules that I'm going to send you all tonight, um, we are all sort of living it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=516.77s">So,</a>  um, her perspective as somebody who does not have any rules and will surely have lots of questions is probably the most valuable one, but, um, around orientation, I could not agree more that we need to, we really need to build that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=531.4s">What</a>  do we even mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=532.836s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=533.837s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=535.857s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=537.998s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=539.439s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=539.959s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=540.58s">And</a>  to that point, I think it does need to be spelled out in terms of what orientation exactly means. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=545.022s">And</a>  I did also appreciate the event that Dr. Edouard-Vincent had hosted with the MASC two years ago, but I think it was also several weeks into the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=558.496s">You</a>  know, at that point, there was a lot of learning curve that had already happened and so in some ways I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=563.394s">committee</a>  also to be thinking about, you know, new members are elected in November, you know, is there an opportunity for a new member orientation before members come on board so that they're not potentially feeling so lost and or, you know, very much like, you know, first year teachers, a mentor position in school committee so that, you know, perhaps as a mentor to new school committee members or something along those lines, but I do think that it's something that really needs to be <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=589.81s">considered</a>  for the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=591.651s">And</a>  I would also just follow up to member Ruseau's comment regarding the rules that he was gonna send to us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=600.458s">Member</a>  Ruseau, are these from what's posted on the website that you're referring to in terms of the school committee MPS policies, or is this something different that you're referring to?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=611.907s">I</a>  won't, I'll let you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=614.901s">I'll</a>  leave it to suspense for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=619.243s">There's</a>  84 of them so far, and they're not really part. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=623.606s">Some</a>  of them are part of our policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=625.227s">Much</a>  of them are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=627.488s">A</a>  lot of them are just past practice that I've observed in my four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=631.99s">And</a>  then I trolled school committees all around the state for their rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=636.993s">Interestingly,</a>  we're not the only school committee that has no written set of rules, which shocked me. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=643.917s">But</a>  a bunch of them do have rules written down and they were really quite good documents to serve as the springboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=651.02s">But</a>  I'll send that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=651.96s">I</a>  didn't want to put it on the agenda tonight because it's, it's, it's not a small effort to read the full 18 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=660.664s">But</a>  I think it'll be worth it once we have something approved.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=672.749s">Mayor,</a>  I just wanted to say that for the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=676.931s">I</a>  thought that the orientation that the superintendent put on and I think it was Dorothy from the MSC she had come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=685.275s">It</a>  was very informative and a refresher for all of us as we're, you know, getting back into a new term. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=693.519s">you</a>  know, because sometimes we can, we know what we're doing, but sometimes we can forget and get away from what we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=700.96s">So</a>  I think it would be great and, you know, look forward to doing that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=708.762s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=711.602s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=714.303s">Oh,</a>  it was me.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=714.803s">So</a>  I just wanted to, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=719.984s">I</a>  just wanted to say welcome to Sharon. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=723.359s">Thank</a>  you for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=724.68s">We're</a>  excited to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=725.66s">And</a>  you should not hesitate to reach out to any of us if you have questions between now and then.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=757.247s">Did</a>  we lose the mayor?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=758.068s">I</a>  was just looking for the mayor and... Jenny Graham, vice chair, might get to be the fastest vice chair actually running a meeting in history.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=773.441s">Mayor,</a>  did we lose you? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=776.444s">I</a>  see her square, but I don't know if she's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=787.461s">Okay,</a>  well, I will do my best to take over while she deals with her technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=797.858s">Are</a>  there any other comments under the good of the order?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=804.599s">I</a>  will definitely be pursuing doing that retreat again for us, because I did enjoy that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=811.863s">And</a>  I am too going to wait just for the surge to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=815.144s">So</a>  hopefully by the end of February, maybe after break or something like that, we'll be able to participate in that retreat.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=831.812s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=832.212s">I</a>  see we have the mayor back. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=834.019s">Are</a>  you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=835.46s">Yeah,</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=836.381s">Thanks,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=837.622s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=839.804s">If</a>  there's no other business under good of the order, we can move on to number five, which is the consent agenda, approval of bills, payrolls, and approval of the regular school committee meeting minutes from 12-20-2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=852.635s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=853.556s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=854.877s">Motion</a>  to approve by member Laughlin, seconded by member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=860.362s">Member</a>  Ruseau, if you'll call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=865.961s">I</a>  don't remember the proper order. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=867.022s">Member</a>  Hays?</p>

    <p>[lRR2dgf0NZM_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=872.384s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=874.465s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[lRR2dgf0NZM_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=875.846s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=878.467s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=881.729s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=881.949s">I</a>  feel like I'm in third grade learning the alphabet or whatever that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=887.171s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=889.533s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=891.093s">Member</a>  Mustone?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=892.274s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=893.851s">Remember,</a>  that's me remember so is yes, and Mayor logo car.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=901.133s">Yes</a>  70 affirmative zero and the negative, the consent agenda has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=906.975s">We</a>  have no reports of subcommittee, but we do have a number of reports of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=914.238s">First</a>  up is superintendents updates and comments, Dr Marice Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=924.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=925.088s">I</a>  want to say good evening to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=926.869s">Happy</a>  New Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=929.071s">This</a>  is our first meeting of school year 2022 so that's pretty exciting and I'm looking forward to this new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=938.072s">So</a>  without much further ado, today, our COVID-19 update will be presented after this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=944.798s">It</a>  will be an official report presented by Assistant Superintendent David Murphy and our Director of Health Services, Mrs. Avery Hines. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=957.288s">As</a>  I mentioned in my communication earlier today, the weather forecast for Medford Public Schools area tomorrow <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=964.992s">is</a>  calling for extremely cold temperatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=968.955s">As</a>  a result, we have taken numerous steps within our schools to prepare for the wind chill temperatures that may hover around zero degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=978.24s">Please</a>  prepare your children by making sure they are properly dressed with warm and layered clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=985.165s">Our</a>  custodial staff is doing everything possible to make sure our heating systems are up to challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=991.42s">In</a>  addition, we are working with our bus vendors to make sure that their transportation equipment, meaning all buses, is operational despite the cold temperatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1002.378s">While</a>  we are doing everything that we can operationally to prepare to have a successful day tomorrow, there is an ongoing risk of unexpected staff or bus driver absences tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1015.045s">So</a>  please be aware of that due to our COVID related personnel challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1020.848s">In</a>  light of this, I am asking all families to minimize to the greatest extent possible the time that your child is waiting at the bus stop in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1032.327s">Students</a>  at the elementary schools will be allowed to enter their schools by 8.15 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1037.789s">tomorrow</a>  morning and at our middle schools 7.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1042.15s">and</a>  high school at 7.20 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1045.011s">We</a>  want to make sure that all of our students are kept safe and ready to learn throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1053.376s">So</a>  as many of you are aware, unfortunately, again, due to COVID, the original inaugural plans had to change, but I was able to watch them on the computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1067.003s">As</a>  the mayor said in her inaugural address, we are proud that the Medford public schools, due to our collaboration with Tufts University was able to bring our students back into school sooner than most surrounding districts, the teamwork of the city Tufts, and the schools <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1084.966s">working</a>  hand in hand to make in-person school a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1088.789s">And</a>  thanks to the collaboration with our full school committee, I wanna just say thank you and I wanna congratulate all of you and especially extend a warm welcome to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1098.655s">Sharon</a>  Hayes, our newest member. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1101.157s">So</a>  congratulations again to all of you on a new term and I'm looking forward to this new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1109.352s">I</a>  want the community to know that today the Medford Public Schools opened kindergarten registration for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1117.157s">If</a>  you have questions, please reach out to our Parent Information Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1123.641s">We</a>  have a few upcoming events this Wednesday, January 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1131.166s">Very</a>  important notice, we have another vaccine clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1135.089s">Again,</a>  a vaccination clinic is this Wednesday <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1138.991s">January</a>  12th from 3 to 6 p.m at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1144.195s">This</a>  vaccination clinic is for students 5 to 11 and for staff and students 12 and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1151.481s">So</a>  we will be giving boosters and first shots or second shots depending on where you are in your series. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1159.147s">So</a>  please take advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1161.208s">I</a>  am really pleased to say that we had over 100 people participate in last Wednesday's clinic, and I hope that we continue to have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1169.891s">I</a>  also want to extend a special thank you to the Medford Board of Health for their continued collaboration with the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1177.794s">I'd</a>  like to thank Nurse Director Avery Hines and all of our hardworking nurses in the Medford Public Schools for the <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1187.031s">incredible</a>  work that they are doing, leading us during this COVID time. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1193.536s">I</a>  also would like to announce for the community that this Wednesday, January 12th, between six and eight o'clock, we are going to be having a CPAC meeting and the Zoom, the topic will be disability awareness curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1210.087s">Again,</a>  this Wednesday, January 12th, from six to 8 p.m. <a

Bridges to Kindergarten presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1225.836s">That</a>  presentation is taking place by Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1228.777s">It's</a>  from 630 to 730 PM this Thursday, January 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1236.974s">I</a>  also want to share that on Monday, January 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1241.057s">Next</a>  Monday, it is a holiday, it is no school, we will be celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1249.803s">and</a>  his legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1252.945s">The</a>  West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1256.397s">along</a>  with many of our students from CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1260.205s">We</a>  will be hosting it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1264.253s">It</a>  will be remotely due to COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1268.345s">due</a>  to our COVID concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1270.406s">So</a>  it will be available on Zoom and we are working to see if we can collaborate with the TV studio to have that aired. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1278.269s">So</a>  I will be sending additional communications regarding our Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1284.311s">event</a>  on Monday, January 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1289.714s">I</a>  also wanna say that I'd like to warmly welcome to our community, the West Medford Community Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1296.957s">has</a>  hired their new executive director in the person of Lisa Crossman. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1301.601s">And</a>  so I would like to warmly welcome Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1304.503s">Lisa</a>  comes to Medford with over 20 years of experience working with youth and community organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1311.369s">So</a>  we welcome her to our community as she will be interfacing with many, many of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1318.877s">I</a>  also would like to take this brief moment to just share with the committee that the Medford Public Schools will be working with the equity process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1330.3s">They</a>  will be conducting our preliminary equity audit in light of the pandemic and many of the concerns that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1341.402s">We</a>  are starting our equity audit in phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1346.164s">So</a>  phase one, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1348.917s">We</a>  will be working and looking at a lot of documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1353.54s">And</a>  so some of the things that will be taking place during phase one, which is this portion of the year between January and June of this school year, is the equity process. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1366.507s">They</a>  will be examining many of our documents and relevant data. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1371.009s">They</a>  will be looking at our policies and practices around school culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1378.419s">They</a>  will be... <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1382.01s">providing</a>  feedback and guidance to our race equity task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1387.953s">They</a>  will be offering our school committee members voluntary interviews, but they would like to have some one-on-one interviews with school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1397.819s">They</a>  would also like to begin conversations with students and families in the forms of potential focus groups and or surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1411.261s">And</a>  so this first phase of the work that they're going to be doing is going to help us begin to think about the systems and structures that we have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1422.327s">The</a>  founder is Cindy Weeks Bradley and the co-founder is Elizabeth Redley. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1429.331s">I</a>  would like to share a little bit of their, how could I say, what their mission statement <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1440.109s">and</a>  vision statement is for the work that they're going to be doing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1444.914s">So</a>  the equity process, their mission statement is through social and academic discourse, coaching, leadership, and the implementation of research and evidence-based practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1456.525s">Our</a>  mission is to create a symbiotic relationship between equity, anti-bias, and culturally inclusive practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1466.425s">They</a>  focus on incorporating systems and structures that allow school districts and other clients to foster positive relations and relationships with people of all races, cultures, ethnicities, ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations to create learning environments wherein all people feel valued <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1495.632s">and</a>  welcomed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1496.812s">So</a>  I am really excited about beginning this process with the equity process and I look forward to having them come and present more detailed information to the school committee so they will come at one of our upcoming meetings to just you know introduce themselves to you so you'll be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1519.13s">have</a>  a greater understanding of the work that they're gonna do with us during this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1525.252s">But</a>  I just wanted to officially present to you that we are working with the equity process and I look forward to getting them in front of you at either our next meeting or the meeting after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1537.775s">So</a>  in closing, what I would like to say from my- Oh, sorry.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1541.196s">Do</a>  you want me to wait to close? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1542.257s">I</a>  just had a question, Mayor, on that specific.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1548.228s">Dr.</a>  Edwin Vincent, how would you like to, would you like to finish and then member McLaughlin can ask a question?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1554.731s">Yes,</a>  yes, I would just finish and then I will take your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1558.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1560.093s">As</a>  we begin 2022, I would like to share a few lines from our poet, Amanda Gorman's New Days lyric that she wrote to celebrate the new year and honor the hurt and humanity of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1577.034s">She</a>  says, this hope is our door, our portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1581.776s">Even</a>  if we never get back to normal, someday we can venture beyond it to leave the known and take the first steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1591.341s">So</a>  let us not return to what was normal, but reach toward what is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1598.124s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1600.905s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1602.366s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1604.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1605.288s">Thank</a>  you for those inspiring words, Dr. Edwin-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1607.73s">It's</a>  always good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1611.292s">For</a>  the equity process, is that actually the name of the company? <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1614.535s">So</a>  if we want to Google it, it's equity process?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1617.176s">Yes,</a>  it is equity process.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1619.938s">Okay,</a>  and so I'm from what I heard you say there's going to there's an equity audit that's taking place in this will be phase one of how many did you say how many phases.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1629.324s">Due</a>  to the pandemic, I really felt like there, there is a portion where they will go into schools and also do you know more in depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1641.011s">review</a>  of what's happening in schools, but in light of the pandemic and in light of all of the testing, I asked to hold off on that portion of the equity audit until next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1653.68s">And</a>  so, this first preliminary phase will be them really looking at a lot of our documents, conducting interviews, <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1664.267s">working</a>  with central leadership and really limiting them going into every single building just in light of all that we're dealing with with the pandemic right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1677.073s">And</a>  so that's how they've been working. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1679.755s">And</a>  they just completed their process in Linfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1685.578s">So</a>  that is something that I could possibly just share with you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1690.911s">So</a>  phase one of two, then since we'll delay, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1695.572s">Depending</a>  on where we are with the pandemic, it could potentially be a three-year process for us to get all of the information and be able to start implementing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1707.935s">So</a>  as part of the document review, they will be spending time looking at documents, human resources, hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1718.277s">They'll</a>  be looking at a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1720.497s">other</a>  pieces that don't involve too much direct involvement with people in light of the pandemic and just trying to be extra safe right now.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1731.204s">That's</a>  great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1731.965s">I'm</a>  really excited to hear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1733.466s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1734.367s">And</a>  I know, I'm sure it was just an oversight in terms of the reading of the statement, but I know that said you were saying equity in terms of culture, gender, you know, you were listing a number of different items and I just didn't hear ability, but I'm sure that's part of it, right?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1750.937s">It</a>  definitely is part of the work that they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1754.298s">And</a>  when they present, you definitely can drill down and ask some targeted questions around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1760.879s">But</a>  they're not looking at it as just one lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/RhUNhYl62Oo&t=1764.94s">They're</a>  looking at it as a much wider scope of work.</p>
