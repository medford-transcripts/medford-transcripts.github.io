No, we got it now.

32
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:56,964

44
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,012
Yes.

45
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:48,093

47
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:49,954
Yes.

48
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:51,437

49
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,098

Mayor Longo Kern.

Motion of approval.

57
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,762
I remember Van de Kloet, second by- Second.

58
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,302
Member Kratz, roll call.

59
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:17,803
Member Graham.

60
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:18,583
Yes.

61
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,448
I'm a Kratz.

62
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:21,449
Yes.

63
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,109
I'm a McLaughlin.

64
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:23,369
Yes.

65
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:24,230
Member McStone.

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:24,950
Yes.

67
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,690
Member Rousseau.

68
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,011
Yes.

69
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,051
Member Van de Kloot.

70
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:30,612
Yes.

71
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:32,192
Mayor Longo Kern.

72
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:33,433
Yes.

73
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,593
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

74
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,415
Approval of payrolls has been approved.

75
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:46,317
We have report of secretary number one, good of the order offered by member McLaughlin.

76
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:49,079
Yes, thank you, Mayor.

77
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:58,744
The good of the order is a category under Robert's Rules of Orders that we had voted in earlier in the year, essentially at our first meeting of the month.

78
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:04,503
And I think on occasion, it's been dropped, but moving forward, I would ask that it is included on the first meeting of the month.

79
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:14,113
And generally, it is to check in with the school committee as a group, as a whole, to check in on the good of the order.

80
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,055
Essentially, how are things going?

81
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,557
Are things going well?

82
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,360
Are there things that folks feel we need work on?

83
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,622
you know, are the meeting scheduling's going fine?

84
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:35,824
Like, it's an opportunity for the committee to offer up anything they have, both positive or, you know, things that need to be worked on.

85
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:38,365
So that's the good of the order.

86
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:39,925
Mayor?

87
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:41,506
Member Russo?

88
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,266
Yes, thank you.

89
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:45,387
I appreciate the good of the order today.

90
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:50,648
I would just like to suggest that we all take a refresher course on Robert's Rules.

91
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:57,578
We typically allow members to speak for as long as they want to speak, which is actually a violation of Robert's rules.

92
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,640
We don't let everybody have turns.

93
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:11,168
Some members will ask six or seven questions in a row, leaving the other members who may have had questions to sit there silently and look like they had nothing to say, which looks bad for those of us that came with a set of questions.

94
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:20,955
So I think as a committee, we can do an awful lot better at acting like a committee instead of as individuals approaching an election.

95
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:24,345
Mayor.

96
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:25,665
Member Van de Kloot.

97
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:32,927
Yes, I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation.

98
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:39,509
Like a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member.

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,591
I think it might be more engaging for all of us.

100
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:52,473
The other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long.

101
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:57,329
We had something like 23 meetings in the in March.

102
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:08,240
I think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and.

103
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:17,523
of doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings.

104
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:34,926
And I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.

105
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,227
And I agree with you member Van de Kloot.

106
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:38,627
Member McLaughlin.

107
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:40,668
Thank you.

108
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:56,976
I think these are, you know, both through the chair, my colleagues I think these are both things that have been talked about, certainly, you know, individually or amongst less than a quorum with folks over time so I think these are both items that need to be addressed.

109
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:11,294
Training and Roberts rules of order is, you know, highly recommended it's a really important, it's what how we operate and how we run and, you know, I know when I came on as a new school committee member there was no orientation there was no indication of how to do things.

110
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,378
We had to seek out training and.

111
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,639
I know MASC has an event.

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:32,112
I don't know how many folks have gone and you know I went to it that one time pre pandemic and learn some things certainly there but I think a course in Roberts Rules of Order is definitely in order and I would also say we've talked about the length of our meetings in the past and there has been some conversation about

113
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:39,901
you know, more frequently meetings for less time and folks sort of tend to say that they think that that would just mean more frequent meetings that are longer.

114
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,522
So they don't necessarily wanna do that either.

115
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:54,129
I don't know what the answer is there, but I think that clearly when we have to go two, sometimes three weeks in between talking to each other, it makes it very difficult because the items on the agenda get longer and longer, understandably.

116
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:55,410
Thank you.

117
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,851
Thank you.

118
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,772
I know we have our student rep

119
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,772
Mr. Colin Bailey on the call.

120
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,773
If you have anything to add, please jump in.

121
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:05,273
Yes, I'm sorry.

122
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,034
I forgot, Mayor.

123
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:13,376
Our new rules have asked that we include the student rep in attendance, and I did have it.

124
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:25,339
I actually reached out to Colin Bailey to ensure that he was coming today, and then I get caught up in the roll call, and I apologize that there's the student rep here, so I will add him to the attendance roll.

125
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:25,699
Thank you.

126
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:27,283
you.

127
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:27,503
Thank you.

128
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:27,863
Thank you, member.

129
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,625
Chris Oh, yes.

130
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:32,106
Um I just wanted to say that, um.

131
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:36,109
And sometimes I haven't been able to speak at some of the meetings because.

132
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:46,815
Some other committee members have gone on to their questions, and I'm looking at the clock and I'm looking at the number of residents that want to speak, and I just you know, I just passed on my question.

133
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,618
Um so I you know, it would be helpful if we all you

134
00:09:56,101 --> 00:10:02,306
Then before they got to ask their second question, it could go through maybe with some of the other members if they had a question.

135
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:09,932
In the past, I have expressed that I'm not in favor of more frequent meetings.

136
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:15,777
I know that it sounds like it would be helpful, but I found that

137
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:29,205
some of the details in the meetings that we have, they're very comprehensive and meeting every week and doing the minutes and posting the meetings, it's going to ultimately take the same amount of time.

138
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:34,268
And the administration is just gonna be getting ready for meetings every single week.

139
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:41,312
So I'm not in favor of meeting more frequently and adding on more frequent, shorter meetings.

140
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:42,853
I just wanted to say that.

141
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:50,574
Mayor.

142
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:55,356
I think the mayor's not here now.

143
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,477
Maybe she got booted out by mistake.

144
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,499
Will we go with the vice chair in the meantime?

145
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:13,582
I will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.

146
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:14,723
Thank you.

147
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:18,219
through the chair, I would also agree.

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,842
You know, I don't want more frequent longer meetings.

149
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:35,257
I just want to clarify that I am looking for, you know, I'm hoping that as part of the good of the order, perhaps we can come up with some suggestions of how to how to, you know, make the meetings less than six, eight hours, especially as we're coming into budget season.

150
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:36,278
Thanks.

151
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:48,394
So I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works.

152
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:56,459
Maybe a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question.

153
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,403
So do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that?

154
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:04,925
Great, okay.

155
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,638
Can we move on to the next order of business?

156
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:17,242
And I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is?

157
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:18,482
Because I don't have it out.

158
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:22,605
We can't hear you.

159
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,128
Who's got the agenda right in front of them?

160
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:26,748
Thank you.

161
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:27,909
I have it in front of me.

162
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:28,289
Oh, great.

163
00:12:28,469 --> 00:12:29,630
Well, McLaughlin raised her hand.

164
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,131
Yeah, I just was gonna say that I had the agenda in front of me as well.

165
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:48,095
So the report of committees, behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting, which is myself for the report and bear with me one second, because I was going between tabs, it's gonna take a second.

166
00:12:52,307 --> 00:13:00,391
while you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions.

167
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:06,853
Perhaps a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question.

168
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:11,095
And we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works.

169
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:13,516
Sounds great.

170
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:16,817
And Melanie is going to give her report.

171
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:19,811
Yes, number five.

172
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:20,394
Sounds great.

173
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:20,635
Thanks.

174
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:21,882
Sorry, I lost internet connection.

175
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,159
Okay, thank you.

176
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:30,902
The Behavioral Health and Special Education Subcommittee met on April 15th.

177
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:34,364
That meeting was for, there were several members present.

178
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:41,589
My subcommittee members are Member Rousseau and Member Mustone.

179
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,691
Member Van de Kloet was also present in place of Member Mustone.

180
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:52,035
The Director of Pupil Services, Joan Bowen, and Director of Guidance, Stacey Schulman, attend these meetings regularly.

181
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:56,937
as does CPAC and several parents and other administrators.

182
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:11,664
We have scheduled a presentation to the school committee for May 24th, where we will put forward what we hope we come to terms with a recommendation at our next meeting.

183
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:20,892
for proposed policy in our next meeting is, sorry, it's the meeting right before our May 24th meeting.

184
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,393
So I don't have the calendar in front of me right now.

185
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,653
I thought it was at the end of these minutes.

186
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,595
It usually is, but I can get back to that.

187
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,677
And so we have been talking about building friendships and community and schools.

188
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:34,899
And so we've had a lot of meetings over the course of the year where

189
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:40,023
Members have come to the committee with various ideas and resources, and we've been talking about those.

190
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:49,109
And one of the things that we're talking about is the common ground program that currently exists at the high school, and potentially using that as a model of building friendships.

191
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,511
They use a reverse inclusion model right now.

192
00:14:52,172 --> 00:15:03,140
And so we would look to this next year at sort of showing what's happening right now, because it's not actually a course, but potentially creating a syllabus, but having the teachers, obviously, Mr. Skorka and Ms.

193
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,580
Andre,

194
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:09,446
potentially create a syllabus for an actual course that will work around building friendships and community.

195
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:16,835
And we're still going to be pursuing the best buddies and a number of things now that hopefully will, you know, be

196
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:25,236
getting better through the pandemic and being spending more time, being able to spend more time within the school and in the community to build those friendships, which are so important.

197
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:30,539
And then we also had the latter half of the meeting is behavioral health.

198
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:36,922
And again, we will be presenting as part of our May 24 presentation on policy recommendations for behavioral health.

199
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:47,399
So we were talking about the Sandy Hook promise, which currently exists in schools and requirements by DESE for mental health training in our schools and behavioral health supports.

200
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,445
So we are looking forward to presenting to the school committee on the 24th, our recommendations.

201
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,146
Any questions or comments?

202
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,048
Can I get a motion to?

203
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,609
Thank you.

204
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:11,803
Okay, roll call.

205
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,024
Member Graham?

206
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:14,964
Yes.

207
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,085
Member Kretz?

208
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:17,905
Yes.

209
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:19,766
Member McLaughlin?

210
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:20,166
Yes.

211
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:21,607
Member McStone?

212
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:22,247
Yes.

213
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:23,828
Member Russo?

214
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:26,048
Yes.

215
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:27,429
Member Van de Kloot?

216
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:28,009
Yes.

217
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:29,450
Mayor Long-Kern?

218
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,290
Yes.

219
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,951
So the affirmative zero and the negative minutes are approved.

220
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:35,856
Number six, community participation.

221
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:45,161
Any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at a school committee meeting regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.

222
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:54,246
A community participation portion of the agenda is established, which will give any citizen the privilege of placing an item before the school committee or be heard on any item.

223
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:55,607
Any item to be present

224
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:07,042
presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools by the Wednesday prior to the scheduled meeting at noon with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.

225
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:15,563
Public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

226
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:21,367
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Redford Street address, your question or comment.

227
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:28,393
We have parent Maureen Ronane topic to speak for up to five minutes on dyslexia.

228
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:40,228
Does anybody see Ms.

229
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:40,688
Ronayna?

230
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:41,488
And I do not.

231
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,590
Do we have any other emails and public participation?

232
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:53,711
We do.

233
00:17:54,731 --> 00:18:02,312
I have one email submitted by William Giglio from Winthrop Street.

234
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,413
This is to your school committee members.

235
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,653
This is a short but two-part email request.

236
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:22,346
One, with all due respect and after talking with many other Medford families who tune in to watch Medford Public School Committee meetings, we kindly ask that any and all subjects that do not pertain directly to Medford Public Schools, please be refrained from being discussed during the time of the meeting.

237
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:28,267
We as parents tune in each meeting to keep up and stay in touch with what is going on within our school system.

238
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:34,709
And we do not need updates on news stories that are going on within our nation that do not directly affect this school system.

239
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:47,124
Example, at the last meeting, the news of a 20-year-old man in Minneapolis who was shot by police when trying to flee while being arrested was discussed when this had nothing at all to do with the Medford public schools.

240
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:53,105
There are many other city community meetings and other outlets that have the time and place for these types of discussions.

241
00:18:53,666 --> 00:19:04,488
Two, I also kindly request that at the beginning of each Medford school committee meeting, when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, that a flag be present behind or in view of at least one committee member during the time

242
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,263
that meetings are conducted on Zoom and not in city hall chambers where flag is present.

243
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:11,145
Thank you.

244
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:15,328
Thank you, member Van de Kloet.

245
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,551
We're going to move on because I don't see Ms.

246
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,792
Ronain on the call.

247
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:27,918
Number seven, report of superintendent.

248
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:31,461
Dr. Edward Vincent.

249
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:42,592
Good evening, everyone.

250
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,854
I hope everyone had a relaxing April break.

251
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:53,697
During vacation week, both Administrative Professionals Day and IRF Day were celebrated.

252
00:19:54,398 --> 00:20:01,681
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our administrative staff for all their dedicated service to the Medford Public Schools.

253
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:11,139
As I said in my communication last Thursday, often the administrative staff is the first face of the district welcoming families to our schools.

254
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,382
They are instrumental in helping to keep our district running smoothly.

255
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:21,725
We appreciate you and thank you for keeping all of us better connected to our Mustang community.

256
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:34,915
To celebrate Earth Day, I would like to extend my thanks to Aggie Tudin, Medford's tree warden, who will oversee the planting of some trees along Steve Miller Way.

257
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:44,563
Additionally, I would like to thank CCSR students, Babin Gill, Eleanor Nicarra, Naomi Pierre, and Oprah Nicarra.

258
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:55,813
who volunteered this past week to transfer both strawberry seedlings and cabbage seedlings into unused flower beds in the Medford High School garden.

259
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,554
Special thanks to Ms.

260
00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:00,978
Retter-Smith for her guidance and support during this process.

261
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:15,460
I want to thank all who actively participated in the Columbus School renaming process, either by submitting a new name for consideration or by submitting an application to serve on the renaming committee.

262
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:23,547
It is my hope that this process will help to bring the community together as we move forward in deciding a new name for the school.

263
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:28,652
National Honor Society Induction Ceremony.

264
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:37,388
Our National Honor Society Induction Ceremony will take place this Thursday, April 29th at 7 p.m.

265
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:40,050
via Zoom for our juniors only.

266
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:47,914
I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize all our 37 students who have been invited to join this group.

267
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:56,159
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, you are able to persevere academically, and Thursday is our day to honor you.

268
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,245
An in-person ceremony for seniors only will take place on Tuesday, May 4th at 7 p.m.

269
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:05,966
in the gym.

270
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:13,652
This is an invitation only event and we are following all Board of Health COVID safety guidelines.

271
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:18,216
I congratulate our 49 seniors who are part of this cohort.

272
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:22,336
I'd like to extend a special thank you to Ms.

273
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:30,842
DiPrizio, our National Honor Society advisor for supporting and encouraging our National Honor Society students.

274
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:47,555
I'd like to share that 35 local organizations in Tufts host communities in Massachusetts have been awarded $35,000 in grants from the Tufts Community Grants Program.

275
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:53,826
The annual grants are funded by donations from Tufts University faculty and staff.

276
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:58,210
Two of our school-based groups were recipients of these grants.

277
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,695
Our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

278
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:21,612
for Medford's Food Drive to help supply bagged groceries and necessities to Medford Public Schools families, and the Strong Girls United Foundation, a student athlete mentor program at the Brooks School, which includes training materials and team shirts.

279
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:28,073
The Medford Public Schools are grateful to Tufts University for their continued support.

280
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:46,873
For everyone's information, Tufts University announced that it has acquired doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and is setting up a vaccination clinic for their students, faculty and staff in the Gantcher Center this week.

281
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,996
Doses will be administered on April 28th through April 30th.

282
00:23:54,027 --> 00:24:11,091
In addition, the announcement by the University Infection Control Health Director, Michael Jordan, he also said that all students, all Tufts University students will need to be vaccinated before participating in on-campus classes or activities for next school year.

283
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:21,274
I would also like to take this moment to thank Stop and Shop for their gracious donations of food bags to the Medford Family Network.

284
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:30,773
At least twice a month, Stop and Shop delivers these bags to Medford Family Network, who distributes them to our families in need.

285
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:45,193
Speaking of the Medford Family Network, this Thursday, April 29th, they will be presenting the 10th Annual Parent Cafe virtually from 7.30 to 9.30 p.m.

286
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:51,655
This important discussion will revolve around stressing resilience in times of stress.

287
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:55,516
They are hoping for at least nine more parents to register.

288
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:59,517
Those interested should contact Marie Cassidy at 781-393-8255.

289
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:16,346
As you are aware, last Monday, all Massachusetts residents over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

290
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:28,113
Our Medford Public School nurses are encouraging parents to vaccinate their children for COVID-19 as an important measure toward reducing the spread of the virus.

291
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:43,344
Parents are encouraged to pre-register their child or children for a vaccine appointment at one of Massachusetts mass vaccination sites at vaccinesignup.mass.gov.

292
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:52,567
I'd like to say that all of our fifth grade students should now know which middle school they will be attending in September.

293
00:25:53,702 --> 00:26:04,508
Please note that orientations will be held for students and their parents or caregivers at the McGlynn Middle School on Wednesday, May 12th from six to 8 p.m.

294
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:11,211
and at the Andrews Middle School on Thursday, May 13th from six to 8 p.m.

295
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,012
More details to follow.

296
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:21,517
I'd also like to announce that Medford Public Schools has temporarily suspended the use of Google Hangouts.

297
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:42,185
Due to some misinformation or cyberbullying and inappropriate exchange of information taking place on Google Hangouts, we have temporarily suspended the use of that platform until we are able to put in additional measures.

298
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:52,467
So the temporary suspension of Google Hangouts is still in place while we are looking for additional security measures.

299
00:26:55,433 --> 00:27:01,537
Lastly, I feel I would be remiss if I did not mention the decision in the Derek Chauvin case.

300
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:11,003
The jury returned guilty verdicts in the murder of George Floyd, which raises hope that our nation is changing for the better.

301
00:27:12,484 --> 00:27:23,912
According to a poll conducted by UMass Amherst, it is notable that a solid majority of whites, 56%, supported the verdict.

302
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:47,097
In a nation with such a troubled racial history and present, it is extremely rare and perhaps unprecedented that a majority of whites support the conviction of a police officer for the murder of a Black man, said political science professor Jesse Rhodes, who helped conduct the poll.

303
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:51,798
An Earth Day quote seems applicable here.

304
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:55,733
We all share the same mother.

305
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,415
It is about time we treat each other like family.

306
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:07,080
I have said continuously that we are one Medford, one district, the Mustang family.

307
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,122
Yet too often in our world, black and brown lives are devalued.

308
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:18,326
We must all understand that no matter the color of one's skin, we are all human.

309
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:27,883
As our Vice President Kamala Harris stated after the verdict was read, today we feel a sigh of relief.

310
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:31,565
Still, it cannot take away the pain.

311
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:36,568
A measure of justice is not the same as equal justice.

312
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:42,932
As your superintendent, as an educator, and most importantly as a mother,

313
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:48,694
I have said that change is hard and can be messy, but it is necessary.

314
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:59,142
Conversations about race and injustice are complicated, but must be had, so the quality of life is improved for us all.

315
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:06,767
As Tyler Perry said last night at the Oscars, let us reject hate.

316
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:07,928
Thank you.

317
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,197
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

318
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:25,901
Number two, we have COVID-19 Public Health Update and Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Testing Summary and Update by Nurse Supervisor Ms.

319
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,361
Toni Rae, Ms.

320
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,662
Marian O'Connor, Board of Health Director, and Mr. David Murphy.

321
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:34,263
Good evening, everyone.

322
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:39,685
I will provide the data tonight for the City of Medford and the Medford Public Schools.

323
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:51,990
The City of Medford, the city is averaging 22.9 positive cases per day as reported on April 22nd, giving us a 1.19% positivity rate.

324
00:29:52,970 --> 00:30:00,513
As reported by the Medford Board of Health, 25 children less than 19 years old tested positive for COVID-19

325
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:03,994
between April 18th and April 25th.

326
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:23,543
In the Medford Public Schools, school nurses administered 4,684 COVID tests during the week preceding school vacation, three of which were positive, a 0.06% positivity rate.

327
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:27,565
We did not administer any tests during school vacation week.

328
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:35,940
Testing resumed today in all schools with 227 pool tests submitted for analysis.

329
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:45,628
I'd like to remind staff who received their COVID vaccinations that it is recommended that they continue weekly COVID testing.

330
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:49,711
Vaccination prevents serious illness and hospitalization.

331
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:57,478
Vaccinated persons can still get the virus and spread it to others despite not having symptoms themselves.

332
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:07,147
I would also like to share a message from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, who sums up the current COVID situation well.

333
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:11,569
She says, we remain in a complicated stage.

334
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:18,051
On one hand, more people in the United States are being vaccinated every single day at an accelerated pace.

335
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:29,736
On the other hand, cases and hospitalizations are increasing in some areas of the country, and cases among young people who have not yet been vaccinated are also increasing.

336
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:46,382
Therefore, I thank all of the parents and the Medford Public School staff who proactively informed the school nurses of their vacation travel plans, provided COVID test results prior to returning to school, and followed the travel advisories.

337
00:31:47,668 --> 00:32:10,877
The good health of our school community depends upon the efforts of all students, families, and staff to follow recommended Department of Public Health COVID guidelines and advisories, including wearing a face mask, avoiding large gatherings, maintaining social distancing, and most importantly, staying home if you feel ill or if a member of your family tests positive for COVID.

338
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:11,757
Thank you.

339
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:14,818
Member McLaughlin.

340
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:16,730
Thank you.

341
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:28,962
I also wanted to ask, I know we had the opportunity to speak last week to the chair, Nurse Ray, and I know that it had been mentioned that it'd be helpful to share if we have vaccine information.

342
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:34,887
Do you want us, is there anything that you're asking for students to do that or not do that?

343
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:35,748
Like, I'm curious.

344
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:42,930
So we are recommending that students over the age of 16 be vaccinated as per the current guidelines.

345
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:48,372
Parents can sign their children up at the MassVax sites.

346
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:53,274
I believe that website was put up on the chat earlier.

347
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:58,595
And we encourage all parents to vaccinate their children over 16.

348
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,276
Okay, and I guess, may I, Mayor?

349
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:03,157
I had a follow-up.

350
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:11,464
So I guess the question is, shall we send vaccine records to you or to the nursing office if they would like them?

351
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:12,864
Yes, please.

352
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:18,408
We would like to keep track of students who have received their COVID vaccines.

353
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:21,690
Thank you.

354
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:22,851
Thank you, Ms.

355
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:23,051
Ray.

356
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:30,496
Number three, we have an update on the fiscal year 22 budget presentation.

357
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:31,677
Mr. David Murphy.

358
00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:33,318
Thank you, Mayor.

359
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:39,195
I'm going to share a very brief deck, some of the material you've seen before.

360
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,635
And that's not to be repetitive.

361
00:33:41,715 --> 00:34:01,939
But as I said in previous budget presentations, because we know that this is a topic of significant interest to the community, we want to be sure that we're being mindful of that and various folks picking up the conversation at various stages throughout the course of the budget development process.

362
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:12,844
We want to be sure that we're keeping everyone as informed as possible, being as transparent as possible, and answering as many questions as clearly as we can.

363
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:17,808
There is some new information in this, or at least some updates.

364
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:22,691
And so at the conclusion, I'll be happy to take any questions that you might have.

365
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:29,396
One of the pieces that we've discussed over the course of the last several months, and I know it's been of interest to some members of the committee,

366
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,639
making sure that we're keeping track of the sequence that we're following.

367
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,703
And so this is a simplified version of the flowchart that you saw at a previous budget update in February.

368
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:44,305
We're in basically the top right corner in this timeline right now.

369
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:53,491
We've completed, as stated in a slide or two, about 25 budget internal meetings with our various departments

370
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,383
and are moving toward the public meetings that will take place with the committee of the whole over the course of the next several weeks.

371
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:12,288
This is a modified version of a table I've shown you in the past related to the sources of funding and the budget development process with the Commonwealth, the city of Medford and the school district.

372
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:21,893
I've added this fourth column to the right as I think most people, certainly the committee knows and members of the community are familiar with the,

373
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:28,533
sizable amount of federal funding that will be flowing into cities and towns as well as school districts.

374
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:34,077
And so we'll be touching upon that a little bit tonight and the implications for that funding.

375
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,200
This is an updated timeline.

376
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,342
I wrote to the committee on Friday.

377
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:46,267
We had initially planned to begin some of the public committees of the whole meetings this week.

378
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,430
And a few things became clear over the course of the last two weeks or so.

379
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,510
One,

380
00:35:51,765 --> 00:35:59,271
There's still a significant degree of uncertainty with regard to restrictions around the additional funding that will be coming in.

381
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:09,939
And the degree to which that has the potential to be intermingled with our operating budget, there's a need for greater clarity.

382
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:19,026
And I know because I fielded several questions from members of the committee about how that funding will be used and the sort of,

383
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:29,729
the concept of essentially bifurcating the operating budget from the COVID mitigation budget coming directly from the federal government.

384
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:37,593
And we'll talk a little bit about that tonight and what the strategic questions that will be coming before the city and the school committee.

385
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:38,934
But this is an updated timeline.

386
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:43,056
We did add one meeting at the end of this process.

387
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:48,078
We've tried to keep the dates consistent and we'll be sending calendar invites out

388
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:51,716
members of the committee to make sure that that's built into your calendar.

389
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:54,777
But we're thinking right now of a 7 p.m.

390
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:59,798
start time to accommodate some of the subcommittee meetings that are scheduled on those days as well earlier in the evening.

391
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:16,543
And then again, the May 19th date was added because we thought it would be a good idea to have sort of a catch all day in case we run out of time to the priority discussed earlier tonight about trying to keep the meetings more manageable.

392
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:17,823
And so we have that

393
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:35,591
as sort of a placeholder where we'll be able to pick up additional departments that need additional time to present or also for further discussion once the multi-dimensional budget has been presented and hopefully gives the committee the full context to discuss.

394
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:46,716
This statement with regard to recognizing the one-time influx of funding, that's something that we've discussed before and something that will be sort of a common thread

395
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:53,230
as we get into the strategic considerations related to operating budget versus COVID mitigation funding.

396
00:37:55,331 --> 00:38:04,995
And so as we get ready to open FY22, we've tried to keep you as informed as possible with regard to the close of FY21.

397
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:10,358
This is not a major change since I presented to you in mid-March.

398
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:19,093
We're comfortable with regard to our financial position as we move toward the end of FY21.

399
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:29,818
I've said before that given the size of the budget, the sort of best practice target area is to finish somewhere between $100,000 and $300,000.

400
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,880
We're a little above that right now.

401
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
There are reasons for that.

402
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:41,965
It has to do with some of the substantial deficits in the revolving funds that are contingent upon revenue generation, which has been

403
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,689
significantly diminished this year.

404
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:58,593
There's also been a few other variables, some COVID related, some sort of typical uncertainties as you go through the course of the fiscal year that have in some cases turned out favorably for us.

405
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:04,395
And so that's what puts us at about a $500,000 cushion for lack of a better term.

406
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:08,477
That is not to say we're able to release the current

407
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:20,406
partial spending freeze, we're not in a position to do that because there are a few variables and potential emergency funding issues that we have to, we're keeping a close eye on infrastructure and otherwise.

408
00:39:20,446 --> 00:39:24,588
And so essentially we're in a good position, but not overly favorable.

409
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:32,872
And, and the main reason for that is again, the food services deficit in particular, which on paper is $730,000.

410
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:34,553
I'm comfortable.

411
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:37,835
I'm confident that that's going to diminish over the next

412
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:50,398
weeks and potentially a month or so as some unencumbered funds are released and as additional revenue is generated as a result of additional students being in school.

413
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:54,040
We do still have two internal meetings left this week.

414
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,784
I expect that those will wrap up by Wednesday or Thursday and we'll be in a good position to begin the public discussions next week.

415
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:06,008
In terms of planning for FY22, we're going to talk about this in a second, but

416
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:10,647
There are two major sources coming directly to the school district, ESSER 2 and ESSER 3.

417
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:25,079
The ESSER 2 number, that's the 2.3 million that we've discussed previously in the federal legislation that passed at the end of calendar year 2020, and the ESSER 3, which is the subsequent federal legislation that passed last month.

418
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,385
So as we get into the spending priorities, all department heads and principals

419
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,518
with the exception of that last group that I mentioned a minute ago that will be convening this week.

420
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:53,684
But all principals and all other department heads have been asked to focus on three specific areas with regard to budgetary priorities and how we as an organization can seek to remedy the learning and opportunity gaps that were either caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

421
00:40:54,545 --> 00:41:00,947
And certainly there are priorities that are broader and expand beyond the particular challenges that have been caused by the pandemic.

422
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:20,102
Generally speaking, we think of them in these three buckets as materials and infrastructure, personnel, and training and professional development, and all within the context of the significant challenges that students are experiencing as a result of the conditions under which they've gone to school over the course of the past year plus.

423
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,044
You've seen this before as well.

424
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:28,148
Again, these are just the buckets, the priority areas that we started the budget process with.

425
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:30,009
They've been guiding our conversations and they will

426
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:33,679
play a large role in the information that's presented to you in the coming weeks.

427
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:42,365
And then these are the three categories, and this is the information that to some extent is new tonight.

428
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:48,870
And these are approximations, and they are a result of the conversations that we've been having internally.

429
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:57,816
You can see there's a significant amount of variability, and I'm happy to go into more detail than is articulated here on the screen as to why there is that variability.

430
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:59,757
But essentially, there are a number of

431
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:04,066
unanswered questions at this point as we look toward FY22.

432
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,048
There are some things we know and that we feel very confident about.

433
00:42:07,408 --> 00:42:17,131
The first one being in what I'll call bracket one on the far left, we're looking at approximately two or $2.1 million in fixed cost increases.

434
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:20,273
And those are made up of three subcategories.

435
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:22,773
First, the contractually owed compensation.

436
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,575
Those are steps and lanes that are part of existing collective bargaining agreements.

437
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:39,514
There are compliance obligations and things that we recognize that we will have to invest in in order to both adhere to best practices and fulfill all of our various obligations to students and families.

438
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:50,278
And there are some emergency infrastructure maintenance technology related expenses that we know we won't be able to defer past fiscal year 22.

439
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:52,658
So that's what makes up the bulk of that $2.1 million that our

440
00:42:55,364 --> 00:43:09,349
Even if we do nothing different, if we have no strategic priorities, if we make no investments, and if we provide no compensation increases other than those that are contractually obligated to provide, we're looking at about $2 million in increased costs.

441
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:24,455
This second category, again, there's a range because there are some strategic decisions that have to be made, and there is some overlap between how we can potentially fund some of these priorities

442
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,388
And there's a domino effect.

443
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:30,249
So if we make one strategic decision, there's potential savings that are realized.

444
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:38,313
And so it's impossible at this point to put an exact number on what our instructional operational necessities will be.

445
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:46,596
But at this point throughout the development process and after close to 25 meetings in which we've discussed all these issues, we can narrow it to a range of $500,000 to 1.75 million.

446
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:47,597
What that essentially means is that

447
00:43:51,470 --> 00:44:05,854
If the increase is less than $500,000, there are difficult decisions that have to be made and savings and efficiencies that have to be recognized over and above our sort of normal fiscal stewardship responsibilities to identify those efficiencies on a yearly basis.

448
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:16,837
And if we're north of $2 million, again, with no compensation increases beyond those that are contractually owed, then we're in a particularly healthy position.

449
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,601
we want to make sure that we're making the most strategic use of all resources.

450
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:27,623
In the third category, again, a lot of variability because there are things that are uncertain.

451
00:44:28,443 --> 00:44:34,865
We have to make some strategic decisions about, from a maintenance and technology perspective, what's the timeline in which we'll adhere to.

452
00:44:35,745 --> 00:44:37,545
So that's one piece of it.

453
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:43,247
There's also close to 10 collective bargaining agreements that are expiring this year.

454
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,288
And so there are no contractually owed increases, but we're

455
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:53,365
beginning to, we'll be entering into those discussions with our bargaining partners in the coming weeks and months.

456
00:44:53,846 --> 00:44:58,950
And so we need to understand that there's the potential costs as we go into those discussions as well.

457
00:44:59,771 --> 00:45:13,041
And then obviously the uncertainty related to the federal funding, which we'll discuss on this next slide, which is that neither the district nor the city have received the guidance that we need to with regard to restrictions around the SO3 funding.

458
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,103
And so we know that

459
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:24,150
There are a series of COVID mitigation related expenses that the district is likely to incur, or not likely, it certainly has and will continue to incur.

460
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,211
And we're grateful to have that funding available to us.

461
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:35,852
But it's also the case that we have operating expenses that are going to escalate to some degree as explained in that previous slide.

462
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:45,294
And so you've seen on the left the information before about how the 4.3 million has been broken down through our partnership with the city and through the funding that's been made available.

463
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,465
both from the federal government and from the state.

464
00:45:48,266 --> 00:46:00,229
And what we're looking at here with regard to ESSA 2 and ESSA 3, it's $7.6 million, which is a healthy amount and something that we'll make sure that we make good use of in terms of those investments.

465
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:03,429
It's also an amount that has to be spread out over a period of time.

466
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:12,812
And so while it's always possible that there'll be additional funding sources that will be realized, our planning really has to encompass the next two to three fiscal years.

467
00:46:13,372 --> 00:46:13,992
And so hopefully,

468
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:19,515
the economy improves, revenue improves, and so we're in a more favorable position in the coming years.

469
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:31,159
But as of right now, we are not in a position to look at this as $7.6 million solely for fiscal year 22, which is just another piece of the equation that we have to take into account.

470
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:42,382
And those bullet points you'll see on the right, those are what you're likely to see as we begin to present on those priorities and begin to have those discussions with the school committee and to inform the community.

471
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:55,348
And so just a final takeaways here, with regard to input 21, again, we're projecting a modest surplus, more or less in line with where we hope to finish the fiscal year.

472
00:46:55,948 --> 00:47:05,794
We do have a food services deficit that at least for the moment is requiring us to maintain our current spending and hiring freeze, partial spending hiring freeze.

473
00:47:05,814 --> 00:47:11,097
We are approving emergency expenses that have a certain urgency with regard to this fiscal year.

474
00:47:12,448 --> 00:47:18,750
The range with regard to the projected increase, I'm going to estimate right now is 3.4 to 5.8.

475
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:21,171
I understand that that's a wide window.

476
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:34,796
But again, there are a number of variables ranging from collective bargaining to the federal stimulus to potential other efficiencies that we're able to recognize and enforce internally.

477
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:40,739
And so that is what that delta represents and what it's attributable to.

478
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:44,304
There will be COVID related expenses, we know that.

479
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:54,354
And we also know that there's uncertainty that the city of Medford is facing and that all cities and towns across the Commonwealth are facing.

480
00:47:54,394 --> 00:48:04,103
And so as a result of that, we are continuing to explore all possible savings and efficiencies to make sure that we're able to bridge whatever gap we responsibly can.

481
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:05,985
We do not have a

482
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:07,369
5.8 million.

483
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,612
And frankly, we don't have a $3.4 million savings that is available to us internally.

484
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:13,573
We know that.

485
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:18,315
And we want to be honest and transparent about that.

486
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:36,225
But at the same time, as any $62.3 million taxpayer-funded enterprise does, we have a responsibility to continue to look internally to make sure that we are being good fiscal stewards and recognizing and realizing efficiencies wherever we are able to find them.

487
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,031
So I recognize that's a lot of information.

488
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:43,013
I'm happy to share this information with you after the meeting.

489
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:55,179
These numbers are relatively fluid, but the wide range between 3.4 and 5.8 is intended to create space for us to move within that range.

490
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:03,343
So I don't anticipate you'll be hearing recommendations that would exceed 5.8, and I don't anticipate any recommendations that would

491
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,253
would be less than 3.4 going into FY 22.

492
00:49:08,453 --> 00:49:15,357
And again, I'm happy to get into more details about any or all this information.

493
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:16,098
Thank you.

494
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:21,341
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

495
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:22,462
Member McLaughlin?

496
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:24,945
Thank you.

497
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:33,032
And I just wanted to add for members of the community, obviously the committee of the whole budget meetings are the place where a lot of this nitty gritty detail comes out.

498
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:39,178
And I wanted to ask, I know with the pandemic last year, it was difficult to get binders around this stuff.

499
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:49,006
And I don't know about my colleagues, but for me, I work much better with the tactile budget binders with the ability to move back and forth during the meetings, what have you.

500
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:52,189
So will we be getting those this session?

501
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:58,273
I don't have any reason to think you wouldn't be receiving bindings if that's the committee's preference.

502
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:00,394
Thank you.

503
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:00,974
That'd be great.

504
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:09,877
Member Russo?

505
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:11,997
Thank you.

506
00:50:12,478 --> 00:50:13,878
We also passed the motion last

507
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:29,034
June, July, August, it all runs together to get updated binders, because I mean, we do literally, I mean, I know most of us probably keep these right at the ready, but this is the binder we use to approve the budget that is absolutely not correct.

508
00:50:30,555 --> 00:50:34,837
So, you know, you put 62.3 million on that slide.

509
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,819
This does not say 62.3 million, neither does the city budget.

510
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:40,180
I go to the city's website.

511
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:40,900
So,

512
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:55,124
I'm not saying 62.3 is not correct, because I know that that is money that came in out of the normal process, but the documents that the public will look at 20 years from now, I looked at 20 years of our city budgets.

513
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:57,546
They can't be lies, they can't be fictions.

514
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:10,216
We need a budget document that actually reflects what the budget was, or a very rational person looking at the actual documents we approved will say in perpetuity that our budget last year was 61.3.

515
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,381
And I don't want us to be in that position.

516
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,322
I need to know what the budget was.

517
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,725
And I feel like I still don't even know because there's this other number that we never approved.

518
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:26,907
And I think we're the only ones who statutorily are allowed to approve a budget.

519
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:40,536
Well, the first thing I'll say just because the word lies was used is that I really can't say strongly enough that there's no intention to provide any lies to the school community or the community with regard to this budget.

520
00:51:41,797 --> 00:51:48,582
The second thing I will say is that this school district budget, like all school district budget, is comprised of multiple funding sources.

521
00:51:49,083 --> 00:52:01,433
The 62.3 is, as was discussed in these slides and previous ones, the operating budget comprised of the Chapter 70 allocation and the local contribution from the municipal government.

522
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:09,119
There are external funds, as there are every year, Title I, Perkins grants, 242 grants, and special ed

523
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:16,348
a variety of other sources that come in that in this district amount to in the range of $2 million or so.

524
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:26,631
That also does not include the 4.3 to 4.6 that was represented here with regard to the COVID relief funding.

525
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:33,592
And so everyone will have a binder and it will spell out in as much detail as possible.

526
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:38,313
I wasn't here, so I can't speak to where those inaccuracies

527
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:39,958
what they might be attributable to.

528
00:52:39,978 --> 00:53:03,475
I will say that my team and I have spent a significant amount of time and I imagine we'll be spending a considerable amount of more time in the coming weeks and months attempting to align the budget lines with the appropriate budget categories.

529
00:53:04,256 --> 00:53:06,678
And there are four budget

530
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:10,456
$63 million and eight or 900 employees.

531
00:53:12,597 --> 00:53:28,622
It does seem to be that historically there have been a number of budget charges, meaning people's salary being charged to the wrong lines, which I think creates confusion and a lack of transparency.

532
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:34,324
I have no, I've seen no evidence of any intent on anyone's part.

533
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,205
I think there are probably,

534
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:43,387
So usually the way that happens is that there's a year where there's an account that's short.

535
00:53:43,527 --> 00:53:49,471
And so someone's salary is charged to a different account, sometimes off the operating budget into revolving funds.

536
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:56,975
And then the next year somebody else's is, and then it just sort of compounds itself and nobody goes through and actually cleans it up.

537
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,717
We've spent a good amount of time this year attempting to clean that up.

538
00:54:01,278 --> 00:54:05,480
And so when you look at the binder that's being discussed and it has the columns for

539
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:35,042
FY21 versus FY20 versus FY22, you'll see some variability that doesn't necessarily represent any type of strategic decision on the part of the district, as much as it represents an attempt to put people in the appropriate groupings so that it can be clearer to the public, both contemporaneously and historically, where the personnel was sitting, what they were doing,

540
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:42,134
And I think it's just, it's a necessary correction that has to be made for purposes of transparency.

541
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:46,778
But the committee should know there is a significant amount of that.

542
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,961
And I can't frankly say with certainty that we're gonna catch every single one.

543
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:58,866
I can tell you that we've caught a number of them and I think it will be more accurate and I think it will be more transparent.

544
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:00,780
But it's $63 million.

545
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:07,524
And I can't say I can't make a guarantee that there won't be times where you'll find something that should be charged through a different account.

546
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:12,486
But in terms of the total number, it's 62.3 plus the external funds.

547
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:18,810
And I have no basis to think otherwise, at least at this point.

548
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,031
What I want to be clear is, again, I know there are

549
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:25,164
They're members of the community for whom this might be the one discussion about the budget they hear.

550
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:36,291
I don't want people walking away thinking that you as members of the committee have a binder of $62.3 million, but there's actually 72, and we just don't tell anybody how we spend that other 10.

551
00:55:37,152 --> 00:55:48,000
It's that there are other funding sources that are all discussed publicly that are deliberated on and I think we're transparent about.

552
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:53,003
it's not all as neat and tidy as just the 60.2.3 and nothing else.

553
00:55:58,152 --> 00:55:58,433
Mayor?

554
00:55:59,575 --> 00:56:00,256
Member Van de Kloet.

555
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:02,285
Yes, thank you.

556
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:06,127
Just this is kind of a housekeeping comment.

557
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:14,510
Because of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30.

558
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,332
We're going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum.

559
00:56:19,932 --> 00:56:21,933
Additionally, and I particularly want to

560
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:30,906
highlight this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee.

561
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:41,208
We'd like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE.

562
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:53,051
And that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget.

563
00:56:53,611 --> 00:57:02,619
So after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative.

564
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:03,720
Thank you.

565
00:57:10,065 --> 00:57:10,505
Thank you.

566
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:11,766
Member Graham.

567
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,172
What is the city's allocation to the school district this year?

568
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,258
I don't have that information.

569
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:36,663
I've had ongoing discussions with the city CFO and as we've reported to the committee previously, we have meet routinely the two finance teams.

570
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:49,188
And so I have shared this information with the city's finance team with regard to essentially the three brackets and what we're projecting as a range for a likely increase or a necessary increase.

571
00:57:50,020 --> 00:58:13,232
but I don't have an official number at, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have the official number and I don't, to go back to the sequence that we discussed the previous presentation, the committee will vote on a request that will go to the city, excuse me, the superintendent will make a recommendation to the committee, which will then make a request to the city, at which point an appropriation will be made.

572
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:22,886
So we've changed the process because it used to be that the city provided the number and we worked to it.

573
00:58:22,906 --> 00:58:37,456
So what I'm talking about is the formal process that is sort of reflected by the Massachusetts law with regard to the sequence that the city informally provides a number of employment.

574
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:39,617
They're certainly welcome to do that.

575
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:45,588
Okay, I'm glad to hear we're following the law as it's been laid out.

576
00:58:46,948 --> 00:59:10,457
The other comment that I will make for my colleagues is that when I think about the budget and how we move forward, we need to be thinking about the funds that we did not receive last year, and then a modest increase on top of that, which does put us into the neighborhood of A plus B plus C on Mr. Murphy's slide.

577
00:59:12,134 --> 00:59:29,314
As far as I can tell, that really represents restoring the district from the layoffs, the pink slips, and all the other things that we had to do last year, given the funding issues.

578
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:30,495
And I will

579
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:43,237
be looking to make sure that we are funding the things that we promised last year, like middle school health and reading specialists and addressing dyslexia in the budget.

580
00:59:43,257 --> 00:59:46,699
So I'm hopeful and we've had great conversations on the curriculum subcommittee.

581
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:55,905
So I am hopeful that the city is preparing for that, especially with the significant infusion of cash from the federal government coming our way.

582
00:59:56,945 --> 01:00:00,548
So that is what I will be looking for as we go into the budget meetings and

583
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:07,350
I hope that we don't have to pink slip hundreds of teachers again this year.

584
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:12,477
Oh, and the last thing I'll say is I'm also hopeful that we can

585
01:00:13,762 --> 01:00:31,776
Um do right by the staff across lots of bargaining units that have helped us navigate through this pandemic as we talk about, um, the negotiation of many collective bargaining agreements and central to those discussions.

586
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:42,585
Of course, and reasonably are cost of living increases, and we as a city need to be prepared to Come to those conversations in good faith.

587
01:00:43,686 --> 01:00:46,068
That's all.

588
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:48,410
Mayor, if I could just, in response to Ms.

589
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:53,554
Graham's questions, I think it would be worth bringing up the slide with the three buckets again.

590
01:00:53,594 --> 01:00:57,257
I think it sort of dovetails nicely up those comments.

591
01:00:57,277 --> 01:00:59,378
Would that be okay if I shared that very briefly?

592
01:01:00,479 --> 01:01:01,000
Yes, please.

593
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,780
Thanks.

594
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:04,422
So to Ms.

595
01:01:04,442 --> 01:01:09,866
Graham's point, if you look in these three categories, on the far left,

596
01:01:12,307 --> 01:01:13,448
Bracket A, we'll call it.

597
01:01:13,468 --> 01:01:14,108
It's a good label.

598
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,210
I should have put it on there to make it more easy to read, I think.

599
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,932
That's the 2.1 million increase.

600
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:25,796
That is the increase that is coming regardless of any decisions that we make.

601
01:01:25,977 --> 01:01:31,060
Essentially, the decisions that led to that 2.1 increase have already been made in the past.

602
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:40,747
Either they're collective bargaining agreements that have been engineered into, some of which decades ago, and others are strategic decisions with regard to

603
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:45,670
investment in various types of maintenance via any ranging from HVAC to technology.

604
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:55,255
These next two brackets, B and C, there are some strategic decisions that can be made there.

605
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:59,637
And that's why there's a range 500 to 1.75 and 750 to 2 million.

606
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:06,701
But the committee and the community need to understand that if we go in the low range of that, then there are implications to that.

607
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:09,562
So, and you could be looking at

608
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,813
essentially going multiple fiscal years with no cost of living increase.

609
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:21,694
Typically not considered a prudent strategy, but under, you know, these are uncertain economic conditions.

610
01:02:21,754 --> 01:02:32,736
And so we need to go in understanding that, you know, ultimately the allocation and the product of the collective bargaining negotiations could land somewhere within that.

611
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:38,937
With regards to the middle column, bracket B here, that restoration of the FTEs is

612
01:02:40,462 --> 01:02:41,723
connected to exactly what Ms.

613
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:45,365
Graham was saying and making sure that those positions are restored appropriately.

614
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:56,553
And that is obviously a chief priority going into these discussions and trying to make sure that we're able to be made whole as much as possible.

615
01:02:56,953 --> 01:03:00,015
So those are the three categories.

616
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,416
Again, there is a range, there is a variability.

617
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:06,799
That's not unusual, frankly, at this time of the year under this form of government.

618
01:03:08,337 --> 01:03:28,109
the uncertainty is exacerbated a little bit this year, or magnified, I guess, by the fact that we have this potential influx of funding, both the city and the school, on the school and city sides of the ledger, for which we don't yet have full guidance on with regard to restrictions.

619
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:31,551
And so that leaves us, in some cases, with more questions.

620
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,753
And I know that, frankly, sometimes with these budget discussions,

621
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:42,143
I think everyone's a little more comfortable if we either come in and say the sky is falling and everyone has to panic.

622
01:03:42,724 --> 01:03:46,467
Or we come in and say, this is a really good year conditions are favorable.

623
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:50,190
We're going to be able to fund all these priorities have been waiting.

624
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:55,474
We've been waiting for years on and we're not in either of those situations, frankly, we're not.

625
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:58,917
This is not a time to panic and it's not a time to rejoice.

626
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:00,698
We're somewhere in the middle with some

627
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:10,762
legitimate questions that we still need to have answered, but hopefully with this information tonight, people can start to get a sense as to what the range is that we're talking about.

628
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:16,184
If our increase is below $3 million, that is going to be a significant, significant challenge.

629
01:04:16,704 --> 01:04:23,986
If our increase is above $6 million, we're going to have to do some additional strategic planning, frankly, to make sure that we're making the most of the investment.

630
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:26,887
Somewhere within that range, in 3.4 to 5.8,

631
01:04:29,229 --> 01:04:40,455
is a number in which we will be able to make good on the investment, maximize those resources to benefit students, and also these sound fiscal stewards.

632
01:04:41,216 --> 01:04:47,659
So thank you for allowing me to just go back to that briefly, but I felt like it was a good opportunity to sort of reaffirm that point.

633
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:53,142
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

634
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:56,766
Number four, we have report on summer funding.

635
01:04:57,247 --> 01:04:58,569
I had my hand raised.

636
01:04:59,230 --> 01:04:59,971
Member McLaughlin.

637
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:00,972
Thank you.

638
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:06,353
Thank you for the PowerPoint.

639
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:11,556
I was going to ask if it could be, I didn't see it in the drive, so I'd love to have it sent to the members if you would as well.

640
01:05:12,057 --> 01:05:18,261
And then I know that we've had discussion in the past, and I just wanted to double check because of the conversation around the process again.

641
01:05:18,922 --> 01:05:27,588
And we talked about a flowchart, and especially for the community that is trying to understand the process, I think

642
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:34,931
you know, we have meetings ourselves and we have a lot of conversation that we may understand things more than, say, the layperson does.

643
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:37,052
So I really do think we need this visual.

644
01:05:37,092 --> 01:05:44,855
And I don't know if that's in the presentation or where that is, but we need a visual of a flowchart on what the process is and how it works.

645
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:50,237
So I know to remember Graham's conversation earlier around, you know, when's the appropriation?

646
01:05:50,297 --> 01:05:51,198
What's the appropriation?

647
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:51,858
How does this work?

648
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,751
from the city, what have you.

649
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:55,312
I think the flowchart really helps with that.

650
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,754
So I'm wondering what the status is, if I can.

651
01:05:58,195 --> 01:05:59,115
Will people be getting that?

652
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:06,301
I know there was some discussion, we'll be getting it before the budget meetings, which are May 3rd, but that means the public didn't necessarily get it in tonight's meeting.

653
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:10,384
So that's the point is I really wanna make sure that the public understands the process, please.

654
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:16,069
So beyond the flowchart that's in this presentation, you mean?

655
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:21,153
Can we go back to the side of the flowchart that's in the presentation?

656
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:23,547
I'm happy to.

657
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:46,076
Is there a piece of information not in this flowchart that you would like represented in the flowchart?

658
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:49,954
Yeah, I think the process of how the decisions are made.

659
01:06:50,014 --> 01:07:09,486
So in the flow chart that we had worked on together, I was under the impression that the process around when the city appropriation, how it goes, what happens if the school committee votes yes, what happens if the school committee votes no, whose decision it is, where it goes, because we don't have any information on that.

660
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:09,607
And

661
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:39,577
we had this situation last time where it was a very where there was a closed vote on there was a potential no vote on the budget and the community you know wanted to know what the impact of that would be and it was not clear and it wasn't clear to committee members and it's still not clear to me so I would like to know that yeah I think it's a fair question it's one that at least in the abstract has been um discussed that I've certainly been part of the conversations a few different times and uh including in recent months as

662
01:07:40,195 --> 01:07:47,257
Um, some of the, you know, budgets picture, um, a couple of months ago when it was even less clear than it is now.

663
01:07:47,937 --> 01:08:03,560
Um, but under the city form of government, if the school committee's role, while there is a vote in the statutory required, statutory required vote to adopt the budget, um, that is ultimately appropriated by the municipal government.

664
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,841
If the question is what happens if the school committee

665
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:19,974
refuses to vote to adopt the budget that the municipal government appropriated, then there really isn't a specific sort of how-to with regard to that.

666
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:27,580
The administration would be in a position where the governing body that we report to has not approved spending for fiscal year 22.

667
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:35,828
We would then consult with the Department of Revenue and get guidance as to how we should proceed.

668
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:45,988
I think you can expect what you would typically see in a situation in which there's, functionally speaking, a government shutdown.

669
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:59,759
It's not common at all, again, in a municipal structure like we have in the city of Medford, because there isn't really a good offering at that point.

670
01:09:00,419 --> 01:09:05,183
So the committee's role is in making the initial request to the municipal government

671
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:11,332
um, articulating and really it's the administration's responsibility to make sure that we're articulating a defense to that.

672
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:12,632
Uh, request.

673
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:18,875
And then the municipal government ultimately makes is, is the, is the spending branch of the municipal government.

674
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:21,196
And ultimately that's the appropriation that's going to be made.

675
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:31,741
I think the reason that there isn't clear guidance spelled out today is because if the school committee were to refuse to accept the budget that was allocated from the municipal government.

676
01:09:32,277 --> 01:09:35,638
there wouldn't be sort of a plan B for the school department.

677
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:43,239
The municipal government ultimately would, you know, could decide, you know, how it was going to respond to that.

678
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:48,620
And I guess there could be some type of breaksmanship where the municipal government then decided to appropriate more.

679
01:09:48,660 --> 01:10:01,363
But just frankly, the way the municipal governments operate and the timing that's involved here in terms of the start of the fiscal year, that wouldn't be a strategically prudent route to take, which is why committees typically don't take that route.

680
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:16,507
So again, that's a, I think trying to articulate that and sharing that type of doomsday scenario, I'm not sure I would say that it would help inform the community.

681
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:28,815
I think in large part, it would be articulating an option, creating the perception that it's a viable one when in fact it's really not a viable option and one that,

682
01:10:30,906 --> 01:10:37,268
I just, I'm hesitant to incorporate more information into this type of presentation that I think is just going to confuse people.

683
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:46,650
But the committee is certainly, I'm not trying to substitute my judgment for the committee.

684
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:58,213
The committee would like to articulate the step-by-step what would happen if the committee voted to not allow the administration to spend the money that was appropriated.

685
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:00,653
certainly entitled to do that.

686
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:13,123
I think my recommendation at the time would be to adopt the budget that was appropriated and continue to advocate for a supplemental appropriation to help bridge whatever gaps the committee recognized.

687
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:19,548
I think that would be a significantly more prudent strategy than shutting the school department down on July 1st.

688
01:11:25,993 --> 01:11:26,613
Member Rousseau.

689
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:28,915
Thank you.

690
01:11:29,977 --> 01:11:31,958
I'm feeling a bit of deja vu here.

691
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:45,025
I've literally watched videos in this last year of communities that have school committees that send budgets up far greater than their municipal appropriation and the world doesn't come to an end.

692
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:51,528
Can you explain to me why that isn't actually an option for us?

693
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:57,691
I think it's a very reasonable option with regard to your vote to make that request.

694
01:11:58,589 --> 01:12:07,876
I'm talking about the scenario in which the budget has passed through the municipal government and where we get to the point at which the new fiscal year is going to start.

695
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:28,310
And what I'm saying is rather than refusing to adopt that budget and therefore freezing the administration's ability to expend any of the resources that have been appropriated, I think it would be a more prudent strategy to adopt that budget and then continue to advocate and lobby the branch of the municipal government that does have spending authority to supplement that budget.

696
01:12:29,748 --> 01:12:30,829
I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.

697
01:12:31,629 --> 01:12:40,474
So if the mayor through her office gives you a number, the school committee's authority around the budget is to vote yes or no on that number.

698
01:12:41,015 --> 01:12:44,937
That is our entire, we have all these meetings, we have all this process.

699
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:48,559
At the end of the day, we're voting yes or no on the number that the mayor gave us.

700
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,821
And that is the entirety of what we do.

701
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:58,085
I'm saying in other communities, we develop a budget based on the school committee's priorities and obviously,

702
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:03,373
with the administration and we send up an $85 million budget.

703
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:11,155
And the mayor says in her budget, it's 65 million and sends it to the city council and they approve it for $65 million.

704
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:19,777
And we can go to sleep with a good conscience because we talk about priorities, getting to the priorities that have been on our lists.

705
01:13:20,157 --> 01:13:23,698
We talk about that like it's like new uniforms for the band.

706
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:24,658
No, we're talking about,

707
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:33,387
reading services for kids in high school that are not on IEPs that can't read well enough to get through life.

708
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:40,969
We have zero reading service providers for kids that are not on IEPs that do not read properly, sufficiently.

709
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,609
That's not a priority.

710
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:46,810
Those are kids for going out into the world without basic skills.

711
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,691
And, you know, I mean, there's the middle school sex ed that we don't have.

712
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:53,271
We don't have any physical ed

713
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:56,219
We don't have an adaptive physical ed person.

714
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:04,042
We keep talking about priorities, like we're talking about whether to get a new car this year or wait a year, like it's our personal budget.

715
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:11,445
There are actual children on the other end who are going off out of our schools, not prepared to survive.

716
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:22,029
And so I would be able to go to bed if we sent an $85 million budget up, just picking a number randomly, that reflected what we said we needed.

717
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:32,900
And then it's on the mayor and then it's on the city council and it's on the taxpayers who will then not be able to deny that this is what we need.

718
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:38,463
But every year we send up a budget that is the exact to the nickel number we're given from the city hall.

719
01:14:39,103 --> 01:14:40,524
And it doesn't matter what we need.

720
01:14:41,024 --> 01:14:41,804
It doesn't matter.

721
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:42,685
And that's true.

722
01:14:43,906 --> 01:14:52,050
So I just, you know, this notion that we are in a, we're in a machine and we have no other options is just not true.

723
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,045
and other communities have figured it out.

724
01:14:54,586 --> 01:14:59,787
They send a budget up that is ethical and reflects the needs of the kids.

725
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:04,488
And if the community isn't willing to pay for it, then it's on the community.

726
01:15:04,788 --> 01:15:07,009
But if we won't send that budget up, it's on us.

727
01:15:07,209 --> 01:15:09,469
It's not on the community, it's on us.

728
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:14,470
I'm just tired of this talk about priorities.

729
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,972
It's like whether or not to paint your house this year or next, or this year or not.

730
01:15:20,988 --> 01:15:22,688
Mayor, if I could just respond briefly.

731
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:28,210
I just want to be clear in this presentation, we've used the word necessity, not priority.

732
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:36,052
So I think that I understand what you're saying that I would say I would rather use the term strategic priority than wishlist.

733
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:44,634
And that is something that we've talked to within our internal budget meetings, we've made that expectation clear, because I think a wishlist, frankly, doesn't sound credible.

734
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:50,575
And I think that you're not in a position to be able to advocate on behalf of the school department, if we are

735
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:55,050
asking everyone who works for us to say, just tell us what you dream about at night.

736
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,931
I don't think that helps the cause in any way.

737
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:10,256
But I hope, Mr. Rousseau, you're not taking this presentation to suggest that we as an administration believe you don't have any options.

738
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:20,400
The presentation tonight says there's a range from 3.4 to 5.8 that we can make very good, very prudent, very student-centered,

739
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:21,972
investments in.

740
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:34,256
Now, as you hear from department heads over the course of the next several weeks, you may well say 5.8 seems, you know, important, but we really think it's 6.3.

741
01:16:35,116 --> 01:16:40,758
I can't, frankly, I don't know why you wouldn't make that request if that's what you think is necessary.

742
01:16:41,058 --> 01:16:47,259
Because to your point, the sky is not going to fall in if the committee says, look, we've summed all this up.

743
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,900
We think the vote should be at 6.3.

744
01:16:49,882 --> 01:16:53,983
should be 6.3 is ultimately it is the school committee's request to make.

745
01:16:54,103 --> 01:16:55,863
You should make it as you see fit.

746
01:16:56,524 --> 01:17:08,486
I would say I have a responsibility to tell you that if we get much further past the range that we're talking about here, again, there's a lot of planning that would have to go in.

747
01:17:08,686 --> 01:17:17,488
And so I would be mindful of that for purposes of making sure that we as an organization have the credibility to advocate on behalf of students.

748
01:17:17,528 --> 01:17:19,629
I think that that's sort of how this

749
01:17:20,243 --> 01:17:25,525
works when you have multi levers of government involved in the development of a budget.

750
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,786
But I think by all means, you can make that request.

751
01:17:28,826 --> 01:17:30,847
I don't know why you wouldn't.

752
01:17:32,568 --> 01:17:37,870
Understand that we're going to be able to operate if we end up with less than that.

753
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:48,154
And what we as an administration can't do is, and I don't think anyone is asking us to do to be clear, but we can't say, we can't light our hair on fire if

754
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:57,352
you know, if the request comes in below $6 million because we are going to be able to operate, we're going to be able to do right by students.

755
01:17:57,952 --> 01:18:01,733
If we get lower than that low end of the number, no, I don't think we can.

756
01:18:01,753 --> 01:18:17,640
I have a responsibility to tell you from based on what I've seen so far, including a lot of these fixes that we're making and trying to be more transparent and be more honest and taking into account that those uncertainties, if we land at a number that is our current budget, less, you know, with less than a,

757
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:19,647
a $3.4 million increase.

758
01:18:19,787 --> 01:18:21,827
At this time, I would not be comfortable with that.

759
01:18:22,228 --> 01:18:26,850
We would have to make a series of decisions that I don't think would be in the best interest of students.

760
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:34,413
But I also would say, I don't think there's a magic number that somehow if we cross that threshold, all of a sudden, we're going to do right by every single kid.

761
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:35,733
I don't think that number exists.

762
01:18:35,873 --> 01:18:38,034
I think right now, it's a range.

763
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,335
I think there are a lot of variables that we have to take into account.

764
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:42,296
I think there are questions that we have to answer.

765
01:18:44,277 --> 01:18:47,698
But I don't think, I just want to be clear that

766
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,817
There's two stages of this process.

767
01:18:51,398 --> 01:19:07,746
You can make whatever request you think is appropriate, but I, it is hard to imagine a scenario on June 30th where not adopting the budget that's been appropriated is the best course of action.

768
01:19:07,946 --> 01:19:08,746
That was my only point.

769
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:14,269
But prior to that, I think you should make whatever request you think is in the interest of the district.

770
01:19:16,287 --> 01:19:16,787
Thank you, Mayor.

771
01:19:16,827 --> 01:19:18,288
Mayor, may I just have a quick follow-up?

772
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:19,769
Member Rousseau.

773
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:21,270
Thank you.

774
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:25,933
Can we get an attorney who can answer the questions about this onto a meeting?

775
01:19:26,693 --> 01:19:36,799
Because I was under the impression from our last round was that if we had voted the budget down and the city appropriated the funds anyways, our voting it down would have no impact at all on people getting paid.

776
01:19:37,299 --> 01:19:43,023
So, you know, the notion that we shut the building down on July 1st and you all just go home

777
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:49,931
wait it out while the politicians get raked over on Facebook or something, I don't think is reality.

778
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:55,532
And I think there is certainly a time when it becomes a problem.

779
01:19:56,713 --> 01:20:03,214
I need to actually have an answer to what happens if we refuse to approve a budget that we don't feel is adequate.

780
01:20:04,535 --> 01:20:10,096
And I don't wanna find out after we are there, what the consequences are.

781
01:20:10,116 --> 01:20:11,597
I think we need an answer.

782
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:16,120
The, you know, several members last year were like, well, what will happen?

783
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,702
And here we are coming up on another year where several of us are asking what will happen.

784
01:20:21,222 --> 01:20:24,743
And I can't believe that in Massachusetts with 351 communities.

785
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:29,605
And I know there's very different forms of government that nobody has ever refused to pass a budget.

786
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,445
That just doesn't seem plausible.

787
01:20:32,406 --> 01:20:33,066
So just be clear.

788
01:20:33,146 --> 01:20:34,746
It doesn't seem like it's there.

789
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:35,407
Absolutely.

790
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:38,528
The school committees that are refused to adopt the budget.

791
01:20:39,048 --> 01:20:39,208
Okay.

792
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:43,856
And I'm happy to seek outside counsel and provide you with a legal opinion.

793
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:46,076
I will say, I am an attorney that's done this.

794
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:48,477
I have talked to other attorneys that have dealt with this.

795
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:56,419
And the issue is that in this form of government, with this timing, it is so nonsensical that there isn't a clear path forward.

796
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:02,980
There are various options, some of which I think are of questionable legality, but there are absolutely paths forward at that point.

797
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,721
In some of the other forms of government, there are contingencies that are built in

798
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:10,404
And there are levers that can then be adopted.

799
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,645
In this form of government, there aren't as many.

800
01:21:12,745 --> 01:21:18,810
So there aren't gonna be, there will not be a good option available, but that's not to suggest that there will be no options.

801
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:25,575
And I really, really wanna be clear that there are two points in the budget sequence here.

802
01:21:26,455 --> 01:21:31,599
No one is saying that the school committee must only take a vote on a number that's handed over from the city.

803
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:37,964
I don't know what the point of the school committee would be if that was the only thing that you were empowered to do.

804
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:49,669
But that is a different question than whether the administration who works for the school committee can legally spend money if no vote has been adopted.

805
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:59,357
I will tell you that in a lot of school committees, and this is sort of the ugly truth of school governance, they often forget to take the second vote.

806
01:21:59,577 --> 01:22:00,658
That is not uncommon.

807
01:22:00,918 --> 01:22:04,681
And I think the school committee association probably is more familiar with this than I am.

808
01:22:05,082 --> 01:22:06,523
But once the request is made,

809
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:14,577
and the municipal government ultimately makes that appropriation, most school committees just consider their previous vote to have been their approval of the budget.

810
01:22:14,917 --> 01:22:25,022
And then administratively, the funding flows in and people get paid and off we go throughout the course of the fiscal year and we live happily ever after, okay?

811
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:32,385
There is a statute that makes it very clear that there's an expectation that the committee adopt a budget after that appropriation is made.

812
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:35,427
And I think it would be a best practice to follow that

813
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:44,984
And I don't think it would be the best practice to not expend the funding that was appropriate, especially when you are in no way closed off from continuing to advocate.

814
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:54,025
I understand there could be some symbolic value in just saying no, but I don't think there's any legal or strategic value in that.

815
01:22:54,625 --> 01:23:05,667
And again, if the idea is you have complete control over where the money is spent, because there's an absolute prohibition on the municipal government telling the school committee how to spend within the eligible expenses,

816
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:19,548
you, it seems to me that the more prudent strategy would be that adopted money, especially when there's a two month runway before most students are even in the buildings and then continue to advocate for a supplemental budget.

817
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:33,912
I mean, that, that is a, that is the path that is, is going to constitute a best practice, whether we can through some type of DOR regulation, expend funds technically without

818
01:23:34,403 --> 01:23:36,585
facing the sort of unfortunate end of an audit.

819
01:23:37,947 --> 01:23:39,769
Yeah, possibly we could do that.

820
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:48,960
But I think those of us who are administrators reporting to the school committee, no, we don't really wanna be spending money if the school committee hasn't ultimately adopted a plan to spend the money.

821
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:49,941
And that's one point.

822
01:23:51,242 --> 01:23:51,422
Thank you.

823
01:23:53,745 --> 01:23:54,466
Thank you, member Graham.

824
01:23:57,683 --> 01:24:17,912
Yeah, I just wanted to acknowledge that this two-step process that is both a best practice and supported by law and regulation, I think is something that Medford just hasn't done before, which I think is why you're getting all of these questions, Mr. Murphy.

825
01:24:18,232 --> 01:24:21,834
Medford has not operated in this best practice fashion in the past.

826
01:24:22,654 --> 01:24:24,675
And I think it's time that we start doing that.

827
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:26,968
And that means two votes.

828
01:24:27,488 --> 01:24:40,060
And that provides an outlet and an ability for the school committee to tell the city government what we need to support the students in our charge.

829
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,485
And it also allows us a way to acknowledge

830
01:24:47,727 --> 01:24:51,609
whether we're doing everything we can with the hand that we have been given.

831
01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:56,071
Last year, those two things were horribly muddy together.

832
01:24:56,111 --> 01:25:11,878
And I think my comments at the time were about trying to make sure that my no vote was not construed as a criticism of making the best of a very bad budget situation and being supportive of the budget overall, which to me were two very different things.

833
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:15,300
And so I am completely supportive of this two-step process.

834
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:19,087
It is a best practice for lots of good reasons.

835
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:34,138
And I am happy to have you on board to guide us through that best practice process so that we can do better for the students of Medford than we have been able to do in our past budget discussions.

836
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:34,739
So thank you.

837
01:25:35,799 --> 01:25:36,340
I appreciate it.

838
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:45,867
Just to be clear, you're probably alone in that again, whether it's most or not, I really can't speak to, but it is absolutely not uncommon for the school committee to take a vote.

839
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:56,177
think of it as a budget approval when in effect it's a request because the actual appropriating happens on the other side of town, the appropriation is made, and then they never convene again.

840
01:25:56,397 --> 01:26:10,519
And frankly, just because it's sort of a cycle, I don't know this, but I suspect a big part of why that second vote doesn't occur in a lot of school committees, it's because the committee has already recessed for the summer when the appropriation is actually allocated.

841
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:13,260
But again, it's really, really not uncommon.

842
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,240
It's just that I think that

843
01:26:15,887 --> 01:26:28,109
What I'm hearing from multiple members is that they want the budget vote to be a clear articulation as to what the committee sees as the needs of the school district.

844
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:30,049
That's completely fair.

845
01:26:30,529 --> 01:26:35,990
Again, that is why school departments are unique within the municipal structure.

846
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:43,312
It's why there's a semi-autonomous body that is elected to have that independence and to advocate on behalf of students, right?

847
01:26:43,692 --> 01:26:45,312
But there's also a reality.

848
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:56,823
that within the composition of a municipal government, there are competing needs, there are competing priorities, and there's a limited amount of money, even with an allocation like this coming in from the federal government.

849
01:26:57,104 --> 01:27:05,326
And so the municipal government has a different mandate and needs to make those decisions and ultimately make an appropriation.

850
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:14,329
My only point is once that need has been articulated, and when the right to continue to articulate that need and to advocate

851
01:27:15,053 --> 01:27:37,631
continues even after that appropriation is made, I'm hard pressed to think of a scenario in which voting down the appropriation that has come in is going to put us in a more favorable position, both to operate the district and to advocate for the additional investment that the school committee believes is necessary.

852
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:42,375
And so I think that that's sort of the sequence as it plays out over the course of the next month.

853
01:27:50,902 --> 01:27:51,282
Thank you.

854
01:27:51,302 --> 01:27:52,283
Thank you.

855
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:54,864
Number four, report on summer fun and community schools.

856
01:27:54,944 --> 01:27:56,866
Dr. Peter Cushing, Mr. Robert Maloney.

857
01:28:45,025 --> 01:28:45,845
Good evening, everyone.

858
01:28:45,865 --> 01:28:47,346
I apologize right now.

859
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:52,429
I'm on a computer that has no audio and my other computer just went down.

860
01:28:53,550 --> 01:29:04,236
So if you would just bear with me for one moment, I will read the report and hopefully get audio back momentarily.

861
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,657
So.

862
01:29:13,102 --> 01:29:22,926
All right, so right now this report is updating on Summer Fun and the other community schools programs that are being offered this summer.

863
01:29:23,926 --> 01:29:31,029
First, Summer Fun, Mr. Petrellis is on the call, but we are offering Summer Fun this year.

864
01:29:31,049 --> 01:29:37,031
It will start on July 5th and it will go through August 13th.

865
01:29:37,912 --> 01:29:40,853
We have six weeks of availability this summer.

866
01:29:41,453 --> 01:29:58,617
One of the things that all of the summer programs are competing with are staffing issues, as well as issues with just the pandemic and looking at how much staff have been through over the past year and just a level of exhaustion.

867
01:29:58,757 --> 01:30:09,900
So currently, we're working to bring people on board and make sure that we have the appropriate nursing staff and other supports necessary to make sure that all of our programs

868
01:30:11,012 --> 01:30:14,459
across the district are running very well and very efficiently.

869
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,744
Secondly, we are

870
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:28,371
with summer fun, there will be a cost increase this year to go up to $200 per week.

871
01:30:28,551 --> 01:30:46,194
We cannot accept walk-ins due to the fact that we're looking for students to have a negative COVID test, which you can get at a stop the spread site free of charge prior to students enrolling.

872
01:30:47,294 --> 01:30:57,065
Um, the the summer fund program will be moved this year to the Columbus school.

873
01:30:57,625 --> 01:31:07,936
Um, as we're looking to spread out as much as possible from the high school to look at the number of programs that are just give me one second.

874
01:31:07,976 --> 01:31:08,597
I'm actually coming

875
01:31:15,895 --> 01:31:33,612
Um, so one of the things that we're doing by moving to the Columbus, we will have the, um, we'll have the opportunity to use the Tufts pool, um, at Tufts park near, um, just make me give me one moment.

876
01:31:33,652 --> 01:31:34,253
I apologize.

877
01:31:52,492 --> 01:31:57,076
All right, I can't apologize enough for the technical difficulties I had over the last couple of minutes.

878
01:31:58,217 --> 01:32:02,580
So hopefully you actually heard me over the last couple of minutes.

879
01:32:03,421 --> 01:32:07,965
So by moving it to the Columbus, we've got a large field there.

880
01:32:07,985 --> 01:32:14,090
We've got a fully renovated playground available to our students and then the availability to go to the Tufts playground.

881
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:27,243
Uh, we also have, uh, several programs that are partner programs that will be leasing space from Medford, uh, public schools through the community schools slash partnering with community schools.

882
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:31,146
Um, and those include the spotlight program.

883
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:37,431
Uh, that's a $325, um, per workshop, uh, cost.

884
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:39,433
They give a specialized singing mask.

885
01:32:40,077 --> 01:32:46,864
to students, they will be able to sing, be able to act, be able to do the things they've been normally doing.

886
01:32:47,304 --> 01:32:50,788
There are certain CDC guidelines that we will be following.

887
01:32:51,648 --> 01:32:54,411
These have been published by the city of Medford as well.

888
01:32:55,853 --> 01:32:58,235
And they were updated late Friday night.

889
01:32:59,522 --> 01:33:01,943
So we're going to cohort individuals as much as possible.

890
01:33:01,963 --> 01:33:06,945
Attendees must remain three feet apart during normal activities, six feet when eating.

891
01:33:06,965 --> 01:33:10,367
We're going to schedule activities outside as much as possible.

892
01:33:10,607 --> 01:33:19,391
We'll strongly encourage all of our camp staff who are 16 and older to get vaccinated as soon as the opportunity is available, which is now.

893
01:33:20,652 --> 01:33:23,493
We'll be ventilating interior spaces as much as possible.

894
01:33:23,613 --> 01:33:27,895
And the district's work on HVAC is definitely helping in all those areas.

895
01:33:29,091 --> 01:33:33,154
and mask wearing at all times, with the exception of swimming, eating, and drinking.

896
01:33:33,314 --> 01:33:48,925
And in the report that I submitted to you this afternoon, I do quote from where they do not want students wearing a mask in areas where they will get wet, such as at a beach or a pool, as a wet mask can make it difficult to breathe and to also not work.

897
01:33:50,426 --> 01:33:54,068
So these programs are enriching and offer a great opportunity for our students.

898
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:55,969
One of our problems that we have

899
01:33:57,628 --> 01:34:05,953
is that the GBL league made the decision to get as many kids involved in athletics as possible.

900
01:34:07,193 --> 01:34:15,558
The problem is, is that that meant that we waited for other school districts to get out of the red to really be able to start participating, which is awesome.

901
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:25,043
It was a great league mandate, but we're going to be pushing our athletic seasons later than ever before going to July 3rd.

902
01:34:26,053 --> 01:34:29,394
And then fall season start back on August 15th.

903
01:34:30,034 --> 01:34:34,236
And many of these programs utilize facilities that our athletics program would.

904
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,917
So just let me run through this again.

905
01:34:38,937 --> 01:34:43,158
We also have a Medford basketball summer camp run by our varsity programs.

906
01:34:43,318 --> 01:34:49,640
It's available to all students, kindergarten through grade nine, three weeks, June 21st to the 25th, June 12th to the 16th.

907
01:34:52,218 --> 01:34:54,079
and August 9th to 13th.

908
01:34:54,559 --> 01:34:57,820
Spotlight Productions is also running July 5th through the 13th.

909
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:04,862
And then the Boston Celtics have expressed interest in returning to Medford High School.

910
01:35:04,902 --> 01:35:07,423
They were there two years ago to run camps.

911
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:14,705
And we're currently just waiting to make sure that we have all of our scheduling settled before we open to outside vendors.

912
01:35:16,146 --> 01:35:19,407
So that's summer fun in community schools at this point.

913
01:35:22,529 --> 01:35:27,372
I'll take any questions if you have them.

914
01:35:27,392 --> 01:35:28,192
Member McLaughlin.

915
01:35:30,533 --> 01:35:31,694
Thank you, Mayor.

916
01:35:32,014 --> 01:35:34,876
I guess I'm confused, because I thought, is Mr. Maloney here?

917
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:45,201
Mr. Maloney is currently supervising volleyball, and so was not able to join.

918
01:35:45,221 --> 01:35:49,803
OK, so do we know what the status is going to be on the cost of

919
01:35:52,542 --> 01:36:01,244
the summer fun camp this year, what the staffing is gonna be, you know, sort of how that's gonna, I'm thrilled that it's happening.

920
01:36:01,304 --> 01:36:03,245
You know, we're definitely gonna be going.

921
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:18,748
I think it's a great program or my child's gonna be going, I won't be going, but I think it's a great program, but I'd like to- I'm not gonna lie, I wish I could go, but no, right now in Mr. Petrellis, I know is flying solo with twins at this point,

922
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:23,012
But we are charging $200 per student.

923
01:36:23,753 --> 01:36:29,877
The additional cost is related to PPE and other things that all of these programs now gonna be responsible for.

924
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:47,548
The initial conversations were probably capping at 75 campers just because of the need to distance and for the additional staff.

925
01:36:48,935 --> 01:36:55,661
If we can expand beyond that we will, but we've just got to be very careful about the number of students that are coming in.

926
01:36:55,681 --> 01:37:02,807
Okay, may I may I follow up question or do you want to let okay.

927
01:37:02,907 --> 01:37:03,888
So keep going.

928
01:37:04,305 --> 01:37:05,426
Thank you.

929
01:37:05,926 --> 01:37:31,621
And so I know that in the past, we've worked with community schools to ensure that there is a obviously clear statement on all applications that Medford Public Schools does not discriminate based on ability, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth, so that the community members know that if you have a child with a disability who you want to attend summer fun camp in our school district, they are fully

930
01:37:34,462 --> 01:37:44,564
able permitted should be allowed to attend summer fun camp, because it is a community program community based program which is obviously accessible and open to all individuals so.

931
01:37:45,048 --> 01:37:46,529
We had something similar.

932
01:37:46,629 --> 01:38:02,157
I know Mr. Petrales is on the line and he was very thoughtful about how that was written into the applications in the past, but just want to make sure that that's really clear to the community because it's an important program where another opportunity to build friendships between children with and without varying abilities.

933
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,357
So thank you.

934
01:38:04,037 --> 01:38:05,498
I would definitely say absolutely.

935
01:38:05,538 --> 01:38:10,961
And then, you know, also any community members who would feel generous enough to say sponsor students.

936
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:30,980
always feel free to reach out and make a contribution on behalf so that we can be able to offer those types of things which we would do anyway, but it just helps to make sure that we're meeting in the black, but we would never deny a student.

937
01:38:34,444 --> 01:38:34,804
Thank you.

938
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:36,730
One last question.

939
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,211
And when are the applications available?

940
01:38:39,911 --> 01:38:41,312
They should be available at the end of this week.

941
01:38:41,352 --> 01:38:42,852
We were just clearing up a few things.

942
01:38:43,692 --> 01:38:53,595
We would love to be able to offer credit card payments in the future and a few other things, but just given the timelines for this year, it wasn't very realistic.

943
01:38:55,715 --> 01:39:04,458
And there are certain challenges if you accept credit cards as the refund isn't immediate, it needs to go through the city warrant process.

944
01:39:05,724 --> 01:39:07,084
and things along those lines.

945
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:19,187
So what we'd like to do is have the applications available toward the end of this week, make sure that they're back as quickly as possible.

946
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:30,269
And then, yeah, we'd like, what we can't have this year though, I can't stress this enough, is we can't have the walk-ups that I think people are very accustomed to.

947
01:39:30,289 --> 01:39:33,790
Right, and so may I ask again, Mayor, one more question?

948
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:35,815
Yes, member McLaughlin.

949
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:43,597
And so are there opportunities for camp counselors or what have you?

950
01:39:43,617 --> 01:39:52,359
I know in the past, Mr. Petralos has been really great about recruiting phenomenal adults to be counselors within the camp.

951
01:39:52,399 --> 01:40:03,901
And I'm wondering where we are at on staffing with that and whether or not there are opportunities available for our rising seniors, rising juniors, folks who may be looking for a summer job, what have you?

952
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:19,137
There will definitely be opportunities for them, although they may be slightly limited just because of the smaller number that is going to be available.

953
01:40:19,357 --> 01:40:31,143
But we'll be looking at the staffing in the coming week to week and a half and hiring as well, and then onboarding anyone who is not currently in the onboarded system.

954
01:40:31,787 --> 01:40:35,888
So if individuals are interested in applying for a camp counselor position, what would they do?

955
01:40:36,788 --> 01:40:42,510
We'll be putting out an email to all the students to let them know through the district email.

956
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:55,973
And then I'm sure Mr. Petralos will be reaching out as well to make sure that he's trying to connect with those counselors that may actually have gone elsewhere last year because some programs ran.

957
01:40:56,193 --> 01:40:59,074
And then just the last summer there were really

958
01:41:17,983 --> 01:41:29,872
know, it's a great example, another shining star in Medford's crown or shining jewel in Medford's crown of, you know, an example of diversity and affordability and accessibility.

959
01:41:30,433 --> 01:41:32,675
And Anthony has really led the charge on that.

960
01:41:32,735 --> 01:41:39,460
And I want to say thank you to Mr. Petrales and Mr. Droschke and others who have been so critical in that program.

961
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:39,880
Thank you.

962
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,342
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

963
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:43,183
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

964
01:41:44,025 --> 01:41:48,746
Number five, we have recommendation to approve 2021-2022 school year calendar.

965
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:52,187
Motion to approve.

966
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:55,748
Motion to approve by member Russo, seconded by.

967
01:41:55,768 --> 01:41:57,708
Member McLaughlin.

968
01:41:58,168 --> 01:41:59,389
Member McLaughlin, roll call.

969
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:02,389
Member Graham.

970
01:42:02,829 --> 01:42:03,029
Yes.

971
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:04,910
Member Kretz.

972
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,730
Yes.

973
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:07,530
Member McLaughlin, yes.

974
01:42:07,611 --> 01:42:08,631
Member Mustone.

975
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:09,351
Yes.

976
01:42:10,071 --> 01:42:10,771
Member Russo.

977
01:42:12,032 --> 01:42:12,232
Yes.

978
01:42:13,152 --> 01:42:13,832
Member Van de Kloet.

979
01:42:19,017 --> 01:42:21,158
member Van de Kloot just unmute yourself, please.

980
01:42:22,999 --> 01:42:23,240
Yes.

981
01:42:24,741 --> 01:42:25,421
Mayor Longo-Khan.

982
01:42:26,281 --> 01:42:28,243
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

983
01:42:28,823 --> 01:42:32,505
New calendar for 2021-2022 has been approved.

984
01:42:33,226 --> 01:42:38,789
And that will be up on our website, I would assume in the next couple of days.

985
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:40,970
Member Russo.

986
01:42:42,211 --> 01:42:42,471
Thank you.

987
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:48,315
I just wanted to thank the administration for their work on an entirely new calendar this year and the way it's being done.

988
01:42:49,098 --> 01:42:52,720
I'm quite proud of the work that went into that new calendar.

989
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,781
So I'm very excited.

990
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:58,584
And I love that the calendar itself includes the statement of how much we value our community.

991
01:42:58,624 --> 01:43:01,166
So just want to thank everybody that did the work on that.

992
01:43:01,947 --> 01:43:02,367
Thank you.

993
01:43:02,627 --> 01:43:03,468
Yes, great job.

994
01:43:04,088 --> 01:43:12,714
I'd like to thank Susie for all the extra time she put in to really beautify the calendar as well to make it more user friendly.

995
01:43:12,894 --> 01:43:13,394
Thank you, Susie.

996
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:22,843
Number six, we have update on discounted MBTA bus passes for disadvantaged students, Mr. David Murphy.

997
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:24,744
Thank you, Mayor.

998
01:43:24,784 --> 01:43:29,808
This was a request from the committee that we share an update on this.

999
01:43:30,168 --> 01:43:33,831
And I know this was discussed at a previous meeting.

1000
01:43:33,911 --> 01:43:40,677
So if the beginning part of this is repetitive or redundant, I apologize.

1001
01:43:40,697 --> 01:43:45,801
I think the committee knows that we, like many districts, offer

1002
01:43:46,469 --> 01:43:49,111
discounted MBTA pass at a cost of $30.

1003
01:43:49,231 --> 01:43:54,814
This year, we've been seeing about 50 of those passes per month.

1004
01:43:54,854 --> 01:44:05,080
That's, I know, a reduction than normal, as would be expected, given the reduced occupancy of the building and just generally fewer people taking public transportation.

1005
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:09,723
But we were asked to look into the potential

1006
01:44:10,318 --> 01:44:23,368
for expanding this to potentially offer more passes, the idea being that we want to make sure that we're giving as much access as possible to students and not depriving anyone of the benefits that come with the MBTA pass.

1007
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:31,274
And so we've had some preliminary discussions internally with the building leadership.

1008
01:44:31,534 --> 01:44:38,780
And we have reached out to the MBTA in the hope of beginning a conversation about the possibility of getting

1009
01:44:39,402 --> 01:44:44,266
further discounting if we were to buy the passes in bulk.

1010
01:44:45,667 --> 01:45:06,844
I will just say I'm not optimistic necessarily about those conversations based on some previous experience I've seen in other districts that were buying thousands more passes than we would likely purchase, but we at least want to have that conversation and potentially we've considered reaching out to other districts as well to see if there might be some other

1011
01:45:07,803 --> 01:45:11,145
strategy for procuring additional passes.

1012
01:45:11,405 --> 01:45:15,528
And right now, what we know is just sort of the basic numbers.

1013
01:45:15,588 --> 01:45:29,376
If we were to draw the line at our economically disadvantaged population of students, we'd be looking at a potentially $150,000 budgetary impact that would need to be absorbed.

1014
01:45:29,816 --> 01:45:35,019
If we were to expand that as some districts have to all high school students,

1015
01:45:35,984 --> 01:45:39,726
we'd be looking at what we estimate to be a $350,000 charge.

1016
01:45:41,106 --> 01:45:51,670
There are other strategies that are probably worth exploring, particularly if it was the committee's priority to consider doing the $350,000 charge.

1017
01:45:51,730 --> 01:46:04,095
Typically, that is a program that would be tied to a city as a classroom type program in which you're trying to encourage the use of the MBTA pass to explore more experiential learning opportunities

1018
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:24,400
And so if that were to be part of a larger suite of offerings or initiatives, we'd probably also want to take a close look at our current transportation contract with our primary vendor to see if it may be cost efficient to expand the yellow bus usage at the high school.

1019
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:32,845
My understanding is certainly right now and historically, the high school has been serviced by one yellow bus from the primary vendor.

1020
01:46:34,268 --> 01:46:39,950
And so that is what is contemplated by the current contract within the first of three years within that contract.

1021
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:46,413
But that might be something that we'd want to take a look at depending on the level of investment the committee would like us to consider.

1022
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:54,936
And so that's sort of where we are in terms of the internal discussions we've had as to whether we should consider this.

1023
01:46:55,156 --> 01:47:00,539
You may have seen the last bullet there that we've also talked about the possibility of essentially creating an application process.

1024
01:47:02,693 --> 01:47:17,487
There are inherent issues with that, as you can imagine, making sure that we're being fair and equitable with regard to how those applications would be reviewed and potentially How the either further discounted or free passes would be allocated, but we're certainly open to that.

1025
01:47:17,707 --> 01:47:21,370
And if the committee has other questions or direction that you'd like us to take

1026
01:47:23,129 --> 01:47:25,752
we can certainly explore this further.

1027
01:47:25,812 --> 01:47:32,880
But primarily, we just wanted to provide this update to see if there were any other questions or direction that the committee would like to provide.

1028
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:37,685
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1029
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,928
Member Graham and Member McLaughlin?

1030
01:47:42,888 --> 01:47:44,809
Thanks for this update.

1031
01:47:45,409 --> 01:48:01,693
I think what I would like to see as we talk about the budget for the transportation is what are those options and how would they fit into our budget when the transportation budget is presented to us because

1032
01:48:03,374 --> 01:48:12,059
You know it may be that the MBTA buses are not the most cost-effective way for us to provide free transportation to all students.

1033
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:23,107
My understanding is the MBTA buses are also the reason that sort of hinder us in a regular year from doing late starts and all kinds of other things.

1034
01:48:24,708 --> 01:48:27,109
So as we kind of consider

1035
01:48:29,251 --> 01:48:32,873
start times, late starts, snow days, all of those things.

1036
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:40,637
I think it's a conversation worth having, but I would want to have it in the context of the larger budget so that we can understand what those options are.

1037
01:48:40,737 --> 01:48:49,522
I mean, this option sounds fine, but there may be a better cost-effective option we should pursue, and I want to make sure that we look at all of those.

1038
01:48:52,144 --> 01:48:52,544
Thank you.

1039
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:54,205
Member McLaughlin, then Member Russo.

1040
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,381
Yes, thank you, Mr Murphy, for putting this together.

1041
01:48:58,401 --> 01:49:00,722
I appreciate the time you've taken to meet with me on this as well.

1042
01:49:02,302 --> 01:49:10,906
I would love to know, I guess one thing was, I understand that in the past, teachers have been funding some of these passes.

1043
01:49:10,966 --> 01:49:11,566
Is that right?

1044
01:49:12,466 --> 01:49:19,869
I know that there are, there have been some situations in which teachers have put together some essentially private efforts to

1045
01:49:20,618 --> 01:49:25,640
to fundraise and make sure that some students are provided with those.

1046
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:36,343
And certainly that's something that's a testimony to, or it attests to their extent to which they care about their students in a very comprehensive fashion.

1047
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:44,926
I think everyone also understands that that's not a prudent long-term strategy for providing transportation.

1048
01:49:44,966 --> 01:49:48,787
It's that it's not a responsibility that we ever could expect of teachers.

1049
01:49:49,947 --> 01:49:55,648
you know, that that extra effort and extra funding could be going toward other needs that that students have.

1050
01:49:55,668 --> 01:50:00,509
And I'm sure that that is, I know that, frankly, that's what some of those student teachers would prefer.

1051
01:50:01,869 --> 01:50:06,210
It is a significant potential financial commitment on the part of the district.

1052
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:10,811
So it's also not something that we could do, I think, without looking at, as Ms.

1053
01:50:10,851 --> 01:50:18,292
Graham points out, the broader budgetary context, and make sure that we consider all the potential options and sort of what is the specific objective.

1054
01:50:19,325 --> 01:50:21,426
that we would be looking to achieve with that.

1055
01:50:21,466 --> 01:50:23,747
But yes, I mean, certainly there have been teachers that have done that.

1056
01:50:24,148 --> 01:50:27,149
I do believe there have been some other outside organizations that have done that.

1057
01:50:27,349 --> 01:50:44,437
And we don't want this to be, we don't want any students' ability to bring in $300 in the course of the school year to preclude them either from being able to get to school easily or move around the community and experience some of those experiential learning opportunities.

1058
01:50:44,477 --> 01:50:47,719
So that's why we have to take a look at this, but I think,

1059
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:52,451
the underlying point of the question is like, that's not a good long term plan.

1060
01:50:52,931 --> 01:50:53,852
We certainly agree with that.

1061
01:50:54,752 --> 01:50:56,132
Thank you.

1062
01:50:56,793 --> 01:51:00,794
So Mayor, may I get in the queue again after Member Russo for a follow up?

1063
01:51:02,094 --> 01:51:03,034
Or however you want to do that.

1064
01:51:07,196 --> 01:51:08,256
Did we lose the mayor again?

1065
01:51:08,296 --> 01:51:08,876
I think we did.

1066
01:51:12,277 --> 01:51:18,462
Yes, let's see, member Rousseau, and then I'd like to get, we do have a hand raised by Leticia Rocha.

1067
01:51:19,302 --> 01:51:20,663
So member Rousseau.

1068
01:51:21,724 --> 01:51:25,387
Thank you.

1069
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:37,035
When I talked earlier about like the budget we actually need, this is a prime example of something that without any question should just be in the budget.

1070
01:51:38,176 --> 01:51:40,278
The word free is literally, I think,

1071
01:51:41,117 --> 01:51:44,499
almost all legislation around a public education.

1072
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,961
And it's also a joke.

1073
01:51:47,721 --> 01:51:48,422
It's actually a joke.

1074
01:51:48,442 --> 01:51:55,046
It costs literally hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year to send your kid to free public school every year per child.

1075
01:51:56,687 --> 01:52:06,833
And so, and I think of that as a failure of society, frankly, but also perhaps a failure of us to just imagine that schools should actually be free.

1076
01:52:07,634 --> 01:52:09,475
It seems so obvious.

1077
01:52:11,487 --> 01:52:24,531
awful to have to say it, but so, you know, when we talk about the budget and we talk about building a budget that's bigger than our allocation, I don't know why this wouldn't have just been on the list.

1078
01:52:25,012 --> 01:52:28,133
Of course, we're going to provide kids a way to get to school.

1079
01:52:29,773 --> 01:52:40,657
If some kids just didn't show up to school because of this in a course of a year, if just 10 or 20 kids didn't, how much money would the public have spent on courts and

1080
01:52:41,448 --> 01:52:49,693
And, you know, officers to go to their houses and like all of that stuff will add up to more than $350,000 pretty easily.

1081
01:52:50,814 --> 01:52:56,958
So I certainly think never grams point about like looking at this in the context of the actual transportation budget.

1082
01:52:57,218 --> 01:53:00,340
And is there an opportunity to make this number smaller?

1083
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:05,083
I mean, I am not looking to spend all the money that we can possibly spend.

1084
01:53:05,123 --> 01:53:10,907
That's not my goal, but getting kids to school should be part of

1085
01:53:11,651 --> 01:53:12,731
a free public education.

1086
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:23,273
So I really appreciate that you did the numbers on this because they're actually even bigger than the numbers I had come up with on my own.

1087
01:53:23,994 --> 01:53:40,337
But I think we need to solve this and hopefully soon, and it seems like a good time to do it because we can build a budget these next three years that show the public, the residents of Medford, the taxpayers,

1088
01:53:40,774 --> 01:53:44,937
This is what your public school system can provide if we have the resources.

1089
01:53:46,077 --> 01:53:56,204
And it's a heck of a good way to also market it at the time to say, look, if we can't get more revenue from wherever, this is the list of things we're taking away from your kids.

1090
01:53:57,365 --> 01:54:05,390
I mean, that's, you know, we talk about what we're not gonna give them, what we don't talk about, but if we are giving it to them,

1091
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:19,174
so that they can actually get to school and they don't have to have six-figure incomes in their houses to be able to do the things that we think of as part of school.

1092
01:54:19,354 --> 01:54:25,415
It's a lot harder, Phil, to swallow to tell people, we're gonna take this away from hundreds or thousands of kids.

1093
01:54:26,056 --> 01:54:29,697
And I think that that's a motivation we should put on the taxpayers.

1094
01:54:30,137 --> 01:54:30,757
So thank you.

1095
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:44,406
Yes, may I call on Leticia Roca, please?

1096
01:54:45,448 --> 01:54:46,289
Leticia, are you there?

1097
01:54:47,011 --> 01:54:48,233
Can you unmute yourself?

1098
01:54:52,861 --> 01:54:53,722
Hi, can you hear me?

1099
01:54:54,162 --> 01:54:54,362
Yes.

1100
01:54:55,142 --> 01:54:55,483
Okay.

1101
01:54:55,963 --> 01:55:05,949
So I see that Mr. Murphy has discussed the discounted MBTA passes for disadvantaged high school students, which he's not even optimistic about.

1102
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:10,052
And I'm here to state that this measure is simply not enough.

1103
01:55:10,952 --> 01:55:19,258
It's honestly shameful that the administration thinks that this is even close to providing relief to families who struggle to get their children to school on a daily basis.

1104
01:55:20,058 --> 01:55:35,829
Maybe this issue has been shoved to the back burner during the pandemic, but since the expectation is that school will be functioning as normally as possible in the next school year, the matter of equitable, and I mean equitable transportation for high schoolers, needs to be addressed now.

1105
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:43,975
All high school students should have access to yellow buses, not only those that live in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhood of North Medford.

1106
01:55:44,655 --> 01:56:00,870
Medford's history has made it so this city is incredibly segregated, and I'm fully aware that North Medford is provided with yellow buses because there technically aren't any MBTA stops in this area, but this is really just an excuse the school administration uses over and over not to address the issue.

1107
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:08,977
You continue to provide resources to an area where most residents have the systemic supports, advantages, and privileges to get to school without an issue.

1108
01:56:09,698 --> 01:56:14,579
The MBTA is not a reliable or safe mode of transportation for our high schoolers.

1109
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:26,403
There are many students in South Medford, which is a much more racially and economically diverse population than North Medford, who struggle to get to school on time because the MBTA is completely unreliable.

1110
01:56:27,023 --> 01:56:29,383
When students come in late repeatedly, what happens to them?

1111
01:56:29,944 --> 01:56:37,826
Well, because they have no other options than to use the MBTA, they're given detentions over and over, which leads to eventual suspension.

1112
01:56:38,706 --> 01:56:44,383
And we all know that these kinds of disciplinary actions directly impact students' chances to pursue a college education.

1113
01:56:45,106 --> 01:56:51,131
So since this district likes to claim that they value equity so much that we are one Medford, right?

1114
01:56:51,431 --> 01:56:58,736
Then they must find a way to provide yellow school buses to all high school students that need it, particularly those that live over two miles from the school.

1115
01:56:59,297 --> 01:57:09,464
You can't claim to value equity without providing all students with the opportunity to get to school with a reliable and safe form of transport, which has shown time and again to be yellow school buses.

1116
01:57:09,905 --> 01:57:12,547
We need action and not performative gestures.

1117
01:57:13,488 --> 01:57:13,788
Thank you.

1118
01:57:15,826 --> 01:57:16,146
Thank you.

1119
01:57:16,186 --> 01:57:18,947
I see the mayor is back, so I'll hand the reins back to the mayor.

1120
01:57:21,647 --> 01:57:22,687
You need to unmute yourself.

1121
01:57:24,087 --> 01:57:24,327
I know.

1122
01:57:24,367 --> 01:57:25,688
I just need to catch my bearings.

1123
01:57:25,908 --> 01:57:26,708
Where are we?

1124
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:27,988
I apologize.

1125
01:57:29,788 --> 01:57:33,429
We were discussing the transportation for high school students.

1126
01:57:35,369 --> 01:57:36,590
And I'm in the queue, Mayor.

1127
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,330
Member McLaughlin, I think.

1128
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:43,131
Yes, Melanie would be next.

1129
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:44,711
Member McLaughlin.

1130
01:57:45,478 --> 01:57:47,259
Thank you, Mayor.

1131
01:57:47,779 --> 01:57:53,643
Yeah, I was going to say regarding the budget meeting, thank you for folks that mentioned that.

1132
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:55,927
Mr. Murphy, thank you for this report.

1133
01:57:56,288 --> 01:58:01,729
I think that the information we need is really important for the transportation budget meeting so that we have it.

1134
01:58:01,809 --> 01:58:18,054
And so I would ask that it be disaggregated so that we have both the, I know that you gave us the numbers, but I'd love to know how many economically disadvantaged at the high school if we do that initially, or if we do all.

1135
01:58:18,234 --> 01:58:20,455
So those numbers specifically would be really helpful.

1136
01:58:20,895 --> 01:58:34,122
And then I would also like to know which students, if possible, which students are actually outside of a two-mile radius, if there are any, because I know that the law requires us to provide transportation to students outside of a two-mile radius, if I'm not mistaken.

1137
01:58:34,202 --> 01:58:36,643
I was under the impression that that was required.

1138
01:58:36,683 --> 01:58:47,068
So I was also told when I asked this question in the past that we didn't have students that were beyond a two-mile radius or that for those that we did, transportation was being provided.

1139
01:58:47,108 --> 01:58:48,889
So I would just love that

1140
01:58:50,153 --> 01:58:52,334
issue addressed through the budget meeting.

1141
01:58:52,394 --> 01:58:56,637
And if I'm wrong around the legal requirements that that be addressed as well.

1142
01:58:56,677 --> 01:59:03,981
And clearly we all know from McKinney-Vento students, which are homeless students, we are required to provide transportation for those students.

1143
01:59:04,021 --> 01:59:09,945
So I know that you put them on there, but that is clearly also a legal requirement.

1144
01:59:09,965 --> 01:59:17,970
So I guess my question is for the budget hearing on the transportation where we will have this topic, can we please have the disaggregated data

1145
01:59:18,410 --> 01:59:24,855
on these numbers to include any student population beyond a two-mile radius.

1146
01:59:25,635 --> 01:59:34,742
So the three disaggregated pieces would be economically disadvantaged at the high school, total at the high school, and any students outside of a two-mile radius.

1147
01:59:34,902 --> 01:59:36,803
If that would be acceptable, I would appreciate it.

1148
01:59:36,823 --> 01:59:38,724
No problem.

1149
01:59:39,225 --> 01:59:40,085
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1150
01:59:44,829 --> 01:59:45,309
Sounds great.

1151
01:59:45,609 --> 01:59:46,410
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1152
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:49,262
Number eight, we have any old business?

1153
01:59:49,702 --> 01:59:50,403
I don't believe so.

1154
01:59:50,423 --> 01:59:53,725
Number nine, communications.

1155
01:59:56,288 --> 01:59:57,469
Number 10, new business.

1156
01:59:57,649 --> 01:59:59,470
We have number one, resolutions.

1157
01:59:59,490 --> 01:59:59,810
Mayor?

1158
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:01,152
Yes, member.

1159
02:00:01,272 --> 02:00:04,774
Number one was on our agenda and approved last week.

1160
02:00:04,855 --> 02:00:07,557
So I think it was just left there in error.

1161
02:00:07,757 --> 02:00:08,878
We can move on to number two.

1162
02:00:10,099 --> 02:00:11,560
Best news I've heard all night.

1163
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:12,261
Thank you.

1164
02:00:15,683 --> 02:00:30,788
Skipping page three then, we're on to number two, whereas the current school committee policy, GCA professional staff position states, all professional staff positions in the school system will be created initially by the school committee.

1165
02:00:31,328 --> 02:00:38,450
Is this committee's intent to activate a sufficient number of positions to accomplish the school system's goals and objectives?

1166
02:00:39,017 --> 02:00:42,940
to provide for the equitable staffing of each school building.

1167
02:00:43,501 --> 02:00:50,226
Although such positions may remain temporarily unfilled, only the school committee may abolish a position it has created.

1168
02:00:50,887 --> 02:01:02,857
Each time a new position is established by the committee, the superintendent will present for the committee's approval a job description for the position, which specifies the job holder's qualifications and the job's performance responsibilities.

1169
02:01:03,397 --> 02:01:07,881
The superintendent will maintain a comprehensive set of job descriptions for all positions.

1170
02:01:08,753 --> 02:01:14,515
Note job descriptions for professional staff positions that are available for review in the office of the superintendent.

1171
02:01:15,395 --> 02:01:27,319
Be it resolved that the school committee amends policy GCA, professional staff positions, to ensure transparency, relevancy, and accountability across all professional staff functions.

1172
02:01:30,761 --> 02:01:35,202
All professional staff positions in the school system will be created initially by the school committee.

1173
02:01:35,822 --> 02:01:37,983
Is the committee's intent to activate a sufficient

1174
02:01:38,765 --> 02:01:44,268
number of positions to accomplish the school system's goals and objectives, and to provide for the equitable staffing of each school building.

1175
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:50,711
Professional staff is defined as the department head, central office staff, nursing, or nursing.

1176
02:01:51,311 --> 02:01:55,413
Superintendent will maintain a comprehensive list of positions and a set of job descriptions for all positions.

1177
02:01:56,025 --> 02:02:00,369
All job descriptions will be reviewed every three years and presented to the school committee for approval.

1178
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:03,172
Job descriptions will contain a last review date.

1179
02:02:03,972 --> 02:02:09,677
Superintendent will establish a review cycle for all positions descriptions within 60 days of the adoption of this policy.

1180
02:02:10,478 --> 02:02:14,462
The initial review cycle will last for no longer than three years and conclude by September 1st, 2024.

1181
02:02:16,606 --> 02:02:25,732
Effective September 1st, 2021, the comprehensive list and current job descriptions for professional staff positions are available for review by the public on the Metro Public Schools website.

1182
02:02:26,712 --> 02:02:39,481
Each time a new position is established by the committee, the superintendent will present for the committee's approval a job description for the position, which specifies the job holder's qualifications and the job's performance responsibilities.

1183
02:02:40,341 --> 02:02:46,005
Although such positions may remain temporarily unfilled, only the committee may abolish the position it has created.

1184
02:02:46,957 --> 02:02:54,199
All positions unfilled for the entire school year will be reported to the committee annually no later than June 1st with an explanation for the vacancy.

1185
02:02:55,119 --> 02:03:00,781
All positions that remain unfilled for more than two consecutive years will be presented to the committee to be abolished no later than June 1st.

1186
02:03:01,321 --> 02:03:14,625
In the event the superintendent wishes to maintain any positions that have been unfilled for more than two consecutive school years, the superintendent must explain the rationale and plan to fill the position and get approval from the committee to continue the unfilled position for an additional year.

1187
02:03:15,563 --> 02:03:17,144
offered by member Graham and member Russo.

1188
02:03:17,164 --> 02:03:19,545
I will turn it over to you.

1189
02:03:20,326 --> 02:03:20,666
Thanks.

1190
02:03:21,446 --> 02:03:32,332
So I actually was asked by a member of the community about which person in the district did a certain thing.

1191
02:03:32,792 --> 02:03:39,496
And it got me sort of wondering about our official job descriptions, which I wasn't able to put my hands on.

1192
02:03:40,297 --> 02:03:43,158
But I did go and look for our policy because I knew that we had one.

1193
02:03:43,638 --> 02:03:44,679
And it struck me that it was

1194
02:03:45,809 --> 02:04:04,197
very outdated and doesn't reflect what I would consider to be best practice around roles and responsibilities, making sure that we are evolving positions as education changes and shifts as is just typical in any job.

1195
02:04:04,997 --> 02:04:12,560
And I wanted to put this forward as a recommendation to this policy because it was

1196
02:04:13,413 --> 02:04:14,954
on my mind at that time.

1197
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:37,482
And I think just overall focusing on best practice and hygiene will really benefit the students ultimately, but all of us in the clarity of who is responsible for what, which allows the administration to hold staff accountable to their roles and provides clarity and transparency for the community.

1198
02:04:40,543 --> 02:04:40,844
Thank you.

1199
02:04:40,904 --> 02:04:41,844
Anything to add member Rousseau?

1200
02:04:43,323 --> 02:04:45,143
and then move it to approve?

1201
02:04:46,044 --> 02:04:54,586
I had some questions about, first of all, there's a timeline September 1st for comprehensive lists and current job description.

1202
02:04:54,826 --> 02:05:04,568
And I just wanted to understand whether that was realistic given all the demands of going in right now.

1203
02:05:04,588 --> 02:05:09,309
So I was just curious about that from central administration, what their reaction to that is.

1204
02:05:10,189 --> 02:05:11,810
I'm a little concerned, I find this,

1205
02:05:13,738 --> 02:05:21,444
in many ways pretty confusing and very prescriptive.

1206
02:05:23,486 --> 02:05:29,110
I'm sort of wondering if there's a way we can simplify it to make it more accessible.

1207
02:05:36,514 --> 02:05:43,796
If I may, from the chair, I don't disagree with you about it being a bit confusing, although I agree with the premise of making sure.

1208
02:05:43,816 --> 02:05:45,357
Yeah, I agree with the premise of that.

1209
02:05:45,397 --> 02:05:46,257
They're updated.

1210
02:05:47,157 --> 02:05:57,780
But I also agree that we should probably ask the administration a reasonable timeframe, because we're doing this on the city side, trying to update all job descriptions, and it does take some time.

1211
02:05:59,481 --> 02:05:59,781
Mayor?

1212
02:06:00,601 --> 02:06:01,942
Member Graham, then Mr. Murphy.

1213
02:06:02,862 --> 02:06:05,883
So the only thing by September 1st was a list.

1214
02:06:07,392 --> 02:06:07,652
That's it.

1215
02:06:08,673 --> 02:06:12,277
That was really, and that they be posted to the NPS website.

1216
02:06:13,838 --> 02:06:28,212
I recognize that A, you don't want to be revising everybody's job all at the same time because it becomes an implementation problem if you are in a position of having to make changes at any given time to some number of positions.

1217
02:06:28,792 --> 02:06:43,740
So you want to, you don't want to big bang, the changes or the review of every job description in the house at the same time, which is why I provided for like a three year like roll in of the first iteration of this.

1218
02:06:44,607 --> 02:07:00,290
with at least in my head, I would do that so that on an annual basis, there's some number of job descriptions that the committee is revising or saying is okay without it ever being like a process where we're looking at every single one at the same time.

1219
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:11,532
So to me, providing a list of the job descriptions that the community pays for as part of the school district should not be,

1220
02:07:14,773 --> 02:07:19,516
prohibitive, which I think is the only ask by September of this year.

1221
02:07:20,176 --> 02:07:33,364
And then really providing a three-year ramp in to a good cadence of hygiene around how we hold our senior staff accountable makes a lot of sense.

1222
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:43,309
And I think at that point, you have the ability to do it in manageable chunks and to execute on change.

1223
02:07:45,573 --> 02:08:00,324
and you never get into a position where job descriptions are widely outdated, staff, and I'm not saying this happens here, but it happens all over the place, say, that's not in my job description and I'm not going to do it and what have you.

1224
02:08:00,424 --> 02:08:14,254
So making sure that we have good structures in place in terms of policy from this committee so that the administration has our support as those changes are made and there's an expectation that it'd be done frequently, I think is to me pretty important.

1225
02:08:17,767 --> 02:08:18,788
Member van de Kloot.

1226
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:21,450
Well, let me see.

1227
02:08:21,630 --> 02:08:29,676
I was going to say Kathy's had her hand raised.

1228
02:08:30,196 --> 02:08:38,142
I had the same concerns about the date where, you know, going back to school, the first day of school starts, I believe I just saw on the calendar.

1229
02:08:38,942 --> 02:08:42,825
I think it was like August 30th or it could be August 31st.

1230
02:08:43,625 --> 02:08:47,067
I'm thinking that we're just getting the kids ready to get back in school.

1231
02:08:47,187 --> 02:08:57,493
It's teacher induction week and it just seems the timing, the date, September 1st, seems a little bit too close to the start of school.

1232
02:08:58,274 --> 02:09:01,436
I also wanted to ask the superintendent or the administration,

1233
02:09:02,276 --> 02:09:20,662
if they felt that date was doable, you know, even just to get the comprehensive list, which will still maybe take some time where they're working throughout the summer, getting everything ready for back to school and getting the kids back to school, you know, for the beginning of the fall.

1234
02:09:23,823 --> 02:09:24,163
Mayor?

1235
02:09:24,183 --> 02:09:27,844
Yeah, I just wanted to say,

1236
02:09:29,742 --> 02:09:35,328
Hearing what Member Graham was saying, she wanted a list of the job descriptions added.

1237
02:09:36,989 --> 02:09:39,652
I agree with the comments that have been said thus far.

1238
02:09:40,793 --> 02:09:50,543
With the September 1st deadline, that will be right at the same time with potentially onboarding last-minute hires, but

1239
02:09:52,705 --> 02:09:56,967
from an accountability perspective to know what the jobs are and the job descriptions.

1240
02:09:58,428 --> 02:10:00,750
We definitely have, you know, nothing to hide.

1241
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:01,670
We want to have that.

1242
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:03,331
We're in compliance with DESE.

1243
02:10:05,212 --> 02:10:14,517
But I guess I'm just thinking we have a completely different platform called Frontline, which is where people apply for jobs.

1244
02:10:14,858 --> 02:10:19,100
And we, you know, our HR wing of the district

1245
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,422
uses the frontline system.

1246
02:10:22,062 --> 02:10:27,607
And so where you were saying that you also wanted something added to the website.

1247
02:10:28,368 --> 02:10:37,855
I was actually going to be asking for greater clarity, because I do think it's, I think it's something if it's just giving you a list of jobs that were posted.

1248
02:10:39,243 --> 02:10:49,808
I think that may be able to be doable, but I just think at this particular point in time, it's gonna be a tremendous lift on our human resources department.

1249
02:10:49,968 --> 02:10:55,831
And I know Mr. Murphy probably could speak to that as well.

1250
02:10:56,451 --> 02:11:06,316
The amount of stress that will happen just to get school started smoothly and how much activity takes place on the 1st of September.

1251
02:11:08,313 --> 02:11:11,074
We don't really feel stressed down at the center of the building.

1252
02:11:11,114 --> 02:11:12,554
We don't even know what that means.

1253
02:11:12,655 --> 02:11:23,778
But beyond that, what I would say is, Mayor, I promise it's only one slide, but if I could just show the org chart that we developed at the beginning of the year.

1254
02:11:23,818 --> 02:11:32,181
I just want to say, I think this is a really important thing that we as an organization have to do and have to do soon.

1255
02:11:32,861 --> 02:11:35,782
So Ms.

1256
02:11:35,802 --> 02:11:37,363
Graham and the superintendent used

1257
02:11:38,197 --> 02:11:41,478
slightly different phrases, and I just want to get clarity as to what the intention here.

1258
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:53,622
If the idea is a list of the jobs, then I personally, I don't have a problem with September 1st if it's a list of the jobs.

1259
02:11:54,422 --> 02:11:59,744
If it's a collection of job descriptions, even ones that, to Ms.

1260
02:11:59,764 --> 02:12:02,645
Graham's point, are antiquated and need to be adjusted,

1261
02:12:03,497 --> 02:12:10,680
September 1st is not realistic in part because we're going to have obligations to confer with bargaining partners in many instances.

1262
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:19,483
And we're just not going to be able to dictate that short of a timeline while we're also involved in negotiations.

1263
02:12:19,964 --> 02:12:21,604
So that would be my only hesitancy.

1264
02:12:22,024 --> 02:12:23,965
This has to get done and it has to get done soon.

1265
02:12:24,866 --> 02:12:30,668
The goal of this org chart is to eventually get to a place where by clicking on any of these departments or positions,

1266
02:12:31,092 --> 02:12:34,433
you're getting to both sub org charts and ultimately to job descriptions.

1267
02:12:34,753 --> 02:12:40,896
And then obviously we'll have a centralized list too for people that like, you know, the centralized list that that's another format that would be necessary.

1268
02:12:40,956 --> 02:12:44,377
But this is absolutely a shared priority and something that we have to get to.

1269
02:12:45,578 --> 02:12:59,063
And again, if it's, if it's a list of jobs, we can, we can accommodate that, you know, October 1st would probably be better than September 1st, just because of the opening of school and because there may be there's oftentimes there are roles

1270
02:12:59,530 --> 02:13:06,234
that are tweaked or changed just as school is beginning and we recognize where there are gaps that have to be filled.

1271
02:13:06,254 --> 02:13:25,747
So I'd probably recommend a little bit later just for the list, but ultimately we have to get to a place where you can, any member of the community can very easily go to the org chart, click on an area of the organization, see how the organization is structured and ultimately get to the individual job description for each position.

1272
02:13:25,847 --> 02:13:26,167
And that is,

1273
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:33,121
absolutely an objective that we have and one that it's my hope that we'll be able to achieve in the coming months.

1274
02:13:33,201 --> 02:13:37,683
But I'm not, I don't see a problem with just a list of the jobs.

1275
02:13:38,203 --> 02:13:43,144
I just think for, so that we don't have to amend it two weeks later, I would say, let's do it for October 1st.

1276
02:13:48,005 --> 02:13:51,426
Member Rousseau, then Member Vandekloot, did you?

1277
02:13:52,801 --> 02:13:53,681
Thank you, Mayor.

1278
02:13:54,522 --> 02:14:00,684
I'd just like to, again, motion to approve as amended with the amendment to move the date to October 1st.

1279
02:14:02,925 --> 02:14:03,965
Member Van de Kloet?

1280
02:14:04,765 --> 02:14:06,306
Yes, and I would second that.

1281
02:14:06,486 --> 02:14:08,687
I'm also just gonna throw out one thing.

1282
02:14:09,867 --> 02:14:17,150
So, you know, I just, the terminology, professional staff, what, the rest of our staff is unprofessional?

1283
02:14:18,988 --> 02:14:20,369
There may be no way around it.

1284
02:14:20,389 --> 02:14:25,131
It may just be the common thing, but I'm just going to mention it to say to me, it just sounds so funny.

1285
02:14:25,791 --> 02:14:36,375
It might be worth amending to permanent staff with permanent being defined as not a temporary position we created to fill some gap for a three month period.

1286
02:14:36,795 --> 02:14:45,519
And I don't think it'd be necessarily we should be running to the school committee to say that we have someone filling in three days a week to bridge a managerial gap.

1287
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:47,960
We may have an existing

1288
02:14:48,782 --> 02:14:51,502
temporary worker type position.

1289
02:14:51,522 --> 02:15:00,324
But I think the idea is it's a position that is not specific to a sort of a discrete project that's going to be completed.

1290
02:15:00,484 --> 02:15:06,245
It is the positions with the type of durability that you would expect to be there until the needs of the organization change.

1291
02:15:08,005 --> 02:15:12,466
And Mayor, the nomenclature actually comes from the existing policy.

1292
02:15:12,486 --> 02:15:13,566
Yeah, I know.

1293
02:15:13,826 --> 02:15:17,507
And I was making an assumption that it was important because it

1294
02:15:19,554 --> 02:15:21,055
seemed like an odd word to me too.

1295
02:15:21,175 --> 02:15:25,078
So if it's not important, I think permanent is fine.

1296
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:36,125
And to that point, I mean, I don't, I don't know if I'm missing a part on my sheet, but it just says defined as department head, central staff, nursing, and the sentence is incomplete.

1297
02:15:36,726 --> 02:15:39,548
So I wouldn't even know what the rest entails.

1298
02:15:39,808 --> 02:15:41,449
That should just probably be a period.

1299
02:15:41,469 --> 02:15:43,911
Oh, with an and.

1300
02:15:48,168 --> 02:15:59,215
Okay, so motion for approval by Member Russo as amended to October 1st, 2021 for a comprehensive list and a list of the current job descriptions.

1301
02:16:00,555 --> 02:16:04,938
Seconded by Member Van de Kloot, roll call.

1302

1352

of out-of-school suspensions policy, C, the focus on hiring and recruitment of BIPOC candidates to teaching and administrative positions, as well as maintaining our current BIPOC staff members.

1353
02:16:59,759 --> 02:17:03,941
I request that the letter be entered into the record and would like to read the letter in its entirety.

1354
02:17:04,121 --> 02:17:05,882
Offered by member Paul Russo.

1355
02:17:08,204 --> 02:17:08,704
Thank you, Mayor.

1356
02:17:09,994 --> 02:17:16,795
So yeah, so we received this, well, the mayor's office received this letter on March 16th, and I will just read the letter.

1357
02:17:17,195 --> 02:17:20,416
Dear members of the Medford School Committee, and then it lists us all.

1358
02:17:21,136 --> 02:17:33,138
The Education Committee of the Mississippi Valley NAACP would like to express its appreciation for the June 2020 decision of the Medford School Committee to erase and replace the name of Columbus from the Columbus School.

1359
02:17:33,658 --> 02:17:36,919
The Education Committee agrees that Columbus is cruel, barbaric,

1360
02:17:37,357 --> 02:17:41,978
treatment of indigenous people disqualifies Columbus from being honored in this way.

1361
02:17:42,418 --> 02:17:53,360
We applaud the democratic search process that has been established to find a more appropriate name for the school, once called the Mystic School in honor of the mystic tribe who inhabited Medford before the colonial period.

1362
02:17:54,121 --> 02:18:01,162
The education committee also lauds the school committee for the unanimous passage of the resolution eliminating out of school suspensions.

1363
02:18:01,762 --> 02:18:05,883
For years, this destructive policy has disproportionately victimized black children,

1364
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:08,681
and other children of color and special needs children.

1365
02:18:09,322 --> 02:18:15,786
Medford's in-school alternatives and mandatory education is positive and welcome evidence of progress in the right direction.

1366
02:18:16,406 --> 02:18:30,615
In addition, we understand that there's a commitment to recruit and maintain black, indigenous and other people of color who will more accurately reflect the increasingly diverse Medford community as administrators and teachers and that school staff have received anti-racist trainings.

1367
02:18:31,396 --> 02:18:35,158
The success of these initiatives will improve educational equity

1368
02:18:36,115 --> 02:18:52,989
While the evaluation of the clothing code has taken a backseat to the COVID-19 crisis, we trust that the Medford School Committee will, when possible, review and revise the clothing code to avoid the discrimination Black students and students of color identified at the Duggar Park rally last summer.

1369
02:18:53,209 --> 02:19:05,499
Sincerely, the Mystic Valley NAACP Education Committee, Eileen Lerner, Regina Caines, Wendy Cliggett, Pearl Morrison, Vincent Dixon, Erga Pierret,

1370
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:10,470
Susan Girard, Jillian Harvey, and Greg Bartlett.

1371
02:19:12,832 --> 02:19:13,172
Thank you.

1372
02:19:16,013 --> 02:19:16,934
Thank you, Member Rousseau.

1373
02:19:21,336 --> 02:19:30,321
Number four, as required by Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 38M, that the school committee must designate a student outreach coordinator.

1374
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:31,602
The school committee

1375
02:19:31,984 --> 02:19:41,812
hereby designates Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education for Metro Public Schools to the role of Student Outreach Coordinator, offered by Member Russo.

1376
02:19:43,353 --> 02:19:43,713
Member Russo.

1377
02:19:43,914 --> 02:19:44,634
Yes, Mayor.

1378
02:19:45,175 --> 02:19:45,515
Thank you.

1379
02:19:45,575 --> 02:19:56,163
I don't think there's too much to say other than this is in the statute and is related to integration of the student representatives and holding elections for student representatives.

1380
02:19:57,504 --> 02:20:00,547
So that's why I put this forward and I hope that

1381
02:20:01,053 --> 02:20:04,916
Dr. Edward Vincent doesn't mind that I picked somebody on her staff without actually having talked to her.

1382
02:20:06,217 --> 02:20:10,840
But he seemed like the right candidate considering his role in secondary, so.

1383
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:12,161
Motion to approve.

1384
02:20:13,301 --> 02:20:13,621

1408
02:21:23,005 --> 02:21:25,267
If we all may take a moment of silence.

1409
02:21:34,838 --> 02:21:35,198
