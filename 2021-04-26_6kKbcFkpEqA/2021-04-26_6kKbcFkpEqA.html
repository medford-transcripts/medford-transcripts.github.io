    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=270.332s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=271.452s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=273.133s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=274.113s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=275.613s">Approval</a>  of payrolls has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=281.775s">We</a>  have report of secretary number one, good of the order offered by member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=287.498s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=289.459s">The</a>  good of the order is a category under Robert's Rules of Orders that we had voted in earlier in the year, essentially at our first meeting of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=299.638s">And</a>  I think on occasion, it's been dropped, but moving forward, I would ask that it is included on the first meeting of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=305.124s">And</a>  generally, it is to check in with the school committee as a group, as a whole, to check in on the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=314.754s">Essentially,</a>  how are things going? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=316.115s">Are</a>  things going well? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=317.617s">Are</a>  there things that folks feel we need work on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=322.681s">you</a>  know, are the meeting scheduling's going fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=325.662s">Like,</a>  it's an opportunity for the committee to offer up anything they have, both positive or, you know, things that need to be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=335.964s">So</a>  that's the good of the order.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=339.685s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=340.946s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=342.726s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=343.606s">I</a>  appreciate the good of the order today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=345.707s">I</a>  would just like to suggest that we all take a refresher course on Robert's Rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=352.174s">We</a>  typically allow members to speak for as long as they want to speak, which is actually a violation of Robert's rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=358.119s">We</a>  don't let everybody have turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=360.901s">Some</a>  members will ask six or seven questions in a row, leaving the other members who may have had questions to sit there silently and look like they had nothing to say, which looks bad for those of us that came with a set of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=372.649s">So</a>  I think as a committee, we can do an awful lot better at acting like a committee instead of as individuals approaching an election.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=384.085s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=385.025s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=386.706s">Yes,</a>  I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=393.007s">Like</a>  a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=400.65s">I</a>  think it might be more engaging for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=405.371s">The</a>  other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=413.906s">We</a>  had something like 23 meetings in the in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=418.451s">I</a>  think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=430.922s">of</a>  doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=437.863s">And</a>  I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=455.947s">And</a>  I agree with you member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=457.587s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=460.148s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=460.688s">I</a>  think these are, you know, both through the chair, my colleagues I think these are both things that have been talked about, certainly, you know, individually or amongst less than a quorum with folks over time so I think these are both items that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=478.635s">Training</a>  and Roberts rules of order is, you know, highly recommended it's a really important, it's what how we operate and how we run and, you know, I know when I came on as a new school committee member there was no orientation there was no indication of how to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=491.815s">We</a>  had to seek out training and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=494.038s">I</a>  know MASC has an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=496.36s">I</a>  don't know how many folks have gone and you know I went to it that one time pre pandemic and learn some things certainly there but I think a course in Roberts Rules of Order is definitely in order and I would also say we've talked about the length of our meetings in the past and there has been some conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=512.697s">you</a>  know, more frequently meetings for less time and folks sort of tend to say that they think that that would just mean more frequent meetings that are longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=519.981s">So</a>  they don't necessarily wanna do that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=521.542s">I</a>  don't know what the answer is there, but I think that clearly when we have to go two, sometimes three weeks in between talking to each other, it makes it very difficult because the items on the agenda get longer and longer, understandably. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=535.069s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=535.43s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=538.871s">I</a>  know we have our student rep <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=540.252s">Mr.</a>  Colin Bailey on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=541.792s">If</a>  you have anything to add, please jump in.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=544.593s">Yes,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=545.313s">I</a>  forgot, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=547.174s">Our</a>  new rules have asked that we include the student rep in attendance, and I did have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=553.776s">I</a>  actually reached out to Colin Bailey to ensure that he was coming today, and then I get caught up in the roll call, and I apologize that there's the student rep here, so I will add him to the attendance roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=565.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.223s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.523s">Thank</a>  you, member.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.883s">Chris</a>  Oh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=569.925s">Um</a>  I just wanted to say that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=572.887s">And</a>  sometimes I haven't been able to speak at some of the meetings because. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=576.989s">Some</a>  other committee members have gone on to their questions, and I'm looking at the clock and I'm looking at the number of residents that want to speak, and I just you know, I just passed on my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=587.336s">Um</a>  so I you know, it would be helpful if we all you <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=596.101s">Then</a>  before they got to ask their second question, it could go through maybe with some of the other members if they had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=604.928s">In</a>  the past, I have expressed that I'm not in favor of more frequent meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=610.492s">I</a>  know that it sounds like it would be helpful, but I found that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=616.457s">some</a>  of the details in the meetings that we have, they're very comprehensive and meeting every week and doing the minutes and posting the meetings, it's going to ultimately take the same amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=629.225s">And</a>  the administration is just gonna be getting ready for meetings every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=634.308s">So</a>  I'm not in favor of meeting more frequently and adding on more frequent, shorter meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=641.952s">I</a>  just wanted to say that.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=650.294s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=650.594s">I</a>  think the mayor's not here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=655.576s">Maybe</a>  she got booted out by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=661.718s">Will</a>  we go with the vice chair in the meantime?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=663.519s">I</a>  will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=674.423s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=676.758s">through</a>  the chair, I would also agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=678.72s">You</a>  know, I don't want more frequent longer meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=681.382s">I</a>  just want to clarify that I am looking for, you know, I'm hoping that as part of the good of the order, perhaps we can come up with some suggestions of how to how to, you know, make the meetings less than six, eight hours, especially as we're coming into budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=696.038s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=698.888s">So</a>  I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=709.755s">Maybe</a>  a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=717.32s">So</a>  do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=724.024s">Great,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=729.296s">Can</a>  we move on to the next order of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=731.878s">And</a>  I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=737.602s">Because</a>  I don't have it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=741.945s">We</a>  can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=751.67s">Yeah,</a>  I just was gonna say that I had the agenda in front of me as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=754.191s">So</a>  the report of committees, behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting, which is myself for the report and bear with me one second, because I was going between tabs, it's gonna take a second.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=772.307s">while</a>  you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=781.451s">Perhaps</a>  a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=786.893s">And</a>  we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=792.936s">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=794.937s">And</a>  Melanie is going to give her report.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1553.702s">Please</a>  note that orientations will be held for students and their parents or caregivers at the McGlynn Middle School on Wednesday, May 12th from six to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1565.268s">and</a>  at the Andrews Middle School on Thursday, May 13th from six to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1571.812s">More</a>  details to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1574.653s">I'd</a>  also like to announce that Medford Public Schools has temporarily suspended the use of Google Hangouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1582.902s">Due</a>  to some misinformation or cyberbullying and inappropriate exchange of information taking place on Google Hangouts, we have temporarily suspended the use of that platform until we are able to put in additional measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1602.905s">So</a>  the temporary suspension of Google Hangouts is still in place while we are looking for additional security measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1615.433s">Lastly,</a>  I feel I would be remiss if I did not mention the decision in the Derek Chauvin case. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1622.918s">The</a>  jury returned guilty verdicts in the murder of George Floyd, which raises hope that our nation is changing for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1632.484s">According</a>  to a poll conducted by UMass Amherst, it is notable that a solid majority of whites, 56%, supported the verdict. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1645.589s">In</a>  a nation with such a troubled racial history and present, it is extremely rare and perhaps unprecedented that a majority of whites support the conviction of a police officer for the murder of a Black man, said political science professor Jesse Rhodes, who helped conduct the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1668.997s">An</a>  Earth Day quote seems applicable here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1673.652s">We</a>  all share the same mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1676.814s">It</a>  is about time we treat each other like family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1680.456s">I</a>  have said continuously that we are one Medford, one district, the Mustang family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1687.94s">Yet</a>  too often in our world, black and brown lives are devalued. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1693.143s">We</a>  must all understand that no matter the color of one's skin, we are all human. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1700.118s">As</a>  our Vice President Kamala Harris stated after the verdict was read, today we feel a sigh of relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1709.023s">Still,</a>  it cannot take away the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1712.606s">A</a>  measure of justice is not the same as equal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1717.829s">As</a>  your superintendent, as an educator, and most importantly as a mother, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1724.351s">I</a>  have said that change is hard and can be messy, but it is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1729.915s">Conversations</a>  about race and injustice are complicated, but must be had, so the quality of life is improved for us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1740.823s">As</a>  Tyler Perry said last night at the Oscars, let us reject hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1747.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1753.937s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1757.938s">Number</a>  two, we have COVID-19 Public Health Update and Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Testing Summary and Update by Nurse Supervisor Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1765.921s">Toni</a>  Rae, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1767.541s">Marian</a>  O'Connor, Board of Health Director, and Mr. David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1773.323s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1775.264s">I</a>  will provide the data tonight for the City of Medford and the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1780.466s">The</a>  City of Medford, the city is averaging 22.9 positive cases per day as reported on April 22nd, giving us a 1.19% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1792.97s">As</a>  reported by the Medford Board of Health, 25 children less than 19 years old tested positive for COVID-19 <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1801.453s">between</a>  April 18th and April 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1807.096s">In</a>  the Medford Public Schools, school nurses administered 4,684 COVID tests during the week preceding school vacation, three of which were positive, a 0.06% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1824.524s">We</a>  did not administer any tests during school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1829.895s">Testing</a>  resumed today in all schools with 227 pool tests submitted for analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1838.062s">I'd</a>  like to remind staff who received their COVID vaccinations that it is recommended that they continue weekly COVID testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1846.389s">Vaccination</a>  prevents serious illness and hospitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1850.732s">Vaccinated</a>  persons can still get the virus and spread it to others despite not having symptoms themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1860.084s">I</a>  would also like to share a message from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, who sums up the current COVID situation well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1868.587s">She</a>  says, we remain in a complicated stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1872.009s">On</a>  one hand, more people in the United States are being vaccinated every single day at an accelerated pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1878.952s">On</a>  the other hand, cases and hospitalizations are increasing in some areas of the country, and cases among young people who have not yet been vaccinated are also increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1891.705s">Therefore,</a>  I thank all of the parents and the Medford Public School staff who proactively informed the school nurses of their vacation travel plans, provided COVID test results prior to returning to school, and followed the travel advisories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1907.668s">The</a>  good health of our school community depends upon the efforts of all students, families, and staff to follow recommended Department of Public Health COVID guidelines and advisories, including wearing a face mask, avoiding large gatherings, maintaining social distancing, and most importantly, staying home if you feel ill or if a member of your family tests positive for COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1931.297s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1934.138s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1936.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1936.75s">I</a>  also wanted to ask, I know we had the opportunity to speak last week to the chair, Nurse Ray, and I know that it had been mentioned that it'd be helpful to share if we have vaccine information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1949.022s">Do</a>  you want us, is there anything that you're asking for students to do that or not do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1954.927s">Like,</a>  I'm curious.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1956.268s">So</a>  we are recommending that students over the age of 16 be vaccinated as per the current guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1964.331s">Parents</a>  can sign their children up at the MassVax sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1968.432s">I</a>  believe that website was put up on the chat earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1973.294s">And</a>  we encourage all parents to vaccinate their children over 16.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1980.616s">Okay,</a>  and I guess, may I, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1982.576s">I</a>  had a follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1984.479s">So</a>  I guess the question is, shall we send vaccine records to you or to the nursing office if they would like them?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1992.224s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1992.924s">We</a>  would like to keep track of students who have received their COVID vaccines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2001.29s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2002.411s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2002.871s">Ray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2006.653s">Number</a>  three, we have an update on the fiscal year 22 budget presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2010.736s">Mr.</a>  David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2011.697s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2014.254s">I'm</a>  going to share a very brief deck, some of the material you've seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2020.395s">And</a>  that's not to be repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2021.715s">But</a>  as I said in previous budget presentations, because we know that this is a topic of significant interest to the community, we want to be sure that we're being mindful of that and various folks picking up the conversation at various stages throughout the course of the budget development process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2042.537s">We</a>  want to be sure that we're keeping everyone as informed as possible, being as transparent as possible, and answering as many questions as clearly as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2053.845s">There</a>  is some new information in this, or at least some updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2057.888s">And</a>  so at the conclusion, I'll be happy to take any questions that you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2063.952s">One</a>  of the pieces that we've discussed over the course of the last several months, and I know it's been of interest to some members of the committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2070.677s">making</a>  sure that we're keeping track of the sequence that we're following. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2073.679s">And</a>  so this is a simplified version of the flowchart that you saw at a previous budget update in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2080.523s">We're</a>  in basically the top right corner in this timeline right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2084.766s">We've</a>  completed, as stated in a slide or two, about 25 budget internal meetings with our various departments <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2094.399s">and</a>  are moving toward the public meetings that will take place with the committee of the whole over the course of the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2102.143s">This</a>  is a modified version of a table I've shown you in the past related to the sources of funding and the budget development process with the Commonwealth, the city of Medford and the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2112.908s">I've</a>  added this fourth column to the right as I think most people, certainly the committee knows and members of the community are familiar with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2123.569s">sizable</a>  amount of federal funding that will be flowing into cities and towns as well as school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2129.053s">And</a>  so we'll be touching upon that a little bit tonight and the implications for that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2135.398s">This</a>  is an updated timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2137.22s">I</a>  wrote to the committee on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2140.042s">We</a>  had initially planned to begin some of the public committees of the whole meetings this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2147.228s">And</a>  a few things became clear over the course of the last two weeks or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2150.45s">One,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2151.765s">There's</a>  still a significant degree of uncertainty with regard to restrictions around the additional funding that will be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2160.152s">And</a>  the degree to which that has the potential to be intermingled with our operating budget, there's a need for greater clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2169.979s">And</a>  I know because I fielded several questions from members of the committee about how that funding will be used and the sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2180.625s">the</a>  concept of essentially bifurcating the operating budget from the COVID mitigation budget coming directly from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2189.789s">And</a>  we'll talk a little bit about that tonight and what the strategic questions that will be coming before the city and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2197.613s">But</a>  this is an updated timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2199.694s">We</a>  did add one meeting at the end of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2203.256s">We've</a>  tried to keep the dates consistent and we'll be sending calendar invites out <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2208.775s">members</a>  of the committee to make sure that that's built into your calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2211.736s">But</a>  we're thinking right now of a 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2214.797s">start</a>  time to accommodate some of the subcommittee meetings that are scheduled on those days as well earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2220.598s">And</a>  then again, the May 19th date was added because we thought it would be a good idea to have sort of a catch all day in case we run out of time to the priority discussed earlier tonight about trying to keep the meetings more manageable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2237.023s">And</a>  so we have that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2238.262s">as</a>  sort of a placeholder where we'll be able to pick up additional departments that need additional time to present or also for further discussion once the multi-dimensional budget has been presented and hopefully gives the committee the full context to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2256.551s">This</a>  statement with regard to recognizing the one-time influx of funding, that's something that we've discussed before and something that will be sort of a common thread <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2267.287s">as</a>  we get into the strategic considerations related to operating budget versus COVID mitigation funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2275.331s">And</a>  so as we get ready to open FY22, we've tried to keep you as informed as possible with regard to the close of FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2286.156s">This</a>  is not a major change since I presented to you in mid-March. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2294.05s">We're</a>  comfortable with regard to our financial position as we move toward the end of FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2300.153s">I've</a>  said before that given the size of the budget, the sort of best practice target area is to finish somewhere between $100,000 and $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2309.879s">We're</a>  a little above that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2312.34s">There</a>  are reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2313.38s">It</a>  has to do with some of the substantial deficits in the revolving funds that are contingent upon revenue generation, which has been <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2322.448s">significantly</a>  diminished this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2325.649s">There's</a>  also been a few other variables, some COVID related, some sort of typical uncertainties as you go through the course of the fiscal year that have in some cases turned out favorably for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2338.654s">And</a>  so that's what puts us at about a $500,000 cushion for lack of a better term. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2345.696s">That</a>  is not to say we're able to release the current <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2349.321s">partial</a>  spending freeze, we're not in a position to do that because there are a few variables and potential emergency funding issues that we have to, we're keeping a close eye on infrastructure and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2360.446s">And</a>  so essentially we're in a good position, but not overly favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2364.648s">And,</a>  and the main reason for that is again, the food services deficit in particular, which on paper is $730,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2374.033s">I'm</a>  comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2374.593s">I'm</a>  confident that that's going to diminish over the next <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2379.23s">weeks</a>  and potentially a month or so as some unencumbered funds are released and as additional revenue is generated as a result of additional students being in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2391.678s">We</a>  do still have two internal meetings left this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2394.7s">I</a>  expect that those will wrap up by Wednesday or Thursday and we'll be in a good position to begin the public discussions next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2402.285s">In</a>  terms of planning for FY22, we're going to talk about this in a second, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2406.423s">There</a>  are two major sources coming directly to the school district, ESSER 2 and ESSER 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2411.147s">The</a>  ESSER 2 number, that's the 2.3 million that we've discussed previously in the federal legislation that passed at the end of calendar year 2020, and the ESSER 3, which is the subsequent federal legislation that passed last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2426.72s">So</a>  as we get into the spending priorities, all department heads and principals <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2433.097s">with</a>  the exception of that last group that I mentioned a minute ago that will be convening this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2437.199s">But</a>  all principals and all other department heads have been asked to focus on three specific areas with regard to budgetary priorities and how we as an organization can seek to remedy the learning and opportunity gaps that were either caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2454.545s">And</a>  certainly there are priorities that are broader and expand beyond the particular challenges that have been caused by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2461.63s">Generally</a>  speaking, we think of them in these three buckets as materials and infrastructure, personnel, and training and professional development, and all within the context of the significant challenges that students are experiencing as a result of the conditions under which they've gone to school over the course of the past year plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2482.064s">You've</a>  seen this before as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2483.124s">Again,</a>  these are just the buckets, the priority areas that we started the budget process with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2488.168s">They've</a>  been guiding our conversations and they will <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2490.717s">play</a>  a large role in the information that's presented to you in the coming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2495.46s">And</a>  then these are the three categories, and this is the information that to some extent is new tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2502.605s">And</a>  these are approximations, and they are a result of the conversations that we've been having internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2509.55s">You</a>  can see there's a significant amount of variability, and I'm happy to go into more detail than is articulated here on the screen as to why there is that variability. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2517.856s">But</a>  essentially, there are a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2520.325s">unanswered</a>  questions at this point as we look toward FY22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2524.607s">There</a>  are some things we know and that we feel very confident about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2527.408s">The</a>  first one being in what I'll call bracket one on the far left, we're looking at approximately two or $2.1 million in fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2537.792s">And</a>  those are made up of three subcategories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2540.773s">First,</a>  the contractually owed compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2543.274s">Those</a>  are steps and lanes that are part of existing collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2547.13s">There</a>  are compliance obligations and things that we recognize that we will have to invest in in order to both adhere to best practices and fulfill all of our various obligations to students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2560.014s">And</a>  there are some emergency infrastructure maintenance technology related expenses that we know we won't be able to defer past fiscal year 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2570.338s">So</a>  that's what makes up the bulk of that $2.1 million that our <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2575.364s">Even</a>  if we do nothing different, if we have no strategic priorities, if we make no investments, and if we provide no compensation increases other than those that are contractually obligated to provide, we're looking at about $2 million in increased costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2590.31s">This</a>  second category, again, there's a range because there are some strategic decisions that have to be made, and there is some overlap between how we can potentially fund some of these priorities <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2605.067s">And</a>  there's a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2606.428s">So</a>  if we make one strategic decision, there's potential savings that are realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2610.769s">And</a>  so it's impossible at this point to put an exact number on what our instructional operational necessities will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2618.753s">But</a>  at this point throughout the development process and after close to 25 meetings in which we've discussed all these issues, we can narrow it to a range of $500,000 to 1.75 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2626.616s">What</a>  that essentially means is that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2631.47s">If</a>  the increase is less than $500,000, there are difficult decisions that have to be made and savings and efficiencies that have to be recognized over and above our sort of normal fiscal stewardship responsibilities to identify those efficiencies on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2646.454s">And</a>  if we're north of $2 million, again, with no compensation increases beyond those that are contractually owed, then we're in a particularly healthy position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2657.92s">we</a>  want to make sure that we're making the most strategic use of all resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2662.921s">In</a>  the third category, again, a lot of variability because there are things that are uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2668.443s">We</a>  have to make some strategic decisions about, from a maintenance and technology perspective, what's the timeline in which we'll adhere to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2675.745s">So</a>  that's one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2677.885s">There's</a>  also close to 10 collective bargaining agreements that are expiring this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2683.747s">And</a>  so there are no contractually owed increases, but we're <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2687.941s">beginning</a>  to, we'll be entering into those discussions with our bargaining partners in the coming weeks and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2693.846s">And</a>  so we need to understand that there's the potential costs as we go into those discussions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2699.771s">And</a>  then obviously the uncertainty related to the federal funding, which we'll discuss on this next slide, which is that neither the district nor the city have received the guidance that we need to with regard to restrictions around the SO3 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2713.081s">And</a>  so we know that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2715.608s">There</a>  are a series of COVID mitigation related expenses that the district is likely to incur, or not likely, it certainly has and will continue to incur. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2725.05s">And</a>  we're grateful to have that funding available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2728.291s">But</a>  it's also the case that we have operating expenses that are going to escalate to some degree as explained in that previous slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2735.892s">And</a>  so you've seen on the left the information before about how the 4.3 million has been broken down through our partnership with the city and through the funding that's been made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2745.785s">both</a>  from the federal government and from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2748.266s">And</a>  what we're looking at here with regard to ESSA 2 and ESSA 3, it's $7.6 million, which is a healthy amount and something that we'll make sure that we make good use of in terms of those investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2760.749s">It's</a>  also an amount that has to be spread out over a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2763.869s">And</a>  so while it's always possible that there'll be additional funding sources that will be realized, our planning really has to encompass the next two to three fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2773.372s">And</a>  so hopefully, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2774.634s">the</a>  economy improves, revenue improves, and so we're in a more favorable position in the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2779.976s">But</a>  as of right now, we are not in a position to look at this as $7.6 million solely for fiscal year 22, which is just another piece of the equation that we have to take into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2792.139s">And</a>  those bullet points you'll see on the right, those are what you're likely to see as we begin to present on those priorities and begin to have those discussions with the school committee and to inform the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2804.561s">And</a>  so just a final takeaways here, with regard to input 21, again, we're projecting a modest surplus, more or less in line with where we hope to finish the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2815.948s">We</a>  do have a food services deficit that at least for the moment is requiring us to maintain our current spending and hiring freeze, partial spending hiring freeze. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2825.814s">We</a>  are approving emergency expenses that have a certain urgency with regard to this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2832.448s">The</a>  range with regard to the projected increase, I'm going to estimate right now is 3.4 to 5.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2839.391s">I</a>  understand that that's a wide window. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2841.952s">But</a>  again, there are a number of variables ranging from collective bargaining to the federal stimulus to potential other efficiencies that we're able to recognize and enforce internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2855.437s">And</a>  so that is what that delta represents and what it's attributable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2862.142s">There</a>  will be COVID related expenses, we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2864.805s">And</a>  we also know that there's uncertainty that the city of Medford is facing and that all cities and towns across the Commonwealth are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2874.394s">And</a>  so as a result of that, we are continuing to explore all possible savings and efficiencies to make sure that we're able to bridge whatever gap we responsibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2885.064s">We</a>  do not have a <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2887.089s">5.8</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2887.65s">And</a>  frankly, we don't have a $3.4 million savings that is available to us internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2892.712s">We</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2895.154s">And</a>  we want to be honest and transparent about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2898.355s">But</a>  at the same time, as any $62.3 million taxpayer-funded enterprise does, we have a responsibility to continue to look internally to make sure that we are being good fiscal stewards and recognizing and realizing efficiencies wherever we are able to find them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2916.55s">So</a>  I recognize that's a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2919.071s">I'm</a>  happy to share this information with you after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2923.473s">These</a>  numbers are relatively fluid, but the wide range between 3.4 and 5.8 is intended to create space for us to move within that range. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2935.239s">So</a>  I don't anticipate you'll be hearing recommendations that would exceed 5.8, and I don't anticipate any recommendations that would <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2944.15s">would</a>  be less than 3.4 going into FY 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2948.453s">And</a>  again, I'm happy to get into more details about any or all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2955.798s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2960.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2961.421s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2964.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2965.146s">And</a>  I just wanted to add for members of the community, obviously the committee of the whole budget meetings are the place where a lot of this nitty gritty detail comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2973.132s">And</a>  I wanted to ask, I know with the pandemic last year, it was difficult to get binders around this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2979.238s">And</a>  I don't know about my colleagues, but for me, I work much better with the tactile budget binders with the ability to move back and forth during the meetings, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2989.086s">So</a>  will we be getting those this session?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2994.152s">I</a>  don't have any reason to think you wouldn't be receiving bindings if that's the committee's preference.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3000.074s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3000.414s">That'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3009.337s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3011.297s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3012.478s">We</a>  also passed the motion last <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3015.667s">June,</a>  July, August, it all runs together to get updated binders, because I mean, we do literally, I mean, I know most of us probably keep these right at the ready, but this is the binder we use to approve the budget that is absolutely not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3030.555s">So,</a>  you know, you put 62.3 million on that slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3035.417s">This</a>  does not say 62.3 million, neither does the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3038.959s">I</a>  go to the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3040.74s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3042.735s">I'm</a>  not saying 62.3 is not correct, because I know that that is money that came in out of the normal process, but the documents that the public will look at 20 years from now, I looked at 20 years of our city budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3055.565s">They</a>  can't be lies, they can't be fictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3058.467s">We</a>  need a budget document that actually reflects what the budget was, or a very rational person looking at the actual documents we approved will say in perpetuity that our budget last year was 61.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3073.279s">And</a>  I don't want us to be in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3076.541s">I</a>  need to know what the budget was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3078.442s">And</a>  I feel like I still don't even know because there's this other number that we never approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3083.385s">And</a>  I think we're the only ones who statutorily are allowed to approve a budget.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3088.208s">Well,</a>  the first thing I'll say just because the word lies was used is that I really can't say strongly enough that there's no intention to provide any lies to the school community or the community with regard to this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3101.797s">The</a>  second thing I will say is that this school district budget, like all school district budget, is comprised of multiple funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3109.083s">The</a>  62.3 is, as was discussed in these slides and previous ones, the operating budget comprised of the Chapter 70 allocation and the local contribution from the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3121.813s">There</a>  are external funds, as there are every year, Title I, Perkins grants, 242 grants, and special ed <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3130.027s">a</a>  variety of other sources that come in that in this district amount to in the range of $2 million or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3136.969s">That</a>  also does not include the 4.3 to 4.6 that was represented here with regard to the COVID relief funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3146.811s">And</a>  so everyone will have a binder and it will spell out in as much detail as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3154.292s">I</a>  wasn't here, so I can't speak to where those inaccuracies <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3158.737s">what</a>  they might be attributable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3159.978s">I</a>  will say that my team and I have spent a significant amount of time and I imagine we'll be spending a considerable amount of more time in the coming weeks and months attempting to align the budget lines with the appropriate budget categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3184.256s">And</a>  there are four budget <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3188.275s">$63</a>  million and eight or 900 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3192.597s">It</a>  does seem to be that historically there have been a number of budget charges, meaning people's salary being charged to the wrong lines, which I think creates confusion and a lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3209.182s">I</a>  have no, I've seen no evidence of any intent on anyone's part. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3214.844s">I</a>  think there are probably, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3217.744s">So</a>  usually the way that happens is that there's a year where there's an account that's short. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3223.527s">And</a>  so someone's salary is charged to a different account, sometimes off the operating budget into revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3230.011s">And</a>  then the next year somebody else's is, and then it just sort of compounds itself and nobody goes through and actually cleans it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3237.976s">We've</a>  spent a good amount of time this year attempting to clean that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3241.278s">And</a>  so when you look at the binder that's being discussed and it has the columns for <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3246.057s">FY21</a>  versus FY20 versus FY22, you'll see some variability that doesn't necessarily represent any type of strategic decision on the part of the district, as much as it represents an attempt to put people in the appropriate groupings so that it can be clearer to the public, both contemporaneously and historically, where the personnel was sitting, what they were doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3276.01s">And</a>  I think it's just, it's a necessary correction that has to be made for purposes of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3282.455s">But</a>  the committee should know there is a significant amount of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3287.358s">And</a>  I can't frankly say with certainty that we're gonna catch every single one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3293.162s">I</a>  can tell you that we've caught a number of them and I think it will be more accurate and I think it will be more transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3299.399s">But</a>  it's $63 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3301.02s">And</a>  I can't say I can't make a guarantee that there won't be times where you'll find something that should be charged through a different account. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3307.924s">But</a>  in terms of the total number, it's 62.3 plus the external funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3313.087s">And</a>  I have no basis to think otherwise, at least at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3319.33s">What</a>  I want to be clear is, again, I know there are <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3321.321s">They're</a>  members of the community for whom this might be the one discussion about the budget they hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3325.724s">I</a>  don't want people walking away thinking that you as members of the committee have a binder of $62.3 million, but there's actually 72, and we just don't tell anybody how we spend that other 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3337.152s">It's</a>  that there are other funding sources that are all discussed publicly that are deliberated on and I think we're transparent about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3349.296s">it's</a>  not all as neat and tidy as just the 60.2.3 and nothing else.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3358.152s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3359.575s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3361.605s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3362.765s">Just</a>  this is kind of a housekeeping comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3366.807s">Because</a>  of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3374.99s">We're</a>  going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3379.932s">Additionally,</a>  and I particularly want to <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3384.024s">highlight</a>  this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3392.266s">We'd</a>  like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3401.908s">And</a>  that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3413.611s">So</a>  after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3423.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3443.137s">I</a>  don't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3444.298s">I've</a>  had ongoing discussions with the city CFO and as we've reported to the committee previously, we have meet routinely the two finance teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3456.763s">And</a>  so I have shared this information with the city's finance team with regard to essentially the three brackets and what we're projecting as a range for a likely increase or a necessary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3470.02s">but</a>  I don't have an official number at, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have the official number and I don't, to go back to the sequence that we discussed the previous presentation, the committee will vote on a request that will go to the city, excuse me, the superintendent will make a recommendation to the committee, which will then make a request to the city, at which point an appropriation will be made.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3496.422s">So</a>  we've changed the process because it used to be that the city provided the number and we worked to it.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3502.906s">So</a>  what I'm talking about is the formal process that is sort of reflected by the Massachusetts law with regard to the sequence that the city informally provides a number of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3517.476s">They're</a>  certainly welcome to do that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3521.546s">Okay,</a>  I'm glad to hear we're following the law as it's been laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3526.948s">The</a>  other comment that I will make for my colleagues is that when I think about the budget and how we move forward, we need to be thinking about the funds that we did not receive last year, and then a modest increase on top of that, which does put us into the neighborhood of A plus B plus C on Mr. Murphy's slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3552.134s">As</a>  far as I can tell, that really represents restoring the district from the layoffs, the pink slips, and all the other things that we had to do last year, given the funding issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3570.195s">And</a>  I will <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3572.751s">be</a>  looking to make sure that we are funding the things that we promised last year, like middle school health and reading specialists and addressing dyslexia in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3583.257s">So</a>  I'm hopeful and we've had great conversations on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3586.719s">So</a>  I am hopeful that the city is preparing for that, especially with the significant infusion of cash from the federal government coming our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3596.945s">So</a>  that is what I will be looking for as we go into the budget meetings and <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3602.203s">I</a>  hope that we don't have to pink slip hundreds of teachers again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3609.092s">Oh,</a>  and the last thing I'll say is I'm also hopeful that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3613.762s">Um</a>  do right by the staff across lots of bargaining units that have helped us navigate through this pandemic as we talk about, um, the negotiation of many collective bargaining agreements and central to those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3632.717s">Of</a>  course, and reasonably are cost of living increases, and we as a city need to be prepared to Come to those conversations in good faith.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3643.686s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3646.388s">Mayor,</a>  if I could just, in response to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3648.43s">Graham's</a>  questions, I think it would be worth bringing up the slide with the three buckets again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3653.594s">I</a>  think it sort of dovetails nicely up those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3657.277s">Would</a>  that be okay if I shared that very briefly?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3660.479s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3661.02s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3663.081s">So</a>  to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3664.442s">Graham's</a>  point, if you look in these three categories, on the far left, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3672.307s">Bracket</a>  A, we'll call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3673.468s">It's</a>  a good label. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3674.128s">I</a>  should have put it on there to make it more easy to read, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3678.091s">That's</a>  the 2.1 million increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3680.653s">That</a>  is the increase that is coming regardless of any decisions that we make. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3685.977s">Essentially,</a>  the decisions that led to that 2.1 increase have already been made in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3691.16s">Either</a>  they're collective bargaining agreements that have been engineered into, some of which decades ago, and others are strategic decisions with regard to <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3701.268s">investment</a>  in various types of maintenance via any ranging from HVAC to technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3706.371s">These</a>  next two brackets, B and C, there are some strategic decisions that can be made there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3715.275s">And</a>  that's why there's a range 500 to 1.75 and 750 to 2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3720.137s">But</a>  the committee and the community need to understand that if we go in the low range of that, then there are implications to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3726.801s">So,</a>  and you could be looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3729.992s">essentially</a>  going multiple fiscal years with no cost of living increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3734.313s">Typically</a>  not considered a prudent strategy, but under, you know, these are uncertain economic conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3741.754s">And</a>  so we need to go in understanding that, you know, ultimately the allocation and the product of the collective bargaining negotiations could land somewhere within that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3753.056s">With</a>  regards to the middle column, bracket B here, that restoration of the FTEs is <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3760.462s">connected</a>  to exactly what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3761.743s">Graham</a>  was saying and making sure that those positions are restored appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3766.146s">And</a>  that is obviously a chief priority going into these discussions and trying to make sure that we're able to be made whole as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3776.953s">So</a>  those are the three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3780.235s">Again,</a>  there is a range, there is a variability. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3782.857s">That's</a>  not unusual, frankly, at this time of the year under this form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3788.337s">the</a>  uncertainty is exacerbated a little bit this year, or magnified, I guess, by the fact that we have this potential influx of funding, both the city and the school, on the school and city sides of the ledger, for which we don't yet have full guidance on with regard to restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3808.169s">And</a>  so that leaves us, in some cases, with more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3812.851s">And</a>  I know that, frankly, sometimes with these budget discussions, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3816.599s">I</a>  think everyone's a little more comfortable if we either come in and say the sky is falling and everyone has to panic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3822.724s">Or</a>  we come in and say, this is a really good year conditions are favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3826.527s">We're</a>  going to be able to fund all these priorities have been waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3830.41s">We've</a>  been waiting for years on and we're not in either of those situations, frankly, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3835.534s">This</a>  is not a time to panic and it's not a time to rejoice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3838.977s">We're</a>  somewhere in the middle with some <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3841.62s">legitimate</a>  questions that we still need to have answered, but hopefully with this information tonight, people can start to get a sense as to what the range is that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3850.882s">If</a>  our increase is below $3 million, that is going to be a significant, significant challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3856.704s">If</a>  our increase is above $6 million, we're going to have to do some additional strategic planning, frankly, to make sure that we're making the most of the investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3864.566s">Somewhere</a>  within that range, in 3.4 to 5.8, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3869.229s">is</a>  a number in which we will be able to make good on the investment, maximize those resources to benefit students, and also these sound fiscal stewards. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3881.216s">So</a>  thank you for allowing me to just go back to that briefly, but I felt like it was a good opportunity to sort of reaffirm that point.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3892.442s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3894.983s">Number</a>  four, we have report on summer funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3897.247s">I</a>  had my hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3899.23s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3900.672s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3902.59s">Thank</a>  you for the PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3906.393s">I</a>  was going to ask if it could be, I didn't see it in the drive, so I'd love to have it sent to the members if you would as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3912.057s">And</a>  then I know that we've had discussion in the past, and I just wanted to double check because of the conversation around the process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3918.922s">And</a>  we talked about a flowchart, and especially for the community that is trying to understand the process, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3928.128s">you</a>  know, we have meetings ourselves and we have a lot of conversation that we may understand things more than, say, the layperson does. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3935.411s">So</a>  I really do think we need this visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3937.092s">And</a>  I don't know if that's in the presentation or where that is, but we need a visual of a flowchart on what the process is and how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3944.915s">So</a>  I know to remember Graham's conversation earlier around, you know, when's the appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3950.297s">What's</a>  the appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3951.238s">How</a>  does this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3952.85s">from</a>  the city, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3953.771s">I</a>  think the flowchart really helps with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3955.372s">So</a>  I'm wondering what the status is, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3958.195s">Will</a>  people be getting that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3959.416s">I</a>  know there was some discussion, we'll be getting it before the budget meetings, which are May 3rd, but that means the public didn't necessarily get it in tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3966.341s">So</a>  that's the point is I really wanna make sure that the public understands the process, please.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3972.546s">So</a>  beyond the flowchart that's in this presentation, you mean?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3978.811s">Can</a>  we go back to the side of the flowchart that's in the presentation?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3983.007s">I'm</a>  happy to.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4001.654s">Is</a>  there a piece of information not in this flowchart that you would like represented in the flowchart?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4006.752s">Yeah,</a>  I think the process of how the decisions are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4010.014s">So</a>  in the flow chart that we had worked on together, I was under the impression that the process around when the city appropriation, how it goes, what happens if the school committee votes yes, what happens if the school committee votes no, whose decision it is, where it goes, because we don't have any information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4029.527s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4030.447s">we</a>  had this situation last time where it was a very where there was a closed vote on there was a potential no vote on the budget and the community you know wanted to know what the impact of that would be and it was not clear and it wasn't clear to committee members and it's still not clear to me so I would like to know that yeah I think it's a fair question it's one that at least in the abstract has been um discussed that I've certainly been part of the conversations a few different times and uh including in recent months as</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4060.195s">Um,</a>  some of the, you know, budgets picture, um, a couple of months ago when it was even less clear than it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4067.937s">Um,</a>  but under the city form of government, if the school committee's role, while there is a vote in the statutory required, statutory required vote to adopt the budget, um, that is ultimately appropriated by the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4083.98s">If</a>  the question is what happens if the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4088.063s">refuses</a>  to vote to adopt the budget that the municipal government appropriated, then there really isn't a specific sort of how-to with regard to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4100.254s">The</a>  administration would be in a position where the governing body that we report to has not approved spending for fiscal year 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4108.441s">We</a>  would then consult with the Department of Revenue and get guidance as to how we should proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4116.9s">I</a>  think you can expect what you would typically see in a situation in which there's, functionally speaking, a government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4126.488s">It's</a>  not common at all, again, in a municipal structure like we have in the city of Medford, because there isn't really a good offering at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4140.419s">So</a>  the committee's role is in making the initial request to the municipal government <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4145.869s">um,</a>  articulating and really it's the administration's responsibility to make sure that we're articulating a defense to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4151.932s">Uh,</a>  request. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4152.792s">And</a>  then the municipal government ultimately makes is, is the, is the spending branch of the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4158.935s">And</a>  ultimately that's the appropriation that's going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4161.676s">I</a>  think the reason that there isn't clear guidance spelled out today is because if the school committee were to refuse to accept the budget that was allocated from the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4172.277s">there</a>  wouldn't be sort of a plan B for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4175.838s">The</a>  municipal government ultimately would, you know, could decide, you know, how it was going to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4183.259s">And</a>  I guess there could be some type of breaksmanship where the municipal government then decided to appropriate more. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4188.66s">But</a>  just frankly, the way the municipal governments operate and the timing that's involved here in terms of the start of the fiscal year, that wouldn't be a strategically prudent route to take, which is why committees typically don't take that route. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4203.018s">So</a>  again, that's a, I think trying to articulate that and sharing that type of doomsday scenario, I'm not sure I would say that it would help inform the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4216.607s">I</a>  think in large part, it would be articulating an option, creating the perception that it's a viable one when in fact it's really not a viable option and one that, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4230.906s">I</a>  just, I'm hesitant to incorporate more information into this type of presentation that I think is just going to confuse people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4241.029s">But</a>  the committee is certainly, I'm not trying to substitute my judgment for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4247.15s">The</a>  committee would like to articulate the step-by-step what would happen if the committee voted to not allow the administration to spend the money that was appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4259.732s">certainly</a>  entitled to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4261.233s">I</a>  think my recommendation at the time would be to adopt the budget that was appropriated and continue to advocate for a supplemental appropriation to help bridge whatever gaps the committee recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4273.243s">I</a>  think that would be a significantly more prudent strategy than shutting the school department down on July 1st.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4285.993s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4288.575s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4289.977s">I'm</a>  feeling a bit of deja vu here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4295.1s">I've</a>  literally watched videos in this last year of communities that have school committees that send budgets up far greater than their municipal appropriation and the world doesn't come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4306.085s">Can</a>  you explain to me why that isn't actually an option for us?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4312.208s">I</a>  think it's a very reasonable option with regard to your vote to make that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4318.589s">I'm</a>  talking about the scenario in which the budget has passed through the municipal government and where we get to the point at which the new fiscal year is going to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4328.456s">And</a>  what I'm saying is rather than refusing to adopt that budget and therefore freezing the administration's ability to expend any of the resources that have been appropriated, I think it would be a more prudent strategy to adopt that budget and then continue to advocate and lobby the branch of the municipal government that does have spending authority to supplement that budget.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4349.748s">I'm</a>  sorry, I wasn't clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4351.629s">So</a>  if the mayor through her office gives you a number, the school committee's authority around the budget is to vote yes or no on that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4361.015s">That</a>  is our entire, we have all these meetings, we have all this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4365.397s">At</a>  the end of the day, we're voting yes or no on the number that the mayor gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4369.04s">And</a>  that is the entirety of what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4372.682s">I'm</a>  saying in other communities, we develop a budget based on the school committee's priorities and obviously, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4378.672s">with</a>  the administration and we send up an $85 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4383.913s">And</a>  the mayor says in her budget, it's 65 million and sends it to the city council and they approve it for $65 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4391.375s">And</a>  we can go to sleep with a good conscience because we talk about priorities, getting to the priorities that have been on our lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4400.157s">We</a>  talk about that like it's like new uniforms for the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4403.818s">No,</a>  we're talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4405.606s">reading</a>  services for kids in high school that are not on IEPs that can't read well enough to get through life. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4414.248s">We</a>  have zero reading service providers for kids that are not on IEPs that do not read properly, sufficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4421.809s">That's</a>  not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4423.709s">Those</a>  are kids for going out into the world without basic skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4427.39s">And,</a>  you know, I mean, there's the middle school sex ed that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4431.251s">We</a>  don't have any physical ed <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4433.738s">We</a>  don't have an adaptive physical ed person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4438.18s">We</a>  keep talking about priorities, like we're talking about whether to get a new car this year or wait a year, like it's our personal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4445.483s">There</a>  are actual children on the other end who are going off out of our schools, not prepared to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4452.645s">And</a>  so I would be able to go to bed if we sent an $85 million budget up, just picking a number randomly, that reflected what we said we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4464.015s">And</a>  then it's on the mayor and then it's on the city council and it's on the taxpayers who will then not be able to deny that this is what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4473.18s">But</a>  every year we send up a budget that is the exact to the nickel number we're given from the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4479.103s">And</a>  it doesn't matter what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4481.024s">It</a>  doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4481.905s">And</a>  that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4483.906s">So</a>  I just, you know, this notion that we are in a, we're in a machine and we have no other options is just not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4492.405s">and</a>  other communities have figured it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4494.586s">They</a>  send a budget up that is ethical and reflects the needs of the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4501.447s">And</a>  if the community isn't willing to pay for it, then it's on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4504.788s">But</a>  if we won't send that budget up, it's on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4507.209s">It's</a>  not on the community, it's on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4511.65s">I'm</a>  just tired of this talk about priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4514.51s">It's</a>  like whether or not to paint your house this year or next, or this year or not.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4520.988s">Mayor,</a>  if I could just respond briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4523.109s">I</a>  just want to be clear in this presentation, we've used the word necessity, not priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4528.97s">So</a>  I think that I understand what you're saying that I would say I would rather use the term strategic priority than wishlist. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4536.132s">And</a>  that is something that we've talked to within our internal budget meetings, we've made that expectation clear, because I think a wishlist, frankly, doesn't sound credible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4544.734s">And</a>  I think that you're not in a position to be able to advocate on behalf of the school department, if we are <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4551.088s">asking</a>  everyone who works for us to say, just tell us what you dream about at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4555.09s">I</a>  don't think that helps the cause in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4558.391s">But</a>  I hope, Mr. Rousseau, you're not taking this presentation to suggest that we as an administration believe you don't have any options. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4570.556s">The</a>  presentation tonight says there's a range from 3.4 to 5.8 that we can make very good, very prudent, very student-centered, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4581.252s">investments</a>  in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4582.592s">Now,</a>  as you hear from department heads over the course of the next several weeks, you may well say 5.8 seems, you know, important, but we really think it's 6.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4595.116s">I</a>  can't, frankly, I don't know why you wouldn't make that request if that's what you think is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4601.058s">Because</a>  to your point, the sky is not going to fall in if the committee says, look, we've summed all this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4607.66s">We</a>  think the vote should be at 6.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4609.882s">should</a>  be 6.3 is ultimately it is the school committee's request to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4614.103s">You</a>  should make it as you see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4616.524s">I</a>  would say I have a responsibility to tell you that if we get much further past the range that we're talking about here, again, there's a lot of planning that would have to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4628.686s">And</a>  so I would be mindful of that for purposes of making sure that we as an organization have the credibility to advocate on behalf of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4637.528s">I</a>  think that that's sort of how this <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4640.243s">works</a>  when you have multi levers of government involved in the development of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4645.625s">But</a>  I think by all means, you can make that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4648.826s">I</a>  don't know why you wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4652.568s">Understand</a>  that we're going to be able to operate if we end up with less than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4658.19s">And</a>  what we as an administration can't do is, and I don't think anyone is asking us to do to be clear, but we can't say, we can't light our hair on fire if <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4668.688s">you</a>  know, if the request comes in below $6 million because we are going to be able to operate, we're going to be able to do right by students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4677.952s">If</a>  we get lower than that low end of the number, no, I don't think we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4681.753s">I</a>  have a responsibility to tell you from based on what I've seen so far, including a lot of these fixes that we're making and trying to be more transparent and be more honest and taking into account that those uncertainties, if we land at a number that is our current budget, less, you know, with less than a, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4698.266s">a</a>  $3.4 million increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4699.787s">At</a>  this time, I would not be comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4702.228s">We</a>  would have to make a series of decisions that I don't think would be in the best interest of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4707.25s">But</a>  I also would say, I don't think there's a magic number that somehow if we cross that threshold, all of a sudden, we're going to do right by every single kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4714.653s">I</a>  don't think that number exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4715.873s">I</a>  think right now, it's a range. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4718.214s">I</a>  think there are a lot of variables that we have to take into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4720.735s">I</a>  think there are questions that we have to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4724.277s">But</a>  I don't think, I just want to be clear that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4728.156s">There's</a>  two stages of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4731.398s">You</a>  can make whatever request you think is appropriate, but I, it is hard to imagine a scenario on June 30th where not adopting the budget that's been appropriated is the best course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4747.946s">That</a>  was my only point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4749.287s">But</a>  prior to that, I think you should make whatever request you think is in the interest of the district.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4756.287s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4756.827s">Mayor,</a>  may I just have a quick follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4759.189s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4761.01s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4761.33s">Can</a>  we get an attorney who can answer the questions about this onto a meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4766.693s">Because</a>  I was under the impression from our last round was that if we had voted the budget down and the city appropriated the funds anyways, our voting it down would have no impact at all on people getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4777.299s">So,</a>  you know, the notion that we shut the building down on July 1st and you all just go home <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4784.049s">wait</a>  it out while the politicians get raked over on Facebook or something, I don't think is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4790.571s">And</a>  I think there is certainly a time when it becomes a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4796.713s">I</a>  need to actually have an answer to what happens if we refuse to approve a budget that we don't feel is adequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4804.535s">And</a>  I don't wanna find out after we are there, what the consequences are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4810.116s">I</a>  think we need an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4813.019s">The,</a>  you know, several members last year were like, well, what will happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4816.52s">And</a>  here we are coming up on another year where several of us are asking what will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4821.222s">And</a>  I can't believe that in Massachusetts with 351 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4824.823s">And</a>  I know there's very different forms of government that nobody has ever refused to pass a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4829.625s">That</a>  just doesn't seem plausible.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4832.406s">So</a>  just be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4833.146s">It</a>  doesn't seem like it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4834.907s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4835.527s">The</a>  school committees that are refused to adopt the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4839.048s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4839.635s">And</a>  I'm happy to seek outside counsel and provide you with a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4844.136s">I</a>  will say, I am an attorney that's done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4846.176s">I</a>  have talked to other attorneys that have dealt with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4848.817s">And</a>  the issue is that in this form of government, with this timing, it is so nonsensical that there isn't a clear path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4856.699s">There</a>  are various options, some of which I think are of questionable legality, but there are absolutely paths forward at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4863.4s">In</a>  some of the other forms of government, there are contingencies that are built in <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4868.302s">And</a>  there are levers that can then be adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4870.604s">In</a>  this form of government, there aren't as many. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4872.745s">So</a>  there aren't gonna be, there will not be a good option available, but that's not to suggest that there will be no options. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4879.21s">And</a>  I really, really wanna be clear that there are two points in the budget sequence here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4886.455s">No</a>  one is saying that the school committee must only take a vote on a number that's handed over from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4891.939s">I</a>  don't know what the point of the school committee would be if that was the only thing that you were empowered to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4898.56s">But</a>  that is a different question than whether the administration who works for the school committee can legally spend money if no vote has been adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4909.809s">I</a>  will tell you that in a lot of school committees, and this is sort of the ugly truth of school governance, they often forget to take the second vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4919.577s">That</a>  is not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4920.918s">And</a>  I think the school committee association probably is more familiar with this than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4925.082s">But</a>  once the request is made, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4926.933s">and</a>  the municipal government ultimately makes that appropriation, most school committees just consider their previous vote to have been their approval of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4934.917s">And</a>  then administratively, the funding flows in and people get paid and off we go throughout the course of the fiscal year and we live happily ever after, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4945.182s">There</a>  is a statute that makes it very clear that there's an expectation that the committee adopt a budget after that appropriation is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4953.086s">And</a>  I think it would be a best practice to follow that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4956.042s">And</a>  I don't think it would be the best practice to not expend the funding that was appropriate, especially when you are in no way closed off from continuing to advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4965.324s">I</a>  understand there could be some symbolic value in just saying no, but I don't think there's any legal or strategic value in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4974.625s">And</a>  again, if the idea is you have complete control over where the money is spent, because there's an absolute prohibition on the municipal government telling the school committee how to spend within the eligible expenses, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4986.445s">you,</a>  it seems to me that the more prudent strategy would be that adopted money, especially when there's a two month runway before most students are even in the buildings and then continue to advocate for a supplemental budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=4999.728s">I</a>  mean, that, that is a, that is the path that is, is going to constitute a best practice, whether we can through some type of DOR regulation, expend funds technically without <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5014.403s">facing</a>  the sort of unfortunate end of an audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5017.947s">Yeah,</a>  possibly we could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5019.789s">But</a>  I think those of us who are administrators reporting to the school committee, no, we don't really wanna be spending money if the school committee hasn't ultimately adopted a plan to spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5029.26s">And</a>  that's one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5031.242s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5033.745s">Thank</a>  you, member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5037.683s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to acknowledge that this two-step process that is both a best practice and supported by law and regulation, I think is something that Medford just hasn't done before, which I think is why you're getting all of these questions, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5058.232s">Medford</a>  has not operated in this best practice fashion in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5062.654s">And</a>  I think it's time that we start doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5065.586s">And</a>  that means two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5067.488s">And</a>  that provides an outlet and an ability for the school committee to tell the city government what we need to support the students in our charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5080.64s">And</a>  it also allows us a way to acknowledge <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5087.727s">whether</a>  we're doing everything we can with the hand that we have been given. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5092.709s">Last</a>  year, those two things were horribly muddy together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5096.111s">And</a>  I think my comments at the time were about trying to make sure that my no vote was not construed as a criticism of making the best of a very bad budget situation and being supportive of the budget overall, which to me were two very different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5111.938s">And</a>  so I am completely supportive of this two-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5116.625s">It</a>  is a best practice for lots of good reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5119.727s">And</a>  I am happy to have you on board to guide us through that best practice process so that we can do better for the students of Medford than we have been able to do in our past budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5134.238s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5135.799s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5136.38s">Just</a>  to be clear, you're probably alone in that again, whether it's most or not, I really can't speak to, but it is absolutely not uncommon for the school committee to take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5146.395s">think</a>  of it as a budget approval when in effect it's a request because the actual appropriating happens on the other side of town, the appropriation is made, and then they never convene again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5156.397s">And</a>  frankly, just because it's sort of a cycle, I don't know this, but I suspect a big part of why that second vote doesn't occur in a lot of school committees, it's because the committee has already recessed for the summer when the appropriation is actually allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5170.859s">But</a>  again, it's really, really not uncommon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5173.8s">It's</a>  just that I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5175.887s">What</a>  I'm hearing from multiple members is that they want the budget vote to be a clear articulation as to what the committee sees as the needs of the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5188.749s">That's</a>  completely fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5190.529s">Again,</a>  that is why school departments are unique within the municipal structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5196.19s">It's</a>  why there's a semi-autonomous body that is elected to have that independence and to advocate on behalf of students, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5203.692s">But</a>  there's also a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5205.82s">that</a>  within the composition of a municipal government, there are competing needs, there are competing priorities, and there's a limited amount of money, even with an allocation like this coming in from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5217.104s">And</a>  so the municipal government has a different mandate and needs to make those decisions and ultimately make an appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5225.766s">My</a>  only point is once that need has been articulated, and when the right to continue to articulate that need and to advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5235.053s">continues</a>  even after that appropriation is made, I'm hard pressed to think of a scenario in which voting down the appropriation that has come in is going to put us in a more favorable position, both to operate the district and to advocate for the additional investment that the school committee believes is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5258.171s">And</a>  so I think that that's sort of the sequence as it plays out over the course of the next month.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5270.902s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5271.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5272.323s">Number</a>  four, report on summer fun and community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5274.944s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, Mr. Robert Maloney.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5325.025s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5325.865s">I</a>  apologize right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5327.406s">I'm</a>  on a computer that has no audio and my other computer just went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5333.55s">So</a>  if you would just bear with me for one moment, I will read the report and hopefully get audio back momentarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5344.256s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5353.102s">All</a>  right, so right now this report is updating on Summer Fun and the other community schools programs that are being offered this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5363.926s">First,</a>  Summer Fun, Mr. Petrellis is on the call, but we are offering Summer Fun this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5371.049s">It</a>  will start on July 5th and it will go through August 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5377.912s">We</a>  have six weeks of availability this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5381.453s">One</a>  of the things that all of the summer programs are competing with are staffing issues, as well as issues with just the pandemic and looking at how much staff have been through over the past year and just a level of exhaustion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5398.757s">So</a>  currently, we're working to bring people on board and make sure that we have the appropriate nursing staff and other supports necessary to make sure that all of our programs <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5411.012s">across</a>  the district are running very well and very efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5415.541s">Secondly,</a>  we are <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5420.249s">with</a>  summer fun, there will be a cost increase this year to go up to $200 per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5428.551s">We</a>  cannot accept walk-ins due to the fact that we're looking for students to have a negative COVID test, which you can get at a stop the spread site free of charge prior to students enrolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5447.294s">Um,</a>  the the summer fund program will be moved this year to the Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5457.625s">Um,</a>  as we're looking to spread out as much as possible from the high school to look at the number of programs that are just give me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5467.976s">I'm</a>  actually coming <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5475.895s">Um,</a>  so one of the things that we're doing by moving to the Columbus, we will have the, um, we'll have the opportunity to use the Tufts pool, um, at Tufts park near, um, just make me give me one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5493.652s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5512.492s">All</a>  right, I can't apologize enough for the technical difficulties I had over the last couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5518.217s">So</a>  hopefully you actually heard me over the last couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5523.421s">So</a>  by moving it to the Columbus, we've got a large field there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5527.985s">We've</a>  got a fully renovated playground available to our students and then the availability to go to the Tufts playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5534.792s">Uh,</a>  we also have, uh, several programs that are partner programs that will be leasing space from Medford, uh, public schools through the community schools slash partnering with community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5548.143s">Um,</a>  and those include the spotlight program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5551.166s">Uh,</a>  that's a $325, um, per workshop, uh, cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5557.491s">They</a>  give a specialized singing mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5560.077s">to</a>  students, they will be able to sing, be able to act, be able to do the things they've been normally doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5567.304s">There</a>  are certain CDC guidelines that we will be following. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5571.648s">These</a>  have been published by the city of Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5575.853s">And</a>  they were updated late Friday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5579.522s">So</a>  we're going to cohort individuals as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5581.963s">Attendees</a>  must remain three feet apart during normal activities, six feet when eating. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5586.965s">We're</a>  going to schedule activities outside as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5590.607s">We'll</a>  strongly encourage all of our camp staff who are 16 and older to get vaccinated as soon as the opportunity is available, which is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5600.652s">We'll</a>  be ventilating interior spaces as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5603.613s">And</a>  the district's work on HVAC is definitely helping in all those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5609.091s">and</a>  mask wearing at all times, with the exception of swimming, eating, and drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5613.314s">And</a>  in the report that I submitted to you this afternoon, I do quote from where they do not want students wearing a mask in areas where they will get wet, such as at a beach or a pool, as a wet mask can make it difficult to breathe and to also not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5630.426s">So</a>  these programs are enriching and offer a great opportunity for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5634.728s">One</a>  of our problems that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5637.628s">is</a>  that the GBL league made the decision to get as many kids involved in athletics as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5647.193s">The</a>  problem is, is that that meant that we waited for other school districts to get out of the red to really be able to start participating, which is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5655.618s">It</a>  was a great league mandate, but we're going to be pushing our athletic seasons later than ever before going to July 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5666.053s">And</a>  then fall season start back on August 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5670.034s">And</a>  many of these programs utilize facilities that our athletics program would. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5675.836s">So</a>  just let me run through this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5678.937s">We</a>  also have a Medford basketball summer camp run by our varsity programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5683.318s">It's</a>  available to all students, kindergarten through grade nine, three weeks, June 21st to the 25th, June 12th to the 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5692.218s">and</a>  August 9th to 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5694.559s">Spotlight</a>  Productions is also running July 5th through the 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5698.9s">And</a>  then the Boston Celtics have expressed interest in returning to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5704.902s">They</a>  were there two years ago to run camps. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5707.903s">And</a>  we're currently just waiting to make sure that we have all of our scheduling settled before we open to outside vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5716.146s">So</a>  that's summer fun in community schools at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5722.529s">I'll</a>  take any questions if you have them.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5727.392s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5730.533s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5732.014s">I</a>  guess I'm confused, because I thought, is Mr. Maloney here?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5734.896s">Mr.</a>  Maloney is currently supervising volleyball, and so was not able to join.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5745.221s">OK,</a>  so do we know what the status is going to be on the cost of <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5752.542s">the</a>  summer fun camp this year, what the staffing is gonna be, you know, sort of how that's gonna, I'm thrilled that it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5761.304s">You</a>  know, we're definitely gonna be going.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5763.265s">I</a>  think it's a great program or my child's gonna be going, I won't be going, but I think it's a great program, but I'd like to- I'm not gonna lie, I wish I could go, but no, right now in Mr. Petrellis, I know is flying solo with twins at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5780.03s">But</a>  we are charging $200 per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5783.753s">The</a>  additional cost is related to PPE and other things that all of these programs now gonna be responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5794.9s">The</a>  initial conversations were probably capping at 75 campers just because of the need to distance and for the additional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5808.935s">If</a>  we can expand beyond that we will, but we've just got to be very careful about the number of students that are coming in.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5815.681s">Okay,</a>  may I may I follow up question or do you want to let okay.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5822.907s">So</a>  keep going.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5824.305s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5825.926s">And</a>  so I know that in the past, we've worked with community schools to ensure that there is a obviously clear statement on all applications that Medford Public Schools does not discriminate based on ability, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth, so that the community members know that if you have a child with a disability who you want to attend summer fun camp in our school district, they are fully <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5854.462s">able</a>  permitted should be allowed to attend summer fun camp, because it is a community program community based program which is obviously accessible and open to all individuals so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5865.048s">We</a>  had something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5866.629s">I</a>  know Mr. Petrales is on the line and he was very thoughtful about how that was written into the applications in the past, but just want to make sure that that's really clear to the community because it's an important program where another opportunity to build friendships between children with and without varying abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5882.377s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5884.037s">I</a>  would definitely say absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5885.538s">And</a>  then, you know, also any community members who would feel generous enough to say sponsor students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5892.02s">always</a>  feel free to reach out and make a contribution on behalf so that we can be able to offer those types of things which we would do anyway, but it just helps to make sure that we're meeting in the black, but we would never deny a student.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5914.444s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5916.19s">One</a>  last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5917.11s">And</a>  when are the applications available?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5919.911s">They</a>  should be available at the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5921.352s">We</a>  were just clearing up a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5923.692s">We</a>  would love to be able to offer credit card payments in the future and a few other things, but just given the timelines for this year, it wasn't very realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5935.715s">And</a>  there are certain challenges if you accept credit cards as the refund isn't immediate, it needs to go through the city warrant process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5945.724s">and</a>  things along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5947.364s">So</a>  what we'd like to do is have the applications available toward the end of this week, make sure that they're back as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5960.187s">And</a>  then, yeah, we'd like, what we can't have this year though, I can't stress this enough, is we can't have the walk-ups that I think people are very accustomed to.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5970.289s">Right,</a>  and so may I ask again, Mayor, one more question?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5974.715s">Yes,</a>  member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5976.875s">And</a>  so are there opportunities for camp Councilors or what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5983.617s">I</a>  know in the past, Mr. Petralos has been really great about recruiting phenomenal adults to be Councilors within the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=5992.399s">And</a>  I'm wondering where we are at on staffing with that and whether or not there are opportunities available for our rising seniors, rising juniors, folks who may be looking for a summer job, what have you?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6004.71s">There</a>  will definitely be opportunities for them, although they may be slightly limited just because of the smaller number that is going to be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6019.357s">But</a>  we'll be looking at the staffing in the coming week to week and a half and hiring as well, and then onboarding anyone who is not currently in the onboarded system.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6031.787s">So</a>  if individuals are interested in applying for a camp Councilor position, what would they do?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6036.788s">We'll</a>  be putting out an email to all the students to let them know through the district email. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6043.59s">And</a>  then I'm sure Mr. Petralos will be reaching out as well to make sure that he's trying to connect with those Councilors that may actually have gone elsewhere last year because some programs ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6056.193s">And</a>  then just the last summer there were really</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6077.983s">know,</a>  it's a great example, another shining star in Medford's crown or shining jewel in Medford's crown of, you know, an example of diversity and affordability and accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6090.433s">And</a>  Anthony has really led the charge on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6092.735s">And</a>  I want to say thank you to Mr. Petrales and Mr. Droschke and others who have been so critical in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6099.54s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6099.9s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6102.362s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6104.025s">Number</a>  five, we have recommendation to approve 2021-2022 school year calendar.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6146.281s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6148.823s">New</a>  calendar for 2021-2022 has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6153.226s">And</a>  that will be up on our website, I would assume in the next couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6160.35s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6162.211s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6162.491s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the administration for their work on an entirely new calendar this year and the way it's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6169.098s">I'm</a>  quite proud of the work that went into that new calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6172.76s">So</a>  I'm very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6173.821s">And</a>  I love that the calendar itself includes the statement of how much we value our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6178.624s">So</a>  just want to thank everybody that did the work on that.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6181.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6182.627s">Yes,</a>  great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6184.088s">I'd</a>  like to thank Susie for all the extra time she put in to really beautify the calendar as well to make it more user friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6192.894s">Thank</a>  you, Susie.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6197.158s">Number</a>  six, we have update on discounted MBTA bus passes for disadvantaged students, Mr. David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6202.863s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6204.784s">This</a>  was a request from the committee that we share an update on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6210.168s">And</a>  I know this was discussed at a previous meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6213.911s">So</a>  if the beginning part of this is repetitive or redundant, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6220.697s">I</a>  think the committee knows that we, like many districts, offer <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6226.469s">discounted</a>  MBTA pass at a cost of $30. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6229.231s">This</a>  year, we've been seeing about 50 of those passes per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6234.854s">That's,</a>  I know, a reduction than normal, as would be expected, given the reduced occupancy of the building and just generally fewer people taking public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6245.14s">But</a>  we were asked to look into the potential <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6250.318s">for</a>  expanding this to potentially offer more passes, the idea being that we want to make sure that we're giving as much access as possible to students and not depriving anyone of the benefits that come with the MBTA pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6265.45s">And</a>  so we've had some preliminary discussions internally with the building leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6271.534s">And</a>  we have reached out to the MBTA in the hope of beginning a conversation about the possibility of getting <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6279.402s">further</a>  discounting if we were to buy the passes in bulk. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6285.667s">I</a>  will just say I'm not optimistic necessarily about those conversations based on some previous experience I've seen in other districts that were buying thousands more passes than we would likely purchase, but we at least want to have that conversation and potentially we've considered reaching out to other districts as well to see if there might be some other <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6307.803s">strategy</a>  for procuring additional passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6311.405s">And</a>  right now, what we know is just sort of the basic numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6315.588s">If</a>  we were to draw the line at our economically disadvantaged population of students, we'd be looking at a potentially $150,000 budgetary impact that would need to be absorbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6329.816s">If</a>  we were to expand that as some districts have to all high school students, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6335.984s">we'd</a>  be looking at what we estimate to be a $350,000 charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6341.106s">There</a>  are other strategies that are probably worth exploring, particularly if it was the committee's priority to consider doing the $350,000 charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6351.73s">Typically,</a>  that is a program that would be tied to a city as a classroom type program in which you're trying to encourage the use of the MBTA pass to explore more experiential learning opportunities <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6364.666s">And</a>  so if that were to be part of a larger suite of offerings or initiatives, we'd probably also want to take a close look at our current transportation contract with our primary vendor to see if it may be cost efficient to expand the yellow bus usage at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6384.56s">My</a>  understanding is certainly right now and historically, the high school has been serviced by one yellow bus from the primary vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6394.268s">And</a>  so that is what is contemplated by the current contract within the first of three years within that contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6400.01s">But</a>  that might be something that we'd want to take a look at depending on the level of investment the committee would like us to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6406.533s">And</a>  so that's sort of where we are in terms of the internal discussions we've had as to whether we should consider this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6415.156s">You</a>  may have seen the last bullet there that we've also talked about the possibility of essentially creating an application process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6422.693s">There</a>  are inherent issues with that, as you can imagine, making sure that we're being fair and equitable with regard to how those applications would be reviewed and potentially How the either further discounted or free passes would be allocated, but we're certainly open to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6437.707s">And</a>  if the committee has other questions or direction that you'd like us to take <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6443.129s">we</a>  can certainly explore this further. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6445.812s">But</a>  primarily, we just wanted to provide this update to see if there were any other questions or direction that the committee would like to provide.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6452.9s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6457.785s">Member</a>  Graham and Member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6462.888s">Thanks</a>  for this update. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6465.409s">I</a>  think what I would like to see as we talk about the budget for the transportation is what are those options and how would they fit into our budget when the transportation budget is presented to us because <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6483.374s">You</a>  know it may be that the MBTA buses are not the most cost-effective way for us to provide free transportation to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6492.96s">My</a>  understanding is the MBTA buses are also the reason that sort of hinder us in a regular year from doing late starts and all kinds of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6504.708s">So</a>  as we kind of consider <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6509.251s">start</a>  times, late starts, snow days, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6513.373s">I</a>  think it's a conversation worth having, but I would want to have it in the context of the larger budget so that we can understand what those options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6520.737s">I</a>  mean, this option sounds fine, but there may be a better cost-effective option we should pursue, and I want to make sure that we look at all of those.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6532.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6532.644s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6536.16s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mr. Murphy, for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6538.401s">I</a>  appreciate the time you've taken to meet with me on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6542.302s">I</a>  would love to know, I guess one thing was, I understand that in the past, teachers have been funding some of these passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6550.966s">Is</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6552.466s">I</a>  know that there are, there have been some situations in which teachers have put together some essentially private efforts to <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6560.618s">to</a>  fundraise and make sure that some students are provided with those. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6565.72s">And</a>  certainly that's something that's a testimony to, or it attests to their extent to which they care about their students in a very comprehensive fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6577.103s">I</a>  think everyone also understands that that's not a prudent long-term strategy for providing transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6584.966s">It's</a>  that it's not a responsibility that we ever could expect of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6589.947s">you</a>  know, that that extra effort and extra funding could be going toward other needs that that students have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6595.668s">And</a>  I'm sure that that is, I know that, frankly, that's what some of those student teachers would prefer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6601.869s">It</a>  is a significant potential financial commitment on the part of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6606.23s">So</a>  it's also not something that we could do, I think, without looking at, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6610.851s">Graham</a>  points out, the broader budgetary context, and make sure that we consider all the potential options and sort of what is the specific objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6619.325s">that</a>  we would be looking to achieve with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6621.466s">But</a>  yes, I mean, certainly there have been teachers that have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6624.148s">I</a>  do believe there have been some other outside organizations that have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6627.349s">And</a>  we don't want this to be, we don't want any students' ability to bring in $300 in the course of the school year to preclude them either from being able to get to school easily or move around the community and experience some of those experiential learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6644.477s">So</a>  that's why we have to take a look at this, but I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6648.43s">the</a>  underlying point of the question is like, that's not a good long term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6652.931s">We</a>  certainly agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6654.752s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6656.793s">So</a>  Mayor, may I get in the queue again after Member Ruseau for a follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6662.094s">Or</a>  however you want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6667.196s">Did</a>  we lose the mayor again? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6668.296s">I</a>  think we did.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6672.277s">Yes,</a>  let's see, member Rousseau, and then I'd like to get, we do have a hand raised by Leticia Rocha. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6679.302s">So</a>  member Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6681.724s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6685.667s">When</a>  I talked earlier about like the budget we actually need, this is a prime example of something that without any question should just be in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6698.176s">The</a>  word free is literally, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6701.117s">almost</a>  all legislation around a public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6705.46s">And</a>  it's also a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6707.721s">It's</a>  actually a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6708.442s">It</a>  costs literally hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year to send your kid to free public school every year per child. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6716.687s">And</a>  so, and I think of that as a failure of society, frankly, but also perhaps a failure of us to just imagine that schools should actually be free. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6727.634s">It</a>  seems so obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6731.487s">awful</a>  to have to say it, but so, you know, when we talk about the budget and we talk about building a budget that's bigger than our allocation, I don't know why this wouldn't have just been on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6745.012s">Of</a>  course, we're going to provide kids a way to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6749.773s">If</a>  some kids just didn't show up to school because of this in a course of a year, if just 10 or 20 kids didn't, how much money would the public have spent on courts and <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6761.448s">And,</a>  you know, officers to go to their houses and like all of that stuff will add up to more than $350,000 pretty easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6770.814s">So</a>  I certainly think never grams point about like looking at this in the context of the actual transportation budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6777.218s">And</a>  is there an opportunity to make this number smaller? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6780.36s">I</a>  mean, I am not looking to spend all the money that we can possibly spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6785.123s">That's</a>  not my goal, but getting kids to school should be part of <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6791.651s">a</a>  free public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6792.891s">So</a>  I really appreciate that you did the numbers on this because they're actually even bigger than the numbers I had come up with on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6803.994s">But</a>  I think we need to solve this and hopefully soon, and it seems like a good time to do it because we can build a budget these next three years that show the public, the residents of Medford, the taxpayers, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6820.774s">This</a>  is what your public school system can provide if we have the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6826.077s">And</a>  it's a heck of a good way to also market it at the time to say, look, if we can't get more revenue from wherever, this is the list of things we're taking away from your kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6837.365s">I</a>  mean, that's, you know, we talk about what we're not gonna give them, what we don't talk about, but if we are giving it to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6845.85s">so</a>  that they can actually get to school and they don't have to have six-figure incomes in their houses to be able to do the things that we think of as part of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6859.354s">It's</a>  a lot harder, Phil, to swallow to tell people, we're gonna take this away from hundreds or thousands of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6866.056s">And</a>  I think that that's a motivation we should put on the taxpayers.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6870.137s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6892.861s">Hi,</a>  can you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6894.162s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6895.142s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6895.963s">So</a>  I see that Mr. Murphy has discussed the discounted MBTA passes for disadvantaged high school students, which he's not even optimistic about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6906.97s">And</a>  I'm here to state that this measure is simply not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6910.952s">It's</a>  honestly shameful that the administration thinks that this is even close to providing relief to families who struggle to get their children to school on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6920.058s">Maybe</a>  this issue has been shoved to the back burner during the pandemic, but since the expectation is that school will be functioning as normally as possible in the next school year, the matter of equitable, and I mean equitable transportation for high schoolers, needs to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6936.529s">All</a>  high school students should have access to yellow buses, not only those that live in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhood of North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6944.655s">Medford's</a>  history has made it so this city is incredibly segregated, and I'm fully aware that North Medford is provided with yellow buses because there technically aren't any MBTA stops in this area, but this is really just an excuse the school administration uses over and over not to address the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6961.35s">You</a>  continue to provide resources to an area where most residents have the systemic supports, advantages, and privileges to get to school without an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6969.698s">The</a>  MBTA is not a reliable or safe mode of transportation for our high schoolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6975.12s">There</a>  are many students in South Medford, which is a much more racially and economically diverse population than North Medford, who struggle to get to school on time because the MBTA is completely unreliable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6987.023s">When</a>  students come in late repeatedly, what happens to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6989.944s">Well,</a>  because they have no other options than to use the MBTA, they're given detentions over and over, which leads to eventual suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6998.706s">And</a>  we all know that these kinds of disciplinary actions directly impact students' chances to pursue a college education. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7005.106s">So</a>  since this district likes to claim that they value equity so much that we are one Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7011.431s">Then</a>  they must find a way to provide yellow school buses to all high school students that need it, particularly those that live over two miles from the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7019.297s">You</a>  can't claim to value equity without providing all students with the opportunity to get to school with a reliable and safe form of transport, which has shown time and again to be yellow school buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7029.905s">We</a>  need action and not performative gestures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7033.488s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7035.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7036.186s">I</a>  see the mayor is back, so I'll hand the reins back to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7041.647s">You</a>  need to unmute yourself.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7055.369s">And</a>  I'm in the queue, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7059.79s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, I think.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7061.73s">Yes,</a>  Melanie would be next. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7063.891s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7065.478s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7067.779s">Yeah,</a>  I was going to say regarding the budget meeting, thank you for folks that mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7074.527s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7076.288s">I</a>  think that the information we need is really important for the transportation budget meeting so that we have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7081.809s">And</a>  so I would ask that it be disaggregated so that we have both the, I know that you gave us the numbers, but I'd love to know how many economically disadvantaged at the high school if we do that initially, or if we do all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7098.234s">So</a>  those numbers specifically would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7100.895s">And</a>  then I would also like to know which students, if possible, which students are actually outside of a two-mile radius, if there are any, because I know that the law requires us to provide transportation to students outside of a two-mile radius, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7114.202s">I</a>  was under the impression that that was required. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7116.683s">So</a>  I was also told when I asked this question in the past that we didn't have students that were beyond a two-mile radius or that for those that we did, transportation was being provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7127.108s">So</a>  I would just love that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7130.153s">issue</a>  addressed through the budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7132.394s">And</a>  if I'm wrong around the legal requirements that that be addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7136.677s">And</a>  clearly we all know from McKinney-Vento students, which are homeless students, we are required to provide transportation for those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7144.021s">So</a>  I know that you put them on there, but that is clearly also a legal requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7149.965s">So</a>  I guess my question is for the budget hearing on the transportation where we will have this topic, can we please have the disaggregated data <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7158.41s">on</a>  these numbers to include any student population beyond a two-mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7165.635s">So</a>  the three disaggregated pieces would be economically disadvantaged at the high school, total at the high school, and any students outside of a two-mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7174.902s">If</a>  that would be acceptable, I would appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7176.823s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7179.225s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7400.326s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7401.446s">So</a>  I actually was asked by a member of the community about which person in the district did a certain thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7412.792s">And</a>  it got me sort of wondering about our official job descriptions, which I wasn't able to put my hands on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7420.297s">But</a>  I did go and look for our policy because I knew that we had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7423.638s">And</a>  it struck me that it was <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7425.809s">very</a>  outdated and doesn't reflect what I would consider to be best practice around roles and responsibilities, making sure that we are evolving positions as education changes and shifts as is just typical in any job. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7444.997s">And</a>  I wanted to put this forward as a recommendation to this policy because it was <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7453.413s">on</a>  my mind at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7455.394s">And</a>  I think just overall focusing on best practice and hygiene will really benefit the students ultimately, but all of us in the clarity of who is responsible for what, which allows the administration to hold staff accountable to their roles and provides clarity and transparency for the community.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7480.543s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7480.904s">Anything</a>  to add member Rousseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7483.323s">and</a>  then move it to approve?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7486.044s">I</a>  had some questions about, first of all, there's a timeline September 1st for comprehensive lists and current job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7494.826s">And</a>  I just wanted to understand whether that was realistic given all the demands of going in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7504.588s">So</a>  I was just curious about that from central administration, what their reaction to that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7510.189s">I'm</a>  a little concerned, I find this, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7513.738s">in</a>  many ways pretty confusing and very prescriptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7523.486s">I'm</a>  sort of wondering if there's a way we can simplify it to make it more accessible.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7536.514s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, I don't disagree with you about it being a bit confusing, although I agree with the premise of making sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7543.816s">Yeah,</a>  I agree with the premise of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7545.397s">They're</a>  updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7547.157s">But</a>  I also agree that we should probably ask the administration a reasonable timeframe, because we're doing this on the city side, trying to update all job descriptions, and it does take some time.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7559.481s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7560.601s">Member</a>  Graham, then Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7562.862s">So</a>  the only thing by September 1st was a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7567.392s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7568.673s">That</a>  was really, and that they be posted to the NPS website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7573.838s">I</a>  recognize that A, you don't want to be revising everybody's job all at the same time because it becomes an implementation problem if you are in a position of having to make changes at any given time to some number of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7588.792s">So</a>  you want to, you don't want to big bang, the changes or the review of every job description in the house at the same time, which is why I provided for like a three year like roll in of the first iteration of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7604.607s">with</a>  at least in my head, I would do that so that on an annual basis, there's some number of job descriptions that the committee is revising or saying is okay without it ever being like a process where we're looking at every single one at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7620.41s">So</a>  to me, providing a list of the job descriptions that the community pays for as part of the school district should not be, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7634.773s">prohibitive,</a>  which I think is the only ask by September of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7640.176s">And</a>  then really providing a three-year ramp in to a good cadence of hygiene around how we hold our senior staff accountable makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7654.144s">And</a>  I think at that point, you have the ability to do it in manageable chunks and to execute on change. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7665.573s">and</a>  you never get into a position where job descriptions are widely outdated, staff, and I'm not saying this happens here, but it happens all over the place, say, that's not in my job description and I'm not going to do it and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7680.424s">So</a>  making sure that we have good structures in place in terms of policy from this committee so that the administration has our support as those changes are made and there's an expectation that it'd be done frequently, I think is to me pretty important.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7697.767s">Member</a>  van de Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7700.569s">Well,</a>  let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7701.63s">I</a>  was going to say Kathy's had her hand raised.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7710.196s">I</a>  had the same concerns about the date where, you know, going back to school, the first day of school starts, I believe I just saw on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7718.942s">I</a>  think it was like August 30th or it could be August 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7723.625s">I'm</a>  thinking that we're just getting the kids ready to get back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7727.187s">It's</a>  teacher induction week and it just seems the timing, the date, September 1st, seems a little bit too close to the start of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7738.274s">I</a>  also wanted to ask the superintendent or the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7742.276s">if</a>  they felt that date was doable, you know, even just to get the comprehensive list, which will still maybe take some time where they're working throughout the summer, getting everything ready for back to school and getting the kids back to school, you know, for the beginning of the fall.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7763.823s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7764.183s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7769.742s">Hearing</a>  what Member Graham was saying, she wanted a list of the job descriptions added. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7776.989s">I</a>  agree with the comments that have been said thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7780.793s">With</a>  the September 1st deadline, that will be right at the same time with potentially onboarding last-minute hires, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7792.705s">from</a>  an accountability perspective to know what the jobs are and the job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7798.428s">We</a>  definitely have, you know, nothing to hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7800.79s">We</a>  want to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7801.73s">We're</a>  in compliance with DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7805.212s">But</a>  I guess I'm just thinking we have a completely different platform called Frontline, which is where people apply for jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7814.858s">And</a>  we, you know, our HR wing of the district <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7819.68s">uses</a>  the frontline system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7822.062s">And</a>  so where you were saying that you also wanted something added to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7828.368s">I</a>  was actually going to be asking for greater clarity, because I do think it's, I think it's something if it's just giving you a list of jobs that were posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7839.243s">I</a>  think that may be able to be doable, but I just think at this particular point in time, it's gonna be a tremendous lift on our human resources department. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7849.968s">And</a>  I know Mr. Murphy probably could speak to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7856.451s">The</a>  amount of stress that will happen just to get school started smoothly and how much activity takes place on the 1st of September.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7868.313s">We</a>  don't really feel stressed down at the center of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7871.114s">We</a>  don't even know what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7872.655s">But</a>  beyond that, what I would say is, Mayor, I promise it's only one slide, but if I could just show the org chart that we developed at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7883.818s">I</a>  just want to say, I think this is a really important thing that we as an organization have to do and have to do soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7892.861s">So</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7895.802s">Graham</a>  and the superintendent used <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7898.197s">slightly</a>  different phrases, and I just want to get clarity as to what the intention here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7902.238s">If</a>  the idea is a list of the jobs, then I personally, I don't have a problem with September 1st if it's a list of the jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7914.422s">If</a>  it's a collection of job descriptions, even ones that, to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7919.764s">Graham's</a>  point, are antiquated and need to be adjusted, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7923.497s">September</a>  1st is not realistic in part because we're going to have obligations to confer with bargaining partners in many instances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7931.44s">And</a>  we're just not going to be able to dictate that short of a timeline while we're also involved in negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7939.964s">So</a>  that would be my only hesitancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7942.024s">This</a>  has to get done and it has to get done soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7944.866s">The</a>  goal of this org chart is to eventually get to a place where by clicking on any of these departments or positions, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7951.092s">you're</a>  getting to both sub org charts and ultimately to job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7954.753s">And</a>  then obviously we'll have a centralized list too for people that like, you know, the centralized list that that's another format that would be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7960.956s">But</a>  this is absolutely a shared priority and something that we have to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7965.578s">And</a>  again, if it's, if it's a list of jobs, we can, we can accommodate that, you know, October 1st would probably be better than September 1st, just because of the opening of school and because there may be there's oftentimes there are roles <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7979.53s">that</a>  are tweaked or changed just as school is beginning and we recognize where there are gaps that have to be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7986.254s">So</a>  I'd probably recommend a little bit later just for the list, but ultimately we have to get to a place where you can, any member of the community can very easily go to the org chart, click on an area of the organization, see how the organization is structured and ultimately get to the individual job description for each position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8005.847s">And</a>  that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8007.42s">absolutely</a>  an objective that we have and one that it's my hope that we'll be able to achieve in the coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8013.201s">But</a>  I'm not, I don't see a problem with just a list of the jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8018.203s">I</a>  just think for, so that we don't have to amend it two weeks later, I would say, let's do it for October 1st.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8028.005s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Vandekloot, did you?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8032.801s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8034.522s">I'd</a>  just like to, again, motion to approve as amended with the amendment to move the date to October 1st.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8042.925s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8044.765s">Yes,</a>  and I would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8046.486s">I'm</a>  also just gonna throw out one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8049.867s">So,</a>  you know, I just, the terminology, professional staff, what, the rest of our staff is unprofessional? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8058.988s">There</a>  may be no way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8060.389s">It</a>  may just be the common thing, but I'm just going to mention it to say to me, it just sounds so funny.</p>

    <p>[David Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8065.791s">It</a>  might be worth amending to permanent staff with permanent being defined as not a temporary position we created to fill some gap for a three month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8076.795s">And</a>  I don't think it'd be necessarily we should be running to the school committee to say that we have someone filling in three days a week to bridge a managerial gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8086.92s">We</a>  may have an existing <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8088.782s">temporary</a>  worker type position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8091.522s">But</a>  I think the idea is it's a position that is not specific to a sort of a discrete project that's going to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8100.484s">It</a>  is the positions with the type of durability that you would expect to be there until the needs of the organization change.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8108.005s">And</a>  Mayor, the nomenclature actually comes from the existing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8112.486s">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8113.826s">And</a>  I was making an assumption that it was important because it <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8119.554s">seemed</a>  like an odd word to me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8121.175s">So</a>  if it's not important, I think permanent is fine.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8127.52s">And</a>  to that point, I mean, I don't, I don't know if I'm missing a part on my sheet, but it just says defined as department head, central staff, nursing, and the sentence is incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8136.726s">So</a>  I wouldn't even know what the rest entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8139.808s">That</a>  should just probably be a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8141.469s">Oh,</a>  with an and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8148.168s">Okay,</a>  so motion for approval by Member Ruseau as amended to October 1st, 2021 for a comprehensive list and a list of the current job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8160.555s">Seconded</a>  by Member Van der Kloot, roll call.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8228.204s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8229.994s">So</a>  yeah, so we received this, well, the mayor's office received this letter on March 16th, and I will just read the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8237.195s">Dear</a>  members of the Medford School Committee, and then it lists us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8241.136s">The</a>  Education Committee of the Mississippi Valley NAACP would like to express its appreciation for the June 2020 decision of the Medford School Committee to erase and replace the name of Columbus from the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8253.658s">The</a>  Education Committee agrees that Columbus is cruel, barbaric, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8257.357s">treatment</a>  of indigenous people disqualifies Columbus from being honored in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8262.418s">We</a>  applaud the democratic search process that has been established to find a more appropriate name for the school, once called the Mystic School in honor of the mystic tribe who inhabited Medford before the colonial period. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8274.121s">The</a>  education committee also lauds the school committee for the unanimous passage of the resolution eliminating out of school suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8281.762s">For</a>  years, this destructive policy has disproportionately victimized black children, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8286.32s">and</a>  other children of color and special needs children. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8289.322s">Medford's</a>  in-school alternatives and mandatory education is positive and welcome evidence of progress in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8296.406s">In</a>  addition, we understand that there's a commitment to recruit and maintain black, indigenous and other people of color who will more accurately reflect the increasingly diverse Medford community as administrators and teachers and that school staff have received anti-racist trainings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8311.396s">The</a>  success of these initiatives will improve educational equity <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8316.115s">While</a>  the evaluation of the clothing code has taken a backseat to the COVID-19 crisis, we trust that the Medford School Committee will, when possible, review and revise the clothing code to avoid the discrimination Black students and students of color identified at the Duggar Park rally last summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8333.209s">Sincerely,</a>  the Mystic Valley NAACP Education Committee, Eileen Lerner, Regina Caines, Wendy Cliggett, Pearl Morrison, Vincent Dixon, Erga Pierret, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8346.368s">Susan</a>  Girard, Jillian Harvey, and Greg Bartlett. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8352.832s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
