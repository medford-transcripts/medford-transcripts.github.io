    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=270.332s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=271.452s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=273.133s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=274.113s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=275.613s">Approval</a>  of payrolls has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=281.775s">We</a>  have report of secretary number one, good of the order offered by member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=287.498s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=289.459s">The</a>  good of the order is a category under Robert's Rules of Orders that we had voted in earlier in the year, essentially at our first meeting of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=299.638s">And</a>  I think on occasion, it's been dropped, but moving forward, I would ask that it is included on the first meeting of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=305.124s">And</a>  generally, it is to check in with the school committee as a group, as a whole, to check in on the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=314.754s">Essentially,</a>  how are things going? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=316.115s">Are</a>  things going well? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=317.617s">Are</a>  there things that folks feel we need work on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=322.681s">you</a>  know, are the meeting scheduling's going fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=325.662s">Like,</a>  it's an opportunity for the committee to offer up anything they have, both positive or, you know, things that need to be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=335.964s">So</a>  that's the good of the order.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=339.685s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=340.946s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=342.726s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=343.606s">I</a>  appreciate the good of the order today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=345.707s">I</a>  would just like to suggest that we all take a refresher course on Robert's Rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=352.174s">We</a>  typically allow members to speak for as long as they want to speak, which is actually a violation of Robert's rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=358.119s">We</a>  don't let everybody have turns. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=360.901s">Some</a>  members will ask six or seven questions in a row, leaving the other members who may have had questions to sit there silently and look like they had nothing to say, which looks bad for those of us that came with a set of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=372.649s">So</a>  I think as a committee, we can do an awful lot better at acting like a committee instead of as individuals approaching an election.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=384.085s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=385.025s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=386.706s">Yes,</a>  I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=393.007s">Like</a>  a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=400.65s">I</a>  think it might be more engaging for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=405.371s">The</a>  other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=413.906s">We</a>  had something like 23 meetings in the in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=418.451s">I</a>  think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=430.922s">of</a>  doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=437.863s">And</a>  I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=455.947s">And</a>  I agree with you member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=457.587s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=460.148s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=460.688s">I</a>  think these are, you know, both through the chair, my colleagues I think these are both things that have been talked about, certainly, you know, individually or amongst less than a quorum with folks over time so I think these are both items that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=478.635s">Training</a>  and Roberts rules of order is, you know, highly recommended it's a really important, it's what how we operate and how we run and, you know, I know when I came on as a new school committee member there was no orientation there was no indication of how to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=491.815s">We</a>  had to seek out training and. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=494.038s">I</a>  know MASC has an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=496.36s">I</a>  don't know how many folks have gone and you know I went to it that one time pre pandemic and learn some things certainly there but I think a course in Roberts Rules of Order is definitely in order and I would also say we've talked about the length of our meetings in the past and there has been some conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=512.697s">you</a>  know, more frequently meetings for less time and folks sort of tend to say that they think that that would just mean more frequent meetings that are longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=519.981s">So</a>  they don't necessarily wanna do that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=521.542s">I</a>  don't know what the answer is there, but I think that clearly when we have to go two, sometimes three weeks in between talking to each other, it makes it very difficult because the items on the agenda get longer and longer, understandably. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=535.069s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=535.43s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=538.871s">I</a>  know we have our student rep <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=540.252s">Mr.</a>  Colin Bailey on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=541.792s">If</a>  you have anything to add, please jump in.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=544.593s">Yes,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=545.313s">I</a>  forgot, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=547.174s">Our</a>  new rules have asked that we include the student rep in attendance, and I did have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=553.776s">I</a>  actually reached out to Colin Bailey to ensure that he was coming today, and then I get caught up in the roll call, and I apologize that there's the student rep here, so I will add him to the attendance roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=565.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.223s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.523s">Thank</a>  you, member.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=567.883s">Chris</a>  Oh, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=569.925s">Um</a>  I just wanted to say that, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=572.887s">And</a>  sometimes I haven't been able to speak at some of the meetings because. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=576.989s">Some</a>  other committee members have gone on to their questions, and I'm looking at the clock and I'm looking at the number of residents that want to speak, and I just you know, I just passed on my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=587.336s">Um</a>  so I you know, it would be helpful if we all you <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=596.101s">Then</a>  before they got to ask their second question, it could go through maybe with some of the other members if they had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=604.928s">In</a>  the past, I have expressed that I'm not in favor of more frequent meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=610.492s">I</a>  know that it sounds like it would be helpful, but I found that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=616.457s">some</a>  of the details in the meetings that we have, they're very comprehensive and meeting every week and doing the minutes and posting the meetings, it's going to ultimately take the same amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=629.225s">And</a>  the administration is just gonna be getting ready for meetings every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=634.308s">So</a>  I'm not in favor of meeting more frequently and adding on more frequent, shorter meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=641.952s">I</a>  just wanted to say that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=650.294s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=650.594s">I</a>  think the mayor's not here now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=655.576s">Maybe</a>  she got booted out by mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=661.718s">Will</a>  we go with the vice chair in the meantime?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=663.519s">I</a>  will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=674.423s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=676.758s">through</a>  the chair, I would also agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=678.72s">You</a>  know, I don't want more frequent longer meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=681.382s">I</a>  just want to clarify that I am looking for, you know, I'm hoping that as part of the good of the order, perhaps we can come up with some suggestions of how to how to, you know, make the meetings less than six, eight hours, especially as we're coming into budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=696.038s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=698.888s">So</a>  I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=709.755s">Maybe</a>  a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=717.32s">So</a>  do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=724.024s">Great,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=729.296s">Can</a>  we move on to the next order of business? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=731.878s">And</a>  I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=737.602s">Because</a>  I don't have it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=741.945s">We</a>  can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=744.667s">Who's</a>  got the agenda right in front of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=746.328s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=746.948s">I</a>  have it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=748.009s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=748.469s">Well,</a>  McLaughlin raised her hand.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=751.67s">Yeah,</a>  I just was gonna say that I had the agenda in front of me as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=754.191s">So</a>  the report of committees, behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting, which is myself for the report and bear with me one second, because I was going between tabs, it's gonna take a second.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=772.307s">while</a>  you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=781.451s">Perhaps</a>  a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=786.893s">And</a>  we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=792.936s">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=794.937s">And</a>  Melanie is going to give her report.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=799.108s">Yes,</a>  number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=800.073s">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=800.414s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=800.655s">Sorry,</a>  I lost internet connection.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1553.702s">Please</a>  note that orientations will be held for students and their parents or caregivers at the McGlynn Middle School on Wednesday, May 12th from six to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1565.268s">and</a>  at the Andrews Middle School on Thursday, May 13th from six to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1571.812s">More</a>  details to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1574.653s">I'd</a>  also like to announce that Medford Public Schools has temporarily suspended the use of Google Hangouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1582.902s">Due</a>  to some misinformation or cyberbullying and inappropriate exchange of information taking place on Google Hangouts, we have temporarily suspended the use of that platform until we are able to put in additional measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1602.905s">So</a>  the temporary suspension of Google Hangouts is still in place while we are looking for additional security measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1615.433s">Lastly,</a>  I feel I would be remiss if I did not mention the decision in the Derek Chauvin case. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1622.918s">The</a>  jury returned guilty verdicts in the murder of George Floyd, which raises hope that our nation is changing for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1632.484s">According</a>  to a poll conducted by UMass Amherst, it is notable that a solid majority of whites, 56%, supported the verdict. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1645.589s">In</a>  a nation with such a troubled racial history and present, it is extremely rare and perhaps unprecedented that a majority of whites support the conviction of a police officer for the murder of a Black man, said political science professor Jesse Rhodes, who helped conduct the poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1668.997s">An</a>  Earth Day quote seems applicable here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1673.652s">We</a>  all share the same mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1676.814s">It</a>  is about time we treat each other like family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1680.456s">I</a>  have said continuously that we are one Medford, one district, the Mustang family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1687.94s">Yet</a>  too often in our world, black and brown lives are devalued. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1693.143s">We</a>  must all understand that no matter the color of one's skin, we are all human. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1700.118s">As</a>  our Vice President Kamala Harris stated after the verdict was read, today we feel a sigh of relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1709.023s">Still,</a>  it cannot take away the pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1712.606s">A</a>  measure of justice is not the same as equal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1717.829s">As</a>  your superintendent, as an educator, and most importantly as a mother, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1724.351s">I</a>  have said that change is hard and can be messy, but it is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1729.915s">Conversations</a>  about race and injustice are complicated, but must be had, so the quality of life is improved for us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1740.823s">As</a>  Tyler Perry said last night at the Oscars, let us reject hate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1747.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1753.937s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1757.938s">Number</a>  two, we have COVID-19 Public Health Update and Medford Public Schools COVID-19 Testing Summary and Update by Nurse Supervisor Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1765.921s">Toni</a>  Rae, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1767.541s">Marian</a>  O'Connor, Board of Health Director, and Mr. David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1773.323s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1775.264s">I</a>  will provide the data tonight for the City of Medford and the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1780.466s">The</a>  City of Medford, the city is averaging 22.9 positive cases per day as reported on April 22nd, giving us a 1.19% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1792.97s">As</a>  reported by the Medford Board of Health, 25 children less than 19 years old tested positive for COVID-19 <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1801.453s">between</a>  April 18th and April 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1807.096s">In</a>  the Medford Public Schools, school nurses administered 4,684 COVID tests during the week preceding school vacation, three of which were positive, a 0.06% positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1824.524s">We</a>  did not administer any tests during school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1829.895s">Testing</a>  resumed today in all schools with 227 pool tests submitted for analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1838.062s">I'd</a>  like to remind staff who received their COVID vaccinations that it is recommended that they continue weekly COVID testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1846.389s">Vaccination</a>  prevents serious illness and hospitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1850.732s">Vaccinated</a>  persons can still get the virus and spread it to others despite not having symptoms themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1860.084s">I</a>  would also like to share a message from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, who sums up the current COVID situation well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1868.587s">She</a>  says, we remain in a complicated stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1872.009s">On</a>  one hand, more people in the United States are being vaccinated every single day at an accelerated pace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1878.952s">On</a>  the other hand, cases and hospitalizations are increasing in some areas of the country, and cases among young people who have not yet been vaccinated are also increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1891.705s">Therefore,</a>  I thank all of the parents and the Medford Public School staff who proactively informed the school nurses of their vacation travel plans, provided COVID test results prior to returning to school, and followed the travel advisories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1907.668s">The</a>  good health of our school community depends upon the efforts of all students, families, and staff to follow recommended Department of Public Health COVID guidelines and advisories, including wearing a face mask, avoiding large gatherings, maintaining social distancing, and most importantly, staying home if you feel ill or if a member of your family tests positive for COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1931.297s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1934.138s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1936.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1936.75s">I</a>  also wanted to ask, I know we had the opportunity to speak last week to the chair, Nurse Ray, and I know that it had been mentioned that it'd be helpful to share if we have vaccine information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1949.022s">Do</a>  you want us, is there anything that you're asking for students to do that or not do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1954.927s">Like,</a>  I'm curious.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1956.268s">So</a>  we are recommending that students over the age of 16 be vaccinated as per the current guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1964.331s">Parents</a>  can sign their children up at the MassVax sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1968.432s">I</a>  believe that website was put up on the chat earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1973.294s">And</a>  we encourage all parents to vaccinate their children over 16.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1980.616s">Okay,</a>  and I guess, may I, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1982.576s">I</a>  had a follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1984.479s">So</a>  I guess the question is, shall we send vaccine records to you or to the nursing office if they would like them?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1992.224s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1992.924s">We</a>  would like to keep track of students who have received their COVID vaccines. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2001.29s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2002.411s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2002.871s">Ray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2006.653s">Number</a>  three, we have an update on the fiscal year 22 budget presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2010.736s">Mr.</a>  David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2011.697s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2014.254s">I'm</a>  going to share a very brief deck, some of the material you've seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2020.395s">And</a>  that's not to be repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2021.715s">But</a>  as I said in previous budget presentations, because we know that this is a topic of significant interest to the community, we want to be sure that we're being mindful of that and various folks picking up the conversation at various stages throughout the course of the budget development process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2042.537s">We</a>  want to be sure that we're keeping everyone as informed as possible, being as transparent as possible, and answering as many questions as clearly as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2053.845s">There</a>  is some new information in this, or at least some updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2057.888s">And</a>  so at the conclusion, I'll be happy to take any questions that you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2063.952s">One</a>  of the pieces that we've discussed over the course of the last several months, and I know it's been of interest to some members of the committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2070.677s">making</a>  sure that we're keeping track of the sequence that we're following. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2073.679s">And</a>  so this is a simplified version of the flowchart that you saw at a previous budget update in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2080.523s">We're</a>  in basically the top right corner in this timeline right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2084.766s">We've</a>  completed, as stated in a slide or two, about 25 budget internal meetings with our various departments <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2094.399s">and</a>  are moving toward the public meetings that will take place with the committee of the whole over the course of the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2102.143s">This</a>  is a modified version of a table I've shown you in the past related to the sources of funding and the budget development process with the Commonwealth, the city of Medford and the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2112.908s">I've</a>  added this fourth column to the right as I think most people, certainly the committee knows and members of the community are familiar with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2123.569s">sizable</a>  amount of federal funding that will be flowing into cities and towns as well as school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2129.053s">And</a>  so we'll be touching upon that a little bit tonight and the implications for that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2135.398s">This</a>  is an updated timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2137.22s">I</a>  wrote to the committee on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2140.042s">We</a>  had initially planned to begin some of the public committees of the whole meetings this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2147.228s">And</a>  a few things became clear over the course of the last two weeks or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2150.45s">One,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2151.765s">There's</a>  still a significant degree of uncertainty with regard to restrictions around the additional funding that will be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2160.152s">And</a>  the degree to which that has the potential to be intermingled with our operating budget, there's a need for greater clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2169.979s">And</a>  I know because I fielded several questions from members of the committee about how that funding will be used and the sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2180.625s">the</a>  concept of essentially bifurcating the operating budget from the COVID mitigation budget coming directly from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2189.789s">And</a>  we'll talk a little bit about that tonight and what the strategic questions that will be coming before the city and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2197.613s">But</a>  this is an updated timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2199.694s">We</a>  did add one meeting at the end of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2203.256s">We've</a>  tried to keep the dates consistent and we'll be sending calendar invites out <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2208.775s">members</a>  of the committee to make sure that that's built into your calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2211.736s">But</a>  we're thinking right now of a 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2214.797s">start</a>  time to accommodate some of the subcommittee meetings that are scheduled on those days as well earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2220.598s">And</a>  then again, the May 19th date was added because we thought it would be a good idea to have sort of a catch all day in case we run out of time to the priority discussed earlier tonight about trying to keep the meetings more manageable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2237.023s">And</a>  so we have that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2238.262s">as</a>  sort of a placeholder where we'll be able to pick up additional departments that need additional time to present or also for further discussion once the multi-dimensional budget has been presented and hopefully gives the committee the full context to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2256.551s">This</a>  statement with regard to recognizing the one-time influx of funding, that's something that we've discussed before and something that will be sort of a common thread <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2267.287s">as</a>  we get into the strategic considerations related to operating budget versus COVID mitigation funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2275.331s">And</a>  so as we get ready to open FY22, we've tried to keep you as informed as possible with regard to the close of FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2286.156s">This</a>  is not a major change since I presented to you in mid-March. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2294.05s">We're</a>  comfortable with regard to our financial position as we move toward the end of FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2300.153s">I've</a>  said before that given the size of the budget, the sort of best practice target area is to finish somewhere between $100,000 and $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2309.879s">We're</a>  a little above that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2312.34s">There</a>  are reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2313.38s">It</a>  has to do with some of the substantial deficits in the revolving funds that are contingent upon revenue generation, which has been <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2322.448s">significantly</a>  diminished this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2325.649s">There's</a>  also been a few other variables, some COVID related, some sort of typical uncertainties as you go through the course of the fiscal year that have in some cases turned out favorably for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2338.654s">And</a>  so that's what puts us at about a $500,000 cushion for lack of a better term. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2345.696s">That</a>  is not to say we're able to release the current <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2349.321s">partial</a>  spending freeze, we're not in a position to do that because there are a few variables and potential emergency funding issues that we have to, we're keeping a close eye on infrastructure and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2360.446s">And</a>  so essentially we're in a good position, but not overly favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2364.648s">And,</a>  and the main reason for that is again, the food services deficit in particular, which on paper is $730,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2374.033s">I'm</a>  comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2374.593s">I'm</a>  confident that that's going to diminish over the next <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2379.23s">weeks</a>  and potentially a month or so as some unencumbered funds are released and as additional revenue is generated as a result of additional students being in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2391.678s">We</a>  do still have two internal meetings left this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2394.7s">I</a>  expect that those will wrap up by Wednesday or Thursday and we'll be in a good position to begin the public discussions next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2402.285s">In</a>  terms of planning for FY22, we're going to talk about this in a second, but <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2406.423s">There</a>  are two major sources coming directly to the school district, ESSER 2 and ESSER 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2411.147s">The</a>  ESSER 2 number, that's the 2.3 million that we've discussed previously in the federal legislation that passed at the end of calendar year 2020, and the ESSER 3, which is the subsequent federal legislation that passed last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2426.72s">So</a>  as we get into the spending priorities, all department heads and principals <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2433.097s">with</a>  the exception of that last group that I mentioned a minute ago that will be convening this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2437.199s">But</a>  all principals and all other department heads have been asked to focus on three specific areas with regard to budgetary priorities and how we as an organization can seek to remedy the learning and opportunity gaps that were either caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2454.545s">And</a>  certainly there are priorities that are broader and expand beyond the particular challenges that have been caused by the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2461.63s">Generally</a>  speaking, we think of them in these three buckets as materials and infrastructure, personnel, and training and professional development, and all within the context of the significant challenges that students are experiencing as a result of the conditions under which they've gone to school over the course of the past year plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2482.064s">You've</a>  seen this before as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2483.124s">Again,</a>  these are just the buckets, the priority areas that we started the budget process with. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2488.168s">They've</a>  been guiding our conversations and they will <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2490.717s">play</a>  a large role in the information that's presented to you in the coming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2495.46s">And</a>  then these are the three categories, and this is the information that to some extent is new tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2502.605s">And</a>  these are approximations, and they are a result of the conversations that we've been having internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2509.55s">You</a>  can see there's a significant amount of variability, and I'm happy to go into more detail than is articulated here on the screen as to why there is that variability. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2517.856s">But</a>  essentially, there are a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2520.325s">unanswered</a>  questions at this point as we look toward FY22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2524.607s">There</a>  are some things we know and that we feel very confident about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2527.408s">The</a>  first one being in what I'll call bracket one on the far left, we're looking at approximately two or $2.1 million in fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2537.792s">And</a>  those are made up of three subcategories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2540.773s">First,</a>  the contractually owed compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2543.274s">Those</a>  are steps and lanes that are part of existing collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2547.13s">There</a>  are compliance obligations and things that we recognize that we will have to invest in in order to both adhere to best practices and fulfill all of our various obligations to students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2560.014s">And</a>  there are some emergency infrastructure maintenance technology related expenses that we know we won't be able to defer past fiscal year 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2570.338s">So</a>  that's what makes up the bulk of that $2.1 million that our <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2575.364s">Even</a>  if we do nothing different, if we have no strategic priorities, if we make no investments, and if we provide no compensation increases other than those that are contractually obligated to provide, we're looking at about $2 million in increased costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2590.31s">This</a>  second category, again, there's a range because there are some strategic decisions that have to be made, and there is some overlap between how we can potentially fund some of these priorities <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2605.067s">And</a>  there's a domino effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2606.428s">So</a>  if we make one strategic decision, there's potential savings that are realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2610.769s">And</a>  so it's impossible at this point to put an exact number on what our instructional operational necessities will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2618.753s">But</a>  at this point throughout the development process and after close to 25 meetings in which we've discussed all these issues, we can narrow it to a range of $500,000 to 1.75 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2626.616s">What</a>  that essentially means is that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2631.47s">If</a>  the increase is less than $500,000, there are difficult decisions that have to be made and savings and efficiencies that have to be recognized over and above our sort of normal fiscal stewardship responsibilities to identify those efficiencies on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2646.454s">And</a>  if we're north of $2 million, again, with no compensation increases beyond those that are contractually owed, then we're in a particularly healthy position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2657.92s">we</a>  want to make sure that we're making the most strategic use of all resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2662.921s">In</a>  the third category, again, a lot of variability because there are things that are uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2668.443s">We</a>  have to make some strategic decisions about, from a maintenance and technology perspective, what's the timeline in which we'll adhere to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2675.745s">So</a>  that's one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2677.885s">There's</a>  also close to 10 collective bargaining agreements that are expiring this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2683.747s">And</a>  so there are no contractually owed increases, but we're <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2687.941s">beginning</a>  to, we'll be entering into those discussions with our bargaining partners in the coming weeks and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2693.846s">And</a>  so we need to understand that there's the potential costs as we go into those discussions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2699.771s">And</a>  then obviously the uncertainty related to the federal funding, which we'll discuss on this next slide, which is that neither the district nor the city have received the guidance that we need to with regard to restrictions around the SO3 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2713.081s">And</a>  so we know that <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2715.608s">There</a>  are a series of COVID mitigation related expenses that the district is likely to incur, or not likely, it certainly has and will continue to incur. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2725.05s">And</a>  we're grateful to have that funding available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2728.291s">But</a>  it's also the case that we have operating expenses that are going to escalate to some degree as explained in that previous slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2735.892s">And</a>  so you've seen on the left the information before about how the 4.3 million has been broken down through our partnership with the city and through the funding that's been made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2745.785s">both</a>  from the federal government and from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2748.266s">And</a>  what we're looking at here with regard to ESSA 2 and ESSA 3, it's $7.6 million, which is a healthy amount and something that we'll make sure that we make good use of in terms of those investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2760.749s">It's</a>  also an amount that has to be spread out over a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2763.869s">And</a>  so while it's always possible that there'll be additional funding sources that will be realized, our planning really has to encompass the next two to three fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2773.372s">And</a>  so hopefully, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2774.634s">the</a>  economy improves, revenue improves, and so we're in a more favorable position in the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2779.976s">But</a>  as of right now, we are not in a position to look at this as $7.6 million solely for fiscal year 22, which is just another piece of the equation that we have to take into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2792.139s">And</a>  those bullet points you'll see on the right, those are what you're likely to see as we begin to present on those priorities and begin to have those discussions with the school committee and to inform the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2804.561s">And</a>  so just a final takeaways here, with regard to input 21, again, we're projecting a modest surplus, more or less in line with where we hope to finish the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2815.948s">We</a>  do have a food services deficit that at least for the moment is requiring us to maintain our current spending and hiring freeze, partial spending hiring freeze. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2825.814s">We</a>  are approving emergency expenses that have a certain urgency with regard to this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2832.448s">The</a>  range with regard to the projected increase, I'm going to estimate right now is 3.4 to 5.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2839.391s">I</a>  understand that that's a wide window. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2841.952s">But</a>  again, there are a number of variables ranging from collective bargaining to the federal stimulus to potential other efficiencies that we're able to recognize and enforce internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2855.437s">And</a>  so that is what that delta represents and what it's attributable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2862.142s">There</a>  will be COVID related expenses, we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2864.805s">And</a>  we also know that there's uncertainty that the city of Medford is facing and that all cities and towns across the Commonwealth are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2874.394s">And</a>  so as a result of that, we are continuing to explore all possible savings and efficiencies to make sure that we're able to bridge whatever gap we responsibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2885.064s">We</a>  do not have a <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2887.089s">5.8</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2887.65s">And</a>  frankly, we don't have a $3.4 million savings that is available to us internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2892.712s">We</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2895.154s">And</a>  we want to be honest and transparent about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2898.355s">But</a>  at the same time, as any $62.3 million taxpayer-funded enterprise does, we have a responsibility to continue to look internally to make sure that we are being good fiscal stewards and recognizing and realizing efficiencies wherever we are able to find them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2916.55s">So</a>  I recognize that's a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2919.071s">I'm</a>  happy to share this information with you after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2923.473s">These</a>  numbers are relatively fluid, but the wide range between 3.4 and 5.8 is intended to create space for us to move within that range. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2935.239s">So</a>  I don't anticipate you'll be hearing recommendations that would exceed 5.8, and I don't anticipate any recommendations that would <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2944.15s">would</a>  be less than 3.4 going into FY 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2948.453s">And</a>  again, I'm happy to get into more details about any or all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2955.798s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2960.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2961.421s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2964.465s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2965.146s">And</a>  I just wanted to add for members of the community, obviously the committee of the whole budget meetings are the place where a lot of this nitty gritty detail comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2973.132s">And</a>  I wanted to ask, I know with the pandemic last year, it was difficult to get binders around this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2979.238s">And</a>  I don't know about my colleagues, but for me, I work much better with the tactile budget binders with the ability to move back and forth during the meetings, what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2989.086s">So</a>  will we be getting those this session?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=2994.152s">I</a>  don't have any reason to think you wouldn't be receiving bindings if that's the committee's preference.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3000.074s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3000.414s">That'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3009.337s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3011.297s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3012.478s">We</a>  also passed the motion last <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3015.667s">June,</a>  July, August, it all runs together to get updated binders, because I mean, we do literally, I mean, I know most of us probably keep these right at the ready, but this is the binder we use to approve the budget that is absolutely not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3030.555s">So,</a>  you know, you put 62.3 million on that slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3035.417s">This</a>  does not say 62.3 million, neither does the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3038.959s">I</a>  go to the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3040.74s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3042.735s">I'm</a>  not saying 62.3 is not correct, because I know that that is money that came in out of the normal process, but the documents that the public will look at 20 years from now, I looked at 20 years of our city budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3055.565s">They</a>  can't be lies, they can't be fictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3058.467s">We</a>  need a budget document that actually reflects what the budget was, or a very rational person looking at the actual documents we approved will say in perpetuity that our budget last year was 61.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3073.279s">And</a>  I don't want us to be in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3076.541s">I</a>  need to know what the budget was. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3078.442s">And</a>  I feel like I still don't even know because there's this other number that we never approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3083.385s">And</a>  I think we're the only ones who statutorily are allowed to approve a budget.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3088.208s">Well,</a>  the first thing I'll say just because the word lies was used is that I really can't say strongly enough that there's no intention to provide any lies to the school community or the community with regard to this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3101.797s">The</a>  second thing I will say is that this school district budget, like all school district budget, is comprised of multiple funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3109.083s">The</a>  62.3 is, as was discussed in these slides and previous ones, the operating budget comprised of the Chapter 70 allocation and the local contribution from the municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3121.813s">There</a>  are external funds, as there are every year, Title I, Perkins grants, 242 grants, and special ed <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3130.027s">a</a>  variety of other sources that come in that in this district amount to in the range of $2 million or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3136.969s">That</a>  also does not include the 4.3 to 4.6 that was represented here with regard to the COVID relief funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3146.811s">And</a>  so everyone will have a binder and it will spell out in as much detail as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3154.292s">I</a>  wasn't here, so I can't speak to where those inaccuracies <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3158.737s">what</a>  they might be attributable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3159.978s">I</a>  will say that my team and I have spent a significant amount of time and I imagine we'll be spending a considerable amount of more time in the coming weeks and months attempting to align the budget lines with the appropriate budget categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3184.256s">And</a>  there are four budget <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3188.275s">$63</a>  million and eight or 900 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3192.597s">It</a>  does seem to be that historically there have been a number of budget charges, meaning people's salary being charged to the wrong lines, which I think creates confusion and a lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3209.182s">I</a>  have no, I've seen no evidence of any intent on anyone's part. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3214.844s">I</a>  think there are probably, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3217.744s">So</a>  usually the way that happens is that there's a year where there's an account that's short. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3223.527s">And</a>  so someone's salary is charged to a different account, sometimes off the operating budget into revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3230.011s">And</a>  then the next year somebody else's is, and then it just sort of compounds itself and nobody goes through and actually cleans it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3237.976s">We've</a>  spent a good amount of time this year attempting to clean that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3241.278s">And</a>  so when you look at the binder that's being discussed and it has the columns for <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3246.057s">FY21</a>  versus FY20 versus FY22, you'll see some variability that doesn't necessarily represent any type of strategic decision on the part of the district, as much as it represents an attempt to put people in the appropriate groupings so that it can be clearer to the public, both contemporaneously and historically, where the personnel was sitting, what they were doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3276.01s">And</a>  I think it's just, it's a necessary correction that has to be made for purposes of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3282.455s">But</a>  the committee should know there is a significant amount of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3287.358s">And</a>  I can't frankly say with certainty that we're gonna catch every single one. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3293.162s">I</a>  can tell you that we've caught a number of them and I think it will be more accurate and I think it will be more transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3299.399s">But</a>  it's $63 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3301.02s">And</a>  I can't say I can't make a guarantee that there won't be times where you'll find something that should be charged through a different account. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3307.924s">But</a>  in terms of the total number, it's 62.3 plus the external funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3313.087s">And</a>  I have no basis to think otherwise, at least at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3319.33s">What</a>  I want to be clear is, again, I know there are <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3321.321s">They're</a>  members of the community for whom this might be the one discussion about the budget they hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3325.724s">I</a>  don't want people walking away thinking that you as members of the committee have a binder of $62.3 million, but there's actually 72, and we just don't tell anybody how we spend that other 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3337.152s">It's</a>  that there are other funding sources that are all discussed publicly that are deliberated on and I think we're transparent about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3349.296s">it's</a>  not all as neat and tidy as just the 60.2.3 and nothing else.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3358.152s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3359.575s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3361.605s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3362.765s">Just</a>  this is kind of a housekeeping comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3366.807s">Because</a>  of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3374.99s">We're</a>  going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3379.932s">Additionally,</a>  and I particularly want to <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3384.024s">highlight</a>  this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3392.266s">We'd</a>  like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3401.908s">And</a>  that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3413.611s">So</a>  after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3423.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3430.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3431.186s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3435.83s">What</a>  is the city's allocation to the school district this year?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3443.137s">I</a>  don't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3444.298s">I've</a>  had ongoing discussions with the city CFO and as we've reported to the committee previously, we have meet routinely the two finance teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3456.763s">And</a>  so I have shared this information with the city's finance team with regard to essentially the three brackets and what we're projecting as a range for a likely increase or a necessary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3470.02s">but</a>  I don't have an official number at, to the best of my knowledge, I don't have the official number and I don't, to go back to the sequence that we discussed the previous presentation, the committee will vote on a request that will go to the city, excuse me, the superintendent will make a recommendation to the committee, which will then make a request to the city, at which point an appropriation will be made.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3496.422s">So</a>  we've changed the process because it used to be that the city provided the number and we worked to it.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3502.906s">So</a>  what I'm talking about is the formal process that is sort of reflected by the Massachusetts law with regard to the sequence that the city informally provides a number of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3517.476s">They're</a>  certainly welcome to do that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3521.546s">Okay,</a>  I'm glad to hear we're following the law as it's been laid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3526.948s">The</a>  other comment that I will make for my colleagues is that when I think about the budget and how we move forward, we need to be thinking about the funds that we did not receive last year, and then a modest increase on top of that, which does put us into the neighborhood of A plus B plus C on Mr. Murphy's slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3552.134s">As</a>  far as I can tell, that really represents restoring the district from the layoffs, the pink slips, and all the other things that we had to do last year, given the funding issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3570.195s">And</a>  I will <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3572.751s">be</a>  looking to make sure that we are funding the things that we promised last year, like middle school health and reading specialists and addressing dyslexia in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3583.257s">So</a>  I'm hopeful and we've had great conversations on the curriculum subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3586.719s">So</a>  I am hopeful that the city is preparing for that, especially with the significant infusion of cash from the federal government coming our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3596.945s">So</a>  that is what I will be looking for as we go into the budget meetings and <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3602.203s">I</a>  hope that we don't have to pink slip hundreds of teachers again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3609.092s">Oh,</a>  and the last thing I'll say is I'm also hopeful that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3613.762s">Um</a>  do right by the staff across lots of bargaining units that have helped us navigate through this pandemic as we talk about, um, the negotiation of many collective bargaining agreements and central to those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3632.717s">Of</a>  course, and reasonably are cost of living increases, and we as a city need to be prepared to Come to those conversations in good faith.</p>
