1
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:13,070
The fourth regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,412
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:17,994
Present.

4
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:20,595
Five present, two absent,

5
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:37,683
Please rise to salute the flag.

6
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:51,227
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

7
00:00:51,267 --> 00:01:01,011
Just for the knowledge of those here present, both counselors who are present tonight called to inform me of their absence.

8
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,512
Counselor Carviello has a family

9
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:09,355
medical emergency, and Councillor Camuso is feeling ill.

10
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:27,889
So, item number 15, 025, offered by Councillor Penta, be it resolved that pursuant to Council Resolution 14472 of May 20th, 2014, presented by the Mayor, allowing him to negotiate up to a 10-year

11
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:58,858
parking contract is passed and voted upon by the City Council, inclusive of Councilor Penta's amendment, exactly stating that the Council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding, so as amended, that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, to present themselves before the Council before the finalization of the contract, unquote.

12
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,699
The Council voted 7-0, approval as amended.

13
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:30,146
and since many Medford business owners and Medford citizenry never had an open public opportunity for input, discussions, concerns on this implementation, option alternatives, and since the council never met pursuant to council resolution 14472 as amended before the finalization of the contract, therefore now to clarify any individual councilor or city council position,

14
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:48,843
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council take an official position as to whether they support Mayor McGlynn's October 17, 2014 signed contract for a pay to park kiosk revenue enhancement program with the Republic Company from Tennessee.

15
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:51,723
Councilor Penta?

16
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:53,724
Mr. President,

17
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:59,852
This has really been a tough week, as we all know, between the snow and everything else.

18
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:07,838
Councillor, if I could, we have two council members absent, and this item is rather important.

19
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:25,072
I'm wondering that it would be best for us to table it before we have any discussion on it or vote on it, since it is a rather grave subject under whose orderliness, for our consideration, I have doubts.

20
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,683
So I'd appreciate it if you'd lay it on the table for a week, so that.

21
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,003
Well, I was leaning to that.

22
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:33,225
I was just making a preemptory comment.

23
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:34,025
Thank you.

24
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,546
I see the chief here tonight.

25
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:37,247
Chief, is he here?

26
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:38,027
Yeah.

27
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:38,547
Okay.

28
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:43,390
No, um, I have no, uh, chief, uh, this is my resolution.

29
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,574
As you know, that it's on the agenda for this evening, but in no way do I want that to interfere with any comments that you might be having as it relates to the paid a parking program.

30
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:52,634
So, okay.

31
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:53,274
All right.

32
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:54,395
So with that being said, um,

33
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:56,567
I have no problem laying it on the table.

34
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:04,089
You want to wait for Councilor Caviello, because I really don't know when Councilor Camus is coming back, how serious he is, sick or what.

35
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,391
We'll lay it on the table for the rest of the meeting.

36
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,392
Until we have all seven councilors present.

37
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:16,153
So on motion of Councilor Penta that this item be tabled.

38
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,253
All those in favor?

39
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:17,993
All those opposed?

40
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,374
Item's tabled.

41
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:19,414
15-027.

42
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,414
Councillor Longo-Kern for suspension of the rules.

43
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:27,874
Councillor?

44
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,355
I take paper 15-026.

45
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:32,497
Paper 15-026.

46
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:40,322
Is this the... Request for expenditure from law department claims over $1,000.

47
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:44,204
On the motion for suspension to take item out of order on Councillor Longo-Kern.

48
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:44,945
All those in favour?

49
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,126
All those opposed?

50
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,027
Item number 15-026.

51
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,149
Request for expenditure from law department claims over $1,000.

52
00:04:54,268 --> 00:05:05,137
Number 10-151-5762 to the President and members of the Honorable Medford City Council, January 23rd, 2015.

53
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:11,902

00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:13,884

00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:15,025

Amount of request, $5,000.

58
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:28,584
Claimant's attorney, Santo J. Aruma, Esquire.

59
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,305
Description of alleged claim.

60
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:47,560
The claimant, Nancy J. Avalone, 9 Seaborne Place, Lexington, Mass., 02420, seeks compensation for injuries suffered as a result of a sidewalk defect, namely a sinkhole located on Governor's Avenue near the corner of High Street and Medford, Massachusetts.

61
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,302
Her injury occurred on November 7, 2014.

62
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,842
As a result of her fall, she sustained a fracture of her right lateral tibia plateau, requiring hospitalization.

63
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:04,163
She received immediate emergency treatment at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, as well as physical therapy at Newton Wellesley Hospital.

64
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,664
Her medical bills were in excess of $7,747.

65
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:11,485
The necessary releases have been obtained from the claimant.

66
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:14,806
The alleged defect was repaired after the accident.

67
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,647
Breakdown of the amount requested, medical costs, $7,000.

68
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:24,519
$747.75, lost wages zero, property damage zero, others zero.

69
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:31,482
Total settlement of $5,000, representative from the office of the city solicitor is here.

70
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:32,742
Chair awaits a motion.

71
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:33,963
Move for approval, Mr. President.

72
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:43,286
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, where this is a matter of this amount of money, we require a roll call vote.

73
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,747
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

74
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,588
Before the roll is called, Councilor Marks.

75
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:54,829
Mr. President, this particular area where the injury occurred is a high-traveled area.

76
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,732
It's the corner of High Street and Governor's Ave.

77
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:06,759
So I would ask that DPW be on notification if they're not already about this particular sinkhole and that something immediately be done at that site.

78
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,402
If I could, do you have any information for us on that matter?

79
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,082
Mr. President, if I may.

80
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:12,203
Councillor Knight.

81
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:14,365
At the bottom of the paper submitted by the Mayor's Office,

82
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:18,878
The alleged defect has been repaired after the accident pursuant to the paper that's before us.

83
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,379
It doesn't give the date though.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,280
Okay.

85
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,042
Do you have the date?

86
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,724
It looks like the date of accident was 11, 7, 14.

87
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:29,487
And it looks like the alleged defect was repaired after the accident.

88
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:30,248
That's what the paper says.

89
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:33,751
We'll allow the assistant solicitor of the city to answer the question.

90
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,052
Thank you, Mr. President.

91
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:39,375
Kimberly Scanlon, assistant city solicitor, 75 Ashcroft road.

92
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,238
And to answer your question, counselor, I,

93
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:50,179
believe it was after a week after, excuse me, a week later, um, after November 7th when the incident occurred.

94
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:54,942
I can, however, if it would please the council, um, check and get an exact date and get back to you.

95
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,664
If you would just send that to the council.

96
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:58,085
Sure.

97
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:02,929
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

98
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,389
Mr. President.

99
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:04,550
Uh, Councilor Penta.

100
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,471
Another question.

101
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,992
Um, um,

102
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:11,591
I'm trying to get the visualization.

103
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,492
Is this on the side of the street where Colleen's is on?

104
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,012
Is that the hole?

105
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:15,972
The hole that was there?

106
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:16,392
Yes.

107
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:17,092
OK.

108
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:22,714
If I remember correctly, too, on that particular hole that continuously started to sink, it was getting larger and larger.

109
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:28,455
And the unfortunate part about it, I know some business merchants had called up until it almost actually caved in.

110
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:39,077
And that's the place some months earlier, many months earlier, I believe the MWRA was there as they were addressing a water leak on that particular part of the street.

111
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:41,649
I believe, on a connection, and it was filled in.

112
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:54,838
And I think on this one here, I think, if I remember correctly, it's where the sinkhole is going next to the curb, but it was right by the curb, and it just kept sinking, and it kept going in and in and in.

113
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:05,446
So maybe the better issue is you can get back to us when it was done, but just how fragile is that particular?

114
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,447
A lot of work has been done in that area over there.

115
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:12,522
And maybe if we can get just an update from DPW, if we can add to the resolution.

116
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,444
We'll add that as an amendment, Councilor.

117
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,405
Yeah, to check that into the fragility.

118
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,546
Is that such a word?

119
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:18,607
Yeah, I think it's fragility.

120
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,608
That is a word, Councilor, yes.

121
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:19,868
I know.

122
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:23,050
The fragility of the ground and the land in that particular area.

123
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,351
Thank you, Councilor.

124
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,272
Councilor Long-Beaucourt.

125
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,012
Thank you.

126
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,313
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

127
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:34,859
Just on a B paper, if we could also discuss with the Department of Public Works the sinkhole in front of Anthony's Liquor.

128
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,714
It was brought to my attention this week.

129
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:41,194
There's a sinkhole and people are backing up.

130
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,335
It's, I believe, around the sewer, sewer caps.

131
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:54,277
So if we could send that to the, I'm gonna email Department of Public Works tomorrow, but if we could also send a paper to them, ask them to go check it out before somebody gets hurt.

132
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:56,718
Thank you, Councilor.

133
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:58,939
As amended by Councilor Longo Kern.

134
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,859
On the motion, main motion of approval by Councilor Knight.

135
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,520
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

136
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,221
Councilor Camuso, Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight.

137
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:12,502
Yes.

138
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,304
Vice President Longo Kern.

139
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:14,404
Yes.

140
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:15,865
Councilor Mox.

141
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:16,145
Yes.

142
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:17,406
Councilor Penta.

143
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:17,526
Yes.

144
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:19,308
President DelaRusso.

145
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,288
Yes.

146
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,810
The vote of five in the affirmative, two absent.

147
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,671
The motion passes.

148
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:24,672
Thank you.

149
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:26,133
Thank you.

150
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:27,214
Councilor Penta.

151
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:31,798
I like to, um, can we just move the consideration of the paper we laid in the table?

152
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:33,779
I just like to bring that up.

153
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,861
I want to do something different with it on the paper.

154
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:40,418
On the motion for reconsideration for the tabled paper.

155
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:40,958
Right.

156
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:45,619
Uh, 15 Oh, 25, 15 Oh, 25.

157
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,219
Uh, for the motion of reconsideration, all those in favor.

158
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,300
Any opposed?

159
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Mr. President, I'm going to, I'd like to move that the paper be withdrawn.

160
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:03,242
And what I'll do is I'll just introduce it next week as a separate resolution on the motion that this paper be withdrawn by a counselor Penta.

161
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,442
All those in favor.

162
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:05,762
All those opposed.

163
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:11,813
The paper 15-025 is withdrawn.

164
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:35,138
Item number 15-027 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that pursuant to citizen and council concerns over the recently enacted tiered water and sewer rate billing, be it acknowledged that on behalf of our Medford water and sewer rate payers, a thank you be extended to the Water and Sewer Commission and staff

165
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:43,552
for their review and adjusted rate structure, allowing for a fairer tiered system rate billing.

166
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:44,573
Counselor Pinto.

167
00:11:44,853 --> 00:12:00,500
Mr. President, we all know that when this new implementation took place, going to a tiered rate system, there was some pushback as it relates to the tier 1, 2, and 3 setup that originally started off at 0 to 800

168
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:07,452
cubic feet, 801 cubic feet to 1,600 cubic feet, and then from 1,600 cubic feet and up.

169
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:16,798
And there was a lot of concern that was, I believe, expressed here at the council meeting, and also, likewise expressed, I think, to the Water and Sewer Rate Commissioners.

170
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:30,427
But through their staff, led by Ron Baker, who was in charge, and he is, I believe, he's the operations supervisor over this, the request was made not only by the council, but to the commission that maybe we should just look at

171
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:42,424
on a percentage basis, just where are we going on this tiered rate system because, in essence, it did turn out to be a water rate increase for certain members.

172
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:49,410
Most recently, at the last Water and Sewer Commission, there was an adjustment that did take place.

173
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:56,497
I had made the suggestion that we should look at the first billing that goes out and just see how many people fall within that 0 to 800.

174
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:03,801
Because at that point in time when they did it, it was an estimation of the same thing with tier 2 and the same thing with tier 3.

175
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:13,743
They've now gone into a revised tier system, which now puts you into the tier 1 system up to the first 1,000 cubic feet.

176
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:26,907
And tier 2 goes from 1,000 to 2,000, and tier 3 goes from 2,000 and up, which is a significant, not large, but it's a significant increase

177
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:34,926
as it relates to giving homeowners an opportunity to receive a benefit as it relates to the increase.

178
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:48,271
So if I understand that chart correctly here, the billing cycle as it will go onto this new rate system will be as follows.

179
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:53,773
I believe you're getting to an approximate amount

180
00:13:56,405 --> 00:14:01,208
76% from 66 to 76% of the single-family homes.

181
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,410
Condos will go from 82 to 90%.

182
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,193
And these are keeping the people in the 0 to 1,000 mark.

183
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,094
The two-family will go from 76 to 85.

184
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:13,577
The three-families will go from 79% to 87.

185
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:15,838
And the four-family will go from 68.

186
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,000
And that basically stayed the same at 68%.

187
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,023
Taking all this into consideration,

188
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:29,079
What it represents financially to the city is the following amount total.

189
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,041
It's a savings of $69,230 and overall condos overall in the city will save approximately $39,363.

190
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,241
Single families will come up to $21,881.

191
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,242
Two families will come up to $6,888.

192
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,803
And the three families, there's a saving of $1,096 total overall.

193
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,153
With that being said, the opportunity is now increased for more savings.

194
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:12,422
I believe, if I understand all of this correctly, that once you get to that zero to 1,000 mark, you go to 1,001, you'll only be charged a difference between 1,000 and 1,001 if you fall into that second tier system.

195
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:17,885
And it would be the same argument going forward for the one to the two and the two and the two and the top.

196
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,588
I want to thank Mr. Baker in particular and his working crew

197
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:52,480
the board for recognizing the fact that we need a little bit more equity in this water and sewer rate structure, since in fact it's an $8.5 million surplus sitting over there, and since in fact the mayor has yet to present anything to us that talks about a water and sewer street construction or water and sewer improvements in this community, and as the law writes itself, it basically says it either has to go to that type of a component, a water and sewer street reconstruction or water and sewer reconstruction,

198
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:55,103
or the money has to go back to the rate payers.

199
00:15:55,623 --> 00:16:01,965
So I would hope that this is probably somewhat of a first step at looking at where we're going with this excess money that we have.

200
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:16,287
Also, with the tiered system that the council on numerous occasions has spoken to about, and now we'll have an opportunity to see it by increasing from 800 to 1,000 and from 1,600 to 2,000, the max on both, that's 200 cubic feet in the water, it's 400 cubic feet

201
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:26,158
Tier 2, which is the commercial rate, and above that, it's everyone else that uses it.

202
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:27,739
It's a high volume group and density.

203
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,721
I think it's a good start.

204
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:35,425
And once we get those adjustments recalculated, we'll have a better idea as to where we're going.

205
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:39,848
But as it stands right now, I believe this will take effect.

206
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:43,670
If I understand this, it's the next billing cycle, not the one that we just had.

207
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,252
I believe it's the next billing cycle.

208
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:50,095
So with that being said, I just thought

209
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:55,610
They should be noticed out, and taxpayers should be aware of it, and people who did it should be recognized.

210
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,792
Thank you for your efforts in this matter, Counselor.

211
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,753
Sir, do you wish to speak on this matter?

212
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:00,314
Yes, sir.

213
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,995
Please state your name and address for the record.

214
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:04,497
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

215
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,938
Thank you, President De La Russo.

216
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:17,986
I'm a little bit confused because this council voted when the budget was being passed to amend the budget

217
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:20,003
by some $600,000.

218
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:27,665
That amendment was passed, but then His Honor the mayor vetoed it, but he signed the amended budget.

219
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:32,567
So how does that $600,000 figure into this tiered water rate?

220
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,607
Can I answer that?

221
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:35,908
Counselor Penter, if you could, yes.

222
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:42,630
I believe that's a separate issue as it relates to how the Water and Sewer Commission has now gotten into it.

223
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,111
We did not have a tiered rate system at that point in time.

224
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:45,931
The tiered rate system

225
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,454
I believe came in October, November of this past year.

226
00:17:49,014 --> 00:18:01,081
As a result of that, and because of the pushback and the concerns from rate payers and taxpayers, their initial tier one, two, and three systems had somewhat of a concern with people as to the charges.

227
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:08,684
So listening to not only the council, council members and taxpayers, they bumped it up to zero to 1,000 instead of zero to 800.

228
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:12,646
And the 1,000 now goes to one to 2,000 and 2,000 plus coming up to be the max.

229
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:25,777
There are representative percentages as it relates to your water bill that's coming forward, how and what the mayor is going to do relative to the 600,000 that the council cut out.

230
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,838
We still haven't seen that and have no idea.

231
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:36,804
And you know, as we know, each and every year for the last four years, there's been a million dollar surplus or thereabouts sitting in a, and that's how we get in our free cash.

232
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:40,007
So, so maybe that's how it's just going to Peter itself out at the end of the year.

233
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:40,367
I don't know.

234
00:18:41,111 --> 00:19:08,937
Well, if I may, I specifically returned to this podium and I asked the direct question, does this amendment mean, at the time, the MWRA wanted to raise our rates by 10%, but then after this whole debate and passing of the amendment for the $600,000 to come out, I returned and I asked specifically, and I believe it was the Honorable Michael Marks who said the answer to my question, which was,

235
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:12,669
Does this mean that nobody in Medford will see a water rate increase?

236
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,931
And the answer was directly given to me, yes.

237
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:23,656
Now you're saying that under this tiered rate, some people are actually and some businesses are actually going to see somewhat of an increase?

238
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,097
Let's go.

239
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,378
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

240
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:33,702
Mr. Capuccia, I think when you have to look at the tiered rate system, you'll see that everybody that falls under tier one will be paying

241
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:36,039
generally the same rate that they were paying last year.

242
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,260
It's a conservation measure.

243
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,801
So it's really based on consumption.

244
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:44,105
So if you conserve your water usage, you won't see an increase if you stay within that tier.

245
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,108
However, if you bump up out of that tier, you will see an increase.

246
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:48,288
But it's a conservation measure.

247
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:49,970
It's not necessarily a budgetary item.

248
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,774
I think that the reason that the tiered rate system is going into place more so is for environmental concerns and for conservation issues.

249
00:19:56,174 --> 00:20:00,838
And I think to control the increases that we're going to see in the future from the MWRA based on our consumption.

250
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,300
point of further clarification.

251
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,561
Point of further clarification, Councilor, Vice President.

252
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:15,544
Maybe Councilor Pinto is going to say that, but once you bump into that second tier, you're only going to pay the additional cost for the amount of usage that goes from the first tier to the second tier.

253
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:18,885
So you won't necessarily get bumped up on your whole water usage.

254
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,165
It will just be for the additional.

255
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,146
And that's the same thing for the third tier.

256
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,987
So if you have a pool, you fill the pool with the third tier, you're going to pay that extra, that extra fee.

257
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:32,864
I want to get back.

258
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,866
Are you satisfied with your response?

259
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:35,966
Thank you.

260
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:38,788
You're right about the increase.

261
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:41,409
I believe it was a 10% or 11% increase.

262
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,491
That represented the $600,000 in the budget.

263
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:51,915
And I believe that the four members of the council who voted to eliminate that out of the budget was because of the fact that we had an $8.5 million surplus.

264
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:58,438
And because we had $8.5 million surplus, why should we be going out and taxing on that particular part?

265
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:10,425
This here is something, apparently, that goes back, I believe, to April or May of 2014, when they first had a discussion on a rate system.

266
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:15,868
I think it was Councilman Marks who originally brought up the issue on the more you use, the more you pay in commercial vendors.

267
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:24,093
And I think this goes back to the former city engineer, who supposedly was in charge of whatever he was in charge of.

268
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:24,473
I don't know.

269
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:35,224
But to get to this point here, it's a combination of not only conservation, but I think it's also a slow way of maybe addressing any increase that might be taking place in the future.

270
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:43,790
But this also has a component with the EPA, the federal EPA coming in here looking at a conservation method as it relates to water usage.

271
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:47,313
And they have this broken down, what they think per person, whatever it might be.

272
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:52,216
Of course, the argument to that is if you have two or three or four kids in the family, that's all down the drain anyway.

273
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,237
But that's neither here nor there.

274
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:54,937
So this is a beginning.

275
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,358
This isn't a do all, be all.

276
00:21:56,418 --> 00:22:01,022
It's a beginning to not only do the conservation, but once again, we see what the numbers and other numbers come in.

277
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,025
And if it works, it works.

278
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,086
If it doesn't work, then we're going to have to look at it again.

279
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:10,210
But it's better than going up with the rates and the cost.

280
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,732
It's coming down to all four categories.

281
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,335
Single family, condo, two family, and three family.

282
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,976
Four families all stayed the same.

283
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:20,879
Thank you very much, councillors.

284
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,420
And just one final point.

285
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:48,843
with all the snow that we have and we still have the water pipes cracked, when all this starts melting in the spring with spring rains and this all starts pouring out in the Boston Harbor, I would just respectfully request that this body send a letter to the state level and let them know about our water pipe conditions and not, you know, to calculate it as raw sewage, as I heard it

286
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,275
been said in the past.

287
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:52,556
If it goes in the storm drains, then it won't be.

288
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:52,997
Right.

289
00:22:53,397 --> 00:23:18,448
Well, with new Governor Baker facing an even larger budget deficit than which was once perceived in cuts coming that are going to be coming very soon, I just want to request that we let the state know about our water pipe problem here and try to keep as much money in Medford for our infrastructure, police,

290
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,617
education, and whatnot.

291
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:23,239
But thank you all so very much for those great answers.

292
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:23,779
Thank you.

293
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:24,820
Thank you, Honorable.

294
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,780
Continue on that further?

295
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,042
I was going to do that.

296
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:28,782
That's my last point.

297
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:29,603
So you just brought it up.

298
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:30,543
So I want to thank you for that.

299
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:39,069
I think, from what I understand from my involvement with Mass Municipal Association, cities and towns are now getting together just as it relates to that particular point.

300
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:48,915
So maybe at the outset, and I don't know how to begin this, but maybe at the outset, maybe it should be City of Medford writes something to our state legislation or maybe to the MWRA and ask them

301
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,932
for them to set up some type of a system, maybe during certain months of the year, knowing where there's a lot of snowfall, that a lot of that water may go down the drain.

302
00:23:55,952 --> 00:24:00,653
Because they can tell you the increase, the amount of the increase of the water flow.

303
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:08,315
It's obvious that some kind of a consideration is given or some kind of credit is given or whatever it might be, because it doesn't happen all the time.

304
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:09,555
It's only at this time of the year.

305
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,476
So thank you for bringing it up.

306
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:11,876
Thank you, council.

307
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:12,496
Thank you.

308
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:14,317
On the motion of council, Pinto for approval.

309
00:24:14,357 --> 00:24:15,097
All those in favor?

310
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,808
All those opposed, the motion passes.

311
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:22,249
Motion to suspend the rules by Councilor Knight.

312
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:27,270
I'd like to take paper number 15032 out of order, please.

313
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:33,252
Motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of rules.

314
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:33,992
All those in favor?

315
00:24:34,012 --> 00:24:34,712
All those opposed?

316
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:35,933
It was suspended.

317
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:38,353
Take one item out of order.

318
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:43,755
Item number 15-032, petition for common vigilance license by

319
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:56,165
Juksing Stafo, 172 Spring Street, Medford Mass for Classic Cafe, 174 Spring Street, Medford.

320
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:01,088
We turn it over to Councilor Knight for recommendation.

321
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:06,771
Would the petitioner please step forward to the podium and state your name and address for the record.

322
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,372
Councilor Marks also has the paper.

323
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:13,633
Carvey.

324
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,814
I yield the floor, Mr. President, to the chairman of the committee.

325
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:16,455
I didn't see him walk in.

326
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,676
Thank you, Mr. President.

327
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:21,058
I reviewed the papers, and I do find them in order.

328
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,199
A couple of quick questions.

329
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:25,061
What type of food are you going to be serving there?

330
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,062
Mostly breakfast and lunch.

331
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,083
Breakfast and lunch?

332
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:28,924
Yes.

333
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,905
And so just morning and afternoon hours?

334
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:31,445
Yes.

335
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:36,669
And I assume, by the address, you're going to be living in the house that's attached to it?

336
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:37,130
Yes.

337
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:38,911
OK.

338
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:43,338
Everything seems in order.

339
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,319
I have a motion for approval.

340
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,341
On the motion for approval, uh, Councilor Carvell, Councilor Max, did you wish to speak on this?

341
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:50,802
All those in favor?

342
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:52,183
All those opposed?

343
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:53,423
License granted.

344
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:54,164
Congratulations.

345
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:54,564
Congratulations.

346
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:55,024
Thank you guys.

347
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,024
Good luck.

348
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:02,187
On the motion of, uh, Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business.

349
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,468
All those in favor?

350
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:04,248
All those opposed?

351
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,930
Item number 15-028 offered by Councilor Knight.

352
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,952
Be it resolved, uh, the Office of Community Development

353
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:30,395
Building Department and Zoning Board examine rezoning options at the site of the Meadow Glen Mall and the site of the former Shaw's Supermarket for the purpose of integrating mixed-use development at these locations and report back to the council their findings and recommendations.

354
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:31,616
Councilor Knight.

355
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,537
Mr. President, thank you very much.

356
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:40,963
I think when you take a look at these two parcels that are in question, the Meadow Glen Mall and the site of the former Shaw's Supermarket that's vacant right now,

357
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:49,434
We have two large parcels of land, and with the appropriate zoning, I feel as though we may be able to generate a mixed-use development of some sort.

358
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:55,436
Now, I think that it's important to note that we could reclassify this area as a mixed-use zoning area, however.

359
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,658
Maybe the use of an overlay district, maybe something that's more appropriate.

360
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:07,657
So that's why I asked that the Office of Community Development, the Building Department, and the Zoning Board take a look at the options that are available there and present with us recommendations.

361
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:20,447
You know, when I drive down Route 16 and I think about the pending construction that's going to happen, I think about stations landing, I think about Assembly Row, I think about the Meadow Glen Mall that we drive past so that we can get to those places.

362
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:27,192
And I think with a little bit of effort and a little bit of hard work, Mr. President, I think we might be able to come up with a zoning recommendation for that area.

363
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,722
that will result in a great turnaround.

364
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:38,588
I think that, you know, when you look at Locust Street and you look at Meadow Glen Mall and you look at the Shaw site, you know, you can have a great vision there of mixed-use development with small commercial, light industrial.

365
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,210
There's a number of housing that's going on there.

366
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:49,096
And I think that it's important also to think about the zoning overlay district because we have existing businesses that are there that we don't want to displace, Mr. President.

367
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,958
So I bring this resolution forward seeking the guidance and input of these three departments.

368
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,181
I've had a number of conversations with our Director of Community Development,

369
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:58,775
I feel as though it does a wonderful job, Mr. President.

370
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:12,598
And in my conversations with her, you know, we've kicked around a number of different ideas, but I think this is something that's going to take the community as a whole to really come up with and see what their vision is and see what they want to live with, Mr. President.

371
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,279
So, you know, I'd like to see a little bit of deliberation on this.

372
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:26,805
a little bit of participation and civic involvement from the residents in the community to paint a picture and come up with some sort of development or some sort of vision that they have for the area for mixed-use development, Mr. President.

373
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:35,947
So I'd ask that my colleagues support this resolution and await the findings of the Building Department, Office of Community Development, and Zoning Board, should they be willing to support this.

374
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:38,848
Thank you for your foresight and your vision in this matter.

375
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:41,969
On the motion of Councillor Knight for approval, all those in favor?

376
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:43,783
All those opposed?

377
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:49,566
Mr. Clerk, if we could mark Councillors Carvielli and Camuso present.

378
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:50,407
Mr. President.

379
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:52,668
Councillor Camuso, I'm glad you're feeling well.

380
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:53,188
Thank you.

381
00:28:53,248 --> 00:29:02,433
I'd just like to say I'm glad I came down this evening with 101 temperature, but with the wisecrack that Councillor Pinto wanted to say about me being sick.

382
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:04,214
So I just wanted to come down.

383
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:06,715
You weren't sure when I was coming back and all this.

384
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:08,656
Yeah.

385
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:11,463
Yes, there was.

386
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:17,005
We'll put the paper on hold for Councilor Caviello, but we don't know when Councilor Camuso's coming back.

387
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:19,505
Thank you, Mr. President.

388
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,586
You're just such a wonderful person.

389
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:26,627
Thank you, Mr. President.

390
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,348
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

391
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:35,229
Item number 15-029, offered by Councilor Knight.

392
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:39,090
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate John McGonigal

393
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:45,397
on his receipt of the Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association's Assistant Coach of the Year Award.

394
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:50,961
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Lonnie Hilson Sr.

395
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:56,225
on his receipt of the Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association's Community Service Award.

396
00:29:56,626 --> 00:30:06,813
Be it further resolved that these individuals be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to receive official commendation recognizing their achievement, Counselor Knight.

397
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,975
Mr. President, thank you very much.

398
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:21,156
Just two short weeks ago, Mr. McGonigal, our assistant coach of the Medford High School Mustang Boys Baseball Team, was presented with the Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association Assistant Coach of the Year Award.

399
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,880
This is a very prestigious award, and I don't think it should go without recognition.

400
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:33,147
Simultaneously, at the same event, a longtime South Medford Little League volunteer, Lonnie Hilson Sr., was given the baseball

401
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:40,612
the Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association Community Service Award for his over 50 years of community involvement and donating of his time, Mr. President.

402
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:48,218
So I think it's only justified that we recognize these two individuals for their commitment to the city of Medford and to the betterment of student athletes here in the community.

403
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:49,939
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

404
00:30:50,480 --> 00:31:03,730
And if I might add from the chair, especially Mr. Hilson has earned a very special place in the hearts of so many of us from South Medford because he was an integral part

405
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:07,853
of so many of our growing up and our involvement in the community.

406
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:12,555
So this is a wonderful, wonderful honor for both of them.

407
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:13,795
Councilor Penta.

408
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:16,116
I'd like to echo your comments, Councilor, Mr. President.

409
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:24,679
Monty Hilson, well recognized within the boys baseball organizations, especially, you know, with the younger children.

410
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:30,301
And I just think it's a fine recognition for long years of service.

411
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:31,421
Absolutely.

412
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,082
On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, all those in favor?

413
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,209
All those opposed?

414
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,390
Motion carries.

415
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,571
15-040 offered by Councilor Penta.

416
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:50,074
Be it resolved that a message of congratulations be sent to Metric Police Lieutenant Michael Goulding upon his being selected the new police chief for the town of Weston.

417
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:51,294
Councilor Penta.

418
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:56,196
Mr. President, Lieutenant Goulding, Michael Goulding is a fine young man.

419
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:59,036
He's had many wonderful years here in the Method Police Department.

420
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:04,018
And I know our chief who's here right now tonight is sorry to see him go, but I think he's,

421
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:11,474
happy to know he's been able to be elevated to a like comparison to him being a chief of another nice community.

422
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:19,819
And I just think it's nice to recognize one of our own achieving this type of a station in their life.

423
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,181
And last night, the town of Western Board of Selectmen voted him in unanimously.

424
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:27,903
So I just think it would be a proper, just to make a public recognition.

425
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:28,664
That's awesome.

426
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:29,624
And he's a good, good man.

427
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:30,205
Yes.

428
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:30,825
Counselor Knight.

429
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,690
Mr. President, Chief Sacco is here.

430
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,311
I think it might be appropriate for Chief Sacco to say a few words on behalf of Mr. Goulding.

431
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,352
If you could.

432
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:38,272
Good evening, everyone.

433
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:41,213
My name is Leo Sacco, police chief here in the city of Medford.

434
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,214
I live at 227 Elm Street in Medford.

435
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:46,315
And you're absolutely right.

436
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:49,176
He's a great guy, very deserving of the job.

437
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:54,478
Tremendous loss for the city of Medford, for the police department, and a tremendous loss for me.

438
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,399
He's always been right there for me with questions and answers.

439
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,140
And give him a task and it gets done.

440
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:03,894
great person, a strong leader.

441
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:07,596
He will do a great job in Western, absolutely a great job in Western.

442
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,838
And it's been a very grueling process.

443
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:18,405
Uh, there were some somewhere around 85 candidates that were selected to go through the process and for him to rise to the top.

444
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:25,531
I think it's a great credit to him, his family and to the city of Medford because this is where he began in 1988.

445
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:26,491
So 27 years later,

446
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:37,969
He's gonna become the chief of police in the town of Westman great opportunity and very well-deserved his whole career He prepared himself for this.

447
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:54,640
So it's it's nice that he was recognized and he went up against a Number of chiefs who had applied for that job that wanted to move from the community that they are in and he he won he did very well in the assessment centers and

448
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:59,259
his interviews and his background speaks for itself, impeccable.

449
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,382
Great family man, great family here at Medford, his own family, the children that he's raising along with his wife.

450
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:10,583
It's a happy time, it's a sad time.

451
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:17,526
I'm very happy for him advancing, but it will be a tremendous loss for the Medford Police Department, for the city of Medford.

452
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,766
But we're all very happy for him.

453
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,527
He had a great mentor too.

454
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,047
I don't know about that.

455
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:24,708
Thank you.

456
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:26,967
I'd just like to congratulate the Lieutenant.

457
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:40,176
You know, he's not only well respected in our community, like the Chief said, but throughout this whole area, whether it's the NMLAC unit, the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, just very, very well respected.

458
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:48,282
And I'm very, very happy to see him moving on, but at the same time, sad because he's such an instrumental part of our police department.

459
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:54,146
I'd also just like to ask the Chief, I don't want to make it a B paper because this is all about Mike,

460
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:58,695
But Chief, do you anticipate to fill the void with him?

461
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:02,537
Because I know we're down to bare bones with patrol officers.

462
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:07,079
I want to make sure that there is a corral ladder and that the job is filled.

463
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:11,200
We hope to fill a lieutenant's rank.

464
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:14,022
I don't know if we'll ever be able to fill the void.

465
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:15,382
Oh, we know that.

466
00:35:15,402 --> 00:35:16,883
We're hoping to fill the position.

467
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:18,337
That's what I'm asking.

468
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:18,658
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:23,480
That's, that's the goal is an outstanding, there's an existing list right now for lieutenants.

470
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,182
Uh, I'm hoping that we can fill that.

471
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:32,164
I know that a Lieutenant Goulding will be leaving early in March for the town of Western.

472
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:36,207
So when the vacancy is real, then we'll request the list.

473
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:36,747
Okay.

474
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,228
Thank you very much.

475
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:38,948
Thank you, chief.

476
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:39,548
Thank you.

477
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,489
Counsel Camuso.

478
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:41,109
Thank you.

479
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:46,712
Counselor Penta for that, uh, that wonderful, uh, resolution and on the motion of council Penta for approval.

480
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:47,904
All those in favour?

481
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:49,225
All those opposed?

482
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,085
The motion passes.

483
00:35:50,766 --> 00:36:06,417
Item number 15-030, be it resolved, offered by Councillor Caraviello, be it resolved that the city look into installing a flashing light and repaint the crosswalk at Le Conte Rink in the matter of public safety.

484
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:07,618
Councillor Caraviello.

485
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:08,699
Thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,282
Mr. President, I received several calls from parents at Le Conte Rink.

487
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,185
A, you know, they're talking about the lighting

488
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,369
coming out of the rink is poor.

489
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:24,232
But when you're crossing the street there, the crosswalk has either been washed here or either been worn away.

490
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:27,114
But there's no flashing light.

491
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:31,076
You've got to remember, you've got people going to the condos and the apartments now.

492
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:35,398
There's no flashing light to tell people that this kid's coming out of there.

493
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:41,922
So if the mayor or whoever's in charge can look into maybe putting a flashing sign there.

494
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:46,705
And I didn't have it on here, but if you look into putting a light outside the rink,

495
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:51,098
because it is dark out there, and repainting the sidewalk.

496
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,280
Thank you for looking into that, Councilor.

497
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:03,209
Could you just amend that, Mr. Clerk, that exterior lighting also be added at the rink site for the matter of public safety?

498
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:06,031
On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

499
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:06,111
Aye.

500
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:07,312
All those opposed?

501
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:10,014
Carries.

502
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:11,776
15-030 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

503
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:15,439
Be it resolved that the City Council discuss the ongoing problem

504
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,752
at 56 Boynton Road and what can be done to address the problem.

505
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:20,733
Councilor Caraviello.

506
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:23,314
Mr. President, can I ask that this be tabled until next week?

507
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:27,957
I know some people had come here to speak on this tonight and when they thought I wasn't coming.

508
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:30,598
If we could table this until next week, I'd appreciate it.

509
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:37,782
On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, that item number 15-031 be tabled.

510
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,642
All those in favor?

511
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,143
All those opposed?

512
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:41,544
Item is tabled.

513
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:43,285
15-035 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

514
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:59,942
Be it resolved that the council request from Hallmark Health an update on the proposed merger with Partners Health in light of the current statements made by Attorney General Mara Healy.

515
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:01,383
Counselor Caravaglio.

516
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:02,664
Thank you again, Mr. President.

517
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:13,252
Mr. President, I put this in before the announcement was made by the court against the merger with Partners.

518
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:25,219
If possible, if the council could request someone from partners to come here to address us and over what the next step is and what their plans are.

519
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,180
Someone from partners?

520
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,022
Either partners or Hallmark or both.

521
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:32,323
Yes.

522
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,784
That is an integral project.

523
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:40,047
Then I, for what I understand, Mr. Sack resigned today, is retiring today.

524
00:38:42,705 --> 00:38:45,106
So, and he's the president of Hallmark Health.

525
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:45,226
Yes.

526
00:38:45,586 --> 00:39:01,073
So I say, if, so if, if, if we could get some direction on where this, um, this is going with all the action over the last, uh, last week, basically, cause this is, this is, you know, the hospital is, is a strong part of this community.

527
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,354
And, um, I think we need to know where it's going.

528
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:10,737
Yes, because their concern, their whole concern around this was the future solvency of the hospital.

529
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:26,206
So, Mr. Clerk, if you could amend that, uh, that a representative of Hallmark Health address the council and update them on their next steps, uh, given, uh, that the, uh, courts have, uh, uh, ordered that, uh, uh, the efforts be, uh, ceased.

530
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:26,986
Councilor Penta.

531
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,427
Um, thank you.

532
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:29,987
Uh, I thank Councilor Caviello.

533
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:32,628
Uh, we had a discussion on this earlier this week as it relates to this.

534
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:37,489
Uh, I, I think it would be equally as important to have somebody here from, uh, Maura Haley's office as well.

535
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,410
This was a 48 page decision.

536
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,140
And I think it would be, you know, this council's been on top of this since day one.

537
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:46,082
We've involved ourselves.

538
00:39:46,162 --> 00:39:48,163
We've had health partners, folks here.

539
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:54,026
We had Mr. Sachs here a couple of times, whether he agreed or disagreed, what his comments were.

540
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:55,107
At least they were there.

541
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:57,508
There was a public, two public forums.

542
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:03,732
But the key is not because of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital or the Melrose Lakeville Hospital.

543
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:06,434
The key to this whole story is the one down the South Shore.

544
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,155
And that was the telling sign.

545
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:20,055
I have some of the documents that she has issued, Maura Healy, but I think it would be important to have somebody here because I believe that there are other options available to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

546
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:26,537
It may not be as great as what Partners was going to offer, but I think something like that needs to be addressed.

547
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:39,080
Also, the fact that not only did Mr. Sack retire when we were told that he was going to continue on and be in charge of the Melrose-Wakefield, no matter what happened to this situation here,

548
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:50,103
So I think there needs to be some information, Rick, on why he retired so suddenly, you know, and you would hope it's not a million dollar balloon payout because they didn't get their way.

549
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:59,628
I mean, and who's going to be left holding the bag here is going to be all the patients and the doctors and the nurses that don't have an opportunity to go to that hospital or won't have an opportunity to go to that hospital.

550
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:07,532
And as we saw the amount of money that's being infused into the Melrose Wakefield Hospital, it's a pittance compared to what's taking place over here at the Lawrence Memorial.

551
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:11,109
So, unfortunately, I think we're at the tail end of the stick on this one here.

552
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:20,253
But putting that aside, I think the other part of the story is I respectfully request that somebody from Maura Healey's office be here.

553
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:25,215
And I think to have them all here at the same time to explain it would make a lot — would make sense.

554
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:26,596
The President.

555
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:31,558
So amended by Counselor Penter that a representative from the Attorney General's office be present.

556
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:32,878
Counselor Knight is next.

557
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,459
Yes, Mr. President.

558
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:36,200
I, too, agree with Counselor Penter in terms of

559
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,883
We need to get a little bit better understanding as to where our new Attorney General is coming from in regard to her approach.

560
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:53,509
And again, there's been litigation, ongoing litigation, so I think that it would make sense maybe for us to let the lawyers do the lawyering, provide us with some information, and let us make informed decisions thereafter, Mr. President.

561
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,393
But I think at this point in time, the position of the Attorney General is very, very important to this body and to the community.

562
00:42:00,078 --> 00:42:03,021
In terms of Mr. Sachs and his retirement, I wish him the best.

563
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:09,508
I hope that he goes on to have a great, great, great retirement and enjoy the sunny beaches of Florida or wherever it is he may end up.

564
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:10,769
Yes, indeed.

565
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:11,850
Councilor Camuso.

566
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:19,738
Yes, what the attorney didn't say is that this is not the Attorney General's office right now.

567
00:42:20,098 --> 00:42:22,581
This was a decision of the Suffolk Superior Court.

568
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:28,780
The 48-page document that Councillor Pinto refers to is a ruling of the court.

569
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,722
So I think we should actually get that ruling first, have our city solicitor go over it.

570
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:49,245
And quite honestly, in the press release from the Attorney General's office, it appeared that there might be some conversations going forward that Hallmark Health may be able to work out an arrangement, possibly,

571
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,761
if it's set aside from the three hospitals.

572
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:56,923
So I just think it's very, we have to be very clear.

573
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:03,686
The Attorney General had made a comment, but her comments were prior to the decision of the Suffolk Superior Court Judge.

574
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:09,889
So if we could get that and send it to our legal counsel to look over, because as Counselor Caviello stated,

575
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:19,028
This is something that's going to have a long-term detrimental effect on our community if that place was to shut down due to a merger not taking place.

576
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:20,449
And that's jobs.

577
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:24,071
That's a major piece of land in our community.

578
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:26,993
So we have to be ahead of this, Mr. President.

579
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:34,357
And if Hallmark Health, if Lawrence Memorial has to start negotiations with Beth Israel or someone else, then so be it.

580
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:36,218
But we all know that the Leahy

581
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:38,571
merged with Winchester most recently.

582
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:49,434
So I think we have to worry about Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not so much the Hallmark Health on the South Shore, because the people in Melrose right now aren't concerned about Medford.

583
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:57,577
So we have to urge Hallmark Health to look at any and all avenues to keep a hospital afloat here in our community.

584
00:43:58,017 --> 00:44:01,698
And as I said, whether it's Beth Israel, whether it's Tufts Medical Center,

585
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,651
And the Brigham and Women's, as we know, has the affiliation with the South Shore Hospital.

586
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:13,033
The Mass General, which is the other part of Partners, was doing the affiliation out here.

587
00:44:13,534 --> 00:44:23,959
And in their political structure, the Mass General is sort of the king, has a little bit more at the table, I would say, in the boardroom than the Brigham and Women's does.

588
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:31,842
So we got to just make sure that Lawrence Memorial Hospital is looked at, excuse me, by Hallmark Health.

589
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,113
for any and all options that are out there.

590
00:44:36,113 --> 00:44:39,975
I think, as a community, we can't just say that we back that merger.

591
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:43,636
We have to see what other opportunities there are out there.

592
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:53,900
So I'd like to get the city solicitor to look at the opinion and then ask Hallmark Health specifically if they have any plans for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

593
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,861
Because quite honestly, I'm not concerned about Melrose.

594
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:57,722
I'm not concerned about

595
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,587
uh, South shore.

596
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:09,552
And when you look at the elected officials that supported this merger and some that didn't, it appears it was all upon where programs were going within the hospital.

597
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:21,878
The senators out of Lynn were against the merger because it would have affected the Lynn facility would have got programs that they may not have wanted that would have been moved from Melrose Wakefield and things of that nature.

598
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:26,060
So I think we have to look at the piece of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and not Hallmark Health as a whole.

599
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,002
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

600
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:34,305
So on the main motion by Councilor Caravaglia, amended by Councilors Caravaglia, Penta, and Camuso.

601
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:35,846
Councilor Penta.

602
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:56,118
Picking up on what Councilor Camuso just alluded to, the fact of the matter is that I believe it was Mara Healy, her position was integrated with a host of other hospitals, presidents and executives from other hospitals, who said that this competition would be devastating to them

603
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:03,112
It would put partners in such a position that they would have some kind of a control that would take years and years and years to overcome.

604
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:08,693
Also, there was no proven fact that the rates would go down as partners said that they would.

605
00:46:09,374 --> 00:46:18,536
And apparently, the documents that were submitted by these other executives from these other hospitals were enough to tantalize, let's put it this way, Maury Haley to the point of saying, hey, I'm not going to do it.

606
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:24,478
But also, she did indicate that if this went through, she was going to sue the judge because of the decision

607
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,486
that she made, and she felt as a result of that.

608
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:34,770
Now, whether you agree or disagree with Maura Healy and why she's doing what she did, I don't think we can answer that.

609
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:41,434
I think we'll have a better understanding when all the parties are here and they can tell us what their reasoning is and what their reasoning isn't going to be.

610
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:44,816
I think Lawrence is the low man on the totem pole of all of this.

611
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:49,958
There was the South Shore Hospital first, then it's the Melrose-Wakefield, and they're going to be taken care of, and it's us.

612
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,479
But I believe that there is a game plan.

613
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:52,980
I believe that there is a game plan.

614
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:57,596
may not be as grandiose as they would have liked with partners coming on.

615
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:13,168
In the 48-page decision that the judge wrote, she did say that there was a belief that the rising cost would be an estimated $50 million a year because of this merger.

616
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:23,155
And because of this merger and the $50 million, and because of the opposition from other hospital executives and presidents, I believe that that probably weighed pretty heavily

617
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:32,626
on making the judge make the decision or to judge making her decision after knowing what Maura Healey was going to do, if, in fact, she did pass it.

618
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:33,487
So.

619
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,730
Thank you, Mr. President.

620
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:53,280
Regarding the meeting that this council wants to hold with the Attorney General's office and also a representative from Lawrence Memorial Hospital or Hallmark Health, I would ask Alan McDonald, who I believe is second in command at

621
00:47:54,050 --> 00:48:01,533
Hallmark Health has appeared before this council a number of times, and I would ask that we invite him in particular.

622
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:14,618
And also, we invite the mayor or someone from the administration to be present at this meeting, because the mayor has the same vested interest of the health of Moss Memorial Hospital.

623
00:48:15,318 --> 00:48:20,400
And I read some of the opinion, and from what I gather,

624
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:31,922
One of the chief complaints was the fact that they believed if partners were to take over Hallmark Health, that partners would be able to control the rates.

625
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:45,249
And we all know that right away, insurance companies, who is really the thousand-pound elephant in the room, it's not the hospitals, it's the insurance companies, they're the ones that are driving the conversation.

626
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,752
And their fear is that if partners gain more of a control over

627
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:58,289
the health industry in Massachusetts, that partners would be able to have more say at the table and increase rates and so forth.

628
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:06,253
And I just think that, as I mentioned before, I actually work for Mass General.

629
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:18,720
And in my opinion, implementing and bringing world-renowned physicians into a local hospital was a win-win for every resident in this community when you're talking about bringing

630
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:37,213
top cardiac doctors into Lawrence Memorial Hospital, top primary care doctors, doctors across all specialties that would be coming and merging into Lawrence Memorial Hospital, as well as Melrose-Wakefield, was a win-win for Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

631
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:45,395
And I'm very fearful of its future with this particular opinion and the ruling that was, as Councilor Camuso mentioned.

632
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:47,556
And I think we should have

633
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:50,467
a meeting sooner than later, Mr. President.

634
00:49:50,747 --> 00:50:04,811
Hallmark Health, where this is so recent, is probably not going to go on the record stating what their next step is, because I think it was asked by — I think it might have been Counselor Knight when Hallmark Health was up here and said, you know, this is plan A. Do you have a plan B?

635
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:11,733
And Mr. — President Sack from Hallmark Health said, no, we just have a plan A. This is our plan.

636
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:15,694
And where this is so recent, I'm not sure if they're going to share any information,

637
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:38,209
I think it's incumbent upon us as a council and also the administration to push back and find out what's going on with the hospital because, in my opinion, from hearing from President Sack, I'm not sure how much Lawrence Memorial or Hallmark as an organization can sustain their operations and the capacity they're doing currently.

638
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:45,795
And that worries me for urgent care in our community and things that many

639
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:51,426
residents and seniors have become accustomed to may no longer be in their back doorstep.

640
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:53,628
And that concerns me, Mr. President.

641
00:50:53,668 --> 00:51:01,595
So I would ask that, uh, this, uh, meeting, if not an emergency meeting, but something take place, uh, immediately, uh, regarding this.

642
00:51:02,055 --> 00:51:02,376
Thank you.

643
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,056
Counsel Mark.

644
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:07,620
So on the main motion of counselor care of yellow amended by counselor care of yellow,

645
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:10,598
Councilor Penta, Councilor Camuso, and Councilor Martz.

646
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:11,998
All those in favor?

647
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:13,459
All those opposed?

648
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:14,819
Motion passes.

649
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:30,243
Offered by Councilor Caraviello, 15-036, be it resolved the city, the council request the building department to provide the status of the property on Salem Street that was destroyed in a fire several years ago.

650
00:51:30,343 --> 00:51:31,404
Councilor Caraviello.

651
00:51:31,704 --> 00:51:32,784
Thank you again, Mr. President.

652
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:35,825
A couple of weeks ago, we were discussing in Squarehead

653
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:43,185
And this came up about the building that was destroyed by a fire, what, maybe four, five, six years ago?

654
00:51:44,106 --> 00:51:49,911
And it's laid vacant for all this time, and it's a blight to that square.

655
00:51:49,971 --> 00:52:01,119
And I'd like to know what our building department is doing to either resolve it or, because I know there's a timeframe in which they have to rebuild something there.

656
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,082
So I would like to get a,

657
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:09,009
something back from the building department over what the status of that property is.

658
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:24,377
And if there is no status, to have the solicitor look into either taking the property, because I think we have sort of a lien where the city can take the property, because it's a lot better than a condition.

659
00:52:24,698 --> 00:52:28,360
And I say, there's no reason why that property needs to be like that.

660
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,921
Commercial property in the city is very desirable.

661
00:52:32,662 --> 00:52:34,203
And there's three, four, five stores there.

662
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:36,716
that's striking down that whole square.

663
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:43,821
So if the building department can have some kind of, or the city solicitor send us a report on what's happening with that property.

664
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:46,203
Thank you, Councilor Caffarello.

665
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:48,244
Councilor Camuso, did you want to speak on this?

666
00:52:48,424 --> 00:52:48,784
No, sir.

667
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:50,205
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

668
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,867
Councilor, Vice President Blanco-Curran.

669
00:52:52,947 --> 00:52:54,768
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

670
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:01,293
We did speak about this last week, and I can't remember if we motioned to send a request to the health department as well.

671
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:06,418
to go in and check out the site and report back to the council, see if there's anything we can do through the health department.

672
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:09,518
Because I agree with you, Councilor Carviello, it is an eyesore.

673
00:53:09,538 --> 00:53:10,959
It is bringing down the neighborhood.

674
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:17,100
But I also believe there's some health concerns that are going on, not only with that storefront, but I'm sure the whole block.

675
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:26,582
Because I don't believe it's been cleaned up, and that is going to leak into the businesses to the right and left of that storefront.

676
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,982
So I'd ask that Karen Rose from the health department

677
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:37,494
to inspect and report back to the council, and that the proper steps are taken by the city to clean that up and move it forward.

678
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:41,275
That landlord should have to clean that establishment up.

679
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:44,276
Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kern.

680
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:48,677
And that paper is amended by Councilor, Vice President Longo-Kern.

681
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:50,557
Councilor Pinto.

682
00:53:51,017 --> 00:53:57,079
Are there any, maybe you should also refer this to the Office of Community Development to find out if there's any proposed

683
00:53:58,186 --> 00:53:59,747
that's being scheduled for that area.

684
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:04,330
Councilor Knight just alluded to something for which we all agreed upon on Locust Street.

685
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:19,640
And you know, maybe it's always a sad situation, but maybe because of this building, it could stop the redevelopment of that particular area as it relates to, you know, where they're going, storefront signs, designs, sidewalks, and a whole host of other businesses that are down there.

686
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,584
So I'd like to refer that to the OCD office as well to see if they might have a review on this particular subject matter.

687
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:35,915
On the motion of Council Penta to amend the paper to additionally refer it to the OCD office, Councilor Marks.

688
00:54:37,116 --> 00:54:38,197
Thank you, Mr. President.

689
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:51,767
And I actually brought up the Foodmaster, actually the old Foodmaster, now the Stop and Shop parking lot on Salem Street, and also mentioned this particular establishment that caught on fire well over two years ago.

690
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:55,450
I believe it was called the Lucky Dragon,

691
00:54:57,223 --> 00:55:12,631
But needless to say, Mr. President, you know, I think it's probably appropriate time now to have a roundtable discussion on our downtown business districts, and that would include all five business districts.

692
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:22,616
You know, we've been discussing and the mayor has been discussing the revitalization of our major business district, Meffitt Square, for the past 28 years.

693
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:26,378
And if anything, there are more vacant storefronts now than

694
00:55:26,885 --> 00:55:28,306
existed when he took office.

695
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:45,373
And, in my opinion, Mr. President, I don't see any activity being done in any of our business districts to make them more of a welcoming area to try to attract newer businesses into the community.

696
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:52,316
Surrounding communities are offering tax incentives to local businesses and small businesses to attract them.

697
00:55:53,037 --> 00:55:55,518
They're trying to attract a variety of business

698
00:55:55,955 --> 00:56:02,056
So you just don't have, you know, all of one particular business or two different type of businesses.

699
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:08,558
That makes it more attractive for people that want to come in and traverse the downtown business districts.

700
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:18,320
A few months ago, I offered a resolution to look at the transportation shelter across from the CVS on Riverside Ave.

701
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,301
We got a response back from the administration saying they'll take it under advisement.

702
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,203
which is, in my opinion, unacceptable, Mr. President.

703
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:45,574
That particular shelter definitely could be reused for another purpose in our community, whether it be for arts or whether it be for retail or whether it be an inviting place to attract people.

704
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:53,139
When they did the square of the revitalization plan in the square many years back,

705
00:56:53,977 --> 00:57:04,561
One of the omissions that was mentioned in the report was the fact that there are no gathering areas in our downtown business district.

706
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:10,363
And there's not a place where you can sit down and have a cup of coffee and relax in an outdoor setting.

707
00:57:11,183 --> 00:57:14,904
And that was one of the big downsides on our square.

708
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:22,867
And there was discussion about widening our sidewalks, adding more benches, and doing a number of things in our business districts.

709
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:29,113
And I saw that particular reuse of that transportation shelter, which is crumbling right now.

710
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:31,835
The roof is in need of a roof.

711
00:57:32,475 --> 00:57:33,435
The gutters are missing.

712
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:35,597
The paint's peeling off the side.

713
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,498
It's really not being used at all right now.

714
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:51,145
And the repurposing of that for another use could have an area where we could have people that would come and sit down and turn it into a vibrant area rather than something that's currently neglected.

715
00:57:51,627 --> 00:57:54,507
But it's long overdue in this community, Mr. President.

716
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:57,368
We need to sit down with this administration.

717
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:01,029
The mayor controls the Office of Community Development.

718
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:17,071
And in my opinion, you know, I don't want to be critical of anyone in particular, but in my opinion, that department is sorely understaffed and is not serving the purpose of a community development office like I see happening in other communities.

719
00:58:17,971 --> 00:58:21,352
And it's about time, if we're interested in

720
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:25,662
Revitalizing, Councilor Caviello is interested in Salem Street.

721
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:27,163
He brings up the Haines Square area.

722
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:29,425
But we have to look at the hillside.

723
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:32,827
We have to look at South Meffitt, West Meffitt, Meffitt Square.

724
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:36,630
We have to look at every particular area, Mr. President, in the square.

725
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,652
And we have to have a game plan.

726
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:47,278
There is no, when we were talking about capital improvements a few years back, the one thing that was lacking was there was no vision.

727
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,761
There was never a capital improvement plan established in this community.

728
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:54,465
And we're seeing the same with our business districts.

729
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:57,947
There is no plan to revitalize our squares.

730
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:08,193
And, you know, we can refer back to the mayor's three proposals for revitalizing Method Square, but none of them have made it out of infancy.

731
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:13,236
They're all still in the baby carriage, and they never make it any further than that.

732
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,859
And every so often, people get upset and say, what's going on in our squares?

733
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:19,000
I see all these vacancies.

734
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,561
After 7 o'clock, the square's dead.

735
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:37,028
And all you need to do is look around other communities and see what Wakefield's doing, see what Redding's doing, see what Stoneham's doing, see what downtown Woburn's doing in areas that before, you know, really weren't, you know, bustling.

736
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,249
Now we're bustling.

737
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:45,412
And here we are five minutes from Boston off of Major 93, and our square is dead, Mr. President.

738
00:59:46,153 --> 00:59:47,073
It really is a shame.

739
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:52,219
And I know there's a group of residents that have organized around this issue.

740
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:56,460
I'm hoping they step forward and bring this to light.

741
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:07,784
But I don't think we can afford to sit around any longer and discuss a possible Peace Garden or a water taxi as the solve-all for Method Square.

742
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:12,326
You know, once we bring in a water taxi, all of a sudden the square is going to be bustling.

743
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:17,168
Or once the Peace Garden comes in, it's going to attract people into the square.

744
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,116
I don't think that's going to be the case.

745
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:20,879
This is not the field of dreams.

746
01:00:20,939 --> 01:00:21,920
If you build it, they'll come.

747
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:27,067
In my opinion, the city's going to have to step forward, do some legwork in the issue.

748
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:28,524
It's not going to just happen.

749
01:00:28,845 --> 01:00:33,166
We have three large parcels of land in our downtown business district.

750
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:36,808
Any other community would die to have that, Mr. President.

751
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:38,148
We own the property.

752
01:00:38,188 --> 01:00:39,789
We don't have to go in by eminent domain.

753
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,249
We don't have to do anything.

754
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,470
That's our property.

755
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,991
We can revitalize that on our own.

756
01:00:45,551 --> 01:00:49,573
And these parcels have been sitting there vacant for years and years and years.

757
01:00:50,453 --> 01:00:52,614
I just don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President.

758
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:54,875
And, you know, I'm sorry for being long-winded.

759
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:59,297
But this business districts in the community is the lifeline.

760
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:03,839
You know, we talk about different things that are the lifeline of a community.

761
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,840
The downtown business districts are a lifeline.

762
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:13,082
Your property value is directly related to how well the schools do, and also the business community.

763
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:17,064
And right now, our business community is not doing well, Mr. President.

764
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:19,865
It's not doing well, and we need to step up.

765
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:24,327
And I'm hoping we can have, and I'd like to put it to a vote tonight, Mr. President,

766
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:42,005
a roundtable discussion regarding the revitalization of all five business districts in our community with the administration, with the Office of Community Development, and with whoever else wants to sit down at the table, and with this council, Mr. President, and discuss the future of our business districts.

767
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,988
So I put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

768
01:01:45,488 --> 01:01:50,032
Amended by Councilor Moxon, if I can just add from the chair.

769
01:01:50,580 --> 01:02:07,752
Councilor, that of the only two items that I did submit when we listed our priorities for the beginning of this elected term, one was for the police station and the second was for the economic redevelopment plan for the commercial districts.

770
01:02:08,153 --> 01:02:09,654
So you're right on target, Councilor.

771
01:02:10,354 --> 01:02:11,895
Point of information, Councilor Penta.

772
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:12,716
Question.

773
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:16,699
Do you want these for all in together or do you want to do them independently?

774
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:18,300
Because each square is different to each other.

775
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:25,085
I'm not looking for a plan that's going to encompass all the business districts.

776
01:02:25,385 --> 01:02:29,047
What I want to do is start the dialogue with this roundtable discussion.

777
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:33,850
And I don't think we can paint a picture of business.

778
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:34,290
You're right.

779
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,812
Every square is individual and has its own needs and wants.

780
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:40,994
And I think we just need to start the discussion.

781
01:02:41,494 --> 01:02:48,979
And I agree with the President that an economic development plan is a great start, but it has to be started somewhere.

782
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,481
and I don't see it being done on the administration side.

783
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:52,642
Thank you, councillors.

784
01:02:52,662 --> 01:02:53,162
Councillor Knight.

785
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:54,583
Thank you, Mr. President.

786
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:58,145
Thank you very much, Councillor Marks, for initiating a discussion on Medford Square.

787
01:02:59,546 --> 01:03:06,730
One of the things that you said was that, you know, the value of our homes is directly tied to the success of our schools and the success of our downtown business districts.

788
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:15,074
And I think another thing that's important to point out is that the value of our homes is also tied to location, location, location, and we're in a great location.

789
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:16,475
Medford Square is a great location.

790
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:21,267
And as Councillor Mark said, you know, we have two parcels of land that are underdeveloped down there.

791
01:03:21,787 --> 01:03:25,088
We have great access to public transit in Medford Square, but we have no people there.

792
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:37,272
And I think that it might make sense for us to maybe take a look at integrating some affordable housing or some moderate to low-income housing down in the area to actually put people in the square so that when these businesses do open and if we do get an economic development plan in place,

793
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:40,476
and we start to generate new businesses, we actually have people that are going to go shop there.

794
01:03:40,636 --> 01:03:41,937
And they can do so by walking there.

795
01:03:41,977 --> 01:03:43,458
They can do so by riding their bikes there.

796
01:03:43,718 --> 01:03:48,040
They can do so by using alternative modes of transportation other than their vehicle, Mr. President.

797
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:51,462
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

798
01:03:52,342 --> 01:04:04,148
So on the paper offered by Councilor Caraviello as amended by Councilor Penter and Lungo Kern, I'm sorry, and Councilor Marks.

799
01:04:04,648 --> 01:04:05,388
All those in favor?

800
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:05,468
Aye.

801
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:06,829
All those opposed?

802
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,382
Motion carries.

803
01:04:10,102 --> 01:04:12,904
We have Councilor Camuso.

804
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:13,404
Thank you.

805
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:20,068
If I may, we like to move suspension of the rules before a gentleman that would like to address this honorable body.

806
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:29,954
Motion for suspension of the rules for the citizen to address the body on this one particular topic, which will be made known to us when he speaks.

807
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:30,835
I think it's a condolence.

808
01:04:30,855 --> 01:04:31,515
All those in favor?

809
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:32,636
All those opposed?

810
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:33,977
Motion carries.

811
01:04:35,556 --> 01:04:37,518
Sir, state your name and address for the record, please.

812
01:04:37,898 --> 01:04:40,100
Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

813
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,621
Thank you, Mr. President.

814
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:43,022
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

815
01:04:44,944 --> 01:04:52,390
Today at the Immaculate Conception in Malden, I just want to ask maybe for a moment of silence if we could.

816
01:04:52,891 --> 01:05:01,898
There were almost 100 priests, at least a dozen bishops, His Eminence Cardinal Sean, and the pastor of St.

817
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:04,140
Raphael's, Father Toomey, who gave the homily.

818
01:05:04,608 --> 01:05:11,751
for the passing of Father Richard Meem, who was the pastor at Immaculate Conception Malden.

819
01:05:12,152 --> 01:05:24,017
I also want to thank Council President De La Russo for coming last night to his wake, and his Honor the Mayor, who both came, Michael McGlynn, to the wake and to the funeral services today.

820
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:29,460
It was a real boost to the family to have those dignitaries from Medford come

821
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:35,457
I am a member of the Immaculate Conception Parish, as are many people in Medford.

822
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:39,879
So Father Meem had a very big impact on our community.

823
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:45,341
As a Knight of Columbus there, Father Meem was constantly coming to the meetings.

824
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:47,622
He was a man of true character.

825
01:05:49,703 --> 01:05:59,147
When Father Meem started succumbing to his illness at the beginning of last week on Monday, I actually saw Cardinal Sean

826
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:02,648
at an assembly in Faneuil Hall two Sundays ago.

827
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:07,049
And I said, Your Eminence, if you please would say a prayer for Father Meem.

828
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:08,010
He's taken ill.

829
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:16,592
And apparently, the prayer was answered with God calling him home to go on to be with God.

830
01:06:17,072 --> 01:06:28,316
But the next day, when it was clear that Father Meem was unfortunately going to pass, Cardinal Sean, this is just a testament to Father Meem's character.

831
01:06:28,983 --> 01:06:32,285
Cardinal Sean went to visit him to inform him.

832
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:37,488
I mean, his whole family around him, the man saw all his friends.

833
01:06:37,968 --> 01:06:45,472
He knew people were very, very morose because a loving family member and a good friend was dying.

834
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:54,397
Cardinal Sean informed him that his Holy Father, the Pope in Rome, had elevated Father Mime to Monsignor.

835
01:06:55,497 --> 01:06:58,399
And this is a true testament to his character, his response

836
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,525
was, well, it's about time.

837
01:07:02,426 --> 01:07:11,733
And they all, I mean, here's a man who immediately relieves the morosity of the situation for his family and friends.

838
01:07:12,274 --> 01:07:15,957
And it was just such a wonderful homily today by Father Toomey of St.

839
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:16,597
Raphael's.

840
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:23,823
And if I could, I could please, I mean, a lot of folks in Medford would love probably to have just a brief moment of silence.

841
01:07:23,863 --> 01:07:26,005
And thank you so much, Councilor Camuso.

842
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:31,828
Thank you.

843
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:40,652
And if I could, from the chair, say that Monsignor Meem was a wonderful, among all his other qualities, he was an outstanding preacher.

844
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:42,613
He knew how to preach the word of God.

845
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:46,075
We have two other condolences that we're going to mention.

846
01:07:46,115 --> 01:07:58,261
If I could just add to really quick that our own city solicitor, Mark Rumley, who's the deacon of our parish too, was also very comforting and inhaling at a time of serious grief.

847
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,662
And I want to thank him for his

848
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:07,855
outstanding leader as a spiritual leader in my parish and church.

849
01:08:07,915 --> 01:08:08,295
Thank you.

850
01:08:08,715 --> 01:08:10,036
Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

851
01:08:10,436 --> 01:08:31,066
We also have two condolences in addition to this, two offered for the same person, one by Councilor Caravaglio 15-037, be it resolved that the council offers sincere condolences to the family of Medford High School Red Sox and Yankee pitcher,

852
01:08:31,527 --> 01:09:00,708
Bill Monboquette on his recent passing, and also offered by Councilor Penta, 15-038, be it resolved that an expression of sympathy be extended to the family of Medford baseball great Bill Monboquette on his recent passing, and that all Medford sports teams and their players recognize the wonderful accomplishment that he accomplished at a time when playing for a professional major league baseball team and achieving his baseball statistics certainly made Medford proud.

853
01:09:01,842 --> 01:09:03,604
Do we want either of you to speak on this?

854
01:09:05,245 --> 01:09:06,145
Yes, Councilor Penta.

855
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:19,455
The recent passing of Bill Mumbo-Katt here in the city of Medford, I think really highlights the fact that he is somewhat of a baseball legend, probably.

856
01:09:19,935 --> 01:09:30,483
Medford has been blessed with many, many baseball players, but this gentleman did it at a time back in the early 50s when he was practicing with a fellow by the name of Gus Hennessey.

857
01:09:31,312 --> 01:09:33,773
And they would go down and play Stead Park continuously.

858
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:36,133
And he would just pitch to them and pitch to them and pitch to them.

859
01:09:36,953 --> 01:09:39,194
And eventually, he finally made it.

860
01:09:39,454 --> 01:09:41,194
But he made it in a time and a period.

861
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:43,074
Eddie Finn, you remember this.

862
01:09:43,414 --> 01:09:46,555
He made it in a time that there was only eight professional baseball teams in either seat.

863
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:47,855
Now there's 32.

864
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:51,736
But there was only eight American League teams, eight National League teams.

865
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:52,876
And it was tough.

866
01:09:52,996 --> 01:09:55,737
And when he went into the minors, he just didn't come up right away.

867
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:57,297
He had to earn his spot.

868
01:09:57,577 --> 01:10:00,938
And he has a very interesting baseball career.

869
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:09,633
But one of his real major accomplishments, and I don't even think he realized it until it happened, they were playing against the Washington Senators on a particular night.

870
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:13,455
And I believe he had struck out 17 baseball, 17 players.

871
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:21,838
And the coach of the Washington Senators, his name was William McCauley, came up to him toward the end of the game.

872
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:23,639
And somebody wants to talk to him.

873
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:24,659
The president wants to talk to him.

874
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:25,439
That's the terminology.

875
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:26,760
The president wants to talk to him.

876
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:30,041
And he thought it was the president of the baseball team or the president of the league and this and that.

877
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:31,565
But it was Dwight Eisenhower.

878
01:10:32,826 --> 01:10:37,507
And Dwight Eisenhower was so impressed with him that he wanted a ball signed by him.

879
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:40,228
And when the president asked him, where did you come from?

880
01:10:40,288 --> 01:10:41,068
And he says, Meffa.

881
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:42,228
Meffa.

882
01:10:42,728 --> 01:10:46,510
And it was sort of like, and he says, why do all you people down there talk like that?

883
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:47,710
I mean, what do you?

884
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,531
And it was kind of like, it was a cool situation.

885
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:58,773
But the night he threw his no-hitter in Chicago on August 1, 1962 against a veteran, a very good veteran pitcher, early win.

886
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:02,283
That was a real highlight here in the city of Medford.

887
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:06,565
No one had ever thrown a, no one ever came from Medford to throw it.

888
01:11:07,225 --> 01:11:22,654
And if I have my story correctly, I believe when he came back to Medford at that time, engine six drove him, picked him up and gave him somewhat of a mini parade here in the city of Medford, acknowledging the fact that who he was and how he was, you know, he was an all-star pitcher for the all-star teams for years.

889
01:11:22,714 --> 01:11:27,416
He played professional, he pitched professional baseball for 11 years between the Red Sox and the Yankees.

890
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:42,434
And I guess his ending comment, which I happened to notice, and I'm glad that they printed it in the local press, he made the comment that he loved playing baseball so much that he would have played for nothing.

891
01:11:43,374 --> 01:11:50,859
And if people only would realize what that would mean to today's kids that are playing professional sports, okay?

892
01:11:50,879 --> 01:11:52,440
They're into the millions and millions of dollars.

893
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:58,004
I believe when he was pitching, the year he threw the no-hitter, he was making $8,000, and I believe they offered him up to 12.

894
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:00,066
the following year.

895
01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:03,928
And that's just craziness for money back then.

896
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:10,391
And if you look at him today, what his statistics would have been and what he could have probably earned, it's probably just unfathomable.

897
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:12,612
But it's baseball as it was then.

898
01:12:13,032 --> 01:12:13,812
That's what they paid.

899
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:14,793
That's what it was all about.

900
01:12:15,473 --> 01:12:22,176
But I think it would be a great opportunity for the Medford sports kids to know that this fellow grew up here in the city of Medford.

901
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:24,157
He worked this thing into the ground.

902
01:12:24,957 --> 01:12:26,078
He played it.

903
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:26,738
He loved it.

904
01:12:27,253 --> 01:12:29,194
He used to come back and watch Meffitt High Baseball.

905
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:34,377
He used to come back because of family members at Meffitt High School Hockey.

906
01:12:35,058 --> 01:12:38,540
He just really was a true gentleman to the sport.

907
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,181
He wasn't flamboyant or anything like that.

908
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:49,246
He was just a regular guy who just proved here in the city of Meffitt and any place else in this country, if you work hard enough at something that you want, it'd be great by today's standards.

909
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:53,108
I mean, like I said, I had a whole list of 32 names of people who

910
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,311
made professional sports through the minor leagues.

911
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:57,832
But this guy made it in the majors.

912
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,154
And he made it in such a way that nobody expected to happen.

913
01:13:01,234 --> 01:13:10,519
And he just made the city of Medford so proud to know that, you know, he could accomplish what he did for the city of Medford, for professional baseball, because he loved it.

914
01:13:10,559 --> 01:13:12,400
And like he said, he would have done it for nothing.

915
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,200
And you know something?

916
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,782
He probably did play for nothing, because that's how much he really loved the sport.

917
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:22,405
And to his wife, Josephine, and the family, you know, you can be very proud of the fact that you had a great husband.

918
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:26,133
who did the city of Medford proud, and you did him proud as well.

919
01:13:26,293 --> 01:13:29,153
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to pass that on.

920
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:30,153
Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

921
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:30,533
Councilor Knight?

922
01:13:31,734 --> 01:13:32,474
Yes, Mr. President.

923
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:36,094
I'd like to thank both Councilors Caviello and Penta for bringing this resolution forward.

924
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:47,076
I think it's important to point out for those of us at home who would like to maybe understand Mr. Mombo-Kett's story a little bit better, that it is memorialized down at Placed at Park, right behind home plate.

925
01:13:47,116 --> 01:13:50,097
There is a plaque down there that speaks about his achievements and

926
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:59,652
his professional achievements, but also his personal achievements and what he's done in the community of Medford to improve our quality of life here and to improve the lives of young athletes in the city, Mr. President.

927
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:00,813
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

928
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:01,694
Councilor Caravaglio.

929
01:14:04,476 --> 01:14:05,397
Thank you, Mr. President.

930
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:08,700
My dad was a good friend of Bill Maumbo-Katt.

931
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,821
They grew up in the same neighborhood.

932
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:18,548
In fact, I know this sounds corny, but the first baseball game I went to, my dad took me with tickets that Bill Maumbo-Katt had given him.

933
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:22,356
And I got to go down on the field and meet him, you know, caught him on a graph ball.

934
01:14:23,356 --> 01:14:26,177
And, you know, I just wanted to say, you know, he was a good guy.

935
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:28,998
I'd see him all the time down at Dickey's gas station, getting gas all the time.

936
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,679
Always asked my dad all the time.

937
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:32,600
And I'd like to wish the family well.

938
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,520
Thank you.

939
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:37,221
Thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:42,063
I remember when they had the dedication down at Placed at Park some many years ago.

941
01:14:42,803 --> 01:14:44,944
That was the first time I met Bill Mumbo-Katt.

942
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:59,270
And out of all the accolades, as Councilor Penter alluded to, no hitter and all-star league named and so forth, the one thing that stands out to me was his commitment to local youth.

943
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:07,956
And he never looked for any fanfare, never looked for any recognition, but he'd always be at certain events, Mr. President.

944
01:15:08,736 --> 01:15:09,977
And, you know,

945
01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:33,524
And I think it meant a lot, even though the younger kids, you know, you hear the name and you could tell them who he was, you know, really could never appreciate that this man was, in his time, was someone that was really looked up to and someone that was at the top of his game, at the top of his sport, never had anything negative mentioned about him.

946
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:40,167
In today's day and age, when you hear about sports players, there's always something mentioned after the name.

947
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,391
And with Bill Mumbo, you never got that.

948
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:54,039
As Councilor Penta mentioned and the other councilors, he was a stand-up gentleman, a family man, and again, gave so much back to a community that he loved so much.

949
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,263
And I'll always remember him for being part of the local youth in this community.

950
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:00,644
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

951
01:16:03,305 --> 01:16:10,170
Next, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that an expression of sympathy be extended to the family and friends of Stephen Brown,

952
01:16:10,795 --> 01:16:11,836
on his recent passing.

953
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:15,439
Counselor Penta.

954
01:16:16,179 --> 01:16:18,201
He was a real personal friend of mine.

955
01:16:18,261 --> 01:16:19,482
I worked with him for many years.

956
01:16:20,282 --> 01:16:22,244
Unfortunately, he passed away.

957
01:16:22,264 --> 01:16:26,947
He has a wonderful family, Sharon, Sam, Sawyer.

958
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:40,477
And this is a tough one, because sometimes when life pops up in front of you and things happen, you just sometimes you don't know what to say or how to react to it.

959
01:16:40,983 --> 01:16:42,024
He loved the outdoors.

960
01:16:42,104 --> 01:16:43,385
He was great with the kids.

961
01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:44,165
He was a coach.

962
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,928
He was a great family man.

963
01:16:48,589 --> 01:16:53,072
But for whatever the reason that God decided to say, this is your time, so be it.

964
01:16:53,112 --> 01:16:58,556
But I would just like to let them know, and the Brown family, that their thoughts are at least with us.

965
01:16:59,257 --> 01:16:59,998
He was a good guy.

966
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:01,098
He comes from a good family.

967
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:05,582
His wife, Sharon, Sam Sawyer.

968
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:17,134
I don't know what to say other than the fact that he was, you know, it was, it's one of these times in your life that something happens and you just can't explain it.

969
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:19,955
And, um, but I'm not going to try to explain it right now.

970
01:17:19,995 --> 01:17:22,977
Other than the saying, I just wish the family well at this time.

971
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:23,938
We all thank you.

972
01:17:26,019 --> 01:17:26,740
Councilor Camuso.

973
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,441
Thank you, Mr. President.

974
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:31,222
And, uh, Steven was also a great personal friend of mine.

975
01:17:31,422 --> 01:17:32,423
Uh, just a great guy.

976
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:37,006
And, uh, as we all know, his family goes back, uh, 50 years of public service.

977
01:17:37,517 --> 01:17:49,805
whether it was his dad, Frank, working for the Sheriff's Department back as a superintendent in the 1980s and the 70s, his mom, Roberta, who still works here part-time and does a fabulous job, his brother, Frank.

978
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:52,587
He's also with the MBTA.

979
01:17:53,027 --> 01:17:55,109
Just a great, great, great family.

980
01:17:55,609 --> 01:18:00,652
And Stephen will be sorely missed around the baseball field and just around the community in general.

981
01:18:00,813 --> 01:18:05,956
Just always had a smile on his face, outstanding personality, and just a great family man.

982
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:09,739
want to send my condolences as well.

983
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:13,421
I apologize.

984
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:14,282
He had three kids.

985
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:15,783
I kept mentioning, I think I only said it too.

986
01:18:16,043 --> 01:18:18,204
It's Sam Sawyer and Sarah.

987
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:20,146
It's Sarah, Sam and Sam.

988
01:18:20,566 --> 01:18:20,846
Wow.

989
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:25,069
Sam, Sarah and Sawyer.

990
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:25,589
I'm sorry.

991
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:28,251
Thank you.

992
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:33,214
Uh, we have two more condolences given to us, both, uh, uh, by councilor Camuso.

993
01:18:33,995 --> 01:18:34,055
Um,

994
01:18:35,808 --> 01:18:52,043
be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of former Medford Recreation Department director Frank Sonny Salido on his recent passing and also be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Gene Irwin who passed away recently.

995
01:18:52,363 --> 01:18:53,124
Councilor Camuso.

996
01:18:53,585 --> 01:19:00,571
If I may, many of us that enjoyed the Park League when we were kids as Councilor Lungo was champion for it for many, many years,

997
01:19:00,978 --> 01:19:08,425
When we were kids, the director, well, I'm a couple years older than Counsel Lungo, but the director when I was a kid growing up was Mr. Salido.

998
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:23,819
Just a great guy, and then I'd often spend time with him after, later in life, I'd be visiting my dad's grave up at Oak Grove Cemetery, and Mrs. Salido was right across the way in the little island there.

999
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:27,422
And he was always, always up there, as we all know, just a great guy.

1000
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:31,382
and another dedicated public servant here in our community that will be sorely missed.

1001
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:33,142
Mrs. Irwin.

1002
01:19:33,462 --> 01:19:37,903
We all know Honorable Justice Irwin that passed away a few years ago.

1003
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:41,324
Another outstanding family here in our community.

1004
01:19:42,124 --> 01:19:46,325
Ann Marie Callahan is still here in Medford with her loving husband, Brian.

1005
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:48,285
And just a great family.

1006
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:52,246
And she passed away this past week as well.

1007
01:19:52,446 --> 01:19:57,047
So if we could just keep them in our thoughts and prayers and send them a condolence on behalf of the Medford City Council.

1008
01:19:57,678 --> 01:20:02,181
If we could all stand for a moment of silence for all these people near and dear to Medford.

1009
01:20:17,733 --> 01:20:19,094
Quick announcement, if I can.

1010
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,395
I hope all the councilors got this.

1011
01:20:24,017 --> 01:20:26,679
An invitation from the development group

1012
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,562
Regarding the former Malden Hospital property was extended to the counselors.

1013
01:20:33,402 --> 01:20:41,925
They've mailed and invited and have been working for some weeks now with the Medford Butters up there as well as the Malden Butters.

1014
01:20:42,426 --> 01:20:46,067
This process is still in its infancy.

1015
01:20:47,888 --> 01:20:51,329
There's no commitment yet on anything.

1016
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:54,070
They want to know what the community feels.

1017
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:08,449
And since the major portion of this, uh, is in Malden of this development and it will require, um, perhaps some amendments to Malden zoning, uh, regulations.

1018
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:15,433
Uh, that's why they're, they've been spending more time with Malden to see where it goes with them before they speak to Medford.

1019
01:21:16,054 --> 01:21:20,937
With Medford, it's not as it seems this way right now, there's not going to be,

1020
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:34,126
much of any construction on Medford, there will be impact of course, but, uh, uh, the wooded area is going to be preserved, but they, uh, extend the invitation to the counselors and the citizens, uh, so we can, uh, all be up to date.

1021
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:49,976
And when the time comes for us to have meetings, uh, should this process start to move further, then, uh, that, that opportunity will present itself and we'll be on the forefront of that, uh, as, uh, counselors,

1022
01:21:50,693 --> 01:21:53,435
protecting the interests of providers up there.

1023
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,316
Councilor Penta, Councilor Camuso.

1024
01:21:56,957 --> 01:21:58,237
Thank you, Mr. President.

1025
01:21:58,898 --> 01:22:05,782
If I just very briefly on this, I'm actually glad to see this development taking place.

1026
01:22:06,682 --> 01:22:20,090
And the reason I say that is we have to make sure that the Medford's neighborhood is protected, but that hospital has always concerned me of a not so good development or facility taking place up there because it's actually in a Medford residential neighborhood.

1027
01:22:20,615 --> 01:22:21,795
practically more than Malden.

1028
01:22:22,435 --> 01:22:48,542
And to echo some of my sentiments from earlier when we were talking about the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and potentially having a vacant piece of property and something not so nice for a neighbourhood to come in, and by speaking with this gentleman for the past six months or so, the developer, in meeting with neighbours, I really believe that they're committed to making sure that this is done in a way that it's respectful of the Medford neighbourhood

1029
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:58,087
I know Councillor Marks put a paper on before, I believe it was you Councillor Marks, correct me if I'm wrong, to install some sort of a structure up there so it will not be a cut through.

1030
01:22:59,528 --> 01:23:10,037
So this council has been proactive on this since it first started, but I also very much respect the development and where they do have to go in front of Malden before coming to Medford.

1031
01:23:10,638 --> 01:23:16,383
It would be similar to us doing a development and the developer goes to Somerville before he has

1032
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:20,615
has the time to come before the Medford City Council or the Medford Zoning Board.

1033
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:24,797
So if the zoning and stuff isn't approved over there, then this is going nowhere.

1034
01:23:25,077 --> 01:23:27,079
And it's basically moot on the Medford portion.

1035
01:23:28,099 --> 01:23:41,267
And just for the viewing public, I know the neighbors were very concerned, and there's a great group of neighbors right up there on Lund Road and that whole surrounding area, that they legally have to be notified of any zoning changes

1036
01:23:41,793 --> 01:23:47,436
even if it's across city lines, if they're within the boundaries of what's called for by law.

1037
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:51,739
I specifically checked that out during a neighborhood meeting up there with our city solicitor.

1038
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:59,043
So anyone that thinks that the zoning laws don't apply because it's on the other side of the town or city border, that is incorrect.

1039
01:23:59,203 --> 01:24:03,785
And so we will have a seat at the table at the appropriate time.

1040
01:24:04,325 --> 01:24:06,927
And Council President De La Russo, I know you've been working on this.

1041
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:12,509
very hot as well as I was when I was sitting in your seat.

1042
01:24:12,929 --> 01:24:15,551
So, look forward to upcoming meetings.

1043
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,792
And thank you for keeping us abreast and getting the developer at the table.

1044
01:24:18,812 --> 01:24:23,035
Thank you.

1045
01:24:23,055 --> 01:24:27,457
Thank you for your reference previously to Councillor Camuso because it was what you started that I picked up.

1046
01:24:27,778 --> 01:24:29,238
Councillor Pinto wanted to speak on this?

1047
01:24:29,258 --> 01:24:32,580
Yeah, during the last snowstorm, not this one, the first one,

1048
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:35,303
We're all snowbound in.

1049
01:24:35,683 --> 01:24:37,505
We're in a perpetual snowstorm for the next couple of weeks.

1050
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,026
Yeah, well, the first day of the first storm.

1051
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:39,686
Let's put it that way.

1052
01:24:40,427 --> 01:24:42,889
I received a phone call from one of the president managing partners.

1053
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:44,710
And I had about a half hour conversation with him.

1054
01:24:45,171 --> 01:24:48,613
He indicated to me that they are going to have five houses on the Medford side.

1055
01:24:49,094 --> 01:24:50,655
There are going to be five houses.

1056
01:24:51,215 --> 01:24:54,218
And with those five houses, I always said, I don't care what you're doing in Malden.

1057
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:58,601
I'm more concerned of what's going to happen here in Medford, its effect, and how this is going to play out.

1058
01:24:59,802 --> 01:25:01,163
So he is concerned.

1059
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,164
He is aware of the fact.

1060
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:04,305
that there was a concern because of the five houses.

1061
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:13,772
So I don't think, again, from my conversation, my take was, I don't think there's been that much involvement between the city and him, other than the fact that they're having this meeting.

1062
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:26,943
Nothing is definitive, but at the same time, they are aware that these five houses, which are less than what the original amount was gonna be, I believe it was either, I think it was nine, I don't think the original number was.

1063
01:25:27,423 --> 01:25:27,983
Seven, was it?

1064
01:25:28,364 --> 01:25:29,825
Seven, so it's down to five, but there's.

1065
01:25:31,623 --> 01:25:31,763
Right.

1066
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:39,927
So as a result of that, um, he is aware of the fact that Medford has a game, you know, a stake in this game and, and, uh, is that tomorrow night?

1067
01:25:40,547 --> 01:25:42,468
It's tomorrow night at 5 30.

1068
01:25:43,569 --> 01:25:45,010
And, uh, what is the location of that?

1069
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:46,891
I can't BB school.

1070
01:25:48,091 --> 01:25:48,411
All right.

1071
01:25:49,632 --> 01:25:56,855
So it's, it's worth for the neighbors going, uh, they've all been invited, uh, those within the, uh, 300 mile range, whatever, 300 yards, 300 feet.

1072
01:25:56,896 --> 01:25:57,156
And, uh,

1073
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,489
And we're warmly invited as well.

1074
01:26:03,169 --> 01:26:08,512
And these people who, the developers are listening.

1075
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:13,674
So this isn't going to go far if they don't, if they don't feel welcome.

1076
01:26:14,475 --> 01:26:16,376
So, so they mature about it.

1077
01:26:16,956 --> 01:26:18,096
Thank you for all of that.

1078
01:26:18,497 --> 01:26:20,157
We, Councilor Moxley, you wanted to speak on this?

1079
01:26:20,538 --> 01:26:29,922
Just if I could, Mr. President, the last meeting that was held at the BB Junior High, the concerns I got from local residents was that

1080
01:26:31,043 --> 01:26:43,867
The room was filled with 95% Malden residents and the few Method residents that took the time to go up, a lot of their issues were dismissed.

1081
01:26:45,427 --> 01:26:47,348
And that is a concern of mine.

1082
01:26:47,468 --> 01:27:00,171
And when I brought up the issue back, I believe it was two months ago, I asked that the city administration take a lead role in this on notification, which residents weren't notified of the first meeting,

1083
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:05,888
They found out through just some local talk.

1084
01:27:06,528 --> 01:27:16,971
And secondly, Mr. President, this council voted unanimously to put some type of barrier or arm on the Medford side of Lund Road, where the entrance is.

1085
01:27:17,711 --> 01:27:19,852
And I don't think we got a response back.

1086
01:27:19,932 --> 01:27:22,092
I don't remember receiving a response back.

1087
01:27:22,152 --> 01:27:28,514
I know the chief was in support of making sure that that wasn't open to access traffic.

1088
01:27:28,594 --> 01:27:29,774
Emergency vehicle, yes.

1089
01:27:30,218 --> 01:27:32,359
but not as a cut-through for access traffic.

1090
01:27:32,839 --> 01:27:37,901
So, you know, I'd like to get a response back from the administration on that, Mr. President.

1091
01:27:38,281 --> 01:27:46,184
And I also just read recently that the homes that were anticipated that were going to be on the Meffitt side are all gone now.

1092
01:27:47,205 --> 01:27:50,306
There is no plans for homes on the Meffitt side at all.

1093
01:27:50,846 --> 01:27:54,288
So, I think that's a little different than what Councilor Penta just mentioned.

1094
01:27:54,648 --> 01:27:59,990
I know we had a conversation as that gentleman reached out to all of us, but I just recently read

1095
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:05,302
that Methodists not going to have any building at all on our side.

1096
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:10,723
And they were going to honor the buffer, the wooded buffer along the property lines.

1097
01:28:11,304 --> 01:28:23,747
So I just want to make sure that the city administration, I know they're having a meeting tomorrow night, but I want to make sure that the city administration is well represented there because they're supposed to be representing the residents of this community.

1098
01:28:24,287 --> 01:28:26,847
And 530 meeting might be tough for people to make it to.

1099
01:28:27,528 --> 01:28:29,248
And we should know that there's someone

1100
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:40,292
fighting on our behalf, whether it's the community development director, the mayor himself, the building department, someone from the administration or several people should be there, Mr. President also.

1101
01:28:40,312 --> 01:28:49,879
So I would have that as a, as part of this motion that, um, you know, I appreciate we were invited, but also the administration should be well represented.

1102
01:28:50,179 --> 01:28:57,805
There's no motion before us, but we will send a communicate, uh, to the city administration tomorrow morning, Mr. Clerk, uh,

1103
01:28:59,287 --> 01:29:05,150
expressing to them our desire that they represent the interest of the city of Medford at this meeting.

1104
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:07,411
And the barrier that we already voted on.

1105
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:12,174
And to remind them that we've voted on a barrier that is already there?

1106
01:29:12,694 --> 01:29:14,375
There's a barrier on their property.

1107
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:16,716
There's a barrier on their property.

1108
01:29:17,236 --> 01:29:27,721
Is it a cement barrier, Chief, or is it, I think it's a cement barrier that's over there, but we were talking about, they can easily remove that cement barrier and we didn't want the road to be used.

1109
01:29:27,741 --> 01:29:28,662
They're not even building it.

1110
01:29:30,233 --> 01:29:31,253
No, the barrier itself.

1111
01:29:31,313 --> 01:29:32,353
That could be removed.

1112
01:29:32,654 --> 01:29:36,254
They don't need approval from the City of Meffitt to remove their own barrier.

1113
01:29:36,754 --> 01:29:39,695
And once that's removed, that remains an open access road.

1114
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:46,176
And we wanted to prohibit that from being an open access road by building our own barrier on our side.

1115
01:29:47,157 --> 01:29:51,397
If you would amend that notification on behalf of Councilor Marks.

1116
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:56,477
No, I'm sorry.

1117
01:29:56,497 --> 01:30:00,100
I, I'm not really aware of what is there right now for a barrier.

1118
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,360
I know it used to be a fence.

1119
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:17,931
I'm not sure what else they may have put in place recently, but I, I believe that what should be there as some sort of a fire gate, at least at a minimum that so emergency vehicles can access the property, but it should not be used as a through way or an alternate roadway in and out of that property.

1120
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:21,433
We've had nothing but nightmares in the past when it was open.

1121
01:30:22,207 --> 01:30:27,271
And that neighborhood right now is totally congested with traffic morning and afternoon.

1122
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:31,654
So certainly nothing more than a, than a fire gate.

1123
01:30:31,674 --> 01:30:42,281
Some of the, so the ones you see at the DCR reservations, something that the fire department and any EMTs, anyone else can get through there easily when needed.

1124
01:30:42,962 --> 01:30:43,162
Yes.

1125
01:30:43,782 --> 01:30:50,647
I think that the possible developers of this possible development, uh, have the message loud and clear.

1126
01:30:51,472 --> 01:30:52,813
of what the will of the neighbors is.

1127
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:53,933
Thank you.

1128
01:30:53,973 --> 01:30:54,293
Thank you.

1129
01:30:56,975 --> 01:31:00,436
We've got one more piece here, this tower piece, if we can.

1130
01:31:01,096 --> 01:31:11,181
Just 15-033, petition by Paul DeMello, 7 Held Circle, Medford, Mass., to address the council on cell towers.

1131
01:31:11,621 --> 01:31:12,922
Mr. DeMello, are you present?

1132
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:15,163
No, if I may.

1133
01:31:15,843 --> 01:31:16,923
Madam Vice President.

1134
01:31:17,484 --> 01:31:20,105
If I may, I actually met with Paul DeMello

1135
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:25,630
last week at city hall and recommended that he wanted to speak before the council.

1136
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:31,432
I recommended that he go to the city clerk and put it on the issues that he's having.

1137
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:34,813
I'm assuming he's not here because of the issue with the snow.

1138
01:31:35,293 --> 01:31:36,953
So I'd just like to speak in his favor.

1139
01:31:37,213 --> 01:31:38,734
I do live in the area as well.

1140
01:31:39,154 --> 01:31:42,355
There is a cell tower right outside his home.

1141
01:31:44,368 --> 01:31:45,708
He went to the building department.

1142
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:48,869
I think he went to probably two or three other locations within City Hall.

1143
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:50,569
Wasn't able to find any answers.

1144
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:54,910
He's just looking to see, and I agree with him, who owns the cell tower?

1145
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:56,470
Who's responsible for it?

1146
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:00,671
Who in the city of Medford oversees any work that's being done on it?

1147
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:05,452
There is a lot of work that was being done on the cell tower in January.

1148
01:32:05,612 --> 01:32:07,812
I'm not sure if that's continued into February.

1149
01:32:08,752 --> 01:32:10,672
But, you know, what type of insurance do they have?

1150
01:32:10,773 --> 01:32:13,473
We would just like to know who has ownership of the tower.

1151
01:32:14,925 --> 01:32:20,428
No, it has been there, but the work that they've been doing is after hours and early in the morning.

1152
01:32:20,448 --> 01:32:31,254
And cell towers, you know, just always have issues and people always are concerned with what's going on, what's being put onto the cell tower, what's being added to the cell tower.

1153
01:32:31,655 --> 01:32:36,317
So I too would like to know, you know, who's responsible for it, what type of work is being done.

1154
01:32:36,858 --> 01:32:43,261
I sent an email to Paul Moki, our building commissioner, probably about eight days ago, nine days ago.

1155
01:32:44,616 --> 01:32:45,876
haven't got a response back.

1156
01:32:45,976 --> 01:32:54,499
So if we could send a request to Paul Mulkey, I believe the building department is where we'd get our answers.

1157
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,140
I just haven't been able to get the answers yet.

1158
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:04,723
So I just want to speak on Mr. DiMello's behalf, because he had true concern over what was taking place at the tower.

1159
01:33:04,903 --> 01:33:07,724
And I, too, again, live in the area.

1160
01:33:07,784 --> 01:33:12,606
And there are a lot of people that have questions with what's going on over there.

1161
01:33:13,718 --> 01:33:28,082
So on the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern, that the building department report back to the council with regards to the cell tower next to Held Circle in Medford.

1162
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:32,164
Who is the owner of the cell tower?

1163
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:36,105
Does anybody in the building department have

1164
01:33:36,786 --> 01:33:41,588
any, you know, oversight of what goes on, what type of work is being done at that tower?

1165
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:45,270
And if so, if we could get the answers, what work is being done?

1166
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,451
Is there insurance?

1167
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:51,333
Mr. President?

1168
01:33:51,354 --> 01:33:51,914
Councillor Camuso.

1169
01:33:52,494 --> 01:33:53,174
Thank you.

1170
01:33:53,935 --> 01:34:01,299
I dealt with this, with the family that the tower's in front of, and this was several years ago when they bought the house.

1171
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:05,681
They moved out here from the north end of Boston to

1172
01:34:06,426 --> 01:34:11,928
held circle in particular, and I don't believe that's a regular cell tower.

1173
01:34:12,548 --> 01:34:22,751
I think it may have something to do with mass port communications in Logan Airport, but certainly that has been there for the last 20 or 30 years from when we originally looked into it.

1174
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:28,813
So I agree with Councillor Lungo-Kern to at least get an update, but unfortunately,

1175
01:34:30,027 --> 01:34:31,107
It was something that's been there.

1176
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:34,229
I think it might have been there prior to the development of some of the houses up there.

1177
01:34:34,249 --> 01:34:40,711
Because I know there would have been huge public outcry at the time to put that inside a residential neighborhood.

1178
01:34:42,312 --> 01:34:50,134
We dealt with it with some of the billboards getting switched out down on Mystic Avenue.

1179
01:34:50,735 --> 01:34:53,776
And that's stuff that you have to be cognizant of the fact when you buy your home.

1180
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:59,718
And I actually said that to the person in the family that I was dealing with at the time that moved out here from Boston.

1181
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,966
You can't buy your house next to a park and then say, hey, get rid of the park.

1182
01:35:04,807 --> 01:35:07,508
I know I used to have that argument with my grandmother at Century Street all the time.

1183
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:10,869
Now my cousin Joey loves having the park there.

1184
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:16,131
So if we could get those answers, though, it would at least alleviate some of the questions and concerns.

1185
01:35:16,531 --> 01:35:22,553
And there's no reason, like Councillor Langel-Kern said, the building department should be issuing permits for when they're doing work on it, no matter who it is.

1186
01:35:22,953 --> 01:35:26,174
And there also should be emergency contact information on the fence that goes around it.

1187
01:35:26,694 --> 01:35:28,575
Similar to the National Grid, you drive through Burlington,

1188
01:35:28,978 --> 01:35:31,679
And they have those huge towers that are delivering electricity.

1189
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,422
And they all say, in case of emergency, call this phone number, blah, blah, blah.

1190
01:35:37,463 --> 01:35:40,644
That's important for after-hours emergencies and things of that nature.

1191
01:35:41,164 --> 01:35:42,905
So I support this 100%.

1192
01:35:43,346 --> 01:35:44,866
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1193
01:35:44,987 --> 01:35:45,727
Councilor Pinto.

1194
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:46,667
Quick question on this.

1195
01:35:46,948 --> 01:35:50,049
On this cell tower that's going up, this is the one with the red beacon on the top?

1196
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,650
It's not going up.

1197
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:52,551
I mean, it's up.

1198
01:35:52,571 --> 01:35:54,051
Is this the one with the red beacon that goes off?

1199
01:35:54,852 --> 01:35:56,613
Are there other towers that, I mean,

1200
01:35:57,597 --> 01:36:02,399
sell things on there like AT&T and Verizon, they aren't attached to that?

1201
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:06,060
Because if that's the case, we don't even know if they're being assessed, and that's tax revenue.

1202
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:14,663
So maybe we can get a further report back from the building commission to find out if- As amended, if they're producing revenue?

1203
01:36:14,783 --> 01:36:14,983
Yeah.

1204
01:36:15,584 --> 01:36:17,584
And the assessor's office too.

1205
01:36:17,604 --> 01:36:17,764
Right.

1206
01:36:17,884 --> 01:36:19,185
Who's paying?

1207
01:36:19,205 --> 01:36:21,346
Maybe they'll have the answer for the ownership.

1208
01:36:21,946 --> 01:36:23,727
If I remember correctly, that was what it was.

1209
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:29,886
One person was the owner, and maybe Massport had some equipment on it, and Verizon, and this and that.

1210
01:36:29,906 --> 01:36:30,806
So that's a good question.

1211
01:36:31,127 --> 01:36:43,214
Maybe if we could ask the assessor's office with regards to who's paying the taxes on the cell tower, on Held Circle, we can get some sort of answer as to what type of ownership and start there.

1212
01:36:44,335 --> 01:36:45,355
And then I'll look into it.

1213
01:36:45,655 --> 01:36:52,740
I'm just not sure why the building department hasn't answered Mr. DeMello's questions, nor returned my email.

1214
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,681
So I'm curious to find out why.

1215
01:36:55,422 --> 01:36:55,642
Yes.

1216
01:36:56,582 --> 01:37:03,125
On the motion of vice president Lungo Kern as amended and the chief wishes to speak.

1217
01:37:05,526 --> 01:37:18,870
I'd like to, uh, to add to that if possible, when we find out who the owner is, you know, where it's probably the highest spot in the city of Medford, maybe there may be some, uh, uh, ability for public safety to have access to those towers as well.

1218
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:23,392
If, if they're capable of holding additional equipment, microwave dishes, et cetera.

1219
01:37:24,437 --> 01:37:25,157
They've been there.

1220
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:32,419
I know, I believe Verizon may own one of them on Murray Street, and there's another one right behind the Glenridge.

1221
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:39,661
And I'm not sure if, I know at one time, Harvard University owned it, and then I think Channel 7 was on there.

1222
01:37:40,302 --> 01:37:47,844
So they're pretty huge structures, and while we're at it, let's ask them if public safety could have access to it as well.

1223
01:37:48,284 --> 01:37:51,765
We may never use it, but it'd be nice to know if we could have that opportunity.

1224
01:37:52,428 --> 01:37:56,890
And so moved by Councillor Lungo-Kern, as recommended by the Chief.

1225
01:37:59,291 --> 01:37:59,911
Mr. Citizen.

1226
01:38:00,671 --> 01:38:02,392
Robert Capucci, 71 Evett Street.

1227
01:38:02,612 --> 01:38:21,240
If I could just add a request, because Councillor Camuso brought up the towers in Burlington, if it is at all possible to find out from the safety department if this tower's given off any radiation, because a lot of those towers do, that could be another

1228
01:38:21,694 --> 01:38:22,735
public safety concern.

1229
01:38:22,755 --> 01:38:23,116
Thank you.

1230
01:38:23,136 --> 01:38:27,381
It's a serious public health concern for people.

1231
01:38:28,762 --> 01:38:32,827
On the motion of approval by Vice President Lago-Curran as amended, all those in favor?

1232
01:38:33,328 --> 01:38:34,189
All those opposed?

1233
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:35,991
Motion carries.

1234
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:38,414
We have a few papers in hand of the clerk.

1235
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:41,818
Did Councillor Pinto ask for suspension to discuss

1236
01:38:42,575 --> 01:39:03,427
allow the chief and the citizen to discuss, um, updating and updating the parking program, the parking, the snow, communication, uh, to, uh, the council president Della Russo and members of the city council from mayor Michael J McGlynn, our parking program updates and responses to a number of the questions, uh, uh, given to us.

1237
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:09,030
Uh, and so, uh, perhaps if the, uh, council would like to speak on them briefly and then

1238
01:39:09,507 --> 01:39:11,928
allow the chief to address the matters.

1239
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:16,829
And I know there's a local shopkeeper, too, who would like to speak.

1240
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:22,850
He's presented us with editions, which have been duly recorded by the clerk, to his petitions.

1241
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:25,970
I'd like to hear from the gentleman, the citizen first.

1242
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:26,851
Thank you.

1243
01:39:27,051 --> 01:39:27,651
He's been waiting.

1244
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:35,372
Good evening.

1245
01:39:35,392 --> 01:39:38,473
Mr. President, I'm Jimmy Spirakis from Jimmy's Pizza.

1246
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:44,404
I guess I bring some more pages for a lot of the residents and customers.

1247
01:39:44,424 --> 01:39:50,008
And they again, and they're on grid with these meters.

1248
01:39:50,628 --> 01:39:54,371
Also, we find out Friday night we have a lot of problems with customers.

1249
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:57,033
We give 20, 25 minutes to pick up the notice.

1250
01:39:57,773 --> 01:39:58,954
It was busy night.

1251
01:39:58,974 --> 01:40:04,238
They know already, so people never stay coming in, they jump out, they come back.

1252
01:40:04,678 --> 01:40:08,141
Actually, two customers, they argument a little bit with my son.

1253
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:09,842
He says, I place an order in 20 minutes.

1254
01:40:10,343 --> 01:40:11,003
He says, no ready.

1255
01:40:11,584 --> 01:40:14,686
I says, we have a lot of orders, you know, we have to wait a little bit.

1256
01:40:14,986 --> 01:40:21,471
He says, yeah, but I got a car up there, I don't want to put the money there, so I want to get a ticket.

1257
01:40:21,852 --> 01:40:26,155
So, you know, Becker Ford was already three customers, we have this discussion for a night.

1258
01:40:27,536 --> 01:40:32,240
So, and again, Mr. Chief, they come and I appreciate.

1259
01:40:32,998 --> 01:40:35,721
They come to see in a lunchtime, it was five minutes of 12.

1260
01:40:36,943 --> 01:40:38,705
There was not even one customer in the store.

1261
01:40:38,725 --> 01:40:40,567
It's been spent about 20 minutes.

1262
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:42,790
No one.

1263
01:40:43,811 --> 01:40:48,437
Usually lunchtime, at least we have at least about 15, 20 hours.

1264
01:40:48,738 --> 01:40:50,500
They're going out, all customers sitting.

1265
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:54,648
After you leave, a customer comes all the time for roast beef.

1266
01:40:54,688 --> 01:40:55,969
He likes the roast beef.

1267
01:40:56,489 --> 01:40:58,251
He reads the newspaper for 10 minutes.

1268
01:40:58,311 --> 01:41:02,614
He says, Jimmy, put it to go, because I don't want to pay money with the mirror.

1269
01:41:02,654 --> 01:41:06,357
He says, I've got to park my car someplace down the Grove Street.

1270
01:41:06,377 --> 01:41:09,680
He says, I can eat my sandwich and read my newspaper.

1271
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:10,741
It's embarrassing.

1272
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:15,845
I want to say, I can give you a quarter, but it's not nice to say to the customer.

1273
01:41:16,645 --> 01:41:19,548
I mean, it really, really affects this mirror.

1274
01:41:21,132 --> 01:41:22,753
a lot, a lot of people.

1275
01:41:24,294 --> 01:41:27,195
And again, I got a customer for Place de Rod.

1276
01:41:28,196 --> 01:41:30,897
He works for a post office in Arlington.

1277
01:41:31,337 --> 01:41:36,360
He said, Jimmy, we like your food, but why should I pay money, he says, to come here?

1278
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:42,904
I can go, he says, down the street, no meter down the street from you, or I can go in Arlington.

1279
01:41:43,704 --> 01:41:45,665
I have, he says, two hours parking free.

1280
01:41:46,866 --> 01:41:50,808
After two hours, he says, I just put a quarter, regular, those all meters.

1281
01:41:52,088 --> 01:41:54,870
He says, I don't mind to do that after if I stay over two hours.

1282
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:59,475
But this is ridiculous, just I have to pay for ten minutes, I have to pay money.

1283
01:42:00,015 --> 01:42:08,362
So anybody comes, if he goes next door to the bakery, they go to the tailor, it's over and over the same thing.

1284
01:42:10,184 --> 01:42:17,550
So I don't have any decisions, anything yet, because we're coming every week, and I don't know what is gonna happen.

1285
01:42:18,946 --> 01:42:21,628
And really, business is very, very slow.

1286
01:42:24,289 --> 01:42:24,889
Very slow.

1287
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:33,554
I can bring my receipts, I can bring my revenues from six months ago.

1288
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:41,899
Of course, this time of the month, you know, it's always slow after the holidays, but not really that slow.

1289
01:42:42,939 --> 01:42:47,602
People really, I mean, they don't want to pay the money.

1290
01:42:51,795 --> 01:42:52,556
That's all I want to say.

1291
01:42:52,576 --> 01:42:57,219
I don't know when we're going to make any decisions in the next couple of weeks.

1292
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:58,620
Thank you.

1293
01:42:58,660 --> 01:42:59,341
I appreciate it.

1294
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:02,883
Thank you very much, Mr. Jimmy.

1295
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:10,189
You have the chief.

1296
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:14,192
Chief, do you want to add anything too?

1297
01:43:14,232 --> 01:43:15,733
We've received a written report.

1298
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:26,786
I've been here, and as I said, the emirates, of course, they want to increase their revenue for Syria.

1299
01:43:27,907 --> 01:43:36,034
And business also increased their revenue, because also, if you notice, the mills tax, 7% in Medford.

1300
01:43:37,456 --> 01:43:39,677
And 0.75 goes to the city.

1301
01:43:39,697 --> 01:43:40,598
The mills tax, 6.25 goes to state.

1302
01:43:46,783 --> 01:43:56,367
And $0.75 was, you know, so now also this is going to be, we're going to lose money also because if customers goes to Winchester and we're going to go to Arlington.

1303
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:01,269
So it's, I don't know, nobody managed this house.

1304
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:05,130
Thank you, Jimmy.

1305
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:06,210
Councilor Knight.

1306
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:09,972
Yeah, Mr. President, I think that Mr. Spiracus makes a great point.

1307
01:44:10,686 --> 01:44:17,691
When you look at the money that we're bringing in on meals tax, that shows almost a direct correlation as to how well our businesses in downtown are doing.

1308
01:44:18,072 --> 01:44:31,301
So I think it might make sense for us to get some numbers in terms of what we collected pre-parking enforcement so that we can have something to compare them to at a later time so we can have a benchmark as to what business was like before parking.

1309
01:44:31,662 --> 01:44:33,263
Then maybe we can do a 90-day review.

1310
01:44:33,283 --> 01:44:34,524
We already have one on file.

1311
01:44:34,544 --> 01:44:40,168
We can take a look at a 90-day review and match those numbers up with the same time last year and see exactly what the impact is.

1312
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:41,080
Thank you.

1313
01:44:41,160 --> 01:45:06,626
So be it resolved by a counselor night that the, uh, city, uh, a treasurer's office, uh, informed the, uh, council regarding a corollary report, 2014, 2015, uh, to update us on, uh, tax revenue on meals tax, uh, income to the city of Medford.

1314
01:45:08,934 --> 01:45:11,297
uh, does the chief wish to, uh, speak to the council?

1315
01:45:11,858 --> 01:45:17,885
Uh, we were given a written report updating us, so I don't, uh, certainly don't expect you to read the report at us.

1316
01:45:19,687 --> 01:45:20,768
Thank you, Mr. President.

1317
01:45:21,329 --> 01:45:22,550
And I would hope that you wouldn't.

1318
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:24,212
I will not be doing that.

1319
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:28,798
The only issue that I wanted to present to the council and let the public know that

1320
01:45:29,566 --> 01:45:45,732
I did receive the official word from the city solicitor, Mark Rumley, that the traffic commission within its scope and powers and duties as a traffic commission does have the power to set the time limit on the, uh, on the kiosks and in the needed enforcement.

1321
01:45:46,332 --> 01:45:57,116
So we will have it on our agenda next Tuesday, February 10th, 2 PM, uh, to change the times instead of seven P seven AM to 7 PM.

1322
01:45:58,476 --> 01:45:59,737
change it from 8 a.m.

1323
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:02,239
to 6 p.m.

1324
01:46:02,659 --> 01:46:05,882
With that, we will have that on our agenda to be voted on.

1325
01:46:07,223 --> 01:46:08,504
Thank you, Chief.

1326
01:46:08,544 --> 01:46:09,284
Councilor Penta?

1327
01:46:09,304 --> 01:46:24,956
Chief, with all due respect to that decision that was made, the contract that was written on September 10th and then executed on October 7th with only a change of one word, both explicitly have a time zone in there of 7 to 7.

1328
01:46:25,616 --> 01:46:27,057
The RFP that went out was 7 to 7.

1329
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:30,592
The three bidders that came in were 7 to 7.

1330
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:33,915
That's a material change to the contract.

1331
01:46:35,216 --> 01:46:36,637
I understand what you're saying.

1332
01:46:36,657 --> 01:46:40,500
I'm going on the word of the city solicitor that it's within our power to set that time limit.

1333
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:47,366
I would think in all fairness to the other bidders and the competitors that they probably should be advised now that the city of Medford is changing.

1334
01:46:48,387 --> 01:46:51,409
Because I don't even know if the city is opening themselves up to a lawsuit here.

1335
01:46:51,429 --> 01:46:54,772
Because I think if I was one of the other competitors, I'd be very concerned over this.

1336
01:46:56,067 --> 01:46:59,910
An hour in the morning, an hour at night, six days a week, that's how many hours a week?

1337
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:02,212
It's 12 hours of enforcement.

1338
01:47:02,432 --> 01:47:02,692
OK.

1339
01:47:02,832 --> 01:47:04,233
That's 12 hours that they're losing.

1340
01:47:04,533 --> 01:47:05,774
That's 48 hours a month.

1341
01:47:05,834 --> 01:47:07,736
Four times, that's four months out of the week.

1342
01:47:08,096 --> 01:47:10,938
And if they all had the same opportunity to bid the same way, OK.

1343
01:47:11,218 --> 01:47:12,900
Making all these other changes, OK.

1344
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:13,860
I think you can live with that.

1345
01:47:14,421 --> 01:47:15,782
But that's a material change.

1346
01:47:16,342 --> 01:47:17,303
That's a huge change.

1347
01:47:17,343 --> 01:47:20,045
But it's within the power of the Traffic Commission to make that change.

1348
01:47:20,525 --> 01:47:22,267
And they can do whatever they want.

1349
01:47:22,307 --> 01:47:24,108
We don't need to notify the other bidders.

1350
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:33,536
They weren't told about additional parking that was provided on the streets that we ended up putting a commuter area on the upper end of Playstead Road.

1351
01:47:33,556 --> 01:47:35,197
That wasn't part of the spec at the time.

1352
01:47:36,298 --> 01:47:37,559
But that's not as much as the material.

1353
01:47:37,599 --> 01:47:38,820
All the eyes are on this program.

1354
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:47,786
If those other bidders at the time want to take the city to task or go against Republic for this, then let them go at it.

1355
01:47:48,246 --> 01:47:51,368
But the program is moving forward.

1356
01:47:51,688 --> 01:47:53,670
We've had a few slow weeks now with the snow.

1357
01:47:54,545 --> 01:47:59,247
So really this month, last month, and this month really is not a good gauge.

1358
01:47:59,267 --> 01:48:00,967
There hasn't been a lot of enforcement.

1359
01:48:01,167 --> 01:48:02,208
Absolutely has not.

1360
01:48:04,329 --> 01:48:05,209
Well, they were up there today.

1361
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:10,431
They were not citing people.

1362
01:48:11,511 --> 01:48:14,892
They were not citing people because the snow emergency is still in effect.

1363
01:48:14,952 --> 01:48:15,733
They cannot cite.

1364
01:48:16,153 --> 01:48:17,013
Then where are they out there from?

1365
01:48:17,493 --> 01:48:19,074
They were shoveling some of the kiosks.

1366
01:48:20,314 --> 01:48:21,255
You bring up a good point.

1367
01:48:21,275 --> 01:48:22,395
I hope no city employee,

1368
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,750
is helping to shovel out any of those kiosks.

1369
01:48:24,970 --> 01:48:26,912
They are not, to the best of my knowledge.

1370
01:48:27,152 --> 01:48:43,729
That is a private company, a municipal workers' union, and that is absolutely against their— Well, I can tell you, based on the magnitude of the snowfall and the amount of city workers that are involved in trying to clear the roads, they have absolutely no time to clear this kiosk.

1371
01:48:44,009 --> 01:48:44,890
Absolutely no time.

1372
01:48:47,945 --> 01:48:54,591
Chief, there's a couple of, Mr. President, there's a couple of things I think that the taxpayers should be aware of as to what took place.

1373
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:59,976
I don't see anything wrong with reading them off and letting the people know what's going on, Mr. President.

1374
01:49:00,796 --> 01:49:02,738
So if you don't want to read them, then I will read them.

1375
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,461
Chief seven minutes, uh, counselor Panto.

1376
01:49:06,682 --> 01:49:07,903
No, this is too important an issue.

1377
01:49:07,923 --> 01:49:09,144
Don't start with the minute thing.

1378
01:49:09,164 --> 01:49:09,404
We did.

1379
01:49:09,464 --> 01:49:10,605
It's too important of an issue.

1380
01:49:12,066 --> 01:49:14,008
The council recommendations regarding 15 Oh 22.

1381
01:49:15,893 --> 01:49:18,494
It says meters must be shut off during non-enforcement time.

1382
01:49:19,075 --> 01:49:25,698
The answer is that the meters will read no charge parking period after hours on Sundays and federal holidays.

1383
01:49:27,959 --> 01:49:29,720
So they're going to change the meter to do that?

1384
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,621
No, the meters are already programmed for that.

1385
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:41,686
Actually, the meter, the kiosk that we had at the police academy when we had our first meeting, we actually tried to use that meter after 7 PM.

1386
01:49:42,066 --> 01:49:44,968
Or actually, it was after 8 PM when the meeting ended.

1387
01:49:45,678 --> 01:49:47,579
And it wouldn't take any money.

1388
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,300
It was shut down because the time limit was seven.

1389
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:56,643
And it actually said, the words that are highlighted in that document, no charge parking period.

1390
01:49:57,543 --> 01:49:59,164
That's exactly what came up on the screen.

1391
01:50:00,565 --> 01:50:06,647
Next one, it indicates that a 10 minute grace period be granted at the end of a time period.

1392
01:50:07,228 --> 01:50:15,011
The answer is that per Republic parking, there was generally a five minute grace period from the time the vehicle takes note of expiration to the issuance of a ticket.

1393
01:50:15,473 --> 01:50:20,916
This is due to the driver having to park his vehicle and walk to the sighted vehicle and then put information for the ticket.

1394
01:50:21,596 --> 01:50:24,057
Now, is this for kiosks or is this for signs?

1395
01:50:25,918 --> 01:50:29,300
It would probably be for all of it, the kiosks and the signs.

1396
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:29,941
Well, how would you know?

1397
01:50:29,961 --> 01:50:33,723
The fact of the matter is they have to identify the violation first.

1398
01:50:34,523 --> 01:50:42,167
And the person could have been a violator, could have already been in violation for 5 or 10 minutes at that point when they find it.

1399
01:50:42,667 --> 01:50:43,548
Now, they can't park.

1400
01:50:44,447 --> 01:50:46,909
park their vehicle and come back and do the whole street.

1401
01:50:47,289 --> 01:50:49,691
They're not just picking out one individual vehicle.

1402
01:50:49,731 --> 01:50:52,653
They're going to scan the whole street, then come back.

1403
01:50:53,233 --> 01:51:09,846
So what we're told by Republicans is that there's basically a minimum of a five-minute built-in grace period without coming out and officially saying that there is a five-minute or a 10-minute or anything like that.

1404
01:51:10,346 --> 01:51:12,287
Two points that we had spoken about before last time was

1405
01:51:13,577 --> 01:51:17,679
having these kiosks in front of a residential apartment or a building.

1406
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:31,827
The one in West Medford, we had talked about putting it by the Brookline Bank, getting rid of the kiosks and putting a 30-minute sign period from here to corner and taking the one out in front of the apartment building.

1407
01:51:32,147 --> 01:51:42,192
The snow has put a delay on any of those right now, but that may be in the works as far as the one closest to the Brookline Bank, so it takes it a little further away from

1408
01:51:42,868 --> 01:51:43,728
the apartment building.

1409
01:51:43,868 --> 01:51:44,068
Right.

1410
01:51:44,108 --> 01:51:46,369
The one that's already in front of that home a little further up.

1411
01:51:46,389 --> 01:51:47,009
That's going to go.

1412
01:51:47,069 --> 01:51:48,109
That will be moved.

1413
01:51:48,149 --> 01:51:48,769
That's bagged.

1414
01:51:48,789 --> 01:51:49,790
That's not to be used.

1415
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,470
It will be moved.

1416
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:54,231
You also have it on High Street here in Medford, right opposite the library.

1417
01:51:54,391 --> 01:51:56,131
There's a kiosk in front of the apartment building.

1418
01:51:57,291 --> 01:51:57,972
Makes no sense.

1419
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:00,352
There's a kiosk in front of the apartment building.

1420
01:52:00,652 --> 01:52:01,552
You mean the condo's 100 high?

1421
01:52:01,572 --> 01:52:01,712
Yeah.

1422
01:52:01,732 --> 01:52:02,493
Right.

1423
01:52:03,613 --> 01:52:04,673
Well, they have a parking lot.

1424
01:52:04,873 --> 01:52:12,415
The people who park on High Street usually are business people in the square or people visiting a doctor's office, so it's not

1425
01:52:13,027 --> 01:52:20,933
I mean, that's a large condo complex that has a parking lot for its residents.

1426
01:52:21,114 --> 01:52:22,675
It's in the middle of the business district.

1427
01:52:23,255 --> 01:52:25,857
So I don't think there's a problem with the kiosk where it's placed there.

1428
01:52:26,818 --> 01:52:35,746
Because then, for that matter, we wouldn't be able to put a kiosk or a meter or any place because we have apartments above further down on High Street, 22 and 30 High Street.

1429
01:52:35,966 --> 01:52:41,190
So then you would be penalizing any doctor or any emergency control type of person or a visiting nurse or somebody who

1430
01:52:41,485 --> 01:52:45,267
doesn't have an opportunity or right to park in the building down below, not knowing about it.

1431
01:52:45,507 --> 01:52:47,828
So if they park in front of the building, they're going to get tagged and ticketed?

1432
01:52:48,188 --> 01:52:53,671
We already said, though, that most of the visiting nurses, they have a placard or something that they place on their dashboard.

1433
01:52:55,411 --> 01:52:56,592
I don't see it as a problem.

1434
01:52:56,632 --> 01:52:58,693
I think that's a good spot for it.

1435
01:52:58,713 --> 01:53:06,977
There's a lot of activity at 92 High Street, the armory building, and 84 High Street, the one that looks like the armory building.

1436
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:11,221
That kiosk is for that.

1437
01:53:11,261 --> 01:53:12,842
I mean, we have one in front of the library.

1438
01:53:12,882 --> 01:53:16,303
I mean, you know, you don't want to hear the story about the library right now.

1439
01:53:16,343 --> 01:53:16,523
No.

1440
01:53:16,563 --> 01:53:24,567
Well, you know, you know, I, I, I guess the problem I'm having with this is we really have not had an opportunity to test this.

1441
01:53:24,587 --> 01:53:30,150
You know, we're throwing stones at something that just, we haven't had an opportunity to let it run.

1442
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:34,892
We have not been able to do any kind of true enforcement for any extended period of time.

1443
01:53:35,523 --> 01:53:40,764
I mean, things are out there and we're saying before we even see how they're doing or what they're doing, we're saying, let's move.

1444
01:53:41,644 --> 01:53:43,225
I'm saying, okay, they're there.

1445
01:53:43,405 --> 01:53:44,445
Let's see what they do.

1446
01:53:44,605 --> 01:53:46,465
And let's feel the complaints.

1447
01:53:46,905 --> 01:53:48,426
And if they need to be moved, they'd be moved.

1448
01:53:48,446 --> 01:53:52,666
But to move one from in front of 100 high street, you're talking a lot of parking spaces.

1449
01:53:53,767 --> 01:53:55,227
You're mentioning to me about that.

1450
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:58,248
We're going to reduce the hours from seven to seven to eight to six.

1451
01:53:58,728 --> 01:54:00,108
If we take the meters out of there,

1452
01:54:01,564 --> 01:54:02,425
I'm not worried about them making money.

1453
01:54:02,445 --> 01:54:04,426
Now we're in violation of a contract provision.

1454
01:54:04,446 --> 01:54:04,886
How do you figure that?

1455
01:54:04,906 --> 01:54:06,667
Because we're saying there's going to be so many spaces.

1456
01:54:06,767 --> 01:54:07,388
How do you figure that?

1457
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,869
Because we're going to say there's so many needed spaces.

1458
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:12,871
Yeah, but they should be done intelligently.

1459
01:54:14,552 --> 01:54:15,733
Well, it goes back to what I said.

1460
01:54:15,793 --> 01:54:23,498
I mean, we have across the city, and we've spoken about West Medford Square, the apartments above one of the businesses there.

1461
01:54:23,858 --> 01:54:28,041
I mean, the fact of the matter is, we have apartments above business blocks everywhere.

1462
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:28,761
How do you justify that?

1463
01:54:28,781 --> 01:54:29,642
Kane Square, the same thing.

1464
01:54:32,547 --> 01:54:41,571
I think it might make sense that we go through the actual changes that the Traffic Commission has made prior to, you know, going through each point and making critical commentary.

1465
01:54:42,352 --> 01:54:44,733
You know, we're talking about locations of kiosks now.

1466
01:54:45,073 --> 01:54:48,214
We went from, we're on to item C, 10-minute grace period at the end of paid time.

1467
01:54:48,254 --> 01:54:49,835
Now we're talking about locations of kiosks.

1468
01:54:50,115 --> 01:54:52,196
I think we're really kind of veering off course here.

1469
01:54:52,877 --> 01:54:56,058
The purpose of the Chief to come up here was to tell us what changes were made since the last meeting.

1470
01:54:56,098 --> 01:55:00,520
So why don't we let the Chief explain to us what the changes were made, and then after that, we can present our questions.

1471
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,621
But maybe we can let him get through it

1472
01:55:02,267 --> 01:55:03,928
a little bit cleaner and easier for people to understand.

1473
01:55:15,073 --> 01:55:17,414
Well, you want to talk for two minutes or 43 seconds from the chair?

1474
01:55:19,675 --> 01:55:25,138
Number three, Mr. President, um, tickets issued on January 15th and 16th to be waived.

1475
01:55:25,578 --> 01:55:29,920
The answer is the individual has a right to appeal any ticket according to the lawful procedures.

1476
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:30,420
Again,

1477
01:55:31,609 --> 01:55:34,590
I think it's totally unfair, because we all know what happened on that particular day.

1478
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:42,774
Are you telling me that a police officer in an unmarked car could not issue a citation because people didn't recognize it as a police car?

1479
01:55:43,695 --> 01:55:51,498
This was the whole issue that you presented, because the parking enforcement vehicles had temporary Tennessee tags, and they didn't have the lettering on them.

1480
01:55:51,519 --> 01:55:51,659
Right.

1481
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:52,419
They had nothing on there.

1482
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:58,782
But when they step out of the vehicle, it says Republic Parking on their jacket, or it says Parking Ambassador on the back.

1483
01:55:59,169 --> 01:56:00,189
And they can present a ticket.

1484
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,950
I mean, they can write it.

1485
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:01,710
They're authorized.

1486
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:03,811
They're authorized, just because it's an unmarked vehicle.

1487
01:56:03,971 --> 01:56:05,552
These didn't have them on their chief.

1488
01:56:06,532 --> 01:56:07,913
No, but they had Republic Parking.

1489
01:56:07,953 --> 01:56:15,076
So the person has the right, if they wish to, appeal the ticket and say that they feel as though they were issued it wrongfully.

1490
01:56:19,638 --> 01:56:28,102
I thought when we discussed this originally, these were tickets issued for parking in front of a fire hydrant, parking in a handicapped spot,

1491
01:56:29,003 --> 01:56:35,386
And I thought this council voted to say, we're not going to eliminate any tickets, uh, for that, for that period.

1492
01:56:35,607 --> 01:56:47,433
I understand what the council is saying about the vehicle going around and the registration and the whole, a lot of other issues that were mentioned, but, but I thought we voted against saying to waive tickets on the 15th and 16th.

1493
01:56:47,453 --> 01:56:50,034
So I'm not quite sure why this was even on there.

1494
01:56:50,574 --> 01:56:51,475
I thought we removed this.

1495
01:56:53,578 --> 01:56:54,439
I thought we removed this.

1496
01:56:54,619 --> 01:56:56,040
Thank you for your point of information.

1497
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,581
Counselor Marks point of information.

1498
01:56:57,621 --> 01:56:58,261
Counselor Knight.

1499
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:05,186
As I remember it, Mr. President, Mr. Nash came up and Mr. Nash says that we'll said that we'd work to waive all the tickets issued on January 15th, 16th.

1500
01:57:05,766 --> 01:57:11,911
Um, however, if it was a handicap violation, a bus stop or a fire hydrant, that was something that they weren't willing to entertain.

1501
01:57:11,951 --> 01:57:14,953
However, any type of kiosk violation was my understanding was with it.

1502
01:57:14,973 --> 01:57:21,097
They were willing to live, but however, any type of violation that would be, you know, a normal infraction that necessarily wouldn't be,

1503
01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:26,495
a creature of the parking management program wouldn't be waived.

1504
01:57:27,196 --> 01:57:29,518
You know, if you're parking in a bus stop or a fire hydrant or something like that.

1505
01:57:29,538 --> 01:57:30,318
That was my understanding.

1506
01:57:30,398 --> 01:57:37,424
And I think we all did agree that those tickets would not be waived in terms of handicap or a fire hydrant.

1507
01:57:37,845 --> 01:57:46,692
Mr. President, just to follow on that, Mr. Nash was advised after the meeting also, he does not have the power to waive any tickets at any time.

1508
01:57:51,283 --> 01:57:52,204
Thank you, Mr. Chief.

1509
01:57:52,444 --> 01:57:55,366
And number F. The floor goes back to Councilor Panta.

1510
01:57:55,887 --> 01:57:58,729
Add orange to the ticket color coded in an envelope.

1511
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:09,038
Republic says that they'll add orange to the ticket, but they're not going to have an envelope because it's, quote, it's sound environmental practice not to put an envelope.

1512
01:58:09,218 --> 01:58:11,540
And that's kind of odd.

1513
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:19,607
But they are going to color code the ticket and make it look more official, because they did take the conversation that occurred here at the council meeting.

1514
01:58:20,098 --> 01:58:25,122
about the ticket almost looking like a register receipt from a grocery store.

1515
01:58:25,142 --> 01:58:27,103
So at least it will be an orange ticket.

1516
01:58:27,803 --> 01:58:30,805
Then it says asked to change the word from officer on ticket.

1517
01:58:31,386 --> 01:58:32,266
And they're not going to change it.

1518
01:58:32,286 --> 01:58:33,127
They're keeping the word officer.

1519
01:58:33,247 --> 01:58:34,848
Oh, parking enforcement officer.

1520
01:58:34,948 --> 01:58:36,309
So it's clear what they are.

1521
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:38,391
It's not patrol officer.

1522
01:58:38,451 --> 01:58:40,432
It's not Sergeant, Lieutenant, or any of that.

1523
01:58:41,413 --> 01:58:45,455
Then the next one on the next page is that reflective signs be placed on both sides of the kiosk.

1524
01:58:45,536 --> 01:58:47,677
It says Republicans in the process

1525
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:50,901
of ordering additional all-weather signs to affix, blah, blah, blah.

1526
01:58:51,282 --> 01:58:55,384
The next one, that the license plate reader technology be used for the police department.

1527
01:58:56,404 --> 01:58:56,744
Purchase.

1528
01:58:57,184 --> 01:58:57,565
Purchase.

1529
01:58:57,605 --> 01:58:58,465
The answer from the city.

1530
01:58:58,545 --> 01:59:05,028
As was mentioned at the city council meeting on January 20th, 2015, the council met with Republic earlier in the month regarding this.

1531
01:59:05,108 --> 01:59:06,249
It is currently in the process.

1532
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:10,411
And as soon as more detailed information is available, you'll be provided with it.

1533
01:59:11,131 --> 01:59:14,573
What does Republic have to do with this, with you people?

1534
01:59:15,726 --> 01:59:20,951
Well, with regard to that, it's just, you know, we're getting the specs on the system that they use.

1535
01:59:21,651 --> 01:59:27,817
And we, whatever model we go with, we want to make sure that we're able to harness their technology and utilize it.

1536
01:59:28,498 --> 01:59:36,185
We don't want to buy a system for like, there's a number of vendors out there for license plate readers, but sometimes you can't, the two different companies won't talk to each other.

1537
01:59:36,205 --> 01:59:40,769
So we want to make sure we get the right information, but I can tell you that process is moving forward.

1538
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:41,850
Another,

1539
01:59:42,723 --> 01:59:44,183
Point of information, Councillor Knight.

1540
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:56,386
I also believe Mr. Nash stated when he was here that they were going to assist the City of Medford getting them at a cheaper cost because they were using their purchase power that they have because they're a national company that does this across the country so they buy more of this type of equipment.

1541
01:59:57,046 --> 01:59:57,807
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

1542
01:59:58,287 --> 02:00:07,389
On that particular matter that Councillor Knight just brings up, Councillor Caviello and myself had the opportunity to be at the MMA meeting and when there were five vendors there,

1543
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:11,428
as it relates to the model and make that we have here.

1544
02:00:11,588 --> 02:00:14,770
And I believe it was the distribution company for Republic that we were dealing with.

1545
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:18,312
And we got the cheapest, lowest grade model of a parking meter.

1546
02:00:19,172 --> 02:00:20,413
So I just thought I'd let you know.

1547
02:00:20,433 --> 02:00:23,374
Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

1548
02:00:23,434 --> 02:00:32,139
What Councilor Pender said, we had the opportunity to see the company that actually sold the parking meters to Republic.

1549
02:00:32,599 --> 02:00:37,082
And while we were there, they actually have, it's the same kiosk,

1550
02:00:37,415 --> 02:00:39,656
with a different interface, with a white screen.

1551
02:00:40,536 --> 02:00:44,097
Chief, it's a lot easier to see than the green one.

1552
02:00:44,477 --> 02:00:47,278
And the gentleman there said it's not a big deal to change them.

1553
02:00:47,298 --> 02:00:47,698
I don't know.

1554
02:00:47,718 --> 02:00:50,799
I don't know if maybe we didn't ask for that.

1555
02:00:52,339 --> 02:01:01,102
But like I said, if they were able to come in and change the screens to make that a white screen, make it for people to see a lot, lot easier.

1556
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:10,000
All I can say is when we had the demos with the different vendors that came in, I don't know if this was even offered to us as an option.

1557
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:19,545
Pakion was the model that they brought in, and Pakion, the representative from Pakion, came here with the machine, and we got what he demonstrated to us.

1558
02:01:19,625 --> 02:01:22,747
Yeah, but were we offered a different option of machine?

1559
02:01:23,307 --> 02:01:24,308
The machine looks the same, Chief.

1560
02:01:24,792 --> 02:01:27,894
Only thing is, the interface, it's a white interface.

1561
02:01:28,415 --> 02:01:33,298
So when the people go in, I gotta be honest with you, I have a hard time seeing the screen, even in the daytime.

1562
02:01:33,658 --> 02:01:37,982
This is a white color screen, and people can actually see it.

1563
02:01:38,622 --> 02:01:40,003
I mean, it doesn't do anything different.

1564
02:01:40,563 --> 02:01:44,466
And what Parkin also said, he said, that machine can do anything you want it to do.

1565
02:01:45,127 --> 02:01:47,228
He said, there's no limits to what it can and can't do.

1566
02:01:48,709 --> 02:01:53,613
And the Parkin guy said he'd be more than happy to come here, and let's see,

1567
02:01:54,872 --> 02:02:00,457
If it's possible to change those interfaces, I'd rather see that than what we have.

1568
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:04,500
Well, I'd be very disappointed if they sold us an outdated model.

1569
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,482
No, I'm not saying it's an outdated model.

1570
02:02:06,502 --> 02:02:13,927
I don't think they said, well, hey, you can have this one or this one.

1571
02:02:14,007 --> 02:02:16,189
Or maybe we just got the low budget item.

1572
02:02:16,269 --> 02:02:16,590
I don't know.

1573
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:20,593
All I know is when they came in and gave us the demo, packing on, the rep from packing on.

1574
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:24,510
What we have on the street is what was demonstrated to us.

1575
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:26,591
It's identical looking.

1576
02:02:26,931 --> 02:02:28,792
Just the interface screen is white.

1577
02:02:29,472 --> 02:02:32,014
It's a lot easier to see and use.

1578
02:02:32,334 --> 02:02:34,975
I think the question was both asked by us, just the two of us.

1579
02:02:35,596 --> 02:02:36,376
What other options?

1580
02:02:36,396 --> 02:02:37,176
They asked it to us.

1581
02:02:37,537 --> 02:02:39,037
Weren't you shown these other options?

1582
02:02:39,077 --> 02:02:40,038
And the answer had to be no.

1583
02:02:40,638 --> 02:02:42,259
And how are you supposed to answer that?

1584
02:02:42,899 --> 02:02:44,460
We were only shown one machine and that was it.

1585
02:02:45,181 --> 02:02:46,661
We were shown one machine by then.

1586
02:02:46,702 --> 02:02:47,222
There was another.

1587
02:02:48,188 --> 02:02:48,808
But by that company, though.

1588
02:02:48,828 --> 02:02:51,889
The company that showed their machine, there were a bunch of them.

1589
02:02:51,929 --> 02:02:53,150
But the model we want was Pacquiao.

1590
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:57,011
Pacquiao says it's not that big of a deal to change the face.

1591
02:02:57,711 --> 02:02:58,791
Probably not a big deal to change.

1592
02:02:58,851 --> 02:02:59,872
It's probably very costly.

1593
02:03:00,492 --> 02:03:01,712
Thank you, Counselor Penta.

1594
02:03:01,752 --> 02:03:03,513
Counselor Carfiello, you're off the floor.

1595
02:03:03,693 --> 02:03:09,055
Well, I'd like to get a cost on, if there is a cost difference of changing that.

1596
02:03:10,015 --> 02:03:12,876
I will bring the message back.

1597
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:15,897
The Pacquiao gentleman said he'd be more than happy to come here and speak.

1598
02:03:16,447 --> 02:03:18,528
and explain the difference between the two screens.

1599
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:20,789
Thank you, Ken.

1600
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:25,110
Also, are you all set, Councilor Cavillo?

1601
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:25,791
Yes, Mr. President.

1602
02:03:25,951 --> 02:03:27,131
Vice President Lungo Kern.

1603
02:03:27,751 --> 02:03:31,393
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

1604
02:03:31,633 --> 02:03:34,674
Just a question about the permit parking.

1605
02:03:34,734 --> 02:03:40,476
I know, again, we're in the middle of a week worth of storms, but people seem to be frustrated.

1606
02:03:41,176 --> 02:03:49,262
with regards to lack of seeing these vehicles enforcing the permit parking, which some of our areas were really looking forward to.

1607
02:03:49,402 --> 02:03:50,924
Well, that's what we were hoping for.

1608
02:03:50,964 --> 02:03:53,285
The 26th was going to be the day that it was going to begin.

1609
02:03:53,345 --> 02:03:55,247
And that was the day we ended up with the blizzard.

1610
02:03:56,008 --> 02:03:58,009
And we've been under snow cover since.

1611
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:05,075
They did do some enforcement over the weekend between the two storms on permit parking.

1612
02:04:05,095 --> 02:04:06,636
But they didn't cover a lot of ground.

1613
02:04:07,096 --> 02:04:09,798
And I know that there was one particular problem.

1614
02:04:11,221 --> 02:04:21,987
And I'm not sure where it stemmed from, whether it was the information we gave them from the police department regarding a street that that portion of it is permit parking and another portion is not.

1615
02:04:22,807 --> 02:04:33,733
So, uh, we've asked the people who were ticketed in the non permit portion to turn their tickets into us and we will do what needs to be done to avoid them out.

1616
02:04:34,533 --> 02:04:37,795
And on that note, so if somebody sees a car parked,

1617
02:04:38,652 --> 02:04:49,735
in front of their home that it does not have a permit, it's been, you know, Saturday, it's on a Saturday or Sunday, and the office is not open, is there somebody that they can reach out to?

1618
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:59,258
Because if they can call the police department on Saturday at least, and we can make contact with Republic to go to that location.

1619
02:04:59,739 --> 02:05:07,321
The thing that we, that all our residents have to keep in mind and all the enforcement people have to keep in mind is the fact that during a declared snow emergency,

1620
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:10,651
We do not do permit parking enforcement.

1621
02:05:11,591 --> 02:05:19,093
We, we have to wait for 24 hours after the emergency is lifted before we actually can do permit parking enforcement.

1622
02:05:20,474 --> 02:05:29,797
You know, I hate being, I hate saying that the police can't do permit parking, but we are in a problem right now where we don't have physical stickers on the vehicles.

1623
02:05:30,337 --> 02:05:34,098
It makes it very difficult for the police to do the permit parking enforcement.

1624
02:05:34,458 --> 02:05:47,467
until we get the license plate readers or we can tie into the database that Republic has that we'll be able to tell if we go down Cherry Street, say, and be able to tell what vehicle is permitted and what vehicle isn't.

1625
02:05:48,268 --> 02:06:01,137
So I'm just asking that they be a little patient with the police response for permit parking until we can get the technology working and we're able to spot the violators as easily as Republic would.

1626
02:06:02,533 --> 02:06:15,300
So going forward, once the snow's cleared and we're into spring, your officers will know that if they get a call on a Saturday, they'll know how to contact Republic to resolve some of these issues for the residents.

1627
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:25,905
We're even talking about radio communications for them, so that's something that can just be broadcast out, so that we can reach them that easily to give them a radio and send them to a certain street.

1628
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:27,566
Thank you.

1629
02:06:28,387 --> 02:06:31,048
Thank you, Council Vice President Lago-Kern.

1630
02:06:31,873 --> 02:06:33,234
Next in line is Councilor Knight.

1631
02:06:33,994 --> 02:06:36,575
Actually, I think you put that on an error, Mr. President.

1632
02:06:37,356 --> 02:06:37,856
You're all set.

1633
02:06:38,936 --> 02:06:39,677
Councilor Marks.

1634
02:06:40,757 --> 02:06:41,637
Thank you, Mr. President.

1635
02:06:42,018 --> 02:06:43,198
I just have a question, chief.

1636
02:06:44,519 --> 02:06:58,845
This council has asked on several occasions that we increase the free parking and we've offered suggestions the first 15 minutes free citywide up to 30 minutes free citywide.

1637
02:06:59,591 --> 02:07:14,580
And the response back we got from the administration was, as a result of meetings with the business community, they provided two free 30-minute spots and also four single-head meters in each of the business districts.

1638
02:07:15,341 --> 02:07:21,344
So the free spots would amount to 10 free spots citywide.

1639
02:07:22,445 --> 02:07:25,126
So each of the five business districts would have two free spots.

1640
02:07:27,532 --> 02:07:34,515
I agree with the, uh, limited hours of operation, changing it from seven to seven, uh, from seven to seven to eight to six.

1641
02:07:35,275 --> 02:07:38,116
And that falls under your purview as a traffic commission.

1642
02:07:38,596 --> 02:07:44,518
I would also say, uh, 30 minute free parking would also fall under the traffic commissions purview.

1643
02:07:45,238 --> 02:07:46,479
Uh, would you agree with that chief?

1644
02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:51,280
Uh, that I have to look at, I have to speak with the city solicitor on that.

1645
02:07:52,141 --> 02:07:53,001
I know that there were,

1646
02:07:53,939 --> 02:08:00,764
certain locations throughout the city and the different business districts that it was already agreed upon that 30 minute free parking would be provided.

1647
02:08:02,085 --> 02:08:02,285
Right.

1648
02:08:02,305 --> 02:08:12,453
But if under, from what I hear, uh, as a rule of thumb, if we don't change the number of meted spots, we fall within the guidelines of the contract.

1649
02:08:12,873 --> 02:08:19,958
This is from what I understand by, uh, adding a 30 minute free parking for the first 30 minutes.

1650
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:22,360
We're not changing the number of meted spots.

1651
02:08:22,964 --> 02:08:29,967
And in my opinion, I'm not a legal counsel, but I would say that that would fall under the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commission.

1652
02:08:30,708 --> 02:08:35,330
And from what I hear from business owners, we had Jimmy from West Medford come up.

1653
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:42,833
We've heard from a number of business owners, a number of residents that want to run into the store for two minutes and pick up a newspaper or something.

1654
02:08:43,874 --> 02:08:47,376
This would solve a lot of issues, Chief, a lot, a lot of issues.

1655
02:08:48,036 --> 02:08:52,478
And if it falls under your purview, I think it goes hand in hand with

1656
02:08:53,365 --> 02:08:55,987
the limiting of the hours of operation also.

1657
02:08:57,288 --> 02:08:59,389
And I think this is a necessity, Chief.

1658
02:09:00,089 --> 02:09:13,157
Well, I think, again, it's something I defer to the city solicitor for a ruling on it, because I'm not that familiar with the contract and the contract language between the city and Republic.

1659
02:09:13,598 --> 02:09:16,519
So I want to make sure whatever we do, we're doing legally.

1660
02:09:18,401 --> 02:09:20,962
We waited to get the ruling for the 8 to 6.

1661
02:09:23,735 --> 02:09:30,280
I think at this point we could wait to see if there's a ruling that could allow either a 15 minute free or a 30 minute free.

1662
02:09:30,921 --> 02:09:33,903
We just talked about that's 12 hours of enforcement we're cutting back.

1663
02:09:34,624 --> 02:09:44,472
If you multiply that out as far as the free 30 minutes in every spot in the city, that would be substantially larger than the 12 hours of non-enforcement.

1664
02:09:45,172 --> 02:09:48,475
So I don't want to totally just trash the contract.

1665
02:09:50,878 --> 02:09:55,339
Well, I don't know at what point are we in violation of the contract if we make changes.

1666
02:09:55,839 --> 02:09:56,820
I really don't understand.

1667
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:59,400
I don't think anyone behind this reeling totally understands.

1668
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:11,264
Well, I think it gets back to the substantial and material changes and that probably would fall within substantial material change because then everyone could go to any place in the city and they'll still have the free parking for the first 30 minutes.

1669
02:10:11,324 --> 02:10:15,205
And you know, a lot of the activity that's conducted in many of the businesses,

1670
02:10:15,997 --> 02:10:18,298
probably falls within that guideline, the 30-minute rule.

1671
02:10:18,338 --> 02:10:18,558
Right.

1672
02:10:18,618 --> 02:10:23,179
But as you know, the whole reason that we implemented this was to move cars along.

1673
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:28,421
And providing a 15 or 30-minute grace period accomplishes such that.

1674
02:10:28,461 --> 02:10:29,921
It still moves cars along.

1675
02:10:30,542 --> 02:10:36,484
So I don't see that we'd be going back from what our mission was to move cars along in the business district.

1676
02:10:36,944 --> 02:10:44,126
And if you're able to take two hours a day off of their enforcement, that's revenue that they could be generating, yet minusing two hours

1677
02:10:44,445 --> 02:10:47,246
I don't see why 30 minutes would be any different.

1678
02:10:48,126 --> 02:10:49,566
I'm looking at that 7 a.m.

1679
02:10:50,006 --> 02:10:52,887
I think that was a zero hour anyway.

1680
02:10:52,907 --> 02:10:53,847
7 to 8 a.m.

1681
02:10:53,907 --> 02:10:55,828
I don't think was going to amount to much of anything.

1682
02:10:56,908 --> 02:10:58,028
We don't have any statistics.

1683
02:10:58,048 --> 02:10:58,828
We have no data yet.

1684
02:10:58,848 --> 02:11:04,330
But I'm just saying if you drive through this any of the business districts at 7 in the morning you see limited packing anyway.

1685
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,971
So it wasn't a heavy hit on that and it was a bigger hit probably from 6 p.m.

1686
02:11:09,011 --> 02:11:09,751
to 7 p.m.

1687
02:11:09,791 --> 02:11:12,592
But even that probably wasn't as great.

1688
02:11:12,632 --> 02:11:14,272
But if you talk the rest of the day.

1689
02:11:14,959 --> 02:11:18,482
a free 30 minutes in every space, uh, that could be substantial.

1690
02:11:20,023 --> 02:11:24,987
I think that's a sad commentary when you can say from seven to eight, there's no cars there anyways.

1691
02:11:26,027 --> 02:11:26,888
Well, it's limited.

1692
02:11:26,928 --> 02:11:29,050
I mean, it's limited because it's unfortunate.

1693
02:11:29,070 --> 02:11:32,052
It's limited because there's no magnets.

1694
02:11:32,292 --> 02:11:42,760
Mr. President, I would ask then if we have to do this piecemeal, um, that, uh, we asked the city solicitor by a vote of this council, whether or not, uh, we could implement,

1695
02:11:43,177 --> 02:11:50,803
either 15 or 30-minute free parking citywide, and if that's under the purview of the Traffic Commission.

1696
02:11:51,343 --> 02:12:00,710
And once we get that response back, because the response we received back from the administration, it says no additional changes will be made at this time.

1697
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:04,213
That would lead me to believe that changes could be made.

1698
02:12:05,173 --> 02:12:07,635
That would lead me to believe that changes could be made.

1699
02:12:08,336 --> 02:12:10,717
And so I think maybe it's appropriate that

1700
02:12:11,935 --> 02:12:14,076
we get a legal opinion from the city solicitor.

1701
02:12:14,556 --> 02:12:38,522
So on the motion of Councillor Knight regarding the comparison from the tax collector with regards to revenue of meal tax from this time last year and this time now where we're under the new plan amended by Councillor Marks that the city solicitor render opinion to the council regarding 15

1702
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:50,977
or 30 minute free parking citywide that is, whether that falls under the purview of the traffic commission or if it's a contractual agreement that needs to be done.

1703
02:12:51,557 --> 02:12:52,578
And the clerk has that.

1704
02:12:56,580 --> 02:13:04,285
And, uh, I'll subsequently or previously amended by counselor coffee yellow for the asking for the cost of white screens.

1705
02:13:04,766 --> 02:13:06,086
Counselor Marks, are you all set now?

1706
02:13:06,246 --> 02:13:06,487
I am.

1707
02:13:06,527 --> 02:13:06,847
Thank you.

1708
02:13:06,967 --> 02:13:07,767
Thank you very much.

1709
02:13:07,848 --> 02:13:08,488
Counsel Marks.

1710
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:11,142
Next in queue is Councilor Camuso.

1711
02:13:11,562 --> 02:13:12,703
Thank you, Mr. President.

1712
02:13:12,863 --> 02:13:22,571
And before we go any further, I think we have to urge the mayor that from now on, on Tuesday nights, at least until April, to turn the heat on in this building.

1713
02:13:23,552 --> 02:13:29,096
Because I was afraid that it was because I'm under the weather, but I've talked to several people in here.

1714
02:13:30,077 --> 02:13:31,858
It's absolutely freezing in here right now.

1715
02:13:31,918 --> 02:13:34,280
Councilor Lungo-Kern tells me it's 63 degrees in here.

1716
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:38,584
So next week, we're going to have to bring our scarves and our winter hat to do the people's business.

1717
02:13:39,372 --> 02:13:59,104
But with that being said, two things that I'd be interested to get an update on the current situation is one, a usage report they gave us a few weeks ago, which was good data, told us people seem to be participating within the confines of the laws and restrictions that are put in place by the Traffic Commission.

1718
02:13:59,865 --> 02:14:02,847
And the second thing is I'd like to get an update, Chief, on the tokens.

1719
02:14:04,228 --> 02:14:07,910
Jimmy's Pizza here, great in the community, as he says.

1720
02:14:08,377 --> 02:14:11,660
People come in, they have to wait because he has a line out the door because he's given a good product.

1721
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:12,801
And people go there.

1722
02:14:15,022 --> 02:14:16,864
Look at all the names on the petitions he gives us.

1723
02:14:17,384 --> 02:14:19,706
Every single one of those people have been in there buying a sandwich.

1724
02:14:20,647 --> 02:14:22,649
So keep up the good work, Jim.

1725
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:34,518
With that being said, though, I would like to have the tokens in place where Jimmy, as a businessman, could purchase the tokens instead of a quarter, $0.15 maybe for the tokens.

1726
02:14:35,079 --> 02:14:35,960
And these businesses.

1727
02:14:37,264 --> 02:14:38,444
Um, I know you're working on it.

1728
02:14:38,484 --> 02:14:39,244
Yeah.

1729
02:14:39,284 --> 02:14:39,905
Didn't say that.

1730
02:14:39,945 --> 02:14:41,485
I think it was like 16 and a half cents.

1731
02:14:42,585 --> 02:14:45,366
Um, and they would, they would color and they would code the color.

1732
02:14:45,406 --> 02:14:52,287
So, uh, you'd know that tokens given on West Metro was staying in West Metro or would they be, they'd be used in other parts of the city.

1733
02:14:52,647 --> 02:14:53,067
Exactly.

1734
02:14:53,087 --> 02:14:55,428
But they said that that's a, they do that in other cities.

1735
02:14:56,908 --> 02:14:58,428
And it was a very doable plan.

1736
02:14:58,788 --> 02:14:59,148
Excellent.

1737
02:14:59,248 --> 02:15:02,189
And with that being said, um, that was my next question was,

1738
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:05,111
if and when this will be instituted.

1739
02:15:05,471 --> 02:15:07,992
Because Jimmy right now, it would be a good tool for him.

1740
02:15:08,172 --> 02:15:13,113
Like he said, it's embarrassing to say to someone, I'll give you a quarter so you can go pay the meter.

1741
02:15:13,553 --> 02:15:14,073
But you know what?

1742
02:15:14,313 --> 02:15:18,875
When the guy does come into Jimmy's shop or any other shop in the community and they say, hey, you're a good customer.

1743
02:15:19,315 --> 02:15:20,895
Next time you come in here, the pocket's on me.

1744
02:15:21,296 --> 02:15:22,816
And you give them one of these tokens.

1745
02:15:24,296 --> 02:15:25,557
I mean, that goes far.

1746
02:15:27,017 --> 02:15:32,739
Many businesses in this community I know are very, very much for that, whether it's a local barbershop, whether it's some of our bigger restaurants.

1747
02:15:33,508 --> 02:15:45,991
Um, it's, it's just a, it's a good tool to, um, again, I don't know if we were told, but these machines are able to print out coupons for all these businesses.

1748
02:15:46,011 --> 02:15:52,833
So Jimmy wants to say, Hey, you know, um, you know, get a free soda with every pizza, push the button here.

1749
02:15:52,873 --> 02:16:00,614
When you, when people put in their 25 cents, you don't print out a coupon, uh, for whatever, whatever the, what the business wants to say.

1750
02:16:00,655 --> 02:16:02,615
And it keeps it specific for that area.

1751
02:16:03,723 --> 02:16:06,384
During the presentations, we heard that, that that could be done.

1752
02:16:06,484 --> 02:16:08,205
But that didn't come out during?

1753
02:16:08,606 --> 02:16:11,167
But I can tell you also that there's interest in the tokens.

1754
02:16:11,187 --> 02:16:14,969
There's interest in that debit card type.

1755
02:16:16,129 --> 02:16:20,572
And they're looking into whether they can embed the license plate number in there, so it makes it even easier.

1756
02:16:21,612 --> 02:16:25,434
So there is interest in that, and Republic is researching all of it.

1757
02:16:25,714 --> 02:16:29,997
Some of these machines have been acting up to, to the point where it's been very customer friendly.

1758
02:16:30,017 --> 02:16:32,078
You throw in a quarter, and you get two quarters back.

1759
02:16:32,997 --> 02:16:34,438
It, uh, it happened to me today.

1760
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:36,859
And, uh, I know you put it right back though.

1761
02:16:37,159 --> 02:16:37,980
Yes, of course I did.

1762
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,001
I put the quarter right back in.

1763
02:16:40,021 --> 02:16:44,863
I drove to the, I drove to the office in South Medfit and I gave it to them.

1764
02:16:45,624 --> 02:16:53,628
Um, no, but, uh, um, I've been hearing that too, that some of them have been actually spitting quarters back out to the consumer.

1765
02:16:54,308 --> 02:17:01,752
Somebody, um, somebody sent me an email joke and said, yeah, it's, it's probably wind casino that owns the, owns the things they're trying to get people in their casino.

1766
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:11,746
But with that being said, I'd just like to get an update on the tokens, because as Councilor Caviello, we're all aware that they are coming, and they said it can be done.

1767
02:17:11,806 --> 02:17:15,749
But deciding to do it and putting it into effect are two different things.

1768
02:17:15,809 --> 02:17:21,273
And quite honestly, I think right now, this is a slow time of year anyway for all the businesses, especially restaurants.

1769
02:17:21,673 --> 02:17:26,136
Right after Christmas, January, February, March, every restaurant I've talked to said this is typically their slow season.

1770
02:17:27,037 --> 02:17:29,499
I think these would come in more handy now than in

1771
02:17:30,694 --> 02:17:35,401
the end of the year, next year, November, when it's traditional busy time of year, Christmas season.

1772
02:17:35,942 --> 02:17:45,776
So if we could just get an update on those two, the usage report, and when I say usage report, the same data that you provided us a few weeks ago with the amount of people that use the machine as well as the

1773
02:17:46,613 --> 02:17:47,934
tickets that were issued.

1774
02:17:47,954 --> 02:17:49,815
And last but not least on the tokens.

1775
02:17:49,835 --> 02:17:50,355
Okay.

1776
02:17:50,615 --> 02:17:51,035
Thanks chief.

1777
02:17:51,416 --> 02:17:51,816
Thank you.

1778
02:17:51,836 --> 02:18:01,881
So on the motion of a counselor, Adam Knight amended by counselor Richard Caraviello, counselor Michael marks, counselor Paul Camuso, counselor Penta chief.

1779
02:18:02,061 --> 02:18:11,206
Um, on the last two matters here, uh, you're working on having a debit card allegedly that could correlate to the, uh, to the car, but they're unable to do that.

1780
02:18:11,687 --> 02:18:14,108
And then the last one detailed maps to be developed to show,

1781
02:18:14,787 --> 02:18:19,109
Spots are available by type of spot in a residential or in a commuter business district.

1782
02:18:19,729 --> 02:18:24,191
Now, I got a couple of phone calls from people up on Quincy Street at resident parking.

1783
02:18:24,371 --> 02:18:27,732
Well, that's the street I was just mentioning when they did some permit parking.

1784
02:18:28,373 --> 02:18:30,874
From Boston Avenue to Capon Street is permit parking.

1785
02:18:31,114 --> 02:18:34,455
From Osgoode Street to the Sum of the Line is permit parking.

1786
02:18:34,675 --> 02:18:36,596
But from Osgoode to Capon is not.

1787
02:18:37,896 --> 02:18:40,077
And I know that it's on our documents.

1788
02:18:40,117 --> 02:18:40,717
I checked that.

1789
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:44,741
But I'm not saying that they were at fault.

1790
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:47,102
But those tickets were issued improperly.

1791
02:18:47,523 --> 02:18:54,627
And the one person that I've had an email from, I asked that she forward it to me because it was truly given in error.

1792
02:18:55,047 --> 02:18:57,589
And we'll go through the process to void those up.

1793
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:01,992
So the three from that neighborhood all have the same issue then?

1794
02:19:02,432 --> 02:19:04,273
Just appeal it to you?

1795
02:19:04,673 --> 02:19:05,634
Just send it in.

1796
02:19:05,674 --> 02:19:07,275
They don't have to go through an appeal process.

1797
02:19:07,295 --> 02:19:10,677
That was the concern, whether they were going to have to go through a convoluted process.

1798
02:19:11,353 --> 02:19:12,434
They were issued wrongfully.

1799
02:19:12,474 --> 02:19:13,615
There's no getting around that.

1800
02:19:13,735 --> 02:19:17,317
The records reflect that that section of the street is not permit parking.

1801
02:19:18,198 --> 02:19:19,559
All they have to do is send them in to us.

1802
02:19:19,579 --> 02:19:21,640
We'll void them out the proper way.

1803
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:23,361
So it's recorded as a void.

1804
02:19:23,921 --> 02:19:28,625
But it also says that detailed maps are finalized and posted on Park Medford.

1805
02:19:28,805 --> 02:19:34,208
This would be the maps for the business districts, where the meters are, where the single head meters were.

1806
02:19:34,569 --> 02:19:39,152
Well, the single head meters aren't out there yet, but it's on parkmedford.org.

1807
02:19:40,037 --> 02:19:42,179
So resident parking maps are not on there yet?

1808
02:19:42,399 --> 02:19:45,842
No, but they're on the police department website.

1809
02:19:45,882 --> 02:19:54,589
There is a list of permit parking streets, but there may be some streets that need to be added to it since, uh, since it was first posted.

1810
02:19:54,749 --> 02:20:06,138
There may be some new streets, some additions, and we're going through the entire list of permit parking streets now to see what the various restrictions are because some streets are permit parking from seven to noon.

1811
02:20:06,598 --> 02:20:08,620
Some streets are from 5pm to 8am.

1812
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:12,202
We want to make sure whatever we put out there is accurate information.

1813
02:20:12,822 --> 02:20:16,344
But when you're doing these resident parking documents, maps or whatever they are.

1814
02:20:16,444 --> 02:20:17,084
They're not maps.

1815
02:20:17,144 --> 02:20:19,786
The resident parking is strictly a list of streets.

1816
02:20:20,286 --> 02:20:20,566
Streets.

1817
02:20:20,746 --> 02:20:21,407
There's not a map.

1818
02:20:21,427 --> 02:20:23,728
But some of the streets aren't all resident parking.

1819
02:20:23,788 --> 02:20:25,469
No, no, just the streets that are.

1820
02:20:25,709 --> 02:20:32,213
So like you explained last week, um, Austin street, the number, it stops at a certain number.

1821
02:20:32,273 --> 02:20:32,473
I mean,

1822
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:34,001
How are these people supposed to know?

1823
02:20:34,021 --> 02:20:34,981
The resident knows.

1824
02:20:35,081 --> 02:20:36,982
I mean, if a resident lives on the street, they haven't seen it.

1825
02:20:37,002 --> 02:20:38,543
Yeah, but how does Republic know?

1826
02:20:38,663 --> 02:20:41,484
They'll know because they have the list.

1827
02:20:41,664 --> 02:20:44,986
There was an error made, I believe it was Saturday.

1828
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:51,970
It was either Friday or Saturday that that portion of Quincy Street was tagged improperly.

1829
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:57,252
Our records reflect that that portion of Quincy Street is not permit parking.

1830
02:20:58,373 --> 02:21:02,635
I don't know what they were operating on, whether they got a document that just said Quincy Street.

1831
02:21:05,172 --> 02:21:09,475
But there's no doubt that they were issued in error, and they'll be voided appropriately.

1832
02:21:10,455 --> 02:21:11,676
Point of information, Counsel.

1833
02:21:11,876 --> 02:21:12,277
Good night.

1834
02:21:12,657 --> 02:21:19,341
It's my understanding, Chief, that when a ticket is issued, it's recorded in the latitude and longitude of the vehicle is recorded, correct?

1835
02:21:20,142 --> 02:21:20,962
On their plate reader, yes.

1836
02:21:20,982 --> 02:21:21,783
On their plate reader, right.

1837
02:21:21,803 --> 02:21:34,511
So it would be safe to say that if, in fact, a citation is issued that's outside the realm of a permit parking street, that they'd be able to pull that information right up on their system and show where the vehicle was parked and whether or not it was within

1838
02:21:35,745 --> 02:21:42,108
All's good in Capen or Austin between Prescott and high, but not Austin between high and Uber.

1839
02:21:42,548 --> 02:21:42,708
Right.

1840
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,029
Thank you.

1841
02:21:44,049 --> 02:21:47,450
They just need to have the actual information.

1842
02:21:47,470 --> 02:21:51,292
If you don't have good information, you're not going to put out good stuff.

1843
02:21:53,172 --> 02:21:53,693
One final thing.

1844
02:21:55,273 --> 02:21:56,994
I'd like to, can we get a report back?

1845
02:21:57,174 --> 02:22:03,917
You said the, um, the decision today by the city solicitor that you could change the hours.

1846
02:22:04,362 --> 02:22:04,562
Yes.

1847
02:22:05,523 --> 02:22:09,046
Within the realm of- Is that a written document or was that verbal?

1848
02:22:09,066 --> 02:22:10,027
There is a written document.

1849
02:22:10,767 --> 02:22:11,388
I didn't get it.

1850
02:22:11,448 --> 02:22:17,773
I didn't meet the city solicitor in time, but he verbally told me and it is in writing.

1851
02:22:18,314 --> 02:22:20,175
So we'll have it.

1852
02:22:21,356 --> 02:22:21,777
Could you get it?

1853
02:22:22,297 --> 02:22:23,058
Could we get a copy of it?

1854
02:22:23,458 --> 02:22:24,058
I'm sure you will.

1855
02:22:24,219 --> 02:22:26,160
I'd like to have a copy of that, Mr. Clerk.

1856
02:22:26,741 --> 02:22:27,161
A copy of-

1857
02:22:43,132 --> 02:22:56,180
And we will give you the minutes of the Traffic Commission meeting this Tuesday, February 10th, so that you'll have that as well.

1858
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:57,381
As you always do.

1859
02:22:58,862 --> 02:22:59,942
Tuesday, February 10th.

1860
02:23:01,463 --> 02:23:02,344
No more Wednesday meetings?

1861
02:23:02,909 --> 02:23:05,511
No, we only do Tuesday for traffic commission.

1862
02:23:05,951 --> 02:23:16,319
The Wednesday night meetings, tentatively one that's still on for tomorrow night, we may have to cancel due to the snow mounds and it may not be a safe thing to bring people out to.

1863
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,122
And we may need a bigger farm to do it in.

1864
02:23:19,162 --> 02:23:22,804
So we may be looking to use the council chamber at some point.

1865
02:23:25,587 --> 02:23:26,007
Yes, it is.

1866
02:23:26,027 --> 02:23:32,192
Yale Street Corner and Harvard Street Corner at two o'clock.

1867
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:35,880
Thank you all.

1868
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:49,883
Uh, so on the motion of council and night amended by counselors, uh, uh, Marks, Carviello, uh, Penta and Camuso, uh, council marks.

1869
02:23:50,403 --> 02:23:50,683
Yeah.

1870
02:23:50,743 --> 02:23:52,104
I just got one last thing.

1871
02:23:52,464 --> 02:23:57,745
A gentleman called me, a gentleman called me up chief on this brochure that was passed out.

1872
02:23:58,905 --> 02:24:02,746
And he mentioned that when he tried to feed the machine,

1873
02:24:03,561 --> 02:24:07,623
He said he believes the steps are backwards, Step 4 and 5.

1874
02:24:08,424 --> 02:24:15,627
So he said he went, he put in his license plate number, and then Step 4 says, press the blue button to buy time.

1875
02:24:17,168 --> 02:24:24,492
He's saying that you're supposed to press the green button, then put the money in, and then press the blue button.

1876
02:24:27,554 --> 02:24:30,435
He said these steps aren't right.

1877
02:24:30,455 --> 02:24:32,997
I'd have to look at it again.

1878
02:24:34,311 --> 02:24:36,272
Can you take a look at that, Chief?

1879
02:24:36,912 --> 02:24:40,773
We'll refer that to the Commissioner of Republic Parking.

1880
02:24:40,813 --> 02:24:41,734
Complete transaction.

1881
02:24:42,794 --> 02:24:44,675
Can you take a peek at that, Chief?

1882
02:24:46,836 --> 02:24:50,577
Point of clarification, Councillor Longo-Kern, and then we're going to take a vote on this.

1883
02:24:51,317 --> 02:24:53,258
Was it a certain machine, Councillor Marks?

1884
02:24:53,458 --> 02:24:56,359
Was it a certain machine, like a certain location?

1885
02:24:57,039 --> 02:25:00,180
Because when I fed it, I followed the steps and it worked fine.

1886
02:25:02,650 --> 02:25:06,811
No, I followed the steps that are actually written on the kiosk.

1887
02:25:11,632 --> 02:25:13,552
So on the motion, all those in favor?

1888
02:25:14,432 --> 02:25:15,272
All those opposed?

1889
02:25:15,772 --> 02:25:16,672
Motion carries.

1890
02:25:17,212 --> 02:25:26,994
Three papers in the hand of the clerk offered by Councilor Camuso be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank St.

1891
02:25:27,034 --> 02:25:31,755
Raphael's pastor, Father Kevin Toomey, for his outstanding service to the parishioners.

1892
02:25:32,262 --> 02:25:33,183
Councillor Camuso.

1893
02:25:33,283 --> 02:25:38,846
Thank you, Mr. President.

1894
02:25:38,886 --> 02:25:39,787
Thank you, Mr. President.

1895
02:25:39,987 --> 02:25:46,471
For those of the individuals that don't know, Father Kevin Toomey recently got notified of his reassignment.

1896
02:25:46,972 --> 02:25:49,433
And this is a major, major blow to St.

1897
02:25:49,473 --> 02:25:50,254
Raphael's Parish.

1898
02:25:50,794 --> 02:25:50,974
St.

1899
02:25:51,014 --> 02:25:54,116
Raphael's is a great parish community.

1900
02:25:54,196 --> 02:25:58,519
Father Toomey has done an exemplary job down there, as we all know.

1901
02:26:00,020 --> 02:26:00,741
He's been there for

1902
02:26:02,253 --> 02:26:12,910
15 or so years, and he is solely responsible for getting people to pledge support financially to build the new Paris Center, which cost around $6 million, Mr. President.

1903
02:26:13,943 --> 02:26:16,624
And for that, the community and the parish is grateful.

1904
02:26:17,105 --> 02:26:18,305
And we want to wish him well.

1905
02:26:18,385 --> 02:26:19,946
And I think it's more than appropriate.

1906
02:26:20,366 --> 02:26:23,528
He's around until June, until he goes to his new assignment.

1907
02:26:23,888 --> 02:26:26,529
But I think we should get him down here just to acknowledge him.

1908
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:33,033
He was a stalwart supporter of putting up the crossing signs and the lights in front of St.

1909
02:26:33,053 --> 02:26:37,995
Raphael's Parish for the children of the community, and just was always there for people.

1910
02:26:38,495 --> 02:26:41,537
And I'm going to miss him, not only as my parish

1911
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,501
Pastor, but more importantly, as a friend.

1912
02:26:45,101 --> 02:26:50,404
So if we can get him down here at a meeting to receive a congratulation note from the Medford City Council.

1913
02:26:50,624 --> 02:26:52,565
On the motion of Councilor Camuso, all those in favor?

1914
02:26:53,265 --> 02:26:53,645
Opposed?

1915
02:26:54,065 --> 02:26:58,607
I inadvertently cut off two citizens who wish to spoke on the matter that has passed.

1916
02:26:59,828 --> 02:27:00,928
If you wish to address us.

1917
02:27:00,948 --> 02:27:07,931
Will you name and address for the record?

1918
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,752
Robert Cappucci of 70 Green.

1919
02:27:09,772 --> 02:27:11,273
The matter is disposed of, as you know.

1920
02:27:12,695 --> 02:27:14,716
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1921
02:27:14,776 --> 02:27:16,758
Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1922
02:27:18,379 --> 02:27:23,862
I didn't plan on speaking on this tonight, but a couple of points came up that I had to voice my concern about.

1923
02:27:24,722 --> 02:27:39,071
With all due respect to the Chief of Police, who has been exhaustive in his energies on this kiosk program, he referred to concerns that people have and the questions that are coming up as throwing stones

1924
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:56,559
on something that we haven't even seen if it works yet, when on a issue brought up tonight by Councillor Penter, it clearly states, Medford citizenry never had an open public opportunity for input, discussions, concerns of the implementation.

1925
02:27:57,159 --> 02:27:59,080
Is it throwing stones?

1926
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:03,383
And with all due respect, I have great respect for the Chief of Police.

1927
02:28:03,743 --> 02:28:05,304
I just wish he would term it differently.

1928
02:28:05,664 --> 02:28:07,865
Was it throwing stones for Jimmy's pizza?

1929
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:17,813
To come up here and address his concerns, was it throwing stones for the woman who talked about Playstead Road and what she has to do to get a permit?

1930
02:28:18,173 --> 02:28:21,074
Was it throwing stones for the guy who owns the lock company?

1931
02:28:21,374 --> 02:28:26,136
Was it throwing stones for all the other citizens and businesses that have come up here?

1932
02:28:26,536 --> 02:28:36,940
And my second point is on the 30-minute parking amendment, a query posed by the Honourable Michael Marks.

1933
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:38,040
That's never going to happen.

1934
02:28:38,384 --> 02:28:44,169
because that will get rid of all the money these folks are going to be collecting on this.

1935
02:28:44,730 --> 02:28:51,215
I have seen for the last few weeks, going into months now, the great concerns.

1936
02:28:51,636 --> 02:28:56,960
I mean, we're talking about making Medford more business friendly and improving our five business districts.

1937
02:28:57,541 --> 02:29:04,367
Welcome to Medford with higher property tax rates, pay to park, the streets falling apart, an understaffed police force.

1938
02:29:04,487 --> 02:29:05,048
I mean, there are.

1939
02:29:05,802 --> 02:29:19,050
a lot more things this city could be doing and it's ultimately going to depend on the voters this year and to exercise that option in this contract to buy it out and get rid of it, please.

1940
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:22,472
It would be the best thing for the City of Medford.

1941
02:29:22,572 --> 02:29:23,493
Thank you for your time.

1942
02:29:27,122 --> 02:29:28,963
Thank You mr. President, my name is Michael or Jiro.

1943
02:29:28,983 --> 02:29:30,403
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1944
02:29:30,843 --> 02:29:31,724
I have two questions.

1945
02:29:31,984 --> 02:29:44,008
The first is With the license plate information that has been aggregated by Republic parking Is that information being sold to private people as a big data enterprise or what happens to that data?

1946
02:29:44,048 --> 02:29:44,548
Does anyone know?

1947
02:29:45,228 --> 02:29:53,095
Say, sir, we've disposed of this already, so ask your second question, and then the police chief will address you.

1948
02:29:53,175 --> 02:29:53,676
Oh, thank you.

1949
02:29:53,996 --> 02:30:03,225
My second point is I've been volunteering at the senior center, and a number of seniors have expressed confusion over how to input

1950
02:30:03,665 --> 02:30:05,305
you know, their license plate and pay for it.

1951
02:30:05,446 --> 02:30:09,166
Maybe it would be helpful if someone from Republic Parking would go down there and give a lecture.

1952
02:30:10,247 --> 02:30:14,228
Some of these individuals have trouble, you know, putting in emergency contact numbers into their phones.

1953
02:30:14,248 --> 02:30:15,488
They're not particularly tech savvy.

1954
02:30:16,228 --> 02:30:16,368
Thanks.

1955
02:30:16,388 --> 02:30:17,009
Thank you.

1956
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:21,390
The chief will address both those questions as he's the expert on this.

1957
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:30,072
I don't know if I'm the expert, but the second one first, I know that Mr. Nash is planning to do another meet and greet with the

1958
02:30:30,517 --> 02:30:38,460
at the senior center, bringing a kiosk to the location so people can actually touch it, feel it, push the buttons and see how it works.

1959
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:43,502
So I don't know exactly when that's scheduled for, but I know it's sometime soon.

1960
02:30:44,982 --> 02:30:52,165
With regard to the license plate reader, I am informed by Republic Parking that they save the data for eight hours.

1961
02:30:52,825 --> 02:30:54,325
They do not sell it to anyone.

1962
02:30:55,066 --> 02:30:59,187
If the vehicle, if they cite a vehicle, then they save it as a record.

1963
02:31:00,366 --> 02:31:06,389
of the citation of the vehicle, and then it's disposed of after all the appeal process of the ticket is paid for.

1964
02:31:06,929 --> 02:31:12,152
But just going down the street and gathering plates, at the end of the day, it's purged.

1965
02:31:12,192 --> 02:31:13,172
The system is purged.

1966
02:31:13,612 --> 02:31:16,414
But absolutely no information sold to anyone.

1967
02:31:16,634 --> 02:31:17,754
No mailing lists, nothing?

1968
02:31:17,774 --> 02:31:17,954
No.

1969
02:31:18,294 --> 02:31:19,335
Thank you very much, Chief.

1970
02:31:19,675 --> 02:31:22,296
Thank you, sir, for those two helpful questions.

1971
02:31:23,177 --> 02:31:29,820
Additional papers in the hand of the clerk, offered by Counselor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medical City Council

1972
02:31:30,293 --> 02:31:41,542
to congratulate Medford City Council President Emeritus Robert Miyako and his wife Cheryl on the birth of their first grandchild, Willow Skye.

1973
02:31:42,062 --> 02:31:42,923
Councilor Camuso.

1974
02:31:42,943 --> 02:31:43,884
Thank you, Mr. President.

1975
02:31:44,144 --> 02:31:50,589
I would be remiss if I didn't congratulate Uncle Bob, as people often refer to him as.

1976
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:54,913
Him and his wife Cheryl are the proud grandparents of Willow Skye.

1977
02:31:55,914 --> 02:32:03,099
And Willow Skye now has the proud parents, Dr. Marty Marin and beautiful Alexandra Mayako Marin.

1978
02:32:04,099 --> 02:32:05,280
The baby was born.

1979
02:32:06,961 --> 02:32:08,482
And baby and mom are doing great.

1980
02:32:08,522 --> 02:32:10,123
They just came home a few days ago.

1981
02:32:10,723 --> 02:32:12,024
And I just want to congratulate them.

1982
02:32:12,044 --> 02:32:12,785
And Alex looks beautiful.

1983
02:32:13,445 --> 02:32:14,046
Absolutely.

1984
02:32:14,186 --> 02:32:14,306
Yes.

1985
02:32:14,346 --> 02:32:17,928
So congratulations to Mr. President, his wife, and the entire family.

1986
02:32:18,428 --> 02:32:18,829
Thank you.

1987
02:32:19,949 --> 02:32:22,431
Seconded on the motion of Councilor Camuso, seconded by

1988
02:32:23,027 --> 02:32:24,868
Vice President Longo-Curran, all those in favor?

1989
02:32:24,888 --> 02:32:25,628
All those opposed?

1990
02:32:26,328 --> 02:32:31,190
And lastly, in the hand of the clerk, a resolution by Councilor Knight.

1991
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:41,434
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Sal and Josephine Marino and Billy and Paul Oganowski on the birth of their newest grandchild, Penelope.

1992
02:32:42,914 --> 02:32:44,555
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1993
02:32:44,715 --> 02:32:50,697
I'd like to congratulate Tiffany and Salvatore on the birth of their first child, as well as Josephine and Big Sal.

1994
02:32:51,292 --> 02:32:53,774
and Paula and Billy on the birth of their new granddaughter.

1995
02:32:53,794 --> 02:32:58,878
It's a very exciting time for these families and I just wanted to let them know that we're thinking of them during this time.

1996
02:33:00,059 --> 02:33:01,540
Motion of Councilor Knight.

1997
02:33:01,921 --> 02:33:02,842
All those in favor?

1998
02:33:03,902 --> 02:33:04,643
All those opposed?

1999
02:33:04,743 --> 02:33:05,484
Councilor Mox.

2000
02:33:16,593 --> 02:33:17,313
Good evening.

2001
02:33:17,434 --> 02:33:19,175
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

2002
02:33:20,017 --> 02:33:21,278
Thank you, City Council.

2003
02:33:21,718 --> 02:33:44,609
This afternoon at one o'clock, Louise Miller had a meeting on public access TV here, and I believe it's room 205 down the hall, where they have the Human Rights Commission, and a wonderful woman, she has a pamphlet about the public access television operation, request for proposals.

2004
02:33:44,990 --> 02:33:49,652
So I just wanted to alert the public that because of the snow, there was one person and myself there,

2005
02:33:50,623 --> 02:34:02,808
And serendipitously, if that's how you say it, coincidentally, an executive director from one of the exit stations called while I was in the room, so Louise talked to him, and that was really great.

2006
02:34:02,908 --> 02:34:04,248
So the word is getting out.

2007
02:34:04,348 --> 02:34:07,049
She's going to reschedule the meeting tentatively.

2008
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:09,490
It is now Wednesday, February 18th.

2009
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:12,011
It should be up on the Medford Mass website.

2010
02:34:15,635 --> 02:34:25,117
This Monday at the high school, at 2.30 p.m., the architects who are bidding on the public access station will be meeting, and it's open to the public.

2011
02:34:25,497 --> 02:34:29,218
So if people want to see the new facility, Louise told me that anyone could go there.

2012
02:34:29,678 --> 02:34:35,639
Now, this is very important because nine months from today, of course, is the election, 273 days away.

2013
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:42,201
What was a little discouraging was if the access station is granted to someone in April,

2014
02:34:43,622 --> 02:34:48,865
As the other individual in the room said, we might not have it until September, and this election is critical.

2015
02:34:48,945 --> 02:34:59,613
So what I would like our mayor to do is maybe see about opening the airwaves, and we discussed this, so that people can have some kind of access maybe with the high school

2016
02:35:00,295 --> 02:35:01,496
Mr. Dempsey or Ms.

2017
02:35:01,516 --> 02:35:11,501
Goldsberry, because they run the high school channel, maybe they can help get something organized so that we get all you candidates, anyone running, anyone out there that's running.

2018
02:35:12,281 --> 02:35:19,445
I know that the attorney that runs the NAACP, Mystic Valley, I know he's already put on his Facebook that he's running.

2019
02:35:19,785 --> 02:35:25,348
This is an excellent opportunity for he and other people running to let's get the ball rolling right now.

2020
02:35:25,428 --> 02:35:26,088
It can be done.

2021
02:35:27,069 --> 02:35:27,409
Thank you.

2022
02:35:27,709 --> 02:35:28,830
Thank you, Citizen Filioni.

2023
02:35:29,741 --> 02:35:34,624
The records were passed to Vice President Lungel-Kern for the meeting of January 20, 2015.

2024
02:35:37,046 --> 02:35:38,987
Madam Vice President, how did you find those?

2025
02:35:39,307 --> 02:35:41,429
I found the records in order and move approval.

2026
02:35:41,729 --> 02:35:48,473
I also want to announce a fundraiser that the Medford Family Network is having on Saturday at 12 p.m.

2027
02:35:48,513 --> 02:35:49,594
at the McGlynn School.

2028
02:35:49,754 --> 02:35:53,356
It's an ice cream social for all families.

2029
02:35:53,797 --> 02:35:54,977
All families are welcome.

2030
02:35:57,487 --> 02:35:59,628
Yes, I could not eat the ice cream if I thought of.

2031
02:36:00,428 --> 02:36:03,069
But I just want to let everybody know about the fundraiser.

2032
02:36:03,290 --> 02:36:06,611
I think it's $10 a person and goes to a great cause.

2033
02:36:06,831 --> 02:36:07,912
A very great cause.

2034
02:36:07,932 --> 02:36:08,972
Thank you for that.

2035
02:36:09,672 --> 02:36:13,214
On the motion of Vice President Langel-Curran for the approval of the minutes.

2036
02:36:13,274 --> 02:36:14,094
All those in favour?

2037
02:36:14,434 --> 02:36:15,155
All those opposed?

2038
02:36:15,215 --> 02:36:15,855
Councillor Camut.

2039
02:36:16,275 --> 02:36:21,418
Yes, I know we did laugh about it a little earlier regarding the climate control in this building.

2040
02:36:22,078 --> 02:36:27,020
I wouldn't expect any secretary, any public employee in this building or school or any municipal building

2041
02:36:27,363 --> 02:36:33,206
to work in the temperatures that we've worked in the last two, a couple of council meetings.

2042
02:36:33,666 --> 02:36:35,127
This is ridiculous.

2043
02:36:35,187 --> 02:36:41,311
If there's a problem with the system in this room, then the mayor and or his designee can get it taken care of.

2044
02:36:41,371 --> 02:36:46,013
In the summertime, it's stifling in here and it's freezing in here tonight.

2045
02:36:46,113 --> 02:36:47,414
I think no one can argue with that.

2046
02:36:47,434 --> 02:36:50,836
We have people that actually left the meeting because of the temperature in this room.

2047
02:36:51,016 --> 02:36:54,558
It's... And you're ailing, but my feet are numb.

2048
02:36:55,073 --> 02:36:55,734
exactly.

2049
02:36:59,136 --> 02:37:07,180
The last few council meetings, at least it's been 66, 67, and then it will gradually go down by 11 o'clock while we were still here.

2050
02:37:07,601 --> 02:37:09,342
It got down to about 63 tonight.

2051
02:37:09,382 --> 02:37:11,963
We came in, it was 64 and it's gradually going down.

2052
02:37:12,063 --> 02:37:14,425
So, um, I can't feel my toes either.

2053
02:37:14,445 --> 02:37:16,446
I think I can see my breath though, which is nice.

2054
02:37:17,266 --> 02:37:21,469
So if we could move, if we could put it in writing to, I know, uh,

2055
02:37:22,996 --> 02:37:29,321
From the building department, Fargo has been down during council meetings in the past to adjust the heat or the air conditioning.

2056
02:37:30,842 --> 02:37:31,222
I agree.

2057
02:37:31,442 --> 02:37:35,825
If this is happening during the day, it's unacceptable for the people that work in this building.

2058
02:37:36,526 --> 02:37:41,890
And just to follow up, a few weeks ago, Alicia Hunt was in here adjusting the temperature.

2059
02:37:43,391 --> 02:37:45,713
And I believe they had it set to go off at like 9 o'clock.

2060
02:37:46,033 --> 02:37:51,197
I don't remember a city council meeting in the history of the city of Medford for the past 30 years that hasn't

2061
02:37:51,995 --> 02:37:52,995
gone till nine o'clock.

2062
02:37:53,696 --> 02:37:56,456
So, uh, has gone, you know what I'm saying?

2063
02:37:56,877 --> 02:37:58,777
Has gone, um, less than nine o'clock.

2064
02:37:59,938 --> 02:38:03,339
It was about a, uh, six month range where some of the meetings were shorter.

2065
02:38:04,219 --> 02:38:06,480
Um, but that was due just to the smaller agendas.

2066
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:09,761
This is, uh, this is absurd.

2067
02:38:14,942 --> 02:38:18,924
We just received a communique and it will be addressed, uh, first thing in the morning.

2068
02:38:19,004 --> 02:38:19,784
I say we don't, we,

2069
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:22,280
We shouldn't be meeting in this temperature.

2070
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:24,821
If it's again like this, really, we should postpone the meeting.

2071
02:38:26,541 --> 02:38:26,881
Thank you.

2072
02:38:27,182 --> 02:38:29,242
Counselor Pence has been patiently waiting for real quick.

2073
02:38:29,302 --> 02:38:38,804
I'd like to send a, um, the council send some congratulations to, uh, not congratulations, some get well wishes to Rick Caviello, his father, who unfortunately is in the hospital right now.

2074
02:38:38,884 --> 02:38:40,245
And, uh, thank you.

2075
02:38:40,285 --> 02:38:43,666
I want to thank, um, the Western fire department and, uh, I'm sorry.

2076
02:38:43,686 --> 02:38:49,107
I gave you lunch for the quick response to my dad and when he, when he passed out this afternoon and, and what's nothing.

2077
02:38:49,127 --> 02:38:49,587
Okay.

2078
02:38:50,193 --> 02:38:52,795
Best wishes to Mr. Cantrell.

2079
02:38:52,895 --> 02:38:56,258
Councillor Maxx.

2080
02:38:56,478 --> 02:38:57,359
All set, Mr. President.

2081
02:38:57,599 --> 02:38:58,500
Thank you, Councillors.

2082
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:03,424
On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Kern for adjournment.

2083
02:39:03,504 --> 02:39:04,285
All those in favour?

2084
02:39:04,745 --> 02:39:05,526
All those opposed?
