1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:05,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the Saturday Coffee Clutch with Heather Lofthouse and your truly Robert Reich.

2
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:07,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I want to start out, Heather.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,941
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been another grueling week.

4
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:12,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you feel.

5
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:13,904
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?

6
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you how you feel for once?

7
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,247
[SPEAKER_00]: After you tell me how you feel.

8
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:18,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gosh.

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, I'm okay.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than last clutch.

11
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, it was a low day.

12
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's a medium day.

13
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,778
[SPEAKER_02]: My family's coming back from having been traveling.

14
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's nice.

15
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's personal.

16
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,062
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about the personal later.

17
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should talk about the political and the personal.

18
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:34,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

19
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that's me.

20
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:36,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but back to you.

21
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you today?

22
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:38,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm, I'm, I'm okay.

23
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,632
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the other day somebody asked me how I'm doing.

24
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just blurted out shitty.

25
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:51,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that I'm shitty because of the person who's in the White House and the effect.

26
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,301
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost subconscious.

27
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of negative.

28
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:03,107
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, awful, sadistic effect that everybody is feeling.

29
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:05,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, even subconsciously.

30
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:10,291
[SPEAKER_00]: You go about your day, and people are busy, and I'm busy, and a lot of nice things happen.

31
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:14,334
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, you can't get away from it.

32
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, he's infected so much.

33
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's just, it's awful.

34
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:22,170
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are we going to talk about today?

35
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so much to talk about.

36
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:24,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Big economic news.

37
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:27,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want your two cents on this, please.

38
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:32,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the first thing we should, tariffs have been, so he's been threatening Trump.

39
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:34,440
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, hold that.

40
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:43,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I want us to talk about tariffs as import taxes because they are not â€“ nobody knows the word taxes or tariffs.

41
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,829
[SPEAKER_00]: But import taxes, that's what they are.

42
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:51,133
[SPEAKER_00]: They're import taxes and they are paid for by us, by Americans.

43
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tariffs, let's get away.

44
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll do a rebrand.

45
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:55,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, rebrand.

46
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:07,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So these tariff import taxes that Trump has been threatening, and then he moves the date, and then he doesn't move the date, and then he moves the amount, and it's so just handshaking with all these different people.

47
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:15,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so personal, it's like each deal, you know, everybody's waiting, but what's Trump going to decide?

48
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:21,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting to the final hour, the final minute, and the Canadians, what is he going to decide?

49
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not based on rational data analysis, it's what's he going to decide in that moment?

50
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,512
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the point.

51
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:31,396
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a, and this is really a theme that I suggest we talk about today.

52
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's do it.

53
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:44,728
[SPEAKER_00]: The theme is that we, you and I, were brought up in a world of law and a policy that is rational, that people had to justify the laws and the policies on the basis of public interest.

54
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:46,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a master's in public policy.

55
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met you.

56
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years studying how we carefully assess the scenarios, what's happening in the world.

57
00:02:54,396 --> 00:02:55,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather, I apologize.

58
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to apologize to you now.

59
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,777
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I doing with that degree?

60
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:04,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Because public policy and law, I know a lot about public policy and I have a law degree.

61
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irrelevant.

62
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:18,622
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing in a world in which we have one person who's making personal deals and they are at his whim and everybody else is trying to figure out what he's going to do next and why he's going to do it.

63
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are so far away from a world of law.

64
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:23,703
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the rule of law

65
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:29,747
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's sometimes staggering to think about where we used to be.

66
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:36,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Constitution, you know, you sometimes kid me for... Do you have it with you?

67
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have it with me, but I know it by heart.

68
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:45,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Article 1, Section 8 says the tariff customs, all duties originate with Congress.

69
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress has the power to decide on tariffs.

70
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:53,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nope, that's not the case these days.

71
00:03:53,433 --> 00:04:01,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's he has using he conjured up an emergency, a national emergency based on the balance of payments.

72
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And the that feels like ages ago, by the way.

73
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:05,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yes.

74
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:08,258
[SPEAKER_00]: And the national debt balance.

75
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a poster board.

76
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:11,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

77
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so-called emergency.

78
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,781
[SPEAKER_00]: creates his authority to what?

79
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,882
[SPEAKER_00]: To deal with every individual nation and strike a different deal?

80
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:23,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't even know what the deals actually are?

81
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody's publicizing the deals.

82
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:29,124
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all we know, he's pocketing money off these deals.

83
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:37,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe he's pocketing some, I don't know, some future agreement to have a Trump resort in wherever this

84
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:38,588
[SPEAKER_00]: country is.

85
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:45,634
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so far beyond the rule of law that it's hard to even talk about it.

86
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

87
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost feels more like you would see this at a corporation or in the mafia.

88
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Mafia is closer.

89
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,800
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not read democracy.

90
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite of Darwin.

91
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,134
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we fought the Revolutionary War about.

92
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:12,502
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taking on a despot who has his own view from one minute to the next of what he wants.

93
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy at the top, that's, it's the guy at the top.

94
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:18,628
[SPEAKER_02]: We really got to, it matters about the guy at the top and we can't, and mergers and acquisitions.

95
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:27,616
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that in your sub stack, these Wall Street people who are like, you know, I really, as I'm working on things, I really got to take into account the intrusions of the people at the White House.

96
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:32,879
[SPEAKER_00]: All these lawyers are advising their clients, and we're talking about big corporations and the big corporate lawyers.

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:42,426
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, well, let me see about what I can find out about what they want in the White House, whether they're going to approve this particular merger, this particular acquisition.

98
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:47,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia University, I mean, all of that, Harvard University, all the universities.

99
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:57,716
[SPEAKER_00]: all the individual law firms, all the individual media companies, all the, you know, they're all vying for Trump's attention, his good graces.

100
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,918
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to avoid pissing him off.

101
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,759
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we living in now?

102
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:10,425
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is, it's so personal, Heather, that it is, to me, it resembles everything I know about fascism.

103
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,586
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fascism.

104
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:13,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it is.

105
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:19,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And this week, so Canada, our neighbors to the north, have been talking about a lot of things.

106
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:27,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing is they were talking about Palestine and the fact that they would say it was a free state potentially the end of September.

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Trump says, excuse me, what?

108
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me with my tariff card.

109
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about Article 1, Section 8.

110
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:39,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm going to put a 35% tariff on everything coming from Canada.

111
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry I used the word tariff.

112
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:41,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.

113
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Import tax.

114
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,453
[SPEAKER_00]: A 35% import tax on everything coming from Canada.

115
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:49,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the oil.

116
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:49,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the lumber.

117
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:50,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the auto parts.

118
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:51,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all kinds of things.

119
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:57,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is vindictive because, why?

120
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:03,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he doesn't like the Canadians and they haven't been cooperating and because- They're not saluting.

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:12,502
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not saluting and they decided because it's their right to decide whether they recognize a Palestinian state and under what circumstances.

122
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:16,523
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this fascist in Washington decide?

123
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:18,104
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to just do what he wants to do.

124
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:25,148
[SPEAKER_00]: and charge Americans a 35% import tax on Canadian everything coming from Canada.

125
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,909
[SPEAKER_02]: While he's supporting Netanyahu.

126
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:27,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be clear about that.

127
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,191
[SPEAKER_00]: While he is supporting Netanyahu.

128
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:41,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why you can't separate out, you know, one issue like import tax tariffs from other issues like what's happening in Israel right now.

129
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,078
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all

130
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:43,693
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.

131
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,838
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes together around this fascist in the White House.

132
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was some movement on American soil with regard to Gaza this week.

133
00:07:53,984 --> 00:08:03,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it last week on The Clutch, but seeing these kiddos, Americans, I mean, there's been murder that we've seen, but somehow watching starving children.

134
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,041
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

135
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:08,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes people rise up in a way that they hadn't previously.

136
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:27,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's where my age comes in, because I remember so distinctly a turning point in Vietnam, in the public's feeling about why we were in Vietnam, whether we should be in Vietnam, when you saw these photos of these little children kind of fleeing from Napalm.

137
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:29,884
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, naked.

138
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:36,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And the public saw these photographs and said, no, this is wrong.

139
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not going to allow this.

140
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:46,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And the starving children in Gaza, I think it's just changing public opinion, even Jewish public opinion.

141
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:50,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't tell you how many people are now saying to me,

142
00:08:51,678 --> 00:09:00,948
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm Jewish, you're Jewish, we are obviously not anti-Semitic, but we are anti-Netanyahu.

143
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:03,210
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is an authoritarian

144
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:16,701
[SPEAKER_00]: fascist regime doing some of the terrible things that resemble, not the same obviously, but it's that resemble what was done in the 1930s in Germany to the Jews.

145
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

146
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:22,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And Trump and Netanyahu, I mean, they're these two authoritarian leaders.

147
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:22,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And Putin.

148
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:23,848
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three.

149
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say synchronized sinners.

150
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:31,417
[SPEAKER_00]: synchronized centers, synchronized swimmers, but not exactly.

151
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,599
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's not.

152
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good together.

153
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really ugly.

154
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:41,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to the military industrial complex that America loves to support or some Americans.

155
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:44,172
[SPEAKER_02]: make happen.

156
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this week, 27 Dems, right?

157
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:49,334
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Senate.

158
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:58,976
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Senate, voted in support of this resolution by Bernie Sanders, which... To not give any military aid to Israel.

159
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:10,999
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge deal, Heather, because you've got the AIPAC, the, you know, the Israeli lobby that, you know, has spent huge amounts in these campaigns.

160
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:24,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Republicans are in their pockets, and the Democrats have been, but the Democrats are now saying, no, we are not going to allow this, this kind of mass starvation.

161
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:30,917
[SPEAKER_00]: And Netanyahu has already turned Gaza into rubble.

162
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:37,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not going to allow this humanitarian crisis, this indecency.

163
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:45,061
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to members of the Senate, senators who are talking about Netanyahu now as a war criminal.

164
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:46,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is.

165
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it took a long time for us to get here, right, in terms of the language.

166
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,424
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw Angus King wrote that terrific letter

167
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:56,131
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Angus King, he's an independent.

168
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:02,375
[SPEAKER_00]: But like Bernie Sanders, these independents from New England, hey, they are in the lead.

169
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,396
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking the lead.

170
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:09,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish the Democratic Party was as courageous as a whole.

171
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,401
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're getting there.

172
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was that Eisenhower quote?

173
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:13,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

174
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

175
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:15,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.

176
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:16,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.

177
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:19,430
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is this is from 1953.

178
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,412
[SPEAKER_00]: He says every gun.

179
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:23,194
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dwight Eisenhower.

180
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:24,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're right.

181
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

182
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:25,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And 75 years ago.

183
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't have a direct memory.

184
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,938
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's not in my speed dial.

185
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,279
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the most boring speaker.

186
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:43,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you listen to Dwight Eisenhower, I mean, I remember I was a little kid, I would go, oh, do we have to listen to Dwight Eisenhower?

187
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:54,222
[SPEAKER_00]: He would say every, but he's had good things to say, every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired,

188
00:11:54,962 --> 00:12:03,704
[SPEAKER_00]: signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

189
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:11,826
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the military industrial complex was taking away resources that we needed and the world needed.

190
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:22,948
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just the United States, the world needed to avoid the starvation and hunger and I mean all of the worst miseries of mankind.

191
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:29,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and he's saying one gun and we're talking about millions of guns, tens of thousands of assault rifles.

192
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:40,334
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no justification, let's be clear, for sending military aid to Netanyahu and this horrible regime.

193
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:44,796
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not make me anti-Zionist or anti-Semitic when I say that.

194
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's separate these issues.

195
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have, it's been so interesting to watch how long this is taking, right?

196
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:54,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about ceasefires.

197
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:59,108
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been watching the horrendous, horrific happenings for ages now.

198
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:09,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But having the zeitgeist catch up, or the politicians catch up to the zeitgeist, or having all Americans see it in a similar way.

199
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:14,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that's been happening is we have, the tariffs are about to hit, right?

200
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it this week?

201
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:17,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it tomorrow?

202
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:17,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they prepping?

203
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:18,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it yesterday?

204
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:19,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Not tariffs.

205
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Import taxes.

206
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So the import taxes.

207
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:26,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we have to say import tax, the tariff import taxes.

208
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to say, but I think it's important that people see these as taxes.

209
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:30,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

210
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:37,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so these tariffs, these tariff taxes, these import taxes, under the guise of tariffs.

211
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:37,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that better?

212
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:38,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty good.

213
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:43,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're coming in, but when are people going to see the prices affecting them?

214
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to see this.

215
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been new economic data out that we have to talk about this week.

216
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:52,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was a big week for economic data.

217
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:58,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed the consumer price index and other indices.

218
00:13:58,596 --> 00:13:59,276
[SPEAKER_00]: The inflation.

219
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices showed an uptick in inflation.

220
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:08,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump is saying to Jerome Powell and the Fed, you've got to lower interest rates.

221
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:17,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't lower interest rates when you see inflation on the horizon and when you see all of these import taxes being just about applied.

222
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:21,446
[SPEAKER_00]: including 35% and we didn't even talk about 50% on Brazil.

223
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

224
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:23,647
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, coffee clutch?

225
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:24,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello?

226
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, how are we going to drink anything?

227
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be so... But that's another personal, right?

228
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye, coffee.

229
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he doesn't like what they're doing, Bolsonaro judge.

230
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:32,433
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's personal.

231
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:33,394
[SPEAKER_00]: It is personal.

232
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:38,938
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example of personal because Trump doesn't want... Trump hates Lula.

233
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:48,500
[SPEAKER_00]: in Brazil and he's going after Lula because of Lula's efforts to hold accountable Bolsonaro.

234
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:05,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Lula's predecessor in Brazil who did just what Trump did, tried to overturn an election and urged people to go and go after the government officials and attack government office buildings.

235
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,905
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, Trump is using tariff policy

236
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:10,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

237
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Import tax policy.

238
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,268
[SPEAKER_00]: To punish Brazil.

239
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,109
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, this is one man.

240
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,591
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Donald Trump, fascist, one-person rule deciding what he's going to do.

241
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Vindictive and kind of all over the place.

242
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:35,215
[SPEAKER_02]: But Bob, so if his goal isn't economic, it's just power and watch my whims?

243
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It's â€“ yes, I have the power.

244
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:48,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody, whether you are Canada or another country or Columbia University or a law firm or the Smithsonian or whoever you are, I want you to come and beg me.

245
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I love people coming and begging and just making deals with me.

246
00:15:54,924 --> 00:16:00,830
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, if the deal happens to be a little bit of a pay to play, you know, like â€“ I

247
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a giant jumbo jet that's a palace.

248
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:06,334
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even better.

249
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:12,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, and I will punish those of you who aren't coming to beg at my feet.

250
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,198
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the malignant.

251
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:27,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you criticize me, or if you allow people to criticize me, if you are CBS, I might not even allow you, CBS, to sell yourself to be part of a merger

252
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,171
[SPEAKER_00]: your parent company, Paramount, to be sold.

253
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:40,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much vindictiveness and so much control over government that I can basically make your life miserable.

254
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,818
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're Jeff Bezos, you have antitrust.

255
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:46,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use antitrust against you, Jeff Bezos.

256
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:52,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make sure that the Washington Post doesn't say anything critical of me.

257
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:55,704
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's on such a huge scale.

258
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:58,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is global personal.

259
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,127
[SPEAKER_00]: global personal.

260
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:06,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not, again, contrast this with the rule of law, which is predictable

261
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:12,868
[SPEAKER_00]: which is based on some facts and it's based on the public interest.

262
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,488
[SPEAKER_00]: This has nothing to do with any of that.

263
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:21,070
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing about all of this is it creates a fog around Epstein stuff.

264
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.

265
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a fog around the jobs report.

266
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love for you to talk about that too.

267
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:30,732
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't even have to have much of a fog around Epstein because what did they do this week?

268
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:36,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Justice Department, it's again, a personal deal, personal deal.

269
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:36,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

270
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:42,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ghislaine Maxwell has just been moved to a softer, more minimum security situation.

271
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,380
[SPEAKER_00]: A minimum security.

272
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you look at that, why do you suppose, why has she moved to a minimum security prison?

273
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:55,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be that she has some agreement there that she might not implicate Trump?

274
00:17:57,052 --> 00:17:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

275
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:03,617
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the jobs report, can we talk about, so we have, I'm tired of talking about the .0000 percent.

276
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about everyone else for a minute?

277
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,340
[SPEAKER_02]: How is everyone else in this country doing?

278
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:10,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the jobs report was not good.

279
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:14,106
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it was the worst jobs report we've had in some time.

280
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:16,508
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the number of new jobs being created.

281
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:25,975
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regard, this is important, with regard to the jobs report, yesterday's jobs report, 73,000 new jobs, Heather.

282
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Now without context, that's meaningless.

283
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,181
[SPEAKER_00]: The context is that the average new job growth

284
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:34,541
[SPEAKER_00]: is about 200,000.

285
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what you expect.

286
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:42,565
[SPEAKER_00]: If the economy is doing halfway decent, you get 200,000 new jobs because of population growth.

287
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,287
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we had 73,000.

288
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:52,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they very often do this.

289
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,872
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they get more information from previous months.

290
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:59,314
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to, as they have before,

291
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:05,057
[SPEAKER_00]: but they revised downward the actual job growth for May and June.

292
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got 73,000 for July.

293
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,902
[SPEAKER_00]: In May, the job growth actually was revised down to 19,000.

294
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,402
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from 125,000 down to 19,000.

295
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:14,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And for June, from 147,000 down to 14,000.

296
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had, in other words, 238,000 jobs

297
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:31,824
[SPEAKER_00]: 258,000 jobs.

298
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:31,824
238,000, 258,000.

299
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:33,786
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a mathematician.

300
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:34,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I try.

301
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,289
[SPEAKER_00]: You are so good.

302
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was subtracted.

303
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:49,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics, they are so careful to modify when they get additional information.

304
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:54,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, of course, you revise something that comes out on the first of the month for the previous month.

305
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:59,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, imagine in all of our accounting, have you ever found someone that can close a month the first day of the next month?

306
00:19:59,446 --> 00:19:59,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.

307
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,747
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do, they try to be as accurate as they can.

308
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And their accuracy, they are known for their accuracy.

309
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:08,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're politically, they are insulated from politics.

310
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I once made a terrible mistake.

311
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,830
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on an international.

312
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:35,739
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion of jobs and it was in Paris and they called me in my office at the Labor Department when I was Labor Secretary and they said, a translator from French, how many new jobs do you expect the Labor Department is going to show in its monthly labor report tomorrow?

313
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:38,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, I don't know.

314
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, they don't tell me and I cannot know.

315
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:43,557
[SPEAKER_00]: But my guess would be.

316
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave them a guess.

317
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:50,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was translated back into French as I expect.

318
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,763
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went around the world.

319
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

320
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:59,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were so upset with me as if I had seen the figure.

321
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, a sneak peek.

322
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:01,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really are careful.

323
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,901
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the other thing.

324
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:08,144
[SPEAKER_00]: When these revisions came out yesterday, what did Donald Trump do?

325
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:10,986
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in line with our theme about personal.

326
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:11,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.

327
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is personal.

328
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:13,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal and loud.

329
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Vindictive, angry.

330
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And taking over.

331
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says that the commissioner of labor statistics

332
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:32,264
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman who is very, very careful, very diligent, who has been absolutely, there's no reason to think anything other than professional.

333
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,046
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that she should be fired.

334
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:37,048
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on True Social immediately.

335
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:41,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is Trump's response to bad news.

336
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

337
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to news that makes him look bad.

338
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,775
[SPEAKER_00]: news that makes him look bad.

339
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:48,476
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

340
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:51,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just he goes after the messenger.

341
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, always do that.

342
00:21:53,699 --> 00:22:05,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you do that repeatedly, what you're doing is reducing the public's trust and faith in institutions of government like the Bureau of Labor Statistics that you need

343
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:08,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have so much faith in those numbers.

344
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:09,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the same thing with the Fed.

345
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's going after the Fed.

346
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,213
[SPEAKER_00]: He just goes after the Fed because he doesn't like what the Fed is doing.

347
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:17,794
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just undermines the credibility.

348
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,916
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his M.O.

349
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:21,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it.

350
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,938
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's get back to some other things.

351
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:32,246
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, you've got the financial economy getting more and more frothy, more and more risky.

352
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw you say frothy in your sub stack.

353
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:43,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Frothy, it's just, it's not, when I use the term frothy, what I mean about the financial markets is that it's bubbly.

354
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,832
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

355
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:45,952
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the real economy.

356
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:48,233
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just speculating.

357
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:50,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more and more big money speculating.

358
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:51,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at,

359
00:22:52,875 --> 00:23:05,300
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know now about Microsoft or Meta, they are putting huge amounts of money, gambling billions and billions and billions on artificial intelligence.

360
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that good?

361
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:07,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that bad?

362
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if everybody is betting on artificial intelligence.

363
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:21,537
[SPEAKER_00]: and those huge bets turn out not to be particularly good, or if somebody else, like China, exceeds us, well, what then?

364
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:29,041
[SPEAKER_00]: You've bet the entire house on something.

365
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,923
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the junk bonds are coming back.

366
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember them?

367
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:37,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are high-risk loans, they charge

368
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:43,729
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge amount of money, if you're not getting a big return on those junk bonds, what then?

369
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:45,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might not be able to pay them back.

370
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:46,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's crypto, of course.

371
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Crypto.

372
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have this new, you know, the comptroller.

373
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:52,151
[SPEAKER_00]: The comptroller of the currency.

374
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:52,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Controller.

375
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Controller, I know, but there's an M, I mean, come on.

376
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:56,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Controller of the currency.

377
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I mean, it's a different word than controller.

378
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on how you say it.

379
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:01,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Comptroller.

380
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:07,917
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times in a normal conversation do you talk about the comptroller of the currency?

381
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:08,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially this one.

382
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:09,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to not go there.

383
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's, you know, another Trump.

384
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:31,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another Trump appointee, a buddy, who now has authority under the so-called Genius Act, just passed by Republicans in Congress, to regularize, I mean, what we all know what he's doing is basically going to take the hands off crypto.

385
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:38,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And stablecoin in particular, which Trump has a huge stablecoin company, Endeavor.

386
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,502
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, go back to our theme.

387
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:42,122
[SPEAKER_00]: This is personal.

388
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:43,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all personal.

389
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:44,044
[SPEAKER_02]: personal.

390
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,811
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all Trump.

391
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:48,914
[SPEAKER_02]: What benefits him?

392
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:49,715
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes him mad?

393
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,318
[SPEAKER_00]: His family is raking it in on crypto.

394
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so focused on him.

395
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,421
[SPEAKER_02]: This is malignant narcissism, 101.

396
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,501
[SPEAKER_00]: It's malignant narcissism, and it's corruption.

397
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:06,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look back on this era, assuming historians in the future can write the truth.

398
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,803
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be able to, Bob.

399
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:09,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.

400
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:10,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

401
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

402
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:11,723
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to.

403
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:12,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK.

404
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:13,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Promise me?

405
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:16,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to promise anything, because I can't guarantee anything.

406
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:21,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that they are going to look back on this period in time and just say, well,

407
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:23,067
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was this?

408
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:37,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this, you know, that we went through a period where we had policy, public policies and laws and we had restrictions and we had a constitution and now we're having a kind of, you know, the Republican Party, they're all zombies.

409
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And the personal vendettas, right?

410
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:42,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jerome Powell, he's bullying Jerome Powell.

411
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:44,283
[SPEAKER_00]: He's thinking and he's bullying.

412
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,324
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how he does it.

413
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,005
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses another part of government.

414
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:57,510
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, he's saying Jerome Powell approved some renovations at the Fed that are very, very expensive.

415
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about hypocrisy.

416
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:02,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that in a minute.

417
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,955
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jerome Powell kind of did something wrong.

418
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:11,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jerome Powell, sotto voce, what Trump is saying, I'm going to get you.

419
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,179
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do what I want.

420
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,580
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't lower interest rates.

421
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,942
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in trouble because I'm going to embarrass you.

422
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:17,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to humiliate you.

423
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:20,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to create a scandal around you.

424
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that because I know how to do that.

425
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Donald Trump.

426
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:34,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Trump, Powell and the Fed so far are saying, no, we're not going to cut interest rates because prices are inching upward.

427
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,115
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we are going to do now.

428
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:40,058
[SPEAKER_00]: But consider what Trump

429
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:52,764
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing even to the Fed, let's assume for the sake of the argument that he gets a Fed chair in there who plays his game, who does exactly what Trump wants.

430
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump says reduce interest rates, he does it.

431
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:59,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet also assume that you're an investor.

432
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:10,638
[SPEAKER_00]: in the market, or you're a corporate investor or whatever, and are you going to be feeling secure about interest rates and inflation?

433
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:13,639
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're going to say to yourself, the cop on the beat is gone.

434
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:14,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

435
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like this hypothetical game.

436
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,580
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but this is real.

437
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

438
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,841
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is actually happening.

439
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerome Powell has said he's not going anywhere.

440
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:26,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And Trump has kind of flirted with the fact that he could or could not try to fire him.

441
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:33,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Jerome Powell still has some time left in his term, but not forever.

442
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trump is already auditioning other Fed chairs.

443
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:38,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

444
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:44,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data, people are a little worried about there are so few people working around the data that it's problematic.

445
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:48,421
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to have people crunching the numbers, being able to check on the prices of things.

446
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:50,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, over the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

447
00:27:50,402 --> 00:28:07,175
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which I am not enamored with most government agencies, but I'll tell you, when I was labor secretary, that group of people had so much talent.

448
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:14,232
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much integrity, and they still do, but they are being starved, just like most other agencies.

449
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:17,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a problem, because you need data to make financial decisions.

450
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:18,894
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.

451
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:20,154
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely do.

452
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:29,558
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hypocrisy you were referring to a moment ago, Trump is saying Jerome Powell is pouring money into renovations of the Fed building.

453
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:32,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, what is Trump doing at the White House?

454
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:36,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's build a $200 million ballroom.

455
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:39,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's model it off Mar-a-Lago, Louis Quatorze.

456
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:44,260
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be even bigger than the White House in terms of square feet.

457
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:50,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else is one going to let them eat one's cake and toast one's... This is the people's house.

458
00:28:52,846 --> 00:29:01,772
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting away from the people's house when we're trying to create a ballroom that is larger than the White House, that is gilded in gold leaf.

459
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, filigreed.

460
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Filigreed, that's exactly it.

461
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:05,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Filigreed.

462
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Full of greed.

463
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Full of greed.

464
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:07,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Full of greed.

465
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:08,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.

466
00:29:08,637 --> 00:29:09,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

467
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what about when he went to Scotland on our taxpayer dollars?

468
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,511
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there for his golf course.

469
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's become normalized.

470
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:24,253
[SPEAKER_00]: We now think, well, of course he's going to rip us off.

471
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's dangerous thinking itself.

472
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:31,656
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, well, of course he's going to be making side deals for himself.

473
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,157
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dangerous.

474
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:35,838
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't allow that to be normalized.

475
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:38,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what do we do?

476
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:39,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we talk about this?

477
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:41,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, first, yeah, this is perfect.

478
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:41,729
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

479
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, when I think, what do we do?

480
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:45,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ask you, and I think, what do we do?

481
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:48,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try and tell people, I do think about the midterms.

482
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:53,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about elections coming up and the gerrymandering.

483
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked about that.

484
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, we can't finish our cups.

485
00:29:56,582 --> 00:30:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not quite done, neither am I, until we talk about the gerrymandering that's happening, which is also personal, right?

486
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is in Texas this week.

487
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: where Trump basically says, Governor Abbott, I need you to find me five seats.

488
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:11,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I need you to go ahead, remap.

489
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor, this is the president.

490
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need five.

491
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:16,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I want five more Republican seats out of Texas.

492
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:18,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can you?

493
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:28,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is so counter to what we believe in, in this country, in terms of rule of law.

494
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people ask me, should California

495
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:38,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin Newsom, governor, try to counter what Greg Abbott is doing in Texas.

496
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:42,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just Newsom, but a lot of Dems in a lot of states and some more important.

497
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:49,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Should New York and Illinois try to gerrymander more radically?

498
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they gerrymander, we gerrymander.

499
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:53,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye for an eye.

500
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,480
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a subtle question.

501
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,021
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ethical question.

502
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:59,521
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a question about democracy.

503
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:06,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if Democrats and progressives do the same thing, you know, they say, well, we have to fight fire with fire.

504
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:08,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.

505
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:17,912
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also means that we are denigrating and undermining constitutional norms and values the same way they do.

506
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:19,853
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.

507
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I go back and forth, Heather.

508
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,013
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel?

509
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it very difficult.

510
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think of examples that so many people bring up when the Democrats sat on their hands and could have been more aggressive and could have gone up against the traditions and protocols, and it would have been better for democracy.

511
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think of Michelle Obama, when she said, when they go down, we go higher.

512
00:31:47,118 --> 00:32:00,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worry a little bit that that attitude may be making it harder for Democrats to do what they need to do to conquer this fascist.

513
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I mean, I know it depends what models you're looking at.

514
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is going to be fascinating, the midterms.

515
00:32:06,618 --> 00:32:07,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is all important.

516
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,262
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that for democracy.

517
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But is five seats enough?

518
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:15,430
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's enough in certain scenarios, I mean, how is all of this going to play out?

519
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't know.

520
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:19,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are special elections between now and the midterms.

521
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:25,904
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also very important mayoral contests like New York City.

522
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:31,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look around the country at the way voters are moving,

523
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:33,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I am encouraged.

524
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:45,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are more and more people who say, these Republicans, all they want to do is go after immigrants and after transgender kids.

525
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,755
[SPEAKER_00]: That has nothing to do with my life.

526
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:50,156
[SPEAKER_00]: What about prices of things?

527
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:52,116
[SPEAKER_00]: What about making things affordable to me?

528
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:54,797
[SPEAKER_00]: What about helping me with child care?

529
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Democrats are getting it.

530
00:32:57,577 --> 00:33:00,818
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what Mamdani actually talks about.

531
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:04,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that other Democrats are beginning to say the same thing.

532
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:06,402
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bread and butter issues.

533
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:08,103
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kitchen table economics.

534
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:10,005
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what people want and need.

535
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:14,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And get away from your scapegoating, your boogeymans.

536
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:16,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, your othering.

537
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:17,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Your othering.

538
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's so good at it, the conman's conman.

539
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:22,593
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very good at taking over language.

540
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:27,895
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an era of anger, anti-establishment anger.

541
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:28,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it.

542
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been chronicling it for years.

543
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:42,918
[SPEAKER_00]: But what Trump has done over his first and now his second term of office, and he's doing it even more crazily, is to channel that anger.

544
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:50,359
[SPEAKER_00]: into really the scapegoating of them, them and them and them and them.

545
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of what the Democrats ought to be doing is saying the real problem â€“ you want to know what the real problem is?

546
00:33:57,005 --> 00:34:01,869
[SPEAKER_00]: It's corporations are too powerful and rich people are too powerful and they are

547
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:15,542
[SPEAKER_00]: They are taking their wealth and their power and they're abusing it by destroying our democracy, undermining our democracy with all their money, their campaign contributions.

548
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:17,283
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we are in the fix.

549
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:17,984
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in.

550
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:19,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just Trump.

551
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:22,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump is the consequence, the culmination of all of this.

552
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you read about at the Smithsonian, there's an exhibit about

553
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: presidents who have been impeached, and so there were three, and then Trump was there, and so they adjusted the exhibit so that he was added, but now we might adjust the exhibit so that he's not in it.

554
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:37,763
[SPEAKER_02]: The Smithsonian.

555
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:42,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The Smithsonian, well, because I think we have serious reasons for impeachment.

556
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:43,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of words.

557
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:52,174
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, again, the surrendering in advance, the desire not to piss him off.

558
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do not to piss him off?

559
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,002
[SPEAKER_00]: His power is not just direct, it is indirect.

560
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:04,626
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all of the chilling effect he is having all over the country.

561
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:11,433
[SPEAKER_00]: All these institutions don't want to make him upset and angry because he could do anything.

562
00:35:11,673 --> 00:35:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

563
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that you've been chronicling

564
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:18,758
[SPEAKER_02]: how we got to Trump, you've been talking about these things.

565
00:35:19,538 --> 00:35:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, pardon me while I stand up, I think Michael and Jordan are gonna get mad at me.

566
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:31,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Your new book, if I may, is coming out, coming up short, it comes out this coming week, this coming Tuesday.

567
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:32,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that this Tuesday?

568
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:33,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the time go.

569
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:41,626
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, Inequality Media Civic Action is gonna be raffling off a couple signed copies, so thank you for scribbling your name for us.

570
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about it.

571
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:45,950
[SPEAKER_00]: It is coming up short is a double entendre, of course.

572
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about me.

573
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:52,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't grow full growth.

574
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:53,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up short.

575
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:57,181
[SPEAKER_00]: But the country, my generation also came up short.

576
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:04,704
[SPEAKER_00]: My father's and my parents' generation, they bequeathed to us my generation.

577
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:08,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say my generation, I'm talking about boomers primarily.

578
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:16,187
[SPEAKER_00]: George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and Clarence Thomas and I, we were born about the same time.

579
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,467
[SPEAKER_00]: When was that, 1946?

580
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about that?

581
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:18,147
1946.

582
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:19,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Heather, everybody who's anybody was born in 1946 share

583
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean.

584
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:30,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolly Parton.

585
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:32,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it going.

586
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:32,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I could keep going.

587
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:33,973
[SPEAKER_02]: No reason to keep it going.

588
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:34,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean everybody.

589
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,314
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everyone.

590
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:36,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean everybody.

591
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:37,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Who matters.

592
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:41,137
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason we were born in 1946 is not complicated.

593
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:42,478
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a war.

594
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,019
[SPEAKER_00]: My father came home.

595
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,321
[SPEAKER_00]: There was my mother.

596
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:49,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom.

597
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:49,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Boomers.

598
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby boom.

599
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:51,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that was it.

600
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,245
[SPEAKER_00]: But they bequeathed to us a

601
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,212
[SPEAKER_00]: a country that was not perfect.

602
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, women were still second class citizens.

603
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Black people were still second class citizens.

604
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,576
[SPEAKER_00]: But we at least tried.

605
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,978
[SPEAKER_00]: We were beginning on the path.

606
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:19,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we blew it in the sense that in the late 70s and the beginning of 80s, particularly with Ronald Reagan, the country did a U-turn.

607
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of building,

608
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:33,001
[SPEAKER_00]: and strengthening the middle class instead of making it a land of opportunity and diversity and equity and inclusion.

609
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:36,969
[SPEAKER_00]: we became top heavy.

610
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:41,151
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more of the wealth of this country went to the top.

611
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:42,992
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more of the income went to the top.

612
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:53,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that came more and more inequality of education and inequalities having to do with healthcare and inequalities having to do with everything you can imagine.

613
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it led ultimately

614
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:09,069
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 2008 financial crisis in which the bankers and the people at the top who were responsible for gambling, they got away with it.

615
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,692
[SPEAKER_00]: They got bailed out by taxpayers.

616
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:18,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And millions of Americans lost their homes and their jobs and their savings.

617
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,522
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when a lot of people began to say, the game is rigged.

618
00:38:24,442 --> 00:38:27,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not my democracy anymore.

619
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:31,025
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, well, that's what I try to get to in the book.

620
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:34,087
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm trying to explain it because I was there.

621
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:35,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what I like.

622
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:40,453
[SPEAKER_02]: You interweave the personal history and the country's history.

623
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: There's kind of broader themes and then individual stories.

624
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:45,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any choice.

625
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:55,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about what I learned, particularly in the public sector and the teaching, which is very important to me.

626
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

627
00:38:57,848 --> 00:38:59,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That last chapter is pretty great.

628
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, did I say that out loud?

629
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:16,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you and I are going to be talking about the book and other things at, for those who are local, Wednesday, August 13 at Broadway SF, which is at the Golden Gate Theater, an event with book passage.

630
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we will be in San Francisco on August 13, if anyone wants to come.

631
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:21,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in fact, I'm starting my book tour.

632
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:23,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the kickoff?

633
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:24,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.

634
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:30,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be on Stephen Colbert's show Monday night.

635
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we allowed to tell people that?

636
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:32,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.

637
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:33,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

638
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do a lot of other things.

639
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:38,692
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't really like book tours.

640
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I confess this to you?

641
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:41,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it to yourself.

642
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you keep it to yourself too, please?

643
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:44,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just us.

644
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:47,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the logistics, but you like to see the people.

645
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:50,116
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also you feel like a traveling salesman.

646
00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:50,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do.

647
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,477
[SPEAKER_00]: You're flogging.

648
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but people are so excited to, they are.

649
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:55,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

650
00:39:55,918 --> 00:40:05,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one thing, a movie is one thing, and you did the movie, you and Elliott Kirshner, a beautiful movie, and I was very touched by your movie.

651
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:05,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm glad.

652
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:07,223
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's different.

653
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:08,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in so many theaters.

654
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,984
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's a memoir, it's personal, it's me.

655
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:11,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

656
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's very,

657
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Historical.

658
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:19,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just this was me and my feelings when I was in middle school and my feelings when I was in my 20s.

659
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really, it's crafting a narrative that's important to read.

660
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:27,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's all me and it's all very sincere.

661
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:30,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what I lived, what I saw.

662
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,941
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do dovetail in terms of the movie, because the movie is a personal side of you, too.

663
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:41,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's you looking at the decision to retire from the huge course you taught.

664
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be clear, you do a few little classes here and there now.

665
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: But this big course of 750 students, you had 30 teaching assistants.

666
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:50,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 30 graduate student instructors.

667
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:52,084
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a class in and of itself.

668
00:40:52,724 --> 00:40:53,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

669
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,184
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get together every week.

670
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:57,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have our own seminar.

671
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:57,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Such an undertaking.

672
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:01,186
[SPEAKER_02]: But the movie, I just have to say thank you to everyone seeing it.

673
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:06,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in 50 theaters in 24 states.

674
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,169
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing more in Florida, more in Alaska.

675
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,411
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my sons saw it recently and said, I said, what did you think?

676
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:16,052
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Dan, it was like a memorial service for you.

677
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:16,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

678
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:18,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it has such hope.

679
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:27,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, other people have said it's uplifting and it's hopeful, but he... Well, I think everyone should see it.

680
00:41:27,624 --> 00:41:32,109
[SPEAKER_02]: TheLastClassFilm.com is where you go to see where it's showing and it is not a memorial site.

681
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:34,139
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?

682
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:36,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us that site again?

683
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I can give you the URL again.

684
00:41:38,283 --> 00:41:48,493
[SPEAKER_02]: TheLastClassFilm.com, which is also, this has not been announced yet, we are going to be doing a live watch-along of The Last Class Film.

685
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:50,956
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I are going to be watching it together.

686
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: We might invite some other people.

687
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, we'll see.

688
00:41:53,118 --> 00:41:54,980
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be able to watch us watch it.

689
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's so fun.

690
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:59,584
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the kids do, watch-alongs.

691
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do it, and because we want people to be able to see the film and help get their friends into theaters, it is going in all of these independent theaters.

692
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Tucson sold out 370 seats.

693
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:13,997
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unbelievable, but I just have a question.

694
00:42:14,257 --> 00:42:17,860
[SPEAKER_00]: When people watch us watch the film, are they going to be able to see the film?

695
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.

696
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Michael would do it any other way?

697
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:22,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is we talk at the beginning.

698
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,561
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some popcorn.

699
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we watch the movie.

700
00:42:26,062 --> 00:42:30,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we cut to us just twice watching the movie, crying, laughing, choking on our popcorn.

701
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:32,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do a Q&A afterwards.

702
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:34,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is August 12th.

703
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:37,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be Tuesday, August 12th, 5 p.m.

704
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:39,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific, 8 p.m.

705
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:39,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern.

706
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:43,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can do it.

707
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:43,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

708
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna say pay what you will.

709
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:45,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's zero dollars.

710
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:50,270
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to just watch it for zero, you can chip in to help support the distribution of the film if you like.

711
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be announcing it soon.

712
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:54,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So sign up at thelastclassfilm.com.

713
00:42:54,392 --> 00:43:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also say the URL for it, the website for it, nextclutch, because we have time before the next clutch, because we do these weekly.

714
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,598
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do the last clutch.

715
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:09,204
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I want to do the first of many clutches.

716
00:43:09,384 --> 00:43:14,231
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could have a film, The Last Clutch, if we ever have a last clutch.

717
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:15,292
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much to cover.

718
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:16,094
[SPEAKER_00]: There is too much.

719
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:19,639
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the tariffs and the coffee, it's going to be harder to clutch, but we won't stop.

720
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,541
[SPEAKER_00]: It is import taxes.

721
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,260
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to flog this book.

722
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,921
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I'm going to flog the movie.

723
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:29,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up short.

724
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:31,102
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it back.

725
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:32,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anyone I took it out of the shelf.

726
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:36,966
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, but it's not actually â€“ that copy is just a â€“ That's the paperback galley.

727
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:38,227
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a galley, yeah.

728
00:43:39,668 --> 00:43:43,110
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is so much more to talk about.

729
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,411
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is.

730
00:43:44,531 --> 00:44:02,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And the irony is that your movie and this memoir are coming out, or have been coming out, just at the time when so many people, so many of you out there, understandably, are just so upset.

731
00:44:03,947 --> 00:44:05,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have every right to be upset.

732
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm upset.

733
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And Heather, you're upset.

734
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:18,973
[SPEAKER_00]: We started talking when we started this particular clutch today about how

735
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:33,328
[SPEAKER_00]: This fascist Trump regime is making us all, all, I think including many Republicans, feel that something is fundamentally wrong.

736
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's immoral what's happening.

737
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:44,714
[SPEAKER_00]: It violates all the ideas and ideals that we accepted and took for granted.

738
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:48,996
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so disorienting.

739
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:50,197
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so disorienting.

740
00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:50,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so heavy.

741
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:53,279
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me just say this.

742
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you.

743
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank you.

744
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:57,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

745
00:44:57,621 --> 00:44:58,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

746
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:01,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael Lohannes Calderon, thank you.

747
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:02,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Three cheers.

748
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:06,386
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me also thank all of you.

749
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:15,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Because despite being so disoriented and upset and despairing, and I know many of you are,

750
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:30,254
[SPEAKER_00]: You also are maintaining your sense of hope and your sense that we will get out of this, we will emerge.

751
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:44,457
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when I mentioned a moment ago about we had taken all of this for granted, we had taken the rule of law for granted, we had taken democracy for granted, we had taken much that we

752
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,682
[SPEAKER_00]: had been born into in America and the world for granted.

753
00:45:55,107 --> 00:46:01,408
[SPEAKER_00]: The word of hope that I want to leave you with is that we will no longer be taking it for granted.

754
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:23,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We see what happens when we become so indifferent to it, we don't see it, we don't appreciate it, that we allow somebody like Donald Trump to take over in every respect and become a personal fascist, authoritarian, monarch,

755
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:26,547
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of a president.

756
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:47,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that that recognition, that understanding of how important the Constitution and the rule of law and democracy are to us will be something that we will not forget, our children will not forget, their children who are now, for some of us, we have grandchildren, they will not forget.

757
00:46:48,837 --> 00:47:07,209
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it lays the foundation for a stronger democracy and a stronger America that respects the rule of law and also seeks social justice.

758
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:14,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me thank you again, and on that note, have a good week.
