00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:25,050

00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:33,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Report of committees.

58
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Curriculum subcommittee 22620, member van de Kloot.

59
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:39,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

60
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:44,388
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

61
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:55,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So the curriculum subcommittee met on Wednesday, February 26, between 4.30 and 5.30 at the superintendent's conference room in Medford High School.

62
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:59,854
[SPEAKER_06]: In attendance were the subcommittee members, myself and Jenny Graham.

63
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:01,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Mia was absent.

64
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,397
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member Paul Rousseau

65
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:20,977
[SPEAKER_06]: attended the meeting, as did Superintendent Maryse Edward-Vincent, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of PE Health Rachel Puri, and Middle School Parent Michelle Ciccolo.

66
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:26,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I called the meeting together at 435 and we saluted the flag.

67
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:30,400
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of the meeting was to review proposed additions to the middle school health curriculum.

68
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:41,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We received handouts from Rachel Puri, including the table of contents for the national health standards and a table reviewing the current Medford health curriculum with the national standards.

69
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Areas where we were not in alignment were highlighted.

70
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Puri reviewed the charts with the subcommittee.

71
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:58,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently we use part of the Michigan model, but now we should be incorporating more areas of the most recent Michigan model edition to cover areas related to sexual health.

72
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:06,172
[SPEAKER_06]: We are covering areas such as vaping, alcohol, drug education, nutrition, physical activity, safety, and other areas of social emotional learning.

73
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, the state standards are not out.

74
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:12,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So at present, we need to rely on the national standards.

75
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:16,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Perry explained the health is offered for a half year in grade six, seventh, and eighth.

76
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,843
[SPEAKER_06]: The other half of the year, the students receive instruction from guidance in order to cover the new areas of instruction.

77
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:29,647
[SPEAKER_06]: In order to cover the new areas of instruction, one full-time health teacher will be needed.

78
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham asked about the trade-off between students receiving health versus the ability to participate in band or orchestra.

79
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Parent Ciccolo noted that her child had no health in sixth grade because of a conflict with orchestra,

80
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:47,565
[SPEAKER_06]: In seventh grade, her child traded phys ed in order to get health instruction.

81
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:52,727
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member Rousseau noted that often students on IEPs miss subjects like health.

82
00:12:53,327 --> 00:13:00,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing said that our kids are under a constant bombardment on vaping and other risky behaviors.

83
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,232
[SPEAKER_06]: He believes a trained health professional is of highest priority, a must have.

84
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:08,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Guiding staff not trained to teach these health areas.

85
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:14,028
[SPEAKER_06]: The superintendent concurred and noted that budget decisions are going to be tough because of the many needs.

86
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:26,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the new curriculum covers areas related to sex education, such as gender identity, anatomy, puberty, and contraception, all parents will receive the opt-out notification, which the district has used for many years.

87
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,455
[SPEAKER_06]: The sequencing of the curriculum will be given careful consideration.

88
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:34,018
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school ninth grade health class will be reviewed and updated.

89
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Scheduling at the middle school is challenging.

90
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham offered the following statement to summarize our current position.

91
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:48,271
[SPEAKER_06]: We recognize that there are scheduling issues that mean parents have to make choices that we would rather they did not have to make.

92
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,714
[SPEAKER_06]: We are very aware of the issues and are working to address them.

93
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by myself.

94
00:13:55,284 --> 00:14:08,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The Curriculum Subcommittee recommends that the school committee adopt Growing Up and Staying Healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements in order to assure that we are aligned with the national health standards.

95
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call was Graham, yes.

96
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Vander Kloot, yes.

97
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:11,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

98
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Stone was absent.

99
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn at 5.30 by Member Graham and seconded by myself.

100
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:19,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And the motion passed.

101
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:23,201
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would like to make a motion tonight.

102
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:39,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We would ask that the school committee adopt, recommendation is that we adopt growing up, the subcommittee recommendation is that we adopt growing up and staying healthy, the Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.

103
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:42,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

104
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:43,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

105
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that thorough report.

106
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:55,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot, I was wondering about the growing up and staying healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.

107
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:59,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Are those supplements regarding students with disabilities or EL learners?

108
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:01,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what the supplements are?

109
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

110
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:08,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there were resources that the teachers would be using.

111
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,569
[SPEAKER_06]: They were not specified.

112
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,977
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we did address the needs of the fact that there was concerns about getting the curriculum to everybody.

113
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:23,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one of the reasons why the recommendation is to add a full-time health

114
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:32,543
[SPEAKER_06]: teacher at that level, because we need to be more comprehensive in our ability to deliver the information to students, all students.

115
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:33,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

116
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:33,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

117
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:38,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm wondering about the special education and EL access for the curriculum.

118
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know, aside from scheduling, I'm talking really content.

119
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:42,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

120
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Perry, if you can help with that.

121
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:43,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

122
00:15:45,093 --> 00:16:02,697
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, is it driven by, I guess that's question number one, and question number two would be that I don't know if the scheduling thing is driven by IEP goals, so if there are parents watching and they feel that their middle schoolers need sex education, they might be thinking about what the IEP, or any health education, what the IEP goals are to reflect that.

123
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:03,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that how it's driven, or?

124
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

125
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,738
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me answer the special education piece first.

126
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have the Michigan model, which we will add to.

127
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:14,440
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at other models as well for the special education piece.

128
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,823
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one called FLASH that I just started looking into, which is actually specifically for special education.

129
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:25,126
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something that we could also add into what we're doing with the Michigan model.

130
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:25,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

131
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:26,286
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

132
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:27,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And EL?

133
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,648
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sorry, what was the other question?

134
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,529
[SPEAKER_15]: English learners.

135
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,709
[SPEAKER_15]: English learners.

136
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,571
[SPEAKER_15]: We would also have to adapt for the English learners.

137
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,212
[SPEAKER_10]: For the English learners.

138
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:40,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're looking to do is, if we get this approved, I have a lot of work ahead of me.

139
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:48,312
[SPEAKER_15]: So we would have to get the Michigan model together, do a scope and sequence, add in the special education piece as well as the EL piece.

140
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:49,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

141
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:49,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

142
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:50,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're welcome.

143
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:53,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, from the chair, I know Ms.

144
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin just asked about the content.

145
00:16:55,397 --> 00:17:02,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there paperwork we could review on our own before this is approved tonight to review what the content is of

146
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:06,523
[SPEAKER_16]: growing up and staying healthy, Michigan model health curriculum.

147
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:07,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

148
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So you should have gotten a handout that actually gives the lessons.

149
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:11,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get copies of that?

150
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:14,768
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't give it.

151
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

152
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:16,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

153
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:20,952
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't feel comfortable voting on it tonight until I can actually read the content first.

154
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:21,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

155
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,854
[SPEAKER_16]: There was questions for me and I couldn't answer them.

156
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:24,555
[SPEAKER_16]: So, okay.

157
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:26,476
[SPEAKER_16]: We can get you copies of those.

158
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, if you could make them all of us.

159
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:31,659
[SPEAKER_16]: If member McLaughlin motion to, um,

160
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:36,110
[SPEAKER_16]: get the content emailed to all members of the school committee?

161
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

162
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And motion to lay it on the table, thank you, by Member van de Kloet, seconded by?

163
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:41,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Melanie.

164
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Melanie McLaughlin.

165
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

166
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:52,480
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could withdraw your motion to table, unless, okay, no, never mind, you're all set.

167
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table, Member van de Kloet, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

168
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:58,163
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

169
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call, please.

170
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call has been requested.

171
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:06,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct in saying when it's tabled, it's tabled?

172
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:08,978
[SPEAKER_16]: You can request a roll call.

173
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:10,180
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

174
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:13,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

175
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:21,833
[SPEAKER_06]: »» Okay.

176
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I make a clarification?

177
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:23,973
[SPEAKER_06]: »» Sure.

178
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:31,315
[SPEAKER_06]: »» The reason I motioned to table it was because a member asked for additional information that I did not provide.

179
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:37,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Because typically when we've had a handout we don't always provide it that's not customary.

180
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:46,877
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't provide it and since a member asked for that information and we didn't provide it, that's why I made the motion to lay it on the table.

181
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: carry over to the next meeting.

182
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have to review them in the next meeting.

183
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want this to go on.

184
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:03,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm totally fine with people having that information that they need.

185
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,288
[SPEAKER_08]: But Ms.

186
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:08,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Perry has a ton of work to do once we make this decision.

187
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:17,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to respect the fact that she can't implement a massive curriculum change unless we give her some room to start to do so.

188
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:28,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I may, there's also a budget piece of getting a, whether we're going to approve the additional health personnel, which is going to make this possible.

189
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I absolutely understand.

190
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that as soon as a member requests a piece of information, I mean, the mayor just said, I don't feel comfortable voting on it unless I see that.

191
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, uh, it would be as you and I both being on the subcommittee, we very, very much want to see this go through.

192
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:46,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

193
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:49,788
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, I'm willing to wait for two weeks.

194
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not have to read the minutes again.

195
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,470
[SPEAKER_06]: We would just have to bring it back up.

196
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll lay it on the table to the next meeting.

197
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:01,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

198
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,419
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not really clear what you mean by information.

199
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,441
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I've received the Michigan model.

200
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:12,063
[SPEAKER_23]: It is a binder that would take most of us, if we're fast readers,

201
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,280
[SPEAKER_23]: more than two weeks to read, so I don't know what the request for information is.

202
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:25,564
[SPEAKER_23]: So two weeks from now, if you get the documents we got in our meeting, is that going to be good enough is really my concern.

203
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:34,168
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to point out that this is a vote that is purely for the purposes of providing cover to our staff.

204
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:38,890
[SPEAKER_23]: We are explicitly forbidden in the law from approving curriculum.

205
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,351
[SPEAKER_23]: It's explicit in the 1993 Ed Reform Act.

206
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:48,630
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm willing to vote for this, no matter what it is that we're going to be teaching, because it isn't about the content.

207
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,171
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about the fact that we're not teaching sex ed at all to our middle schoolers right now.

208
00:20:53,911 --> 00:21:12,016
[SPEAKER_23]: And we are so far off of the national standards that I'm just not interested in a conversation about whether or not masturbation, menstruation, whether showing how to put a condom onto a replica penis, those are things that are going to happen.

209
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:16,314
[SPEAKER_23]: And in my mind, they're going to happen whether we approve this or not.

210
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:21,635
[SPEAKER_23]: So the law requires opt-out for parents.

211
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:29,676
[SPEAKER_23]: A form will be sent home, and parents are more than welcome to keep their kids from knowing the facts of life or whatever it is you want to call that.

212
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:34,317
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't have the amount of work that is going to be involved with getting this done.

213
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:37,458
[SPEAKER_23]: Two weeks is just two weeks, but the school year is only 180 days long.

214
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:43,716
[SPEAKER_23]: We are talking about almost 10% of the time between now and the next time we meet.

215
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,620
[SPEAKER_23]: So I am not comfortable with waiting so that we can all know what the content is.

216
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,082
[SPEAKER_23]: The meeting?

217
00:21:53,603 --> 00:22:04,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand and respect our co-members' positions, but I think that this is an important topic, at least for the rest of us to understand, especially as I'm considering our learners who are more vulnerable.

218
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:07,713
[SPEAKER_10]: And that doesn't necessarily mean that our parents want to automatically opt out.

219
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:17,670
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means that we want to be aware of and understand how this will be presented in a way that's differentiated, which I know we don't won't know that yet because we won't know how you're doing that.

220
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,456
[SPEAKER_10]: But I certainly want to see the big picture around like where we're going and how

221
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,515
[SPEAKER_10]: that's going to work.

222
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:29,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So respectfully, I would say that I'm happy to take the time over the two weeks.

223
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:36,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm certainly not going to read every single line item, but I want to have a broad understanding and picture of what it is that we're presenting to.

224
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:42,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would make a motion to, or second your motion to table.

225
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member McLaughlin.

226
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:50,254
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

227
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,073
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

228
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:54,194
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

229
00:22:55,234 --> 00:23:05,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled for two weeks and motion by Member McLaughlin to get a copy of the content, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

230
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:05,782
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

231
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:07,303
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

232
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

233
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:08,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

234
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:09,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

235
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:11,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

236
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to ask for suspension of, oh, sorry, not yet.

237
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:16,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

238
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

239
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:18,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

240
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you told me when you were going to do it.

241
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:25,494
[SPEAKER_16]: So rules, policy, and equity subcommittee, March 3rd, 2020.

242
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

243
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:27,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

244
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:34,098
[SPEAKER_23]: So on March 3rd, we had a meeting that started at 3.31 PM.

245
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:35,698
[SPEAKER_23]: I won't read the entire set of minutes.

246
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,020
[SPEAKER_23]: We were discussing two new rules.

247
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,760
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it two?

248
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:44,497
[SPEAKER_23]: excuse me, the agenda's not here, two new rules for the committee itself.

249
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,381
[SPEAKER_23]: And these are procedural rules and then a new policy.

250
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:53,522
[SPEAKER_23]: I will just quickly go over each of them.

251
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:59,526
[SPEAKER_23]: The first was a rule on how to add an item to the agenda of the school committee.

252
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:07,730
[SPEAKER_23]: It is a very common experience for new members and even for those of us that have been around to wonder how do we get something on the agenda.

253
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,362
[SPEAKER_23]: I could not find any existing rules, so we have composed a specific procedure.

254
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:20,065
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't have a rule number yet because we have to find the current rules to know what to give it.

255
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:28,530
[SPEAKER_23]: And I won't read the full rule, assuming that you have all read these since you received them in your packets.

256
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:37,895
[SPEAKER_23]: I do want to make one minor amendment to it on page, it doesn't have page numbers, excuse me, under the why section.

257
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:44,128
[SPEAKER_23]: The last sentence is, this procedure aims to put an end to that question.

258
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:49,573
[SPEAKER_23]: Really, it should say, this procedure aims to provide an answer to that question.

259
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:59,382
[SPEAKER_23]: So I entertain a motion to accept this rule as amended.

260
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you clarify your motion one more time?

261
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:05,056
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure.

262
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:16,876
[SPEAKER_23]: The motion that I would like to have is to approve this as a rule of the school committee going forward with the slight change on the second page

263
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:30,057
[SPEAKER_23]: where it says the why, and the last sentence is to be changed slightly, where it says this procedure, well the entire section Y says, this procedure is needed to ensure transparency.

264
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:34,899
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the first questions a new member is often, how do I get something on the agenda?

265
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,441
[SPEAKER_23]: This procedure aims, and it should say, to provide an answer to that question.

266
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:44,464
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's the one amendment that I'd like to include.

267
00:25:47,614 --> 00:26:06,220
[SPEAKER_23]: So since not everybody has this, this just provides a list of steps for members when we want to add something to the agenda, how do we do it, what we would send, who we would send it to, when we would send it, we would use email, why we even need this procedure, and then also outline some important

268
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:17,777
[SPEAKER_23]: some important situations that have happened but are unusual, such as what if there's an objection to adding something to an agenda?

269
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:29,003
[SPEAKER_23]: For instance, we can ask for anything we want on the agenda, but if we ask for something that we couldn't legally actually get an answer to, that objection would actually follow a process as well.

270
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:31,885
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think there's some questions.

271
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

272
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:40,476
[SPEAKER_11]: First, I want to say thank you to the committee for putting these instructions together.

273
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:44,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have just a couple of really simple questions.

274
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:50,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we follow these same procedures to add subcommittee meeting minutes to the agenda?

275
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:54,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know quite often we have to send a request to add our meeting minutes.

276
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:57,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Would we follow the same procedure, I'm assuming?

277
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:58,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

278
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Member van der Kloot.

279
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:08,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a question about the timeline.

280
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:16,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, I guess my first question is, did the subcommittee endorse, I don't see a motion for approval.

281
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there, sorry, where is it?

282
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: And was it a three to one vote?

283
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a three to zero vote?

284
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

285
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:35,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a question about, okay, here, I see it now.

286
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:39,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question about the timeline.

287
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:51,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears that it gives the superintendent or her designee within two normal school days to respond with the following.

288
00:27:53,257 --> 00:28:04,001
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I'm up there signing the bills on Wednesday, I have to say that my observation is that people are running, running, running, juggling so many balls in the air.

289
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think two normal school days is sufficient.

290
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:14,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand everybody thinks that whatever they have, as do I, is the most pressing issue.

291
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:22,149
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that's real to hold the superintendent to, and I don't want her to be under pressure to simply

292
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,980
[SPEAKER_06]: designating something to everybody else.

293
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:27,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometimes she may need to think about it.

294
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:32,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't find two days to be sufficient.

295
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:40,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask the superintendent, since this affects you directly, is what sort of timeline you would think would be reasonable?

296
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:48,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the spirit of trying to give feedback in preparation,

297
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to double that from two days to four days because we meet every two weeks.

298
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:06,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would need to, I'm going to try my due diligence, my best to respond as quickly as possible.

299
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we could increase that from two to four to at least be able to say whether it could be on that, I hope that's considered reasonable.

300
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:19,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let, have Mr.

301
00:29:22,585 --> 00:29:38,774
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just point out that switching to nine days, because there's a five-day window before the meeting by which you would have to have submitted this, that would mean it would be impossible to put something on the next agenda.

302
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:50,556
[SPEAKER_23]: The when says that you cannot request something beyond the agenda closer than five school days before that meeting.

303
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:55,660
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we wanted something on the next agenda, we must have it in by this Friday.

304
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:03,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Two days before that is this Wednesday for the very next meeting.

305
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,249
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's my concern.

306
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:11,951
[SPEAKER_23]: We put that big five-day window out there.

307
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:20,191
[SPEAKER_23]: Because you've got to put the posting, you've got to whatever documentation, whatever the thing is that is going to be on the agenda, it takes time.

308
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:30,400
[SPEAKER_23]: And right now, we sometimes have members, and I'm guilty as charged, who submit things on Wednesday afternoon for a Monday meeting, or Thursday afternoon for a Monday meeting.

309
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,221
[SPEAKER_23]: And they get on the agenda.

310
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:38,987
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm always happy when I shove something in at the last second and it gets on the agenda.

311
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,729
[SPEAKER_23]: But there is no time for planning, there's no time for

312
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:46,889
[SPEAKER_23]: saying, well, the meeting is now going to be six hours long, as happened last time.

313
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:58,920
[SPEAKER_23]: So I mean, the five days is already a huge change, in my opinion, to when the last time you can hit your Send button to add something to an agenda.

314
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,245
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's sort of my response to that.

315
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:06,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say,

316
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:21,135
[SPEAKER_04]: let's allow it to go through as is and in a year's time we can or six months time review or reconvene in subcommittee to see if it if it really is too tight or the the

317
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:27,938
[SPEAKER_04]: it becomes very, very difficult, then we could review it, revisit it again as a compromise.

318
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd also just like to respond to the two day thing.

319
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:36,282
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually completely agree that two days, like I have plenty of unread email that's more than two days old.

320
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:46,086
[SPEAKER_23]: However, if I send something that I want on the agenda, I might be asking parents to come or, you know, engaging the community on a topic.

321
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:48,227
[SPEAKER_23]: I send this email and

322
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,670
[SPEAKER_23]: days just go by, and I don't know if it's going to be on the agenda.

323
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,271
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a real problem, for me at least, when I've had that experience.

324
00:31:57,031 --> 00:31:59,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Two days is already, in my mind, is a long time.

325
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:04,373
[SPEAKER_23]: Two full work days to simply say, yes, it'll be on the agenda.

326
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:09,174
[SPEAKER_23]: You can just respond and say, I'm too busy right now.

327
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,834
[SPEAKER_23]: Give me a couple extra days or something.

328
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,215
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't have to be.

329
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:19,420
[SPEAKER_23]: definitive, but getting a response of some sort is really part of the goal of that.

330
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,101
[SPEAKER_23]: So, thank you.

331
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:24,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

332
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:26,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz.

333
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:30,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just had just a couple of quick questions.

334
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:40,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I just wanted to know, when we send it in the subject, should we put specifically, please add to agenda, you know, something that will stand out that

335
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:49,059
[SPEAKER_11]: will be unique for people adding to the agenda so that the superintendent and the mayor know that, oh, this is an item for the agenda.

336
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I should make that a priority over some other emails.

337
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know.

338
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:54,662
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just my thought at my work.

339
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:59,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We have certain subject procedures when emailing, but that was just a thought.

340
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:08,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I wanted to know, who is the designee while we wait for a replacement for the executive assistant, which is just recently developed?

341
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:11,494
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think Ms.

342
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:14,755
[SPEAKER_11]: McLaughlin has mentioned this a couple of times with some other procedures.

343
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:21,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to put these procedures on the websites once they're approved so that we can easily access them for reference?

344
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:31,139
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because like, I mean, I think we come across one of the documents which is functions of the school committee and I had the final version, but you know how like there's multiple versions everywhere?

345
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:32,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is the final one?

346
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so I was just wondering where will this be?

347
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:35,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

348
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,860
[SPEAKER_23]: If I might respond.

349
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information?

350
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

351
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, member Rousseau.

352
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:43,911
[SPEAKER_23]: One more time?

353
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,592
[SPEAKER_23]: There we go.

354
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:51,773
[SPEAKER_23]: For those that weren't in the meeting, I forget that you didn't hear this part of the conversation.

355
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:58,575
[SPEAKER_23]: But all of these procedures, especially the new ones, I fully expect these are not perfect.

356
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:03,016
[SPEAKER_23]: And that if three meetings from now we're like, this isn't working,

357
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:06,136
[SPEAKER_23]: We just send it back to the subcommittee for changes.

358
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:08,298
[SPEAKER_23]: These are our working rules.

359
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:12,840
[SPEAKER_23]: If they're not working, then we can change them, because we change them for ourselves.

360
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:22,447
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's how I look at all of these procedures and policies, that achieving a perfect outcome on the first run is, I think, a heavy lift.

361
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:29,251
[SPEAKER_23]: And if two days, or five days, or if the whole procedure just doesn't work, any one of us can just

362
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:36,481
[SPEAKER_23]: speak up at the next meeting and say, this doesn't work and here's why, and send it to subcommittee for changes.

363
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,803
[SPEAKER_23]: But having something written down so members know which ends up, I think is really important.

364
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:53,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I did want to know, you know, who, like, who should we be, like, just to, you know, to start the process, like,

365
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Going forward, we have to schedule some meetings.

366
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:01,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So am I going to send it to the mayor, the superintendent, and who else while we wait for a replacement?

367
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to go to Pete?

368
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:06,952
[SPEAKER_07]: For the time being, you can send it to me.

369
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll make it work.

370
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,193
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so the mayor and superintendent.

371
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:12,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor and superintendent, chair and superintendent, yes.

372
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:12,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

373
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:12,933
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

374
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:17,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't matter, just put anything in the subject.

375
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:19,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Agenda item.

376
00:35:19,715 --> 00:35:20,515
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, agenda item.

377
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:22,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

378
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:23,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

379
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:26,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the conversation.

380
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:36,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on the subcommittee, and this is why it's so good to have the conversation after subcommittee, because other things come up, and we get an idea of what questions we maybe didn't vet in the subcommittee.

381
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:49,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So one thing that's come up to me and might come up for community members is, what happens when there's obviously, say, a really pressing issue, like we have a pressing issue,

382
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:53,280
[SPEAKER_10]: that's come up in the community and we have an agenda list.

383
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,860
[SPEAKER_10]: We just, what?

384
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,321
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the coronavirus?

385
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:56,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like a coronavirus.

386
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to say it, but yes.

387
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Like something like that, that's sort of a pressing issue and sort of, you know, prioritizes over all the other agenda items.

388
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,051
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the process for that?

389
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:11,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And should, and if there's not one, should we be including one in the subcommittee?

390
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:16,058
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's an emergency matter, the chair can rule to take that under suspension.

391
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:17,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

392
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:31,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And then so, and then maybe including in the policy what that process is so that, you know, for notification for, you know, whether things get rippled down or totally re assigned or, or why I just think we should be thinking about it.

393
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:31,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

394
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:39,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Through the chair, I spoke to a law firm today about that very matter and it could be taken under suspension from the chair.

395
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,378
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you have something to add, member Ruseau.

396
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:48,110
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not the only way things get on the agenda.

397
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,351
[SPEAKER_23]: The superintendent and the chair are more than, they add things to the agenda all the time that we have nothing to do with.

398
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:59,393
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, we're all welcome to send an email saying, can you put coronavirus update on the agenda?

399
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:04,175
[SPEAKER_23]: We also can just not do that because I think it'd be weird if that wasn't on the agenda.

400
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:13,918
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, the adding emergency things doesn't require us to do that.

401
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,252
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not an emergency for me.

402
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:19,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.

403
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:21,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, yeah.

404
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:25,196
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess the question was then how it ripples down for the others.

405
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,636
[SPEAKER_10]: So how is that affected?

406
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:32,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought the point was that we were going to be knowing ahead of time what was on the agenda and how things rippled through.

407
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:37,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously if the superintendent or chair have things that they're including on the agenda,

408
00:37:37,932 --> 00:37:46,735
[SPEAKER_10]: that also includes our line items, our agenda items that were put in with these great notations that we have next to them about who submitted what and when and all those things.

409
00:37:47,796 --> 00:38:01,321
[SPEAKER_10]: How then is it after they've put their things on the agenda and an emergency comes up, how then is it addressed and communicated to everybody to know what is in fact on the agenda, what's not, what's going to be reprioritized, and what's not?

410
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:03,061
[SPEAKER_23]: If I may.

411
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:07,383
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is for this particular procedure.

412
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:10,157
[SPEAKER_23]: is only for members who want to add something to the agenda.

413
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:20,904
[SPEAKER_23]: There is another issue in this subcommittee that hasn't been scheduled yet, which is looking to redesign our entire agenda, how it works, and all that.

414
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:23,946
[SPEAKER_23]: So in my mind, that is very much a part of that conversation.

415
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:30,950
[SPEAKER_23]: The agenda is getting changed and built out, and how do we all know what's on the agenda coming up in two weeks before it gets posted?

416
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:35,113
[SPEAKER_23]: But that seems very separate, in my mind, to the procedure of,

417
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:39,469
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to talk about XYZ on April 9th.

418
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,652
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this is what I would do under that circumstance.

419
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:49,435
[SPEAKER_23]: But emergencies, I mean, this isn't really intended for emergency situations.

420
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:51,696
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

421
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:52,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Member van de Kloot.

422
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, so first I want to say I do appreciate the work that the subcommittee did on this.

423
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:02,386
[SPEAKER_06]: The superintendent has indicated her willingness to try it out.

424
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern, again, just stands, perhaps I would change it to three normal school days.

425
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:10,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to work through my head.

426
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:14,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's written on Sunday, it gets sent so it's received Monday.

427
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,977
[SPEAKER_06]: That means the expectation is that it would get answered by Tuesday.

428
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:23,697
[SPEAKER_06]: afternoon, but all hell breaks out loose on Monday and Tuesday they're running about.

429
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, again, part of me just, I absolutely understand, you know, what the intent is and I think we are all reasonable people, but I'm always concerned when we write policy like this that someone then could come along and be holding, hold the superintendent to something that we agreed would be flexible and we're trying out.

430
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:50,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, to me, it just seems very quick.

431
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:55,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd be more comfortable with a three-day return, personally.

432
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:14,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I would go, certainly, with asking the rest of the school committee whether, you know, I'll make a motion that the response within three normal school days as opposed to two, and you either vote up or down, and I'm happy to take whatever the consensus is.

433
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So I make a motion, if anybody wants to

434
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:20,662
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, approve it or second it, that'd be three.

435
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Kathy.

436
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:25,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau?

437
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:26,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

438
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, motion.

439
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:30,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

440
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:31,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I?

441
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:31,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

442
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:37,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve.

443
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:38,406
[SPEAKER_11]: To extend it to three days.

444
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,886
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended with the change of three days.

445
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:40,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

446
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by Member Vindiclude, seconded by Member Kreatz.

447
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:45,147
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

448
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:45,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

449
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:46,648
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

450
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:47,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

451
00:40:51,529 --> 00:41:06,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Number three committee of the whole wages and high school tour on March member or so Confident on that there were two more parts of this report.

452
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:12,917
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a new ad hoc report request procedure if if members would like another

453
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:18,422
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd like to table this to our next meeting to read it through and really get your thoughts on it.

454
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:25,483
[SPEAKER_23]: It is complicated and is a very big divergence from our current procedure for asking for ad hoc reports.

455
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:32,684
[SPEAKER_23]: So if anybody would like to make a motion to table that particular rule to the next meeting so that we can move along.

456
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:35,085
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, I make the motion to table it.

457
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:35,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Second that.

458
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:39,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Rousseau.

459
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,325
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

460
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:41,726
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

461
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:42,646
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will.

462
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:44,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Papers tabled.

463
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,966
[SPEAKER_23]: And the last is the policy review policy.

464
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:53,148
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have four edits that I'd like to make.

465
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:59,811
[SPEAKER_23]: So in the interest of time and the fact that we have people here, I will also request that perhaps we table this to the next meeting.

466
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:04,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table policy review policy by member Rousseau.

467
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:04,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by?

468
00:42:04,653 --> 00:42:06,453
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll second.

469
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

470
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:08,254
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

471
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:09,855
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

472
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:12,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled.

473
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Committee of the Whole Meeting, Wages and High School Tour, 3-4, 2020.

474
00:42:18,376 --> 00:42:21,979
[SPEAKER_16]: I will give this report.

475
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,982
[SPEAKER_16]: We took a high school tour from 530 to 630 on Wednesday, March 4th.

476
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:28,684
[SPEAKER_16]: We visited the library.

477
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:33,568
[SPEAKER_16]: We visited, looked at the lighting, at the paint, sailing tiles.

478
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,153
[SPEAKER_16]: We went to the C building.

479
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:41,134
[SPEAKER_16]: We went through the bathrooms.

480
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:42,195
[SPEAKER_16]: We also went through

481
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:47,868
[SPEAKER_16]: the lecture halls and the locker rooms.

482
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:52,429
[SPEAKER_16]: There was some definite paint needed, fresh paint is needed.

483
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:59,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Locker rooms are being redone by the vocational students, so it's not operational as of yet.

484
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:05,673
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Member Kreatz took a number of notes and helped us out with what needs to be done.

485
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:08,193
[SPEAKER_16]: And the motion was,

486
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:21,959
[SPEAKER_16]: to request a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the scope and mission of the newly formed vision committee that was passed at 6.30.

487
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:37,391
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the first, that was one part of our meeting and the second part was the minimum wage issues in the schools and that was discussed with a number of students and employees present.

488
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:40,213
[SPEAKER_16]: We discussed the

489
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:57,665
[SPEAKER_16]: those employees making $10 an hour and moved to increase that and dated back to January 1st, 2020 to minimum wage, which was motioned by Member Mustone, seconded by Member Van der Kloot, and all in favor.

490
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:00,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if anybody else has anything to add.

491
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:05,150
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve, Member Van der Kloot?

492
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I make a motion to approve the recommendation from the subcommittee.

493
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:12,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion approved by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by Member Kreatz.

494
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:12,935
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

495
00:44:12,955 --> 00:44:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

496
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:14,616
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

497
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:15,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be a roll call.

498
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:16,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

499
00:44:16,638 --> 00:44:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot.

500
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:18,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

501
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:19,140

502
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,680

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

510
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:25,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot, yes.

511
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:26,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

512
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:26,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

513
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,349
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor and in opposition, paper passes.

514
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Community participation.

515
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:37,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Maureen Rohan.

516
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:39,402
[SPEAKER_16]: on dyslexia.

517
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on down.

518
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:51,823
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Maureen Ronain, and I have a third grader in the district with severe dyslexia.

519
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:56,565
[SPEAKER_25]: He needed to leave his neighborhood school in order to access a language-based classroom.

520
00:44:57,245 --> 00:45:05,168
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank you for taking a proactive approach for the K-2 second graders by screening for dyslexia and providing remediation.

521
00:45:05,609 --> 00:45:10,350
[SPEAKER_25]: And there is more work to be done for our older students with dyslexia, and we'd like to help you.

522
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,952
[SPEAKER_25]: My friend is not here.

523
00:45:13,032 --> 00:45:13,252
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

524
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:13,932
[SPEAKER_25]: She's sick.

525
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:16,393
[SPEAKER_25]: We propose the creation of an ad hoc

526
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:31,346
[SPEAKER_25]: dyslexia committee comprised of parents of students with dyslexia, teachers, administrators, and an independent dyslexia expert to identify needs and create an action plan so that our children can close the gap in reading in one year.

527
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:43,971
[SPEAKER_25]: We also propose the development of a dyslexia protocol so that all students, regardless of their neighborhood school, receive access to appropriately intensive services.

528
00:45:45,287 --> 00:46:00,215
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we also propose that the language based classrooms proactively offer an end to annually administer grade and age appropriate standardized norm reference evaluations such as the West Gort 5 Tower Intel toll.

529
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:04,417
[SPEAKER_25]: It's my understanding that the district already owns these evaluations.

530
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:09,600
[SPEAKER_25]: This will be used to measure progress and provide guidance and the students treatment plan.

531
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:15,985
[SPEAKER_25]: The statistics for students that can't read by the end of third grade are depressing.

532
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:28,108
[SPEAKER_25]: These students typically struggle throughout school, develop emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, are less than their non-dyslexic peers, and unfortunately have a higher rate of incarceration.

533
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:30,329
[SPEAKER_25]: These tragic outcomes are avoidable.

534
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:36,190
[SPEAKER_25]: Evidence-based reading instruction in alignment with the science harms no one and is mandatory for some.

535
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:42,092
[SPEAKER_25]: Parents and teachers that suspect dyslexia or are concerned about reading failure are urged to act quickly.

536
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:48,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Decoding Dyslexia and the International Dyslexia Association are fantastic resources for education.

537
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:58,136
[SPEAKER_25]: Locally, there is a Medford Mass Parents of Children with Dyslexia Facebook group that can also be contacted by emailing medforddyslexia at gmail.com.

538
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:06,582
[SPEAKER_25]: On Saturday, March 21st, from 2 to 4, there will be a presentation at the Winchester Public Library about dyslexia and evidence-based reading instruction.

539
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:13,869
[SPEAKER_25]: I am asking you to continue your efforts to support dyslexia and expand the focus to the older students so that all can read.

540
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:15,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

541
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

542
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:16,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

543
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:18,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van de Kloot?

544
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:19,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

545
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:21,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we take a copy of your statement?

546
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:21,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

547
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:22,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that OK?

548
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:23,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

549
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:36,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend that we take this and put it under consideration so that we can take a look at in-depth of your proposals.

550
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:41,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm also very glad that you acknowledged

551
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:47,202
[SPEAKER_06]: so much that the district has made grave strides in these last months.

552
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:48,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.

553
00:47:50,225 --> 00:47:54,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I take that one and we can make a copy and send it back to you maybe?

554
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I can have it.

555
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:55,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

556
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:58,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

557
00:47:58,731 --> 00:47:59,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

558
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:03,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you for the report.

559
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:06,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I was going to say maybe we could, if Ms.

560
00:48:06,908 --> 00:48:10,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Ronay wants to type those up and send them to us, would that be better or easier?

561
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:11,710
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's OK to just use that?

562
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,210
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, great.

563
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:22,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess we can take the time to review and ask that it be put on the next agenda.

564
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:27,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe a subcommittee.

565
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:28,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

566
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Subcommittee for this disability special education.

567
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:36,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So I ask that this be moved to the subcommittee for the special education and behavioral health.

568
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:42,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by member McLaughlin, seconded by member van de Kloet.

569
00:48:42,908 --> 00:48:43,648
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

570
00:48:43,668 --> 00:48:44,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

571
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:45,988
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

572
00:48:46,248 --> 00:48:46,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

573
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:47,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Maureen.

574
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:52,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll be in touch with you from that subcommittee to follow up.

575
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:53,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

576
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:58,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for suspension of the rules by Member Van der Kloot to take a resident who would like to speak.

577
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:02,756
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

578
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,456
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you say?

579
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:06,917
[SPEAKER_16]: All in favor.

580
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,298
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

581
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:13,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello Mayor and School Superintendent, members of the school committee.

582
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,701
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Eileen Lerner and I'm here

583
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:43,632
[SPEAKER_03]: as a representative of Safe Medford, because we have questions about the committee that was constituted to create a vision for the Medford High School, and we wanted to know why it wasn't publicized, why wasn't there more outreach, why are there only white people on the committee, and you know, it just seems like

584
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:48,826
[SPEAKER_03]: the time that we need to really be concerned about having people of color.

585
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 40% of our students are children of color.

586
00:49:55,229 --> 00:50:13,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that some of the people on the committee, or all of the people have varying degrees and expertise, and that's all well and good, but I think that a mother who lives in public housing is just as capable of having a vision for the Medford High School, and I don't think advanced degrees should be

587
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:17,293
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the standard necessarily.

588
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like for you to give us an explanation of why that occurred and if more people can be added to that committee who are more representative of our community.

589
00:50:30,387 --> 00:50:32,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin and then we'll explain.

590
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

591
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:33,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Lerner.

592
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:44,617
[SPEAKER_10]: This was an important point and one that was brought up before this meeting as well by both community members and school committee members who are concerned about this for the vision committee too.

593
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:51,842
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the process was such that the applications were, for lack of a better word, blind.

594
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:59,587
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was no indication, partially of the differences in capabilities or abilities or race

595
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,435
[SPEAKER_10]: ethnicities or economic backgrounds or what have you.

596
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:08,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that that is a place to start in terms of where we're thinking about being proactive.

597
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we clearly have work to do to be able to do that.

598
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:18,745
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm glad to say that I believe that we are reaching out to several groups.

599
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:25,487
[SPEAKER_10]: and stakeholders in the community to add some folks to the vision committee so that we are being more aware of that.

600
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:36,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the future, moving forward, I think that that's something that, especially with community members like yourself coming to the podium and people emailing us and other items, that this will be something that will be done proactively.

601
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,433
[SPEAKER_10]: So we thank you for being here.

602
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:40,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

603
00:51:41,413 --> 00:52:05,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam superintendent can explain the question about the outreach and how people were able to apply that happened before my time as mayor so it started at the tail end of last year and so the applications did come in to To central office so when we received the application similar to what member McLaughlin just shared that it was

604
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:28,105
[SPEAKER_04]: The 30 something, 42 or 43 people who applied, a lot of them had experience in construction and those types of things, but we really weren't able to tell it was a blind, a voluntary application process.

605
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So we- Wasn't that thought to be an important consideration?

606
00:52:34,457 --> 00:52:37,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is always considered an important consideration.

607
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:54,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at the time when we were looking at trying to balance male and female and not trying to have an ad hoc committee consist of 40 people in terms of trying to bring the number of participants down, we're trying to get to a manageable number.

608
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:58,377
[SPEAKER_04]: But when this came to our realization,

609
00:52:58,897 --> 00:53:01,898
[SPEAKER_04]: we definitely realized that we needed to be more proactive.

610
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:06,319
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be meetings next week with members of the NAACP.

611
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:22,643
[SPEAKER_04]: We're willing to reach out to the West Metro Community Center and other diverse groups within the community so that we can add additional seats so that this vision committee will be more reflective of the population as well.

612
00:53:23,143 --> 00:53:28,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the mayor is scheduled to have some meetings as early as next week regarding that.

613
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:40,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be a revised vision committee with additional members, diverse members from the community added to the vision committee.

614
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

615
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:42,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Murray.

616
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:43,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

617
00:53:43,197 --> 00:53:43,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

618
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:44,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

619
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:51,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted, as a point of information, to add an apology to the community that that wasn't considered in advance.

620
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:54,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll make sure that we are more proactive about that in the future.

621
00:53:54,223 --> 00:53:54,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

622
00:53:57,765 --> 00:53:59,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Report of superintendent.

623
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:04,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

624
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:04,950
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

625
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,270
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

626
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

627
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:08,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Superintendent.

628
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: First time, it got away from me at our last meeting.

629
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:34,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So I must take this opportunity to congratulate our associate superintendent, Mrs. Diane Caldwell, who after 45 years of outstanding and dedicated service to Medford Public Schools, will retire in June.

630
00:54:51,354 --> 00:55:01,117
[SPEAKER_14]: and superintendent, if I could just say that it has been my honor to serve the families and the children of Medford Public Schools.

631
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:09,299
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly will miss all of the children and the families and the staff, the teachers, my administrators, thank you so much.

632
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:11,299
[SPEAKER_14]: It means a lot to me, thank you.

633
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:12,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

634
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

635
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:17,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

636
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:23,979
[SPEAKER_10]: all these years and for our families.

637
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:30,264
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure that there are parents here who you were in the schools while they were educated and appreciated.

638
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:34,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all appreciate your service and thank you very much for your time here.

639
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:36,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know we'll see you in the community.

640
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:37,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

641
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:38,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Member van de Kloot.

642
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:55,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to add my thanks Diane and not only for all of your years but I have to emphasize for the last two years because you really were the constant in the office who helped us through the transition of superintendents and that was just an incredibly important

643
00:55:56,339 --> 00:56:18,093
[SPEAKER_06]: role for you to play and you know you could have looked around and said oh I don't think so but instead you chose to stay and to be the transition link and so I think for that not only for that but also for your many years back I remember when you were teaching at the Curtis Tufts and I always thought you were something special so thank you very very much.

644
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

645
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say thank you for your years of service, Ms.

646
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:23,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Caldwell.

647
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:26,526
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very much appreciated and congratulations.

648
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:27,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

649
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:32,071
[SPEAKER_16]: On the chair, congratulations, enjoy retirement in July.

650
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:33,271
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll have you till then.

651
00:56:33,672 --> 00:56:34,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Superintendent.

652
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:35,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

653
00:56:36,514 --> 00:56:38,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna give a little bit of a short resume.

654
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:41,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I paused, but I do wanna share this.

655
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:42,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

656
00:56:42,257 --> 00:56:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell's background is in elementary education and special education.

657
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And she has been the administrator of numerous educational grants.

658
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: She began her career in Medford teaching at the Dame Elementary School.

659
00:56:56,808 --> 00:56:59,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, she taught at the Curtis Tufts and Medford High School.

660
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:02,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving into administration, Ms.

661
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:07,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell served as a professional development coordinator and the title one director.

662
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:17,917
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 years ago, she was appointed assistant superintendent for elementary education and two years ago, was elevated to associate superintendent.

663
00:57:18,637 --> 00:57:20,858
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first arrived in Medford, Ms.

664
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell opened her arms to me and shared her wealth of information while providing guidance and advice when needed.

665
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:31,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I quickly learned that Ms.

666
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell was an integral key in how the Medford Public School community was running so smoothly and working collaboratively together.

667
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:44,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Her knowledge is something that cannot be replaced.

668
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: She has guided and taught so many Mustangs, both in this room and throughout the district.

669
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:58,024
[SPEAKER_04]: However, her focus has always been with her kiddos, the many students who have gone through the Medford Public Schools.

670
00:57:59,465 --> 00:57:59,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

671
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:07,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell's eyes have always been on the prize, and that is the students who come here to learn.

672
00:58:08,257 --> 00:58:10,878
[SPEAKER_04]: To say she will be greatly missed is an understatement.

673
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I speak for everyone when I say we wish her nothing but the best in her retirement.

674
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:25,225
[SPEAKER_04]: We thank her husband, Jack, along with her children and grandchildren for allowing us to have her as part of our family for so long.

675
00:58:26,106 --> 00:58:27,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

676
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:36,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Diane Caldwell, for your 45 years of devotion to the students, administrators, faculty, staff, and parents of the Medford Public Schools.

677
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:40,112
[SPEAKER_04]: wishing you every happiness in your retirement.

678
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:46,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Please know, we still have your phone number, so we still plan to use it to ask questions.

679
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again.

680
00:58:56,434 --> 00:59:04,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Another highlight that happened back on February 23rd, that was our beautification day that took place at the high school.

681
00:59:05,497 --> 00:59:11,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to thank the mayor and her transition team who took the time to help beautify the entrance to Medford High School.

682
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:23,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustang graduate, Bill Carr Jr., who chaired this committee, met with Headmaster DeLeva and John McLaughlin, our Director of Building and Grounds, to put together a plan for the day.

683
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:31,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Over 40 volunteers and current students cleaned, painted, and refreshed the entrance.

684
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:40,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate and thank everyone who took the time to devote to this important community project, including Mr. Paul Rousseau,

685
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:42,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

686
00:59:42,188 --> 00:59:45,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Kathy Krutz, Ms.

687
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:47,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie McLaughlin, Ms.

688
00:59:47,314 --> 01:00:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Paulette Vander Kloot, all of the school committee, City Councilor Michael Marks, Neil Osborne, the City's Director of Diversity, and Acting Human Resource Director, and from my team,

689
01:00:01,252 --> 01:00:10,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Dr. Peter Cushing, and Mr. John McLaughlin, again, who assisted throughout the day.

690
01:00:10,901 --> 01:00:15,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for that dedication of time and beautifying our high school entrance.

691
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:24,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a very brief update on our coronavirus, COVID-19.

692
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:30,126
[SPEAKER_04]: We continue to work very collaboratively with City Hall.

693
01:00:31,386 --> 01:00:41,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself, Nurse Tony Ray, we're working closely with the Medford Board of Health, Mary Ann O'Connor, and I know the city's doctor as well is here.

694
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping everyone up to date and informed.

695
01:00:46,533 --> 01:01:07,688
[SPEAKER_04]: As you are aware, Medford did have, well, I should preface it by saying the CDC gave us guidance last week about to impose a 14-day quarantine for anyone who traveled to the countries of China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran.

696
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:18,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So in particular, when we got that notice, we did have two staff members that had traveled overseas during February break.

697
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to honor the new guidelines that we were given, they had to quarantine for the remaining days to get to 14 days.

698
01:01:28,988 --> 01:01:40,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I can report that there were no symptoms, but again, out of an abundance of caution, we were following the guidelines that we received, and those staff members have already returned back to work.

699
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to announce that

700
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,631
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very busy and very focused on that.

701
01:01:48,212 --> 01:01:57,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a special machine called the Jenny O machine, believe it or not, which helps to sanitize and kill germs and bacteria.

702
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is being used.

703
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:04,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was leaving today, we are continuing to do that.

704
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: We also

705
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:13,630
[SPEAKER_04]: have requested outside cleaners, which we used over February vacation when we had the first deep cleaning that took place.

706
01:02:14,471 --> 01:02:23,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Our outside cleaners that we used are so booked, we cannot get them to come back again until at least the 18th of March.

707
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:33,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. John McLaughlin, who's our Director of Building and Grounds, is working very diligently trying to get on the roster to have them come back, but in the meantime,

708
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,262
[SPEAKER_04]: we are using the special cleaning agent to sanitize and disinfect the air.

709
01:02:40,582 --> 01:03:00,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are taking it very seriously and nurse Tony Ray is encouraging again that hand washing, making sure we're using soap and water, singing happy birthday twice, using those strategies that are being selected to help keep our community healthy and safe.

710
01:03:00,712 --> 01:03:14,761
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are any new developments to member McLaughlin's point, working collaboratively with city hall and the mayor, we will definitely send out a communication robocall, put it up on our website.

711
01:03:15,802 --> 01:03:25,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We're recommending that everyone goes to the city's website to get up to date notification about anything related to COVID-19.

712
01:03:26,149 --> 01:03:29,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did want to just share that information with the community.

713
01:03:31,092 --> 01:03:31,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

714
01:03:32,293 --> 01:03:51,560
[SPEAKER_04]: The libraries of Medford Public Schools are pleased to announce that they will be the first libraries in Massachusetts to host the Welcoming Library Traveling Book Exhibit funded by the Massachusetts Library System and created by imyourneighborbooks.org.

715
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:55,682
[SPEAKER_04]: The Welcoming Library Exhibit, also funded in part

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

775
01:10:43,936 --> 01:10:44,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

776
01:10:45,356 --> 01:10:48,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the update, Superintendent Edward-Vincent.

777
01:10:48,297 --> 01:10:58,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a couple of community members that asked questions, and I wanted to ask and clarify if we could for the community.

778
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,221
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I want to say thank you, especially

779
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:14,616
[SPEAKER_10]: to all of you, but also to Dr. Cushion for his work in keeping folks updated on social media and providing the frequently asked questions listing and to the mayor's office for doing that as well.

780
01:11:14,656 --> 01:11:21,624
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really important list that folks can access, especially around, I had some folks calling me about compromised and vulnerable populations and

781
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,869
[SPEAKER_10]: and our student population and what they should do.

782
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:27,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So they should definitely be going to the frequently asked questions on the website.

783
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:30,852
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's information there as well as provided by our nurse.

784
01:11:30,892 --> 01:11:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But regarding the cleaners coming, the outside cleaners coming in, I think there was correspondence that went out last week, right?

785
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:42,576
[SPEAKER_10]: that said that there was going to be a deep cleaning or a thorough cleaning over the weekend.

786
01:11:42,616 --> 01:11:55,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And can we just clarify for the community that that didn't happen and that it didn't happen because the, if the information I have is right, that it didn't happen because of the scarcity of the outside cleaners, but that it will be happening.

787
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:56,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

788
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:56,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

789
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:57,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

790
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:03,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

791
01:12:06,775 --> 01:12:09,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so the deep cleaning was not able to take place.

792
01:12:09,516 --> 01:12:16,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We will not be able to have the outside cleaners come until the 18th.

793
01:12:16,797 --> 01:12:18,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Their phones are ringing off of the hook.

794
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:32,001
[SPEAKER_04]: They did come and do a deep cleaning over sanitization over February break, and we actually do have some of that product, the Genio product, so we are using that as well.

795
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:39,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And if Mr. McLaughlin is able to step out to join us, he could give you some specifics on that.

796
01:12:39,829 --> 01:12:44,033
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were unable to secure the outside cleaner.

797
01:12:44,453 --> 01:12:48,718
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not be available to come back to Medford Public until the 18th of March.

798
01:12:49,218 --> 01:12:49,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

799
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted that for the clarification.

800
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:52,520
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

801
01:12:52,540 --> 01:13:04,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I was told that this agent, this cleaning agent might like folks might come into the school or to the classroom and still see, you know, say dust or what have you in the, in the, in the area because the deep cleaning didn't happen.

802
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:07,050
[SPEAKER_10]: But this agent is a misting agent that would sort of

803
01:13:07,438 --> 01:13:11,302
[SPEAKER_10]: go over the dust and still sanitize, if you would, I don't know, I guess the dust.

804
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly 100% correct.

805
01:13:13,984 --> 01:13:14,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mist.

806
01:13:14,805 --> 01:13:15,445
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes in.

807
01:13:16,026 --> 01:13:19,028
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a green chemical cleaner called Geneon.

808
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:23,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You mist it into the room.

809
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,413
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to wipe it.

810
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:27,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just does the job.

811
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills all of the bacteria.

812
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:30,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

813
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:33,602
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been using it in the other schools during the vacation breaks.

814
01:13:34,602 --> 01:13:40,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And just an update, we basically have about 95% of Method High School done right now.

815
01:13:40,828 --> 01:13:41,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Our guys have been on it.

816
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:46,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had all the custodians, they have spray bottles with it.

817
01:13:47,713 --> 01:14:01,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were instructed tonight when they were cleaning their areas in the schools to spray down everything on their way out of the, after they have completed their dusting and their trash pickup.

818
01:14:02,325 --> 01:14:06,109
[SPEAKER_02]: The contract cleaners are going to spray down at the McGlynn.

819
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:12,075
[SPEAKER_02]: They normally do wipe, disinfect doors and windows and such.

820
01:14:12,396 --> 01:14:14,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to take extra care in doing it.

821
01:14:14,938 --> 01:14:18,162
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem happening is the chemicals are running out everywhere.

822
01:14:20,384 --> 01:14:23,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Clorox 360 woman come in.

823
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,748
[SPEAKER_02]: She emailed me and says, hey, can I come in and talk?

824
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, why don't you come on in?

825
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And she says, well, I don't have anything back.

826
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:31,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's back ordered for two months ago.

827
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:32,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't need to talk to you then.

828
01:14:34,895 --> 01:14:37,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been dealing with it, and we're dealing with it good.

829
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:38,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some product.

830
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our products are green.

831
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:48,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of disinfectant in our utility closets that mix by themselves with water.

832
01:14:49,344 --> 01:14:50,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to keep at it.

833
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:55,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unfortunate that we were running out of time.

834
01:14:56,488 --> 01:15:01,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to get the word out, but I hadn't yet heard from the contractors.

835
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:05,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was running around Friday and Thursday night.

836
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was unfortunate that that information went out like that.

837
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:14,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say that we are 100% caught up on what we feel good about.

838
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And while we, well, thank you very much.

839
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:22,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And while you're here, can I just ask also that I'm assuming that there's soap in all the bathrooms?

840
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

841
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:27,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, we did an audit, 19 cases of soap.

842
01:15:27,594 --> 01:15:32,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 19 one-gallon jugs that go into the dispensers.

843
01:15:32,318 --> 01:15:35,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We just ordered 10 more cases, so we're good.

844
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:36,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

845
01:15:37,622 --> 01:15:37,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

846
01:15:37,962 --> 01:15:38,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot.

847
01:15:40,044 --> 01:15:43,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'd like to go back and talk about the coronavirus more.

848
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:59,710
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm particularly interested in is our proactive plans to talk about education if we were to have to close the schools for a week or two or whatever.

849
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:05,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at this point, I understand it's speculative, but I think planning would help.

850
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have all administrators tomorrow is an administrative professional development day for school leaders So they will be at central office tomorrow where we're going to be working all school leaders have been talked already creating documents of what would happen in the event that we would need to close what would

851
01:16:27,623 --> 01:16:47,192
[SPEAKER_04]: homework look like, and so tomorrow will be our first opportunity to be together to finish working on finalizing how we would be able to do homework packets, etc., for students in the event that we would need to close down a school or all schools.

852
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, I'd love to see homework packets put together, you know, and if possible, or even, you know, read with your child two times for 20 minutes every day or something while whatever break we're on.

853
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is, it's, depending on the level, high school uses Google Classroom, but the principals are working collaboratively and Ms.

854
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:11,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell

855
01:17:12,631 --> 01:17:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other concern I have, just with that, that goes hand in hand, is that some of our students are reliant on two meals a day through the public schools.

856
01:17:24,027 --> 01:17:28,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And at least, like I'm thinking at the high school level, we've got the pantry.

857
01:17:29,404 --> 01:17:32,367
[SPEAKER_06]: could those students be encouraged to take more?

858
01:17:32,987 --> 01:17:40,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the pantry needs more food, could you put a call out to the community so we can fill it up right now so that there's more food available?

859
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking about other things.

860
01:17:43,036 --> 01:17:47,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all of a sudden, you know, we have students who would be home and not accessing our food.

861
01:17:47,981 --> 01:17:51,464
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we make sure that we're being proactive and thinking about

862
01:17:51,863 --> 01:17:59,226
[SPEAKER_06]: supplying some food to families that might be in a particular vulnerable place.

863
01:18:00,246 --> 01:18:04,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, I'm glad to hear the administrators are getting together tomorrow.

864
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:04,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

865
01:18:05,228 --> 01:18:06,489
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could just respond as well.

866
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:18,333
[SPEAKER_14]: We sent out a message to all of our principals at the beginning of last week to inquire about what they would send home if, in fact, we had to call a day or a week off from school.

867
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:23,135
[SPEAKER_14]: and all of our principals have already responded to us with Google Classroom or Blizzard Bacs.

868
01:18:24,176 --> 01:18:41,871
[SPEAKER_14]: My concerns are not only the food for our students who might need it and the families, but for those children who don't have access to the internet, we need to make sure that our special education students, our EL students have access to Chromebooks and then of course if they have internet service, that's just another problem.

869
01:18:41,911 --> 01:18:45,934
[SPEAKER_14]: So as superintendent has said, we will be working on that tomorrow.

870
01:18:51,548 --> 01:19:04,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that we will do this, send home information so that we don't get to a Monday morning and all of a sudden cancel and the kids haven't received anything on Friday afternoon.

871
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:05,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, we'll work on that.

872
01:19:07,357 --> 01:19:08,678
[SPEAKER_02]: May I just add something to

873
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:15,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, you opened up a mobile food pantry out in front of City Hall.

874
01:19:15,937 --> 01:19:29,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We also just recently, in the last day or two, opened one up in front of the Columbus for the community outreach to help in case we did have to stall at Medford High School.

875
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:37,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, worst comes to worst, we could take what we had up there, I would go get it, and bring it to where it needed to be.

876
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:44,037
[SPEAKER_16]: And from a city side, we already did meet emergency management planning meeting last week.

877
01:19:44,057 --> 01:19:56,843
[SPEAKER_16]: We have our second one on Wednesday with Armstrong Ambulance, the school department, police chief, fire chief, DPW director to go over any and every issue.

878
01:19:56,923 --> 01:20:03,546
[SPEAKER_16]: We've sent out, we asked for organizational charts of every department to make sure we have contacts and backups.

879
01:20:04,056 --> 01:20:15,399
[SPEAKER_16]: We have cross-training city hall staff, so we are going to go through every school-related issue, city hall-related issue, city issue that could arise in hopes to make sure we're prepared.

880
01:20:15,599 --> 01:20:20,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I also have a metro mayor's meeting in the morning on Wednesday, and they're going to give us up-to-date information.

881
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:29,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Tony Ray and Marian O'Connor from the Board of Health worked with my chief of staff on the question and answer portion of last week's

882
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:43,418
[SPEAKER_16]: updates, that was any question and every question we found on social media that people had so that they worked for, I think, four or five hours, doing the best they could to make sure every question was answered accordingly.

883
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:50,981
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to continue to work and monitor the situation and be as prepared as we can if something is to happen.

884
01:20:52,862 --> 01:20:54,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau?

885
01:20:56,203 --> 01:20:57,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Member Graham, I'm sorry.

886
01:20:57,324 --> 01:20:58,104
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Member Ruseau.

887
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you go.

888
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:09,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like bring some clarity too, because as a student, like,

889
01:21:11,003 --> 01:21:21,713
[SPEAKER_18]: We use the internet a lot, so like if we were to miss school, it wouldn't be that much of like, if like, we wouldn't get behind that much, because even with school right now, we use the internet, like Google Classroom.

890
01:21:22,353 --> 01:21:36,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I use Google Classroom for like most of my classes, or like for psychology and physics, we have like our website, she has a website that she posts everything on anyways, or like in my economics class, she ends up emailing us everything anyways as well, so like,

891
01:21:37,307 --> 01:21:39,348
[SPEAKER_18]: even if we were to miss a couple of days of school.

892
01:21:39,808 --> 01:21:47,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that there's people out there that don't have access to internet or access to Chromebooks, but I feel like that could be something.

893
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:53,155
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that's special cases because that's not a great majority of our student population, I don't think.

894
01:21:57,096 --> 01:22:22,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just I'm like just to like give a little bit of a clarification on to like or insight into like thank you so we should cancel for a week member Graham it's like being a senior and wanting a snow day I suppose but so I have a couple of questions the first one actually really sort of dovetails nicely do we even know

895
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:27,150
[SPEAKER_09]: what our families do and don't have access to.

896
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:32,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think we speculate quite a bit about what they do and don't have access to, but I don't think we know.

897
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:45,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe there's a way to start to know so that we have some indication of what our reality really, really is.

898
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So we may find that people have more access than we think.

899
01:22:49,342 --> 01:22:50,423
[SPEAKER_09]: We may not find that.

900
01:22:51,678 --> 01:22:55,799
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's important to understand what does access mean?

901
01:22:55,879 --> 01:22:58,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a Chromebook or a laptop at home?

902
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have internet at home?

903
01:23:00,261 --> 01:23:01,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a smartphone?

904
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What are those access components that could become important as we go forward?

905
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:12,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think the other thing from an emergency preparedness perspective is,

906
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:17,533
[SPEAKER_09]: We have never deployed Chromebooks for individual use to my knowledge.

907
01:23:17,974 --> 01:23:24,722
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to assume that we don't have a deployment plan to sort of manage equipment like that.

908
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:33,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a whole other sort of work effort to think about technology deployment that we should be thinking about.

909
01:23:35,046 --> 01:23:50,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also curious whether the food security task force, I know it's forming, but if they're involved in your upcoming meetings to talk about the students who do rely on us for food and what deployment options there would be where we have to call off school.

910
01:23:51,409 --> 01:24:00,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally I saw an update from the commissioner of DESE today about guidance around makeup days that came through my email.

911
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:02,491
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is some guidance out there that talks about

912
01:24:03,325 --> 01:24:07,148
[SPEAKER_09]: The 180 days is still in play officially right now.

913
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:15,074
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some different levers in terms of if the day is after a certain time, then it sort of changes.

914
01:24:15,094 --> 01:24:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just saw that today, but I would definitely sort of caution against us thinking blizzard bags are the option, because I don't think they are.

915
01:24:27,283 --> 01:24:28,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that

916
01:24:29,221 --> 01:24:34,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm necessarily equipped to teach my Children the way that the educators in this community are doing that.

917
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:40,116
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that doesn't, you know, sort of make it easy to deal with something like that.

918
01:24:40,156 --> 01:24:42,960
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we have to carefully weigh those pros and cons of

919
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,483
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, just tossing homework at people and expecting that that can pass for learning.

920
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:52,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just to make sure that people stay sharp?

921
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:56,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just in cases where we're asking somebody to self quarantine?

922
01:24:57,207 --> 01:25:00,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what are all of those remote learning components?

923
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:11,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And when, as you build your plan, I'm just hoping that you guys will sort of think through all of those things and then tell the community what you're thinking about those things so that people have an understanding of,

924
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:14,270
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that we are thinking about this stuff.

925
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,730
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a plan.

926
01:25:16,771 --> 01:25:18,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what's not perfect about our plan.

927
01:25:19,011 --> 01:25:22,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And what have you just so that people understand?

928
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the situation seems like it changes every single day.

929
01:25:26,114 --> 01:25:27,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe more frequently than that.

930
01:25:28,315 --> 01:25:29,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's hard.

931
01:25:29,395 --> 01:25:31,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a moving target and I appreciate all the hard work.

932
01:25:32,536 --> 01:25:34,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just want to make sure that we.

933
01:25:34,955 --> 01:25:41,719
[SPEAKER_09]: have these other components of the plan flushed in so that we are really ready if we have to mobilize.

934
01:25:41,799 --> 01:25:43,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And it goes far beyond cleaning buildings.

935
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

936
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:44,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

937
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:45,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

938
01:25:48,223 --> 01:25:50,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to say thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

939
01:25:50,725 --> 01:25:56,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to ask Nurse Toni Ray and the city's doctor if you'd like to come forward.

940
01:25:58,329 --> 01:25:58,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

941
01:25:58,689 --> 01:26:00,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get back to my area.

942
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:00,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

943
01:26:09,107 --> 01:26:09,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

944
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:17,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know I gave an overview, but I'm so appreciative of you both being here.

945
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:25,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did not know if you just wanted to give a medical update to the school community and the listening audience.

946
01:26:28,513 --> 01:26:38,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say as part of the city task force, we are communicating on a very regular, almost daily basis, watching the CDC updates.

947
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:45,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And our plan is to implement any of the recommendations and updates into our practice as advised.

948
01:26:47,426 --> 01:26:47,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

949
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:48,186
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

950
01:26:48,747 --> 01:26:49,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

951
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:51,769
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I agree.

952
01:26:51,849 --> 01:26:53,770
[SPEAKER_20]: We're following the CDC guidelines.

953
01:26:55,822 --> 01:26:58,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Concerned with the Department of Public Health.

954
01:26:58,184 --> 01:26:59,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

955
01:26:59,686 --> 01:27:00,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

956
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:03,370
[SPEAKER_23]: My questions actually weren't specifically for them.

957
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:17,604
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to add, you know, we I'm concerned that we need to make sure that by the time we have our next meeting that anything that requires the school committee to take a vote to implement plans

958
01:27:19,381 --> 01:27:22,424
[SPEAKER_23]: that you prioritize anything where we need to be involved.

959
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:34,395
[SPEAKER_23]: If we close the schools for two weeks and pay the teachers for two weeks, and then we need to tack on two extra weeks of school, we have to pay the teachers for two weeks of school.

960
01:27:35,015 --> 01:27:36,877
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not budgeted for today.

961
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:42,582
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're not going to close the schools for two weeks and say, good luck, teachers, and not pay them.

962
01:27:42,662 --> 01:27:44,584
[SPEAKER_23]: That doesn't seem reasonable or rational.

963
01:27:45,146 --> 01:28:01,076
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we're going to run into situations where we have to close a school for two or three or four weeks, and ignoring the issue of the kids getting an education, just the financial impact of that is something that this committee needs to be involved in.

964
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:08,440
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to make sure that we need to front load those concerns so that we don't have to have emergency meetings

965
01:28:10,089 --> 01:28:10,869
[SPEAKER_23]: unnecessarily.

966
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:20,412
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to make sure that those, when you're looking at the plans and there's lots and lots of details, somebody needs to be paying very close attention to, does the school community need to vote on this?

967
01:28:21,072 --> 01:28:23,212
[SPEAKER_23]: And get that to us as soon as possible.

968
01:28:24,953 --> 01:28:32,435
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also was wondering if we've heard anything from our state or federal delegation about perhaps providing some money for this.

969
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:34,655
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I know there was like $8 billion to the CDC.

970
01:28:35,255 --> 01:28:37,376
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't heard a peep about money for anything else.

971
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:46,747
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I know some parents would like us to be doing a full-blown disinfectant of the entire building, all eight of our buildings every day, practically.

972
01:28:47,607 --> 01:28:50,430
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that would be millions of dollars after a couple of weeks.

973
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:55,814
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've heard nothing from anybody in any higher levels of government to provide us some money.

974
01:28:56,655 --> 01:29:00,738
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that that, I'm just wondering if there is anything.

975
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:03,060
[SPEAKER_23]: Mayor, have you heard anything from anybody?

976
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,803
[SPEAKER_16]: I have not heard from the state delegation, but I can reach out to them.

977
01:29:07,253 --> 01:29:12,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm assuming they're kind of preparing for this too, but they haven't released anything.

978
01:29:12,315 --> 01:29:12,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, thank you.

979
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:21,298
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the last thing I would like to say is I was listening to NPR or WBUR or whatever it was today, and I screamed in my car.

980
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:31,470
[SPEAKER_23]: not really, but I wanted to scream into my car, into the radio about everybody is talking about the inconvenience if we close our schools.

981
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:39,954
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just want to be clear, it's going to be an inconvenience to me because I'm going to have to wear headphones because my kids are going to be obnoxious about how bored they are.

982
01:29:40,555 --> 01:29:44,457
[SPEAKER_23]: But it is not an inconvenience to families who depend on going to work

983
01:29:45,197 --> 01:29:54,319
[SPEAKER_23]: at an hourly rate, and don't get insurance if they don't go, and don't have food if they don't go, and now they can't go because their kids don't have any place to be.

984
01:29:55,419 --> 01:29:57,300
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not about an inconvenience.

985
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:07,562
[SPEAKER_23]: And when people think about how we're weighing the importance of whether to close the schools or not, for me, in my house, whether the schools are closed is like a yawn.

986
01:30:09,249 --> 01:30:11,112
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not that big a deal for my family.

987
01:30:11,493 --> 01:30:16,682
[SPEAKER_23]: But there are a lot of families in our community where closing the schools will devastate them.

988
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:39,057
[SPEAKER_23]: for many months or even years financially and so we need to really be following only the guidelines coming out of CDC and the recommendations from the feds and whoever else is giving us those and not ever responding to how many emails we got about why we haven't closed the schools because

989
01:30:39,717 --> 01:30:45,761
[SPEAKER_23]: That should not be driving this, because the impact is so severe for so many people.

990
01:30:46,101 --> 01:30:49,684
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to hope that we can stop using the word inconvenience.

991
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:50,985
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be really appreciated.

992
01:30:51,005 --> 01:30:52,005
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

993
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:52,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

994
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:53,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

995
01:30:53,486 --> 01:30:54,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van de Kloot?

996
01:30:57,154 --> 01:31:16,744
[SPEAKER_06]: to something my colleague said that there would be our teachers and staff and whatever would continue on their regular pay scale as per contract whether we close or not that that would not affect our personnel in terms of being paid and it I'm not sure that's what you said but that's what it sounded like okay just want to be clear

997
01:31:24,355 --> 01:31:26,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau, point of clarification.

998
01:31:26,737 --> 01:31:37,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Certainly we would pay them during a closure, but because of the 180 day minimums, we may have to have school past our current end date, even after the contractual end date.

999
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:46,173
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we need them to work more days than we have a contract for, we're going to have to find the money to pay them because they're not going to just show up for free.

1000
01:31:46,853 --> 01:31:48,234
[SPEAKER_23]: We wouldn't want them to either.

1001
01:31:49,135 --> 01:31:50,096
[SPEAKER_23]: So that was my concern.

1002
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: The blessing is right now is that we have quite a number of days still left.

1003
01:31:55,864 --> 01:31:58,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So because of the light snow.

1004
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:02,608
[SPEAKER_06]: But saying that, I probably, there was a year, so I won't say anything.

1005
01:32:02,628 --> 01:32:04,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1006
01:32:10,373 --> 01:32:11,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1007
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:16,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, I wanted to thank our health professionals for all your support right now.

1008
01:32:16,487 --> 01:32:21,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is a crazy hectic time for you guys and appreciate that.

1009
01:32:21,588 --> 01:32:33,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to, the mayor's point on the Wednesday emergency preparedness meeting, we have a universal safety committee that's been working in our schools for the past two years and we meet monthly.

1010
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:37,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And we started meeting quarterly with the leadership teams as well.

1011
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:41,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are hosting a safety night on April 28th

1012
01:32:42,908 --> 01:32:47,889
[SPEAKER_10]: at the McGlynn Auditorium from six to eight, where we'll be talking about these very things.

1013
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,850
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you do in a man-made disaster, a natural disaster?

1014
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:54,231
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we do with our vulnerable populations?

1015
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:55,551
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we prepare in advance?

1016
01:32:56,371 --> 01:33:09,874
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's been in the works for the past couple of months, so folks should know that that's happening and that we are proactive about looking at safety for all our students and thinking about how we're thinking again about those most vulnerable populations

1017
01:33:10,578 --> 01:33:13,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciated your quick response on our medically fragile students.

1018
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:31,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And we hear all the time about this COV, whatever, coronavirus, COVID-19, about how it affects our most vulnerable populations more even than our typically healthy population.

1019
01:33:31,409 --> 01:33:33,851
[SPEAKER_10]: So really being aware and mindful of that is important.

1020
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:36,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciated your quick response on that, Ms.

1021
01:33:36,632 --> 01:33:36,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray.

1022
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:37,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1023
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:39,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1024
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:40,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz.

1025
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:42,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I wanted to say thank you Ms.

1026
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:50,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray and Dr. Sabe for being here and thank you for the frequently asked questions to the mayor's office and last Friday's bulletin.

1027
01:33:50,339 --> 01:34:00,329
[SPEAKER_11]: It was excellent and I found it so useful and some of my questions were answered and I really appreciate it and I know there's a lot of people out there that are, you know, just

1028
01:34:00,669 --> 01:34:02,950
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, concerned, anxious, worried.

1029
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:04,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Can they get it?

1030
01:34:04,911 --> 01:34:08,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's just there's a lot to think about every day.

1031
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:12,653
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting the reports and just it's updating all day long.

1032
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:13,934
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all we hear about.

1033
01:34:14,334 --> 01:34:15,994
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can be a little nerve wracking.

1034
01:34:16,094 --> 01:34:19,456
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really appreciate everything that everybody's doing to keep us updated.

1035
01:34:20,276 --> 01:34:25,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Also something that we want to think about is the methods of communicating if we have to cancel

1036
01:34:26,258 --> 01:34:41,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And if schools have to dismiss, I did hear of some schools that had to dismiss at the last minute because a parent had come into the school and was tested positive and they had to get in touch with everybody to send the students home.

1037
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:43,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think we've ever had to do that either.

1038
01:34:44,193 --> 01:34:48,797
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot to think about and consider in the planning stages.

1039
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:50,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate everything that everybody's doing.

1040
01:34:51,559 --> 01:34:53,721
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really a tremendous amount of work everybody's doing.

1041
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:54,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1042
01:34:54,871 --> 01:34:55,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1043
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:55,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1044
01:34:56,192 --> 01:34:56,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1045
01:34:56,812 --> 01:35:10,461
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here to answer questions Reports of superintendent number two recommendation to approve 2020 2021 Most member Kreatz

1046
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:36,640
[SPEAKER_11]: last couple of years we've been going back to school three days in August and this year we're not and I was just wondering if that's going to be the start of a new trend if we're gonna you know kind of we're not going to go back in August anymore or did that just happen with the calendar this year I wasn't sure so it's just I just happen to notice so I just thought I would ask.

1047
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:44,783
[SPEAKER_14]: It's it's really because Labor Day is so late this year in August but it's because Labor Day is late.

1048
01:35:45,263 --> 01:35:45,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1049
01:35:45,819 --> 01:35:46,439
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you.

1050
01:35:46,559 --> 01:35:46,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1051
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:48,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval by member Ms.

1052
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Stone, seconded by member Rousseau.

1053
01:35:50,441 --> 01:35:51,241
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1054
01:35:51,582 --> 01:35:51,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1055
01:35:51,962 --> 01:35:52,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1056
01:35:52,822 --> 01:35:59,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to approve cancellation of international trip to France, April 2020.

1057
01:35:59,745 --> 01:36:02,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli and Marie Nyland.

1058
01:36:05,728 --> 01:36:06,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So sad.

1059
01:36:06,188 --> 01:36:07,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

1060
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:07,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1061
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:13,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1062
01:36:15,649 --> 01:36:16,812
[SPEAKER_13]: We're here tonight.

1063
01:36:17,393 --> 01:36:23,548
[SPEAKER_13]: We wish we weren't here recommending the cancellation of the April 2020 vacation trip to France.

1064
01:36:26,676 --> 01:36:42,106
[SPEAKER_13]: So with the increased concerns of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, both here in the United States and internationally, and with the advice of government officials, school administration is recommending the cancellation of the high school April vacation trip to France.

1065
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:56,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Governor Baker has urged all schools to cancel upcoming organized trips and stated that, quote, while the risk of COVID-19 is low in Massachusetts, out of an abundance of caution, all schools have been advised to cancel

1066
01:36:56,954 --> 01:37:00,416
[SPEAKER_13]: all upcoming international travel for the foreseeable future.

1067
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:08,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Per district policy, all students participating in overnight travel and field trips must purchase travel insurance.

1068
01:37:08,681 --> 01:37:16,706
[SPEAKER_13]: The full travel insurance policy, including the CFAR option, which is the cancel for any reason option, is included in this report.

1069
01:37:17,506 --> 01:37:24,831
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand that this is a great disappointment among our 38 students, which includes 36 seniors, one junior, and one sophomore,

1070
01:37:25,385 --> 01:37:30,647
[SPEAKER_13]: and the six chaperones, but the safety and wellness of our Medford School community is our top priority.

1071
01:37:31,347 --> 01:37:38,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And I stand here beside the teacher who put an immense amount of work into this project.

1072
01:37:38,909 --> 01:37:40,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Marie Nyland is an outstanding teacher.

1073
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:44,611
[SPEAKER_13]: She has looked forward to this trip for the past four years.

1074
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,392
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been very emotional about this.

1075
01:37:48,712 --> 01:37:51,093
[SPEAKER_13]: She's very, very upset, as we all are.

1076
01:37:51,915 --> 01:37:55,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And she really had her heart set on this.

1077
01:37:55,517 --> 01:37:58,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know there's great disappointment amongst the students.

1078
01:37:58,779 --> 01:38:02,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we are following the recommendations of the governor.

1079
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:08,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is with great sadness that we make this recommendation to the committee.

1080
01:38:09,246 --> 01:38:09,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz?

1081
01:38:14,554 --> 01:38:15,375
[SPEAKER_11]: to all the students.

1082
01:38:15,495 --> 01:38:23,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean especially like 36 seniors and you know it's senior year and it's just so unfortunate with the coronavirus.

1083
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:27,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand it's very disappointing.

1084
01:38:27,641 --> 01:38:34,263
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, I'm torn because I just want to make sure that the students, their safety and well-being.

1085
01:38:34,343 --> 01:38:37,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a really tough situation.

1086
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:40,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really feel for you and all the students.

1087
01:38:40,705 --> 01:38:52,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that there's something that maybe another way or an event that we can do here to celebrate maybe not going to France, but just doing a nice cultural event here.

1088
01:38:53,413 --> 01:38:58,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it wouldn't really make it better, but just something that we could do here.

1089
01:38:59,014 --> 01:39:02,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to express how this is very sad.

1090
01:39:02,635 --> 01:39:05,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did hear from some parents, it's very disappointing.

1091
01:39:05,836 --> 01:39:06,816
[SPEAKER_11]: But they understand.

1092
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And they understand that it's a risk.

1093
01:39:09,896 --> 01:39:13,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And they don't want to kind of put their student, their child in that situation.

1094
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:15,758
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really tough.

1095
01:39:15,878 --> 01:39:18,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry that we have to do this.

1096
01:39:18,738 --> 01:39:21,019
[SPEAKER_24]: I understand.

1097
01:39:21,519 --> 01:39:22,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Member van de Kloot.

1098
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:28,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So did all of the students buy the cancel for any reason insurance?

1099
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:29,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, they did.

1100
01:39:29,953 --> 01:39:30,233
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1101
01:39:30,393 --> 01:39:35,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point in the time window, do I understand they'll only get 50% back?

1102
01:39:36,315 --> 01:39:36,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1103
01:39:36,956 --> 01:39:39,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've had no talks with the company to say whether that could be?

1104
01:39:40,544 --> 01:39:45,146
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I could just clarify, it's 50% of the tour cost.

1105
01:39:45,286 --> 01:39:47,187
[SPEAKER_13]: So that does not include airfare.

1106
01:39:47,787 --> 01:39:57,491
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now, the estimate that we have from the travel agent, the tour director, is a refund of $1,050, so $1,050.

1107
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:03,053
[SPEAKER_13]: The total cost that each family has put forth was $3,100.

1108
01:40:06,267 --> 01:40:12,349
[SPEAKER_13]: So the airfare, again, is not included in the CFAR policy, which is illustrated on this form.

1109
01:40:12,409 --> 01:40:13,410
[SPEAKER_13]: It is tour only.

1110
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:15,150
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're correct.

1111
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:23,213
[SPEAKER_13]: When we look at the days out, we're more than 31 days out, so it's 50% of the package price.

1112
01:40:24,874 --> 01:40:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So within that,

1113
01:40:28,095 --> 01:40:35,538
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the airfare, some airlines are allowing waves or will give credit for future trips.

1114
01:40:36,498 --> 01:40:38,259
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you planning on flying?

1115
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:39,519
[SPEAKER_24]: Delta.

1116
01:40:39,919 --> 01:40:46,582
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is, believe it or not, just came to my mind this evening as I'm sitting there, which is something we could look into.

1117
01:40:47,102 --> 01:40:49,563
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe the families can receive a voucher.

1118
01:40:50,183 --> 01:40:52,684
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would have to be through the tour company.

1119
01:40:53,704 --> 01:40:55,545
[SPEAKER_24]: But that is something I could, so they can get a voucher,

1120
01:40:56,095 --> 01:41:04,059
[SPEAKER_24]: for usually vouchers last six months, maybe sometimes up to 100, 364 days, something like that.

1121
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:08,861
[SPEAKER_24]: That is something we can look for that could be salvaged.

1122
01:41:08,881 --> 01:41:12,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that we could look into that, because it's quite a hit for a family.

1123
01:41:12,763 --> 01:41:16,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a disappointment for students, and I feel terrible about this.

1124
01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:22,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And so anything that we can at least get the most money back for the families.

1125
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,585
[SPEAKER_06]: thought or discussion of saying, could we do the trip during the summer instead?

1126
01:41:28,346 --> 01:41:28,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1127
01:41:29,327 --> 01:41:36,197
[SPEAKER_24]: That was an option we had, and he's given an option to all his schools that he had to cancel.

1128
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,462
[SPEAKER_24]: for at least the month of April, because that's usually when a lot of schools do their trips, is June-April vacation.

1129
01:41:43,002 --> 01:41:47,124
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, we're looking at, you know, the month of May, and we're going into June.

1130
01:41:47,224 --> 01:41:49,905
[SPEAKER_24]: Our seniors finish school on June 1st.

1131
01:41:50,565 --> 01:41:58,908
[SPEAKER_24]: And after they leave us, we basically don't have a lot of leverage with, you know, their behavior, let's be honest, in Europe.

1132
01:42:00,609 --> 01:42:03,430
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, during April vacation, you know, there's rules you have to follow.

1133
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,490
[SPEAKER_24]: They represent the school.

1134
01:42:04,946 --> 01:42:11,029
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was something the chaperones and the principal made it known on the first meeting when we had with the parents.

1135
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:16,632
[SPEAKER_24]: And then who, you know, my next question, who would want a chaperone after the summer?

1136
01:42:16,732 --> 01:42:21,495
[SPEAKER_24]: Like which, you know, staff wants to take their summer at 36?

1137
01:42:21,955 --> 01:42:31,841
[SPEAKER_24]: And of course, you know, another big blow is that these were seniors, because if they were, if there was five seniors and 34 juniors, we could have gone in September.

1138
01:42:32,401 --> 01:42:33,742
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, we could have gone in October.

1139
01:42:33,822 --> 01:42:39,624
[SPEAKER_24]: We could have, you know, have a one week approved where we're not in school, you know, beginning of September, if that was allowed.

1140
01:42:40,004 --> 01:42:42,185
[SPEAKER_24]: We would have done that, whatever it took for these students.

1141
01:42:42,685 --> 01:42:44,306
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've looked at all those options.

1142
01:42:44,486 --> 01:42:45,407
[SPEAKER_24]: I've looked at all those options.

1143
01:42:45,427 --> 01:43:00,173
[SPEAKER_24]: I've even looked at a week in May, you know, but there's AP, there's senior prom, there's, I was looking out day to day, you know, even myself, I have my son's senior prom, like, oh, I can't go, you know, my baby, my final,

1144
01:43:00,697 --> 01:43:01,978
[SPEAKER_24]: My little baby's graduating.

1145
01:43:01,998 --> 01:43:02,959
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to miss his prom.

1146
01:43:03,299 --> 01:43:09,504
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's my, you know, for myself and, uh, you know, and the six chaperones of five of us are teachers.

1147
01:43:10,163 --> 01:43:13,486
[SPEAKER_24]: And one is the Dr. Burnham was one of the chaperones.

1148
01:43:14,467 --> 01:43:17,369
[SPEAKER_24]: So what about taking the week off from school?

1149
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Who would substitute?

1150
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:22,353
[SPEAKER_24]: There's so many issues.

1151
01:43:22,873 --> 01:43:24,014
[SPEAKER_24]: There's so many issues.

1152
01:43:25,355 --> 01:43:32,241
[SPEAKER_24]: And for me, yes, I was, she said, Marie, take a calm this weekend.

1153
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:32,942
[SPEAKER_24]: No anxiety.

1154
01:43:33,022 --> 01:43:34,163
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I had to grade and all that.

1155
01:43:34,183 --> 01:43:35,824
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was like, I can't even deal with this.

1156
01:43:36,164 --> 01:43:38,986
[SPEAKER_24]: This has never happened in, I think, the history of Medford High.

1157
01:43:39,787 --> 01:43:45,026
[SPEAKER_24]: We're known to take a lot of trips, a lot of April trips, February, the whole world language department.

1158
01:43:45,353 --> 01:43:48,935
[SPEAKER_24]: We do February and April, February and April, every single year.

1159
01:43:50,175 --> 01:43:53,237
[SPEAKER_24]: So this never happened.

1160
01:43:54,397 --> 01:43:57,539
[SPEAKER_24]: But I want to look into the Delta.

1161
01:43:57,819 --> 01:44:00,460
[SPEAKER_24]: At least they can get a voucher for that.

1162
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:02,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all your work and effort.

1163
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:03,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can feel your pain.

1164
01:44:03,942 --> 01:44:10,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really appreciate your thoughtful answer and the fact that you had to make this tough decision.

1165
01:44:10,225 --> 01:44:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1166
01:44:15,311 --> 01:44:17,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, but you have to come up and speak on the record.

1167
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:23,222
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome to come up and speak on the record.

1168
01:44:30,896 --> 01:44:32,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Bob Green, live up the hills.

1169
01:44:33,318 --> 01:44:34,578
[SPEAKER_12]: 36 Ridgeway Road.

1170
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:37,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, a couple of things.

1171
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:40,843
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I'd like to thank Ms.

1172
01:44:40,883 --> 01:44:42,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Riccardelli and Ms.

1173
01:44:42,624 --> 01:44:43,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Nealon.

1174
01:44:43,885 --> 01:44:45,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Nealon, see I taught with Nealon.

1175
01:44:47,927 --> 01:44:51,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, for all the work and effort they put into this trip.

1176
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Now a couple of things.

1177
01:44:56,854 --> 01:45:06,979
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I have the travel insurance thing here, which doesn't say anything about the flight being excluded.

1178
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:22,285
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the things it does say, which has already been expressed, is the fact that it says cancellation charge from 60 to 31 days is 50% of the package price.

1179
01:45:23,046 --> 01:45:25,007
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was thinking the package price would be the $3,100.

1180
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,549
[SPEAKER_12]: which would be 1550, right?

1181
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I didn't like anyways.

1182
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:37,013
[SPEAKER_12]: But now it's down to 1050, because I guess the flight isn't included.

1183
01:45:37,053 --> 01:45:39,074
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see anything on here about a flight.

1184
01:45:40,635 --> 01:45:40,835
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1185
01:45:40,855 --> 01:45:43,957
[SPEAKER_13]: It just says land package.

1186
01:45:45,157 --> 01:45:47,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, air non-refundable.

1187
01:45:47,178 --> 01:45:48,299
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, I finally found it.

1188
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:48,659
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1189
01:45:49,299 --> 01:45:52,921
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so basically what's happening here is the following.

1190
01:45:54,402 --> 01:45:54,502
[SPEAKER_12]: For 3,100,

1191
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:57,860
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll get back $1,050.

1192
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1193
01:46:02,663 --> 01:46:04,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And my concern is this.

1194
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:11,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously, because of the safety of the children, you have to vote it down.

1195
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:11,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that.

1196
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:12,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with it.

1197
01:46:13,312 --> 01:46:15,133
[SPEAKER_12]: My whole thing is how can we get some money?

1198
01:46:17,055 --> 01:46:21,838
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if it was me myself, I'd call their bluff because

1199
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,741
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1200
01:46:25,201 --> 01:46:26,582
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm saying is this.

1201
01:46:27,482 --> 01:46:32,204
[SPEAKER_12]: When it comes to April, how do we know if there's even going to be flights going out there?

1202
01:46:33,265 --> 01:46:35,586
[SPEAKER_12]: As of today, there were 1,000 people infected.

1203
01:46:35,986 --> 01:46:36,726
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look it up.

1204
01:46:36,786 --> 01:46:37,827
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like 969, 1,000, OK?

1205
01:46:37,987 --> 01:46:39,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a mathematician.

1206
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:40,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I round.

1207
01:46:41,289 --> 01:46:43,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, 16 people dead.

1208
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:48,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll bet you within another month, unless something happens, it's going to get much worse.

1209
01:46:50,213 --> 01:46:51,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it does, OK?

1210
01:46:54,090 --> 01:47:02,452
[SPEAKER_12]: They're getting off easy, because thank God we're not going to send our children, because thank God one of them isn't over there and has to be quarantined.

1211
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:04,173
[SPEAKER_12]: What would they have done about this?

1212
01:47:04,453 --> 01:47:06,793
[SPEAKER_12]: We're saving them money by cancelling.

1213
01:47:08,934 --> 01:47:14,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, if two or three kids, they have to quarantine them, they have to make all these things, that's a cost.

1214
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,636
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a cost.

1215
01:47:17,156 --> 01:47:25,325
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so, therefore, what I'm trying to say is, all right, there's $1,050 from the insurance.

1216
01:47:27,568 --> 01:47:34,436
[SPEAKER_12]: The travel agency, okay, makes a nice penny out of this for nothing.

1217
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:43,692
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've got to look into somehow getting them to, you know, give back some of that money.

1218
01:47:43,992 --> 01:47:46,955
[SPEAKER_12]: They're making $2,050 a person.

1219
01:47:49,056 --> 01:47:49,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1220
01:47:50,417 --> 01:47:58,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And, as I said, obviously, you know, I wouldn't have let my—even if the trip were going, I wouldn't have let my daughter go.

1221
01:47:59,525 --> 01:47:59,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1222
01:48:00,065 --> 01:48:00,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't tell her.

1223
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:11,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, I mean, if things get worse, they would have had a much harder situation.

1224
01:48:11,478 --> 01:48:15,281
[SPEAKER_12]: This way, they're coming up with $2,000, not bad.

1225
01:48:15,481 --> 01:48:21,026
[SPEAKER_12]: 38 times 2, $76,000, plus the 50 I'm not even talking about.

1226
01:48:21,747 --> 01:48:27,853
[SPEAKER_12]: They're making that off of this trip and off of all of her hard work and your hard work.

1227
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:30,215
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be willing.

1228
01:48:31,388 --> 01:48:31,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1229
01:48:32,309 --> 01:48:40,933
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if there is some way that we can, you know, if the governor is saying, okay, can we, uh, you know, please not send these kids abroad.

1230
01:48:41,994 --> 01:48:42,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

1231
01:48:43,534 --> 01:48:43,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1232
01:48:44,675 --> 01:48:48,257
[SPEAKER_12]: The governor's office or something can put some pressure on these travel agencies.

1233
01:48:48,277 --> 01:48:52,339
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's, it's funny that we're doing this because my son came home today.

1234
01:48:52,379 --> 01:48:54,480
[SPEAKER_12]: He wants to go on a trip to Scotland next year.

1235
01:48:55,541 --> 01:48:55,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1236
01:48:56,943 --> 01:48:58,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And what am I going to say, no?

1237
01:48:59,285 --> 01:49:03,907
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, I don't want to lose another $2,000.

1238
01:49:04,708 --> 01:49:09,611
[SPEAKER_12]: In this case, of course, we'll know what's going on with this virus and everything like that.

1239
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:12,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably have a vaccine by then, things like that.

1240
01:49:14,053 --> 01:49:18,656
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only do I feel bad for you two, but I especially also feel bad for the kids.

1241
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:21,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I know my daughter is devastated by this.

1242
01:49:22,628 --> 01:49:23,348
[SPEAKER_12]: She really is.

1243
01:49:24,028 --> 01:49:25,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's her senior year.

1244
01:49:25,969 --> 01:49:28,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Other kids have gone on trips in their junior year or whatever.

1245
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:31,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll wait till the senior year to go to France.

1246
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:38,032
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and her girlfriends were all going, and they really, really feel bad about it.

1247
01:49:38,512 --> 01:49:41,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I have another idea, OK?

1248
01:49:43,559 --> 01:49:44,800
[SPEAKER_12]: $2,050, right?

1249
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,541
[SPEAKER_12]: The insurance is paying $1,050.

1250
01:49:46,641 --> 01:49:50,445
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, they're doing their part according to this.

1251
01:49:50,965 --> 01:49:52,767
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I didn't see the flight thing here.

1252
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:58,051
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, these are my eyeglasses for seeing far, so I didn't see the flight thing.

1253
01:49:58,652 --> 01:50:04,937
[SPEAKER_12]: But out of the $2,050, are they willing to give us some kind of credit or something?

1254
01:50:05,017 --> 01:50:10,082
[SPEAKER_12]: If they can't give us actual money, some kind of credit so these kids could get together,

1255
01:50:11,121 --> 01:50:14,164
[SPEAKER_12]: and, you know, basically take a trip.

1256
01:50:15,405 --> 01:50:21,330
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that other travel agencies are doing things like that, I've heard, okay?

1257
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:23,452
[SPEAKER_12]: But... Crew ships.

1258
01:50:23,852 --> 01:50:27,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that, you know, there's got to be something done.

1259
01:50:27,555 --> 01:50:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, as of today, they said, like, cruises, they're cancelling all kinds of cruises, they don't want people going on cruises.

1260
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:35,702
[SPEAKER_12]: By April, who knows?

1261
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:37,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully it'll all get better.

1262
01:50:38,669 --> 01:50:39,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1263
01:50:39,429 --> 01:50:40,890
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have to make a decision now.

1264
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:42,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

1265
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:53,132
[SPEAKER_12]: However, okay, if it gets worse, they're making blood money because, you know, they could never run that trip if it gets worse.

1266
01:50:53,553 --> 01:50:58,654
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping they'll listen to some reason, the actual travel agency, whatever.

1267
01:50:59,354 --> 01:51:00,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And once again, I thank you very much.

1268
01:51:01,874 --> 01:51:02,235
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1269
01:51:03,015 --> 01:51:04,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you're going to have to go home and wash your hands.

1270
01:51:04,995 --> 01:51:07,736
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1271
01:51:07,796 --> 01:51:08,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1272
01:51:09,807 --> 01:51:10,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

1273
01:51:14,628 --> 01:51:15,848
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1274
01:51:16,848 --> 01:51:27,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Understanding that the families are getting $1,000 back, I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the insurance costs 10% of the potential.

1275
01:51:27,351 --> 01:51:30,411
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, wow, we should just self-insure and forget about this in the future.

1276
01:51:31,591 --> 01:51:36,933
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, $100 to possibly get $1,000 back, I'll personally take that game.

1277
01:51:39,349 --> 01:51:44,975
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really kind of an insane, I mean, the reason we all probably thought it made so much sense is that it was, oh, it's $100.

1278
01:51:45,015 --> 01:51:46,036
[SPEAKER_23]: $100 doesn't sound so bad.

1279
01:51:46,056 --> 01:51:47,157
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm just a bit shocked at the

1280
01:51:53,772 --> 01:51:56,513
[SPEAKER_23]: cost of the insurance for what it is you can actually get back.

1281
01:51:57,034 --> 01:52:00,455
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't remember the name of the speaker here, but I mean.

1282
01:52:00,475 --> 01:52:02,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Green.

1283
01:52:02,136 --> 01:52:02,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Green.

1284
01:52:02,736 --> 01:52:06,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Green, if I could say, was a former math teacher at Medford High School.

1285
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:06,598
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh.

1286
01:52:06,818 --> 01:52:07,379
[SPEAKER_23]: And now a parent.

1287
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:07,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1288
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:18,204
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, to his point though, each student is covered for $100,000 worth of evacuation and repatriation services.

1289
01:52:18,877 --> 01:52:20,899
[SPEAKER_23]: if we decide to not cancel them, to send them.

1290
01:52:20,979 --> 01:52:27,444
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not suggesting we send them, but $100,000 of their money times, what is it, 28 people.

1291
01:52:28,384 --> 01:52:31,687
[SPEAKER_23]: That's some pretty bad math on their side.

1292
01:52:31,807 --> 01:52:39,473
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I mean, the thing is that I don't know, is there any other game in town?

1293
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:44,473
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, can we truly threaten them and be like, this is kind of ridiculous.

1294
01:52:45,614 --> 01:52:49,117
[SPEAKER_23]: Next year we're not going to use your services anymore if you can't do any better.

1295
01:52:49,137 --> 01:52:59,666
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I don't think there's any reason we shouldn't say that to them because I mean, if they're not the only game in town, this is not a great, this looks bad.

1296
01:53:00,726 --> 01:53:04,988
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not a great policy.

1297
01:53:05,408 --> 01:53:12,592
[SPEAKER_13]: What I will say is that there's been a lot of information going back and forth among superintendents in the state about this very issue.

1298
01:53:12,972 --> 01:53:14,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford is not alone.

1299
01:53:14,893 --> 01:53:19,816
[SPEAKER_13]: So lots of school districts around the Commonwealth are struggling with the reimbursement.

1300
01:53:20,456 --> 01:53:23,418
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of talk.

1301
01:53:23,438 --> 01:53:24,278
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of chatter.

1302
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:29,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully there's some movement on this, because there are large numbers of students that are affected by this.

1303
01:53:30,043 --> 01:53:32,184
[SPEAKER_13]: who are getting similar refunds.

1304
01:53:32,284 --> 01:53:38,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Some aren't getting any refunds at all, which is a worse situation that we have.

1305
01:53:38,626 --> 01:53:41,527
[SPEAKER_13]: So I like to think that there is going to be some movement on this.

1306
01:53:42,307 --> 01:53:46,068
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to fall within the window of getting that 50%.

1307
01:53:46,228 --> 01:53:56,371
[SPEAKER_13]: If we wait to less than 31 days out, then we're jeopardizing ourselves to a lower reimbursement.

1308
01:53:56,431 --> 01:53:57,492
[SPEAKER_13]: So we don't want to do that.

1309
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:00,706
[SPEAKER_13]: is planned for April 15th, I believe.

1310
01:54:01,346 --> 01:54:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, there are a few days, but we don't have a great amount of time.

1311
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:13,234
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, and it's worth noting that I discussed this particular policy with member

1312
01:54:14,565 --> 01:54:23,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember Graham earlier today, and I just noticed that the 60 to 31 day window, and a 20 to 15, and a 14, there's no 31 to 20 day window.

1313
01:54:23,455 --> 01:54:26,599
[SPEAKER_23]: The policy just doesn't exist if you cancel during that time.

1314
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,644
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a pretty bad, poorly written policy.

1315
01:54:32,646 --> 01:54:33,346
[SPEAKER_23]: I certainly agree.

1316
01:54:33,406 --> 01:54:33,707
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1317
01:54:34,107 --> 01:54:34,828
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know, you're right.

1318
01:54:34,848 --> 01:54:39,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Should we have looked at this way more carefully when we all started?

1319
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:39,953
100%.

1320
01:54:39,993 --> 01:54:44,217
[SPEAKER_24]: But something like this has never, ever happened.

1321
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:46,399
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've taken so many trips.

1322
01:54:46,499 --> 01:54:51,023
[SPEAKER_24]: I even used Educational Foundation, the EF.

1323
01:54:52,225 --> 01:54:53,706
[SPEAKER_24]: Like you said, there's so many other companies.

1324
01:54:54,045 --> 01:54:56,587
[SPEAKER_24]: And they have the same, believe it or not, the same policy.

1325
01:54:57,527 --> 01:55:03,131
[SPEAKER_24]: And we went with the company that offers the best service with the least money.

1326
01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:06,233
[SPEAKER_24]: I've traveled with them for Italy, and they were so fantastic.

1327
01:55:06,393 --> 01:55:10,576
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also went with EF, and the kids weren't getting as much for their money.

1328
01:55:10,836 --> 01:55:11,817
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's why I went with this.

1329
01:55:12,257 --> 01:55:13,258
[SPEAKER_24]: But you're right, you're right.

1330
01:55:13,478 --> 01:55:16,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Like for example, getting insurance for the airplane.

1331
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,201
[SPEAKER_24]: I do that when I travel.

1332
01:55:18,422 --> 01:55:24,005
[SPEAKER_24]: So right now I have a voucher that expires July 31st.

1333
01:55:25,186 --> 01:55:31,110
[SPEAKER_24]: So maybe, I'm gonna call, I'm gonna work on that in the next few days and call and see if Delta can just give them a voucher.

1334
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:33,632
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll not give the money back, you know they won't do that.

1335
01:55:33,732 --> 01:55:36,234
[SPEAKER_24]: But they'll give a voucher, so I'm gonna try for that.

1336
01:55:36,994 --> 01:55:37,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1337
01:55:37,595 --> 01:55:38,715
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just an idea.

1338
01:55:38,735 --> 01:55:52,707
[SPEAKER_13]: So going with what Mr. Green said about calling their bluff, and maybe what we could do is make the official cancellation date a few days from now.

1339
01:55:52,727 --> 01:55:54,188
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

1340
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:59,732
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing I was saying about calling a bluff was me, myself, I call a bluff.

1341
01:56:00,213 --> 01:56:03,475
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wouldn't send my kids over.

1342
01:56:03,495 --> 01:56:04,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I wouldn't send these kids.

1343
01:56:05,477 --> 01:56:06,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

1344
01:56:07,422 --> 01:56:15,166
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm really saying is, look it, all you have to do is, if we could call them up, okay, we got two issues here.

1345
01:56:16,087 --> 01:56:25,852
[SPEAKER_12]: The insurance, we got 1,000 out of, okay, it'd be nice if they give more, but maybe we could get more, I don't know, considering the circumstances, okay?

1346
01:56:26,252 --> 01:56:31,715
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, in a lot of these things, I'm leaving on Wednesday for California, okay?

1347
01:56:33,012 --> 01:56:35,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I could, I have two grandkids, I gotta see them.

1348
01:56:36,013 --> 01:56:37,013
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't seen them in eight months.

1349
01:56:37,773 --> 01:56:39,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going out.

1350
01:56:40,473 --> 01:56:42,814
[SPEAKER_12]: But I looked at the policy to see the cancellation.

1351
01:56:43,094 --> 01:56:45,714
[SPEAKER_12]: It actually says in there, no pandemics or epidemics.

1352
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:48,275
[SPEAKER_12]: It says it right in the policy.

1353
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:50,455
[SPEAKER_12]: All your regular airline things.

1354
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:53,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, getting away from that.

1355
01:56:55,016 --> 01:56:56,776
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 1,000 with the insurance.

1356
01:56:57,516 --> 01:56:58,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Delta, what's the flight, 1,000?

1357
01:57:01,987 --> 01:57:04,048
[SPEAKER_12]: $1,100, okay, so that's where the $1,100 comes from.

1358
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:11,169
[SPEAKER_12]: If we get a voucher for that, you know, some kind of voucher, that would help, okay?

1359
01:57:12,029 --> 01:57:12,629
[SPEAKER_12]: That would help.

1360
01:57:13,249 --> 01:57:14,730
[SPEAKER_12]: If we get a voucher, that would help.

1361
01:57:16,370 --> 01:57:17,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Ma'am, you can come.

1362
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:20,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to speak through the chair.

1363
01:57:22,371 --> 01:57:24,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. DeLeva, you've got to speak through the chair.

1364
01:57:26,152 --> 01:57:27,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to say something?

1365
01:57:28,653 --> 01:57:29,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to come up?

1366
01:57:31,857 --> 01:57:34,258
[SPEAKER_12]: The only other thing I said, then that leaves 900 left.

1367
01:57:34,278 --> 01:57:39,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to make 900, so the tour agency is going to make 900 a piece office?

1368
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:39,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1369
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how that works.

1370
01:57:41,601 --> 01:57:47,583
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we can maybe give our superintendent some authority to, through a vote, to try to work on these things.

1371
01:57:47,663 --> 01:57:49,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to vote to cancel, yes.

1372
01:57:49,224 --> 01:57:51,445
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with them 100%, OK?

1373
01:57:51,465 --> 01:57:53,626
[SPEAKER_12]: At least get the 1,050 back.

1374
01:57:53,686 --> 01:57:58,348
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think there could be a travel voucher in the future from Delta.

1375
01:57:58,368 --> 01:57:59,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Delta, yes.

1376
01:57:59,288 --> 01:58:01,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be reasonable, given

1377
01:58:02,349 --> 01:58:07,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's goodwill, goodwill helps in a time like this.

1378
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:15,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know a lot of people aren't going to want to lose $2,000 with their kids going to college.

1379
01:58:16,452 --> 01:58:18,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And those people have retirement things.

1380
01:58:18,512 --> 01:58:20,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Those went down today, too.

1381
01:58:20,613 --> 01:58:22,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do have a school attorney.

1382
01:58:23,734 --> 01:58:28,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's let the other members ask their questions, and we will give the superintendent the authority.

1383
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:29,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

1384
01:58:30,235 --> 01:58:30,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

1385
01:58:33,237 --> 01:58:34,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just had a couple of questions.

1386
01:58:34,598 --> 01:58:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: On the airfare topic, it's more complicated than just how you might buy a regular flight, because if you bought a regular flight on Delta, there's a $200 change fee.

1387
01:58:44,084 --> 01:58:46,685
[SPEAKER_09]: You can personally use that ticket going forward.

1388
01:58:47,146 --> 01:58:55,271
[SPEAKER_09]: But a lot of these tour companies go through a consolidation process, and it radically changes what your ticketed options are.

1389
01:58:56,632 --> 01:58:57,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be good.

1390
01:58:57,452 --> 01:58:58,493
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be bad for us.

1391
01:58:59,414 --> 01:59:10,562
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some digging under the covers that needs to happen with the tour operator to understand what those implications are because they may well be quite different than what the commercial airlines are saying.

1392
01:59:10,742 --> 01:59:22,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now what they're saying is if you buy a ticket right now, they'll be super flexible with you going forward because they want to take your money right now and not have sales come to a crashing halt.

1393
01:59:23,010 --> 01:59:25,912
[SPEAKER_09]: But they aren't allowing people to cancel

1394
01:59:26,556 --> 01:59:30,377
[SPEAKER_09]: trips right now and receive refunds on stuff that has been booked in advance.

1395
01:59:30,457 --> 01:59:35,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of nuance in that flight stuff that we would probably need to work out.

1396
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:39,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I found this policy incredibly confusing.

1397
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:44,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to work really hard to understand it.

1398
01:59:44,201 --> 01:59:56,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like for us also as a committee to revisit our field trip policy and talk about the kinds of information that has to go home to families so that everyone is really, really clear what the insurance means.

1399
01:59:56,769 --> 02:00:04,655
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, the report says that this insurance is required, and on the form it says that cancel for any reason is an option.

1400
02:00:04,895 --> 02:00:07,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it an option, or is it required?

1401
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:18,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that forms may be different, but I just want to make sure that the information that we're sending home to families proactively is clear, and it's clear that it's not clear, because there were questions tonight about that.

1402
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:39,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also, I do support the notion that we need to talk to the Attorney Greenspan and understand what those options are and really think about the best course of action for our families, who this is a lot of money to lose.

1403
02:00:41,325 --> 02:00:48,387
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot, you know, there's huge benefits to going through tour companies, but this is sort of one of the downfalls of going through tour companies.

1404
02:00:48,427 --> 02:00:50,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you just booked a hotel,

1405
02:00:50,854 --> 02:00:54,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Many, many times you can get out of it, especially this far in advance.

1406
02:00:54,457 --> 02:00:58,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But once you're inside a tour company's package, it's very, very hard to decouple.

1407
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:01,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we really need to have a lot of conversation with the tour company.

1408
02:01:02,944 --> 02:01:15,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to make a motion that we give the superintendent the authority to make this decision before the 31-day timeline, but only after she has a conversation with our attorney.

1409
02:01:16,556 --> 02:01:26,542
[SPEAKER_09]: He has ample time to get in touch with the travel company and explore how we recover more money for our families than just simply $1,000.

1410
02:01:29,864 --> 02:01:34,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1411
02:01:34,726 --> 02:01:35,507
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1412
02:01:35,527 --> 02:01:36,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1413
02:01:36,487 --> 02:01:36,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1414
02:01:36,887 --> 02:01:37,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1415
02:01:38,628 --> 02:01:39,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Mustone?

1416
02:01:40,269 --> 02:01:41,830
[SPEAKER_16]: She beat me to it.

1417
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:42,731
[SPEAKER_16]: She beat you to it.

1418
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:42,871
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1419
02:01:44,932 --> 02:01:48,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I guess everybody said everything that should be said.

1420
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:50,414
[SPEAKER_19]: But with all my coughing, I did want to get something out.

1421
02:01:52,455 --> 02:01:57,857
[SPEAKER_19]: As representative for the students and the families, I was going to make the recommendation that we use the attorney.

1422
02:01:57,877 --> 02:01:58,297
[SPEAKER_19]: But thank you.

1423
02:01:58,317 --> 02:02:00,938
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad that that's going to go forward.

1424
02:02:01,659 --> 02:02:02,159
[SPEAKER_19]: I do want to.

1425
02:02:03,427 --> 02:02:11,451
[SPEAKER_19]: To be clear, though, that we did present this fully to the committee, not this full committee, on June 3rd of last year.

1426
02:02:12,211 --> 02:02:16,393
[SPEAKER_19]: And the insurance policy was part of that presentation as well.

1427
02:02:16,453 --> 02:02:17,293
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was.

1428
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:28,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Whether we were all looking at the fine-tuned comb or one of the things that we push for with the policy is that there is insurance before we approve any trip that's there.

1429
02:02:28,718 --> 02:02:32,260
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just want to make that clear that, you know,

1430
02:02:33,351 --> 02:02:34,514
[SPEAKER_19]: June 3rd this was approved.

1431
02:02:34,714 --> 02:02:36,157
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that documentation.

1432
02:02:37,159 --> 02:02:37,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1433
02:02:42,571 --> 02:02:43,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just.

1434
02:02:47,003 --> 02:02:50,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to first thank you ladies for your presentation this evening.

1435
02:02:51,567 --> 02:02:57,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And I too as a senior got to go to Paris in April.

1436
02:02:57,732 --> 02:03:05,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember being so excited at the Parent Information Center meeting that had happened sometime last year.

1437
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:07,360
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time it's

1438
02:03:09,281 --> 02:03:24,965
[SPEAKER_04]: very unsettling to see how the illness is spreading at such rapid rates, especially right now in Italy and in different parts of Europe, that we do have to operate on the side of caution to keep everyone safe.

1439
02:03:25,366 --> 02:03:30,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I can assure you, not only with what the motion that did go forward,

1440
02:03:31,127 --> 02:03:52,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are going to do our due diligence and Assistant Superintendent Dr. Cushing talked about also wanting to notify our delegation to see if they can put forward some legislation to find ways to get greater compensation for families because it's not only Medford, it's the entire state.

1441
02:03:53,791 --> 02:04:04,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, where Dr. Riccadeli made reference to the Super's listserv to see all of the districts with all of the European countries that students were going to travel to next month.

1442
02:04:05,358 --> 02:04:09,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they're all, almost all of them have been canceled.

1443
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:17,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with the recommendation of the governor that we can't ensure what could happen once you get there.

1444
02:04:18,885 --> 02:04:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can just assure everyone that we're gonna do our best to try to get more

1445
02:04:23,507 --> 02:04:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: back for our students, and we will take up that conversation, that battle with Delta as well.

1446
02:04:31,112 --> 02:04:42,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully if the delegation can support that movement, that it won't only be Medford as a beneficiary, but our surrounding communities that are all in the same exact situation.

1447
02:04:42,218 --> 02:04:44,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1448
02:04:44,999 --> 02:04:45,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

1449
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,240
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1450
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,661
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to not

1451
02:04:48,433 --> 02:05:07,304
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't need to stand up here for this, but I just wanted to really point out that this doesn't impact all families equally, and that if we had a no-fee school system where what we considered part of our education was actually covered by the taxpayers, that this whole situation would be a very different situation.

1452
02:05:07,704 --> 02:05:12,987
[SPEAKER_23]: We would all be mourning the loss of the experience, and that would be the end of the conversation.

1453
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:23,068
[SPEAKER_23]: Instead, we are in a situation where some families are probably very unhappy to have lost a couple thousand dollars.

1454
02:05:23,589 --> 02:05:32,477
[SPEAKER_23]: Other families may well have worked an extra job, given up weekends for a year to find this money.

1455
02:05:32,597 --> 02:05:34,779
[SPEAKER_23]: So it is not impacting all families equally.

1456
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:37,501
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it's important to really call that out.

1457
02:05:38,102 --> 02:05:40,244
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm assuming that not everybody that is going

1458
02:05:42,782 --> 02:05:44,364
[SPEAKER_23]: has a $300,000 household income.

1459
02:05:45,165 --> 02:05:50,330
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not saying if you do, this is no big deal either.

1460
02:05:52,015 --> 02:05:57,818
[SPEAKER_23]: I just think it's important to note we make a lot of stuff that we consider part of our education fall into families.

1461
02:05:58,299 --> 02:06:04,682
[SPEAKER_23]: And when stuff like this happens, it is even more, it's like pouring salt into the wound of some families.

1462
02:06:04,762 --> 02:06:13,627
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to be clear that I don't, that families that this is really hurting from a financial perspective, that you are not unseen.

1463
02:06:13,647 --> 02:06:15,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1464
02:06:15,588 --> 02:06:16,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1465
02:06:17,862 --> 02:06:19,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to offer my condolences.

1466
02:06:19,783 --> 02:06:20,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1467
02:06:20,463 --> 02:06:29,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what a drag that is and that real first taste of disappointment that you get as a young person is so palpable.

1468
02:06:30,008 --> 02:06:31,369
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really sad.

1469
02:06:31,409 --> 02:06:32,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for that.

1470
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:42,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to ask from your perspective and from the superintendent's perspective whether a letter from the school committee also expressing

1471
02:06:43,995 --> 02:07:00,659
[SPEAKER_10]: our disappointment in both the travel policy and the airline, and also how this is affecting our students, and also the cost benefit that we're saving, really, included in that letter, whether that might be helpful.

1472
02:07:01,132 --> 02:07:01,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

1473
02:07:01,832 --> 02:07:03,873
[SPEAKER_24]: As a matter of fact, that would be absolutely fantastic.

1474
02:07:03,913 --> 02:07:04,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for bringing that up.

1475
02:07:06,194 --> 02:07:06,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1476
02:07:07,414 --> 02:07:07,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1477
02:07:08,294 --> 02:07:17,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I make a motion that we provide a letter from the school committee as well, supporting any remuneration we can get from these agencies.

1478
02:07:17,097 --> 02:07:23,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that the superintendent is going to be charged with that, but I think also having a collective voice from the school committee and letting folks know.

1479
02:07:23,059 --> 02:07:29,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I wonder if there's an opportunity, I know that folks said that the superintendents across the state, Dr. Riccadeli, you were saying.

1480
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:49,864
[SPEAKER_10]: are talking about it, so maybe there's an opportunity to also address the Mass Association of School Superintendents and ask if they would collectively be willing to write a letter to, you know, as a whole, either to Governor Baker or to the travel agencies so that we're supporting each other in this movement, because it is a lot of money.

1481
02:07:50,605 --> 02:07:52,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it really is.

1482
02:07:52,426 --> 02:07:54,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we call the roll, President McGilvrey?

1483
02:07:57,861 --> 02:07:59,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Harry McGilvey, 4 Piedmont Road.

1484
02:08:00,082 --> 02:08:02,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the middle of my shift, but I came up because I heard what was going on.

1485
02:08:04,304 --> 02:08:08,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, my family's going to be out upwards of $2,000 because of this.

1486
02:08:09,226 --> 02:08:14,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect the selected body to make sure that this never happens again to any family in this city.

1487
02:08:15,128 --> 02:08:15,808
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money.

1488
02:08:16,549 --> 02:08:18,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one in college and I have one going to college.

1489
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:24,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Being out $2,000, I'm not happy and I don't think this is acceptable.

1490
02:08:26,053 --> 02:08:26,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what's going on.

1491
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:37,088
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the governor of Massachusetts is ordering people to cancel these trips, I think that the attorney general's office should step in and do something.

1492
02:08:38,289 --> 02:08:41,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Green said that company's making $72,000 on this.

1493
02:08:42,209 --> 02:08:43,270
[SPEAKER_01]: That's outrageous.

1494
02:08:43,530 --> 02:08:52,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And I expect this body, going forward, to not do business with that company and to think about this a little bit more carefully going forward.

1495
02:08:52,432 --> 02:08:55,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's not acceptable, losing that kind of money.

1496
02:08:55,613 --> 02:08:55,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1497
02:08:56,353 --> 02:08:56,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1498
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:08,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So I made a motion to write a letter from the school committee to the travel agency, to Delta Airlines, and to others.

1499
02:09:08,704 --> 02:09:09,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Before we take the motion.

1500
02:09:10,405 --> 02:09:13,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, my name's Carla, 6 Benjamin Circle.

1501
02:09:14,127 --> 02:09:24,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to say that on behalf of a lot of my friends that are going on this trip, myself included, I had to pick up a lot more shifts at my old job.

1502
02:09:24,812 --> 02:09:27,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I had two jobs, actually, for a little while.

1503
02:09:28,513 --> 02:09:40,601
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's just very frustrating and upsetting to see that thousands of dollars, I know I split it with my parents, but some of my friends, their parents can't even afford it.

1504
02:09:40,801 --> 02:09:44,704
[SPEAKER_22]: So they themselves have been raising this money for over a year.

1505
02:09:45,445 --> 02:09:48,987
[SPEAKER_22]: We have all been waiting since our sophomore year, that's two years ago for this trip.

1506
02:09:49,542 --> 02:09:50,403
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been with Ms.

1507
02:09:50,443 --> 02:10:17,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Nyland the whole way, we've been helping her, and I just think it's important to stress to, like what Mrs. Father was saying, if Governor Charlie Baker is suggesting to cancel these things, I think we have the right to put pressure on them to somehow help us get this money back and put pressure on the

1508
02:10:17,967 --> 02:10:20,628
[SPEAKER_22]: the industry that is taking the money from us.

1509
02:10:20,708 --> 02:10:25,068
[SPEAKER_22]: These corporations do not care that they're hurting families like ours.

1510
02:10:25,369 --> 02:10:29,009
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a public school, not some rich charter private school.

1511
02:10:29,509 --> 02:10:36,471
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's important to stress that a lot of this money is from the students themselves, not even just the parents, but the parents included too.

1512
02:10:37,171 --> 02:10:38,011
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1513
02:10:38,291 --> 02:10:38,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1514
02:10:38,671 --> 02:10:45,133
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to vote another motion.

1515
02:10:45,213 --> 02:10:46,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to amend it.

1516
02:10:46,914 --> 02:10:48,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, motion to amend?

1517
02:10:48,916 --> 02:10:56,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to amend the motion to offer students the opportunity to co-sign on to the letter if they want, if you would be willing to facilitate that.

1518
02:10:56,964 --> 02:11:00,528
[SPEAKER_10]: If we got you a copy of the letter and we wanted to have a signature page for the students or their families.

1519
02:11:01,347 --> 02:11:05,070
[SPEAKER_10]: welcome that, and then we can, and I'm happy to, you know, facilitate.

1520
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:07,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to give you or anybody else extra work.

1521
02:11:07,532 --> 02:11:10,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to type up a letter and pass it along, whatever, if it's helpful.

1522
02:11:11,055 --> 02:11:12,657
[SPEAKER_10]: But, and collecting students.

1523
02:11:12,677 --> 02:11:24,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll make the motion to have a letter from the school committee that can also be signed by students and their families to the governor, to the airlines, and to the travel agency to try to get money back.

1524
02:11:25,107 --> 02:11:27,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by Member McLaughlin.

1525
02:11:27,785 --> 02:11:30,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Member Van der Kloot, amended by Member McLaughlin.

1526
02:11:30,406 --> 02:11:31,106
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1527
02:11:31,686 --> 02:11:32,466
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1528
02:11:32,486 --> 02:11:34,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to speak?

1529
02:11:34,767 --> 02:11:35,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham?

1530
02:11:36,647 --> 02:11:37,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1531
02:11:39,367 --> 02:11:49,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to make a motion that we send our field trip protocols back to the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee.

1532
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:55,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally hear your point about we all weren't looking at this fine print and there is

1533
02:11:56,198 --> 02:11:59,499
[SPEAKER_09]: a big difference between having insurance and having good insurance.

1534
02:11:59,579 --> 02:12:01,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like we're sort of caught in that trap right now.

1535
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not an insurance expert.

1536
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,441
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not an insurance expert.

1537
02:12:08,241 --> 02:12:22,865
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we have to do something to make sure we have the right guardrails in place so that an actual insurance expert can help us weigh the pros and cons, or frankly, make decisions to self-insure in these cases, which is another insurance option.

1538
02:12:23,544 --> 02:12:30,146
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, more complicated, it's a different thing altogether, but I think we really have to sort of investigate all of those options.

1539
02:12:30,186 --> 02:12:41,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to send this to the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee so that they can take a look at it and come up with some solutions to be productive about this going forward.

1540
02:12:41,889 --> 02:12:47,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1541
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:48,330
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1542
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:48,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1543
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:49,670
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1544
02:12:49,710 --> 02:12:50,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1545
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:51,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1546
02:12:55,751 --> 02:12:59,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to approve no school choice district 2020.

1547
02:13:00,892 --> 02:13:05,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by member Mustone.

1548
02:13:08,233 --> 02:13:09,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call has been requested.

1549
02:13:11,734 --> 02:13:11,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1550
02:13:13,354 --> 02:13:19,055
Yes.

1551
02:13:19,855 --> 02:13:20,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1552
02:13:20,555 --> 02:13:22,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1553
02:13:22,316 --> 02:13:23,096
[SPEAKER_16]: The paper passes.

1554
02:13:23,925 --> 02:13:27,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on Student Opportunity Act, Dr. Peter Cushing.

1555
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:31,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1556
02:13:31,471 --> 02:13:36,755
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm here today to present on the Student Opportunity Act and its implications for Medford Public Schools.

1557
02:13:37,256 --> 02:13:45,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving forward, if you'll remember, the Student Opportunity Act provides $1.5 billion to schools and districts across the Commonwealth.

1558
02:13:46,823 --> 02:14:00,468
[SPEAKER_21]: in order to right the inequities and to close achievement gaps for those students that history has shown the achievement gaps are being closed in isolated areas.

1559
02:14:00,488 --> 02:14:05,250
[SPEAKER_21]: 37 of the state's districts will be receiving 85% of the funds.

1560
02:14:07,131 --> 02:14:11,872
[SPEAKER_21]: And so the information was released by the commissioner

1561
02:14:13,613 --> 02:14:19,635
[SPEAKER_21]: February 18th was the webinar and the plans are due April 1st.

1562
02:14:20,315 --> 02:14:21,116
[SPEAKER_21]: We are receiving $138,660.

1563
02:14:21,156 --> 02:14:24,257
[SPEAKER_21]: As part of my verbal report, I prepared for you just a quick comparison earlier this year.

1564
02:14:33,961 --> 02:14:38,023
[SPEAKER_21]: We all presented on the MCAS data and there were certain districts that we compared to.

1565
02:14:38,043 --> 02:14:44,328
[SPEAKER_21]: I went back to that report and we are receiving the minimum per student at $30 per student.

1566
02:14:47,005 --> 02:14:49,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Everett is receiving $768 per student for a total of $5.8 million.

1567
02:14:49,646 --> 02:14:51,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Malden is receiving $298 per student for a total of $2.1 million.

1568
02:14:52,006 --> 02:14:54,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Melrose, $262 for a total of $1 million.

1569
02:14:54,307 --> 02:14:55,927
[SPEAKER_21]: Reading, $30 for a total of $119,250.

1570
02:14:56,267 --> 02:14:58,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Revere, $1,305 per student for a total of $10.4 million.

1571
02:15:14,412 --> 02:15:17,553
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm averaging these at the millions just so you know.

1572
02:15:18,133 --> 02:15:19,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Saugus is receiving $153 per student for $427,388.

1573
02:15:19,693 --> 02:15:20,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Somerville $30, $158,520.

1574
02:15:20,234 --> 02:15:20,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Wakefield $37 for $129,249.

1575
02:15:33,911 --> 02:15:35,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Watertown, $55 for a total of $147,516.

1576
02:15:35,172 --> 02:15:35,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Wilmington, $30, $96,600.

1577
02:15:35,952 --> 02:15:36,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Winchester, $86 for $400,375.

1578
02:15:36,632 --> 02:15:37,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Winchester was $86 per student, and it's $401,575.

1579
02:15:37,653 --> 02:15:38,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, my blurries.

1580
02:15:58,012 --> 02:16:01,673
[SPEAKER_21]: And Woburn is $54 per student for $241,675.

1581
02:16:03,474 --> 02:16:12,577
[SPEAKER_21]: While I have a doctorate in educational leadership, I do not have a doctorate in advanced mathematics to explain to you the formula on the calculations.

1582
02:16:14,297 --> 02:16:14,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Know this, though.

1583
02:16:16,538 --> 02:16:18,339
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a great need, obviously.

1584
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:26,131
[SPEAKER_21]: There are districts across the state, Brockton, my hometown of Lynn, respectively, getting $100 million and $30 million.

1585
02:16:26,692 --> 02:16:29,297
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there is tremendous need for those 37 districts.

1586
02:16:31,782 --> 02:16:35,023
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do have work to do in the next several weeks.

1587
02:16:36,824 --> 02:16:38,945
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to submit our plan by April 1st.

1588
02:16:39,185 --> 02:16:51,370
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to be putting out a survey to families for them to rank order some of their choices based on, if you look at the next page, they're looking for evidence-based programs.

1589
02:16:51,550 --> 02:16:54,172
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not good enough anymore just to have research-based programs.

1590
02:16:54,212 --> 02:16:59,454
[SPEAKER_21]: What they want is programs that have been researched but then have success that's evidenced.

1591
02:17:00,374 --> 02:17:09,218
[SPEAKER_21]: And so these are the four main areas, enhanced core instruction, targeted student supports, talent development, and conditions for student success.

1592
02:17:10,118 --> 02:17:17,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Interestingly, targeted student supports doesn't have any of the bolded areas, the commissioner's hot button issues.

1593
02:17:18,562 --> 02:17:24,685
[SPEAKER_21]: It's numbers one through three and then number 10 that are the areas that they're saying are priority.

1594
02:17:25,725 --> 02:17:29,068
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the short form packet that we would be expected to fill out.

1595
02:17:29,628 --> 02:17:37,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Districts who receive under $1.5 million will only have to fill out a two-page succinct.

1596
02:17:38,254 --> 02:17:41,556
[SPEAKER_21]: The plan should not be a comprehensive strategic plan.

1597
02:17:42,497 --> 02:17:53,684
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not looking for that, but we do have to open it up for public involvement and for the public to be involved in the development of this plan, even though we're receiving the minimum

1598
02:17:55,445 --> 02:17:57,426
[SPEAKER_21]: the minimum of the $30 per student.

1599
02:17:58,026 --> 02:18:18,093
[SPEAKER_21]: The key areas, also just so that you're well aware, the four key commitments that were mentioned in the webinar that they want to really focus on is intentionally focusing on student subgroups, adopt, deepen, or continue specific evidence-based programs that you might be doing.

1600
02:18:19,313 --> 02:18:24,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And so our conversations have actually been around that thus far in the infancy.

1601
02:18:24,753 --> 02:18:29,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Monitor, I'm good, but thank you.

1602
02:18:29,594 --> 02:18:36,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Monitor success in reducing disparities in the achievement of student subgroups.

1603
02:18:37,557 --> 02:18:41,698
[SPEAKER_21]: And then engaging families, particularly those families representing our subgroups.

1604
02:18:43,159 --> 02:18:47,560
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're looking for high quality implementation as part of this.

1605
02:18:48,753 --> 02:18:52,938
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are the, and to focus on doing a few things well.

1606
02:18:53,338 --> 02:18:57,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Not trying to do this huge plan, but to focus on doing a few things well.

1607
02:18:58,043 --> 02:18:58,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Once again,

1608
02:18:59,929 --> 02:19:02,470
[SPEAKER_21]: where our total amount is $138,660.

1609
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:07,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes I've been saying $137,000, but it's $138,660.

1610
02:19:08,613 --> 02:19:11,775
[SPEAKER_21]: All of this is available at a web link.

1611
02:19:11,915 --> 02:19:16,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Every single district in the state's numbers are available at a web link.

1612
02:19:16,677 --> 02:19:28,363
[SPEAKER_21]: If you search Student Opportunity Act at the DESE website, they have a web page dedicated to it with the two webinars for the short form and the long form and all of the financials that I mentioned.

1613
02:19:30,026 --> 02:19:30,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1614
02:19:30,626 --> 02:19:31,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

1615
02:19:33,607 --> 02:19:34,387
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of things.

1616
02:19:35,347 --> 02:19:41,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's also important to note that our charter school bill will increase by about a half a million dollars next year as well.

1617
02:19:41,609 --> 02:19:48,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So $138,000 isn't going to go really very far in the big scheme of things.

1618
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:56,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know Mayor Lungo-Koehn what information you've received from our state delegation because one of the central things that I think

1619
02:19:57,082 --> 02:20:06,753
[SPEAKER_09]: does stand to impact Medford is one of the final measures, which was funded at only 4% of the seven year phase in instead of 14.

1620
02:20:06,913 --> 02:20:17,905
[SPEAKER_09]: So every other measure was funded at 14%, which includes special education, English language learners and health care costs, but support for support for

1621
02:20:20,164 --> 02:20:26,688
[SPEAKER_09]: High needs students was only funded in the governor's budget at 4% in year one.

1622
02:20:27,228 --> 02:20:32,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a drastic shift down from how the rest of the equation is funded.

1623
02:20:33,291 --> 02:20:37,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it's why towns like Winchester stand to make more money than we do.

1624
02:20:38,274 --> 02:21:03,904
[SPEAKER_09]: In all of this But I would like to know from the state delegation what they're doing to Affect change in the Ways and Means Committee process as they put their budgets together and how we can help and then Finally I make a motion that this report be sent to the

1625
02:21:05,133 --> 02:21:21,884
[SPEAKER_09]: engagement, communication, and strategic planning subcommittee for further work in support of the submission, and as importantly, the requirements around having a plan for engaging families across the district, which is critically important.

1626
02:21:23,785 --> 02:21:27,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

1627
02:21:27,507 --> 02:21:28,368
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1628
02:21:30,409 --> 02:21:32,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And they asked to take motions one at a time.

1629
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:36,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a question on this before you vote on it?

1630
02:21:38,013 --> 02:21:38,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1631
02:21:38,473 --> 02:21:39,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1632
02:21:41,255 --> 02:21:49,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So moving this to the subcommittee for engagement, we know that this, it's March 9th.

1633
02:21:51,204 --> 02:21:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: This is April 1.

1634
02:21:53,345 --> 02:21:59,671
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a timeline of getting our, whatever family and community engagement we're able to

1635
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:09,919
[SPEAKER_10]: achieve between March 9th and our next school committee meeting to have this budget, I mean, to have this report approved before it's sent to DESE, right?

1636
02:22:10,019 --> 02:22:11,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, what are those school days?

1637
02:22:14,002 --> 02:22:15,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's that?

1638
02:22:15,243 --> 02:22:16,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next meeting is the 23rd.

1639
02:22:16,525 --> 02:22:17,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what are the school days?

1640
02:22:17,606 --> 02:22:26,814
[SPEAKER_10]: So from the net, from... So we have 10 days to engage the, to meaningfully engage the community with our stakeholder

1641
02:22:27,554 --> 02:22:30,458
[SPEAKER_10]: groups that are our most high need stakeholder groups.

1642
02:22:30,478 --> 02:22:37,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So our English learners, our individual families of children with disabilities, and our economically disadvantaged students.

1643
02:22:38,669 --> 02:22:44,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just asking, do people really think that that's meaningful engagement for those stakeholder groups?

1644
02:22:45,345 --> 02:22:48,067
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to make it as meaningful as we possibly can.

1645
02:22:48,607 --> 02:22:54,010
[SPEAKER_21]: We have been, first of all, the guidance coming out of the state was delayed.

1646
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:55,671
[SPEAKER_21]: The Mass.

1647
02:22:55,691 --> 02:22:59,514
[SPEAKER_21]: Association of School Superintendents even said it was supposed to be on this day and it'll be out.

1648
02:23:00,174 --> 02:23:02,976
[SPEAKER_21]: It was only a few days later, but then the webinars and various things.

1649
02:23:03,977 --> 02:23:09,200
[SPEAKER_21]: And given where February vacation was, the last school committee meeting,

1650
02:23:10,084 --> 02:23:13,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Essentially, there was six weeks to begin with, if that.

1651
02:23:13,949 --> 02:23:20,016
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do want to make sure that we are focusing on that family engagement piece.

1652
02:23:20,749 --> 02:23:39,863
[SPEAKER_21]: I think getting the survey out tomorrow, Wednesday morning at the latest will go a long way to providing families an opportunity to engage in that manner, and then also reaching out to specific stakeholders through the various organizations that there are will help us build that.

1653
02:23:41,444 --> 02:23:45,126
[SPEAKER_21]: DESE did also say that while the plan has to be submitted on April 1st,

1654
02:23:46,447 --> 02:23:55,473
[SPEAKER_21]: If there is cohesive work in the subcommittee, that the full vote of the school committee can come after the April 1st deadline.

1655
02:23:55,493 --> 02:23:55,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Interestingly.

1656
02:23:56,253 --> 02:23:56,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1657
02:23:56,794 --> 02:24:08,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be something that I would ask, whether it's an amendment to the motion or a separate motion, is that we actually ask DESE for an extension so that we can meaningfully engage our community and our families.

1658
02:24:08,781 --> 02:24:13,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, speaking as a family of a child with a disability and knowing the

1659
02:24:14,139 --> 02:24:20,102
[SPEAKER_10]: extra demands that are put on our families with children with disabilities and the extra demands that are put on our families that are.

1660
02:24:20,464 --> 02:24:36,594
[SPEAKER_10]: second language and our extra demands that are put on our families that are working two or three jobs, I don't think it's reasonable to expect that we're going to respond to a survey in 10 days because of a deadline that's being presented to us based on whether it's $100,000 or $10 million, how it's going to be spent in our schools.

1661
02:24:36,634 --> 02:24:48,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we should be asking, if we're not prepared to do that, which I would say, I'd venture to say, 10 days is not meaningful family engagement, then we should be asking for an extension on this report.

1662
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:52,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the motion that motion extension on the report.

1663
02:24:52,622 --> 02:24:52,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1664
02:24:54,224 --> 02:24:56,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if that's an option.

1665
02:24:56,606 --> 02:25:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, uh, member McLaughlin, I, I don't have a problem reaching out to Desi, but based on the fact that they gave a clear expectation that they want us to do the short form and the amount of money that we have been allocated, which is probably the equivalent of

1666
02:25:14,921 --> 02:25:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: one FTE plus professional development, I do not see DESE granting an extension for the amount of money.

1667
02:25:22,708 --> 02:25:27,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had received millions, I could see DESE saying, yes, you need more time for that.

1668
02:25:29,174 --> 02:25:32,037
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of money that we have received is truly

1669
02:25:36,172 --> 02:25:47,455
[SPEAKER_04]: such a small amount that we have been kind of scratching our heads to say, like, how can we realistically use this amount, which is going to decrease over the next seven years?

1670
02:25:48,035 --> 02:25:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not even going to end up being the same exact amount every year.

1671
02:25:55,217 --> 02:25:56,678
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of community engagement,

1672
02:25:58,458 --> 02:26:06,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I embrace and I welcome community engagement, but the community does need to understand that we are not receiving millions of dollars.

1673
02:26:06,925 --> 02:26:10,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We're receiving $138,660, which really doesn't yield that much for us.

1674
02:26:10,548 --> 02:26:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand and I respectfully

1675
02:26:21,542 --> 02:26:29,627
[SPEAKER_10]: have to say that, you know, when we're talking on the other side of the budget and we're talking about $130,000, everybody's talking about how much money that is.

1676
02:26:30,227 --> 02:26:42,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And whether it's in comparison to a school district that's getting $10 million or us that are getting $130,000, it's still $130,000 that families should be engaged in about how they're being, it's being spent in our community.

1677
02:26:43,015 --> 02:26:45,576
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it has to be meaningful engagement.

1678
02:26:45,656 --> 02:26:46,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say,

1679
02:26:47,076 --> 02:26:51,137
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, that I don't find this meaningfully engaging families.

1680
02:26:51,177 --> 02:27:02,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it's reasonable to say that we have some work to do on family engagement as a whole, which is why we have a subcommittee on community engagement, and that, you know, I'm happy to be a part of, and I think that this is work that needs to be forward.

1681
02:27:02,919 --> 02:27:14,681
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that this body needs to think a little bit more thoughtfully, respectfully, about how we can really expect to engage these marginalized families within a 10-day deadline.

1682
02:27:17,558 --> 02:27:21,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Member Ruseau?

1683
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:22,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a lot of thoughts.

1684
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:27,301
[SPEAKER_23]: One, the Student Opportunity Act provides no opportunity for extensions.

1685
02:27:28,262 --> 02:27:33,243
[SPEAKER_23]: It also provides no consequences for failure to submit your form on time either.

1686
02:27:34,704 --> 02:27:37,505
[SPEAKER_23]: DESE has a long history of things that if you just don't do it,

1687
02:27:38,092 --> 02:27:40,594
[SPEAKER_23]: It's sort of like many of our laws in this state.

1688
02:27:41,774 --> 02:27:43,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Do it or nothing happens.

1689
02:27:44,676 --> 02:27:48,399
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't really honestly care whether we submit this on time.

1690
02:27:50,220 --> 02:28:03,408
[SPEAKER_23]: From a purely practical perspective, we cannot develop a family engagement plan and figure out how to reach out to our marginalized communities in particular, which we've never been able to successfully do in this city.

1691
02:28:03,988 --> 02:28:05,549
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't just mean the school system.

1692
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:13,203
[SPEAKER_23]: We cannot develop that muscle in 10 days or even in a year.

1693
02:28:13,783 --> 02:28:24,628
[SPEAKER_23]: We have to spend money, whether it's creating an office of community and family engagement or whatever it is, and spend a lot of time, money, and people on the ground to develop that.

1694
02:28:24,669 --> 02:28:27,630
[SPEAKER_23]: It does not happen because we want it to happen.

1695
02:28:28,055 --> 02:28:30,936
[SPEAKER_23]: It happens because we take actions to make it happen.

1696
02:28:31,677 --> 02:28:47,323
[SPEAKER_23]: And I honestly don't think that because we're going to get $380,000 or $370,000 less from the Department of Ed next year that we're going to use that, which is the real, you know, the total number is going to be less next year, not more.

1697
02:28:49,364 --> 02:28:52,365
[SPEAKER_23]: And figuring out how we're going to spend $138,000 when we're really going to have $307,000 less.

1698
02:28:57,599 --> 02:28:59,501
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a mind game.

1699
02:28:59,801 --> 02:29:02,664
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I'm not interested in how we're going to spend the $138,000.

1700
02:29:03,204 --> 02:29:09,890
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm interested in what we're going to cut to make up the $300-something thousand, which is what I think we should all be talking about.

1701
02:29:11,312 --> 02:29:20,440
[SPEAKER_23]: We aren't going to do better family engagement, and we aren't going to close any achievement gaps with $300-something less thousand dollars, which is what's going to happen.

1702
02:29:22,136 --> 02:29:32,139
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just feel like this administration, our central administration is, you know, they can only work, there's only 24 hours in a day.

1703
02:29:32,739 --> 02:29:39,461
[SPEAKER_23]: And we definitely have to improve family and community engagement, but I don't think 10 days is the time to get it done.

1704
02:29:39,921 --> 02:29:47,723
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we do a, you know, I'm terrible with analogies, but you know, one of those, we just give it a,

1705
02:29:50,402 --> 02:29:51,783
[SPEAKER_23]: the best try.

1706
02:29:53,284 --> 02:30:07,992
[SPEAKER_23]: And clearly, since DESE has set up this short form and said, don't fill it with lots of stuff, they get it, that $30 per student, which is really not what we're getting because we're losing so much more money, isn't enough to do anything.

1707
02:30:08,372 --> 02:30:10,333
[SPEAKER_23]: And they don't expect us to do anything.

1708
02:30:11,473 --> 02:30:18,177
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just not, you know, we should be very concerned about parent and family engagement.

1709
02:30:19,158 --> 02:30:21,741
[SPEAKER_23]: But that has nothing to do with Student Opportunity Act in my mind.

1710
02:30:24,203 --> 02:30:24,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

1711
02:30:26,626 --> 02:30:29,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree that there's not enough time for any of this.

1712
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:37,617
[SPEAKER_09]: But one thing I do want to mention is that one of the central questions were asked in this plan is

1713
02:30:38,951 --> 02:30:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: What is our plan for ongoing engagement?

1714
02:30:42,133 --> 02:30:44,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't believe we have one.

1715
02:30:44,595 --> 02:30:46,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is someplace we could start.

1716
02:30:46,116 --> 02:30:50,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we could do between now and April 1st is draft a plan.

1717
02:30:52,721 --> 02:31:07,212
[SPEAKER_09]: It does go on to say that they are specifically wanting us to engage organizations that represent some of our marginalized families, our PTOs, our CPAC.

1718
02:31:08,542 --> 02:31:22,037
[SPEAKER_09]: our English language learners pack, title one, so there are teachers, so there are some specific people that I think we could reach out to between now and April 1st to start to have the conversation.

1719
02:31:22,177 --> 02:31:24,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we've started to have the conversation,

1720
02:31:25,023 --> 02:31:33,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Surely we can write a paragraph that talks about what our ongoing plan is with the notion across this room that it is just the starting point.

1721
02:31:34,508 --> 02:31:35,068
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're right.

1722
02:31:35,969 --> 02:31:43,752
[SPEAKER_09]: We cannot meaningfully engage people we've never successfully engaged before in 10 days or even in 20 days to be honest.

1723
02:31:45,073 --> 02:31:49,095
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't a March problem or even a January to March problem.

1724
02:31:50,496 --> 02:31:54,618
[SPEAKER_09]: What we can do though I think is to move it to the subcommittee and talk about

1725
02:31:55,069 --> 02:32:05,174
[SPEAKER_09]: what those plans might be, start that brainstorming and get this thing submitted and behind us so we can get back to doing the real work of family engagement without money to do family engagement.

1726
02:32:05,194 --> 02:32:07,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1727
02:32:10,376 --> 02:32:22,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I also feel like it's sort of a little bit of what we heard earlier from the community about having a number of, frankly, white engaged families around the table making decisions for

1728
02:32:23,291 --> 02:32:27,013
[SPEAKER_10]: brown and black and disengaged families who aren't around the table.

1729
02:32:27,133 --> 02:32:29,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't feel comfortable doing that.

1730
02:32:29,274 --> 02:32:40,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do feel like we really should be thinking about how this is affecting our families and whether it's, and I understand it's, you know, robbing Peter to pay Paul, if you will, in terms of moving money around and what have you.

1731
02:32:41,119 --> 02:32:46,622
[SPEAKER_10]: But this Student Opportunity Act is explicitly requiring us to have those engagements.

1732
02:32:46,702 --> 02:32:48,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if it's in this one paragraph

1733
02:32:49,341 --> 02:32:57,565
[SPEAKER_10]: where we're talking about reaching out to CPAC, or we're talking about reaching out to the LPAC, which the LPAC is barely existing, is existent at this point.

1734
02:32:58,065 --> 02:33:00,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, those are our already engaged families.

1735
02:33:01,387 --> 02:33:04,288
[SPEAKER_10]: And so how are we thinking about how we're representing this?

1736
02:33:04,489 --> 02:33:15,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, okay, it's not reasonable for DESE to be asking this, and we all understand that it's not reasonable for DESE, and it's not fair that Winchester's getting more money than Medford is, or whatever else.

1737
02:33:16,007 --> 02:33:25,549
[SPEAKER_10]: At a minimum, we have to be thinking at this subcommittee, if we're doing this in the next 10 days, who are we engaging in this community that is going to be very representative of those people?

1738
02:33:25,629 --> 02:33:29,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should not be, frankly, sitting here discussing it amongst ourselves.

1739
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:36,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we have to be thinking like tonight, who are we engaging and who are we bringing to the table on this?

1740
02:33:36,952 --> 02:33:42,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think we're hearing far too often from our community members that we are not engaging these constituents.

1741
02:33:42,173 --> 02:33:42,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And to say,

1742
02:33:43,154 --> 02:33:50,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that our PTOs, while our PTOs are great and they're doing a lot of work in our schools, our PTOs are our already engaged family members.

1743
02:33:50,720 --> 02:34:01,229
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not the people who aren't able to come to the PTOs because they're working two or three jobs or because they have children with disabilities at home or because they don't speak English and don't feel comfortable or what have you.

1744
02:34:01,249 --> 02:34:04,051
[SPEAKER_10]: So the other thing is, how are we translating the survey?

1745
02:34:04,111 --> 02:34:06,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that you're ready to send a survey out, and I think that's great.

1746
02:34:07,454 --> 02:34:08,835
[SPEAKER_10]: How is the survey being translated?

1747
02:34:08,895 --> 02:34:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it going to be getting to these families?

1748
02:34:10,316 --> 02:34:11,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these are all really

1749
02:34:12,859 --> 02:34:24,441
[SPEAKER_10]: important questions that I just feel like, you know, I would rather say to Dessie, no, we're not submitting this plan April 1, because you didn't give us enough time to really meaningfully engage this constituency.

1750
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:27,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't like it, sorry, but that's where we're at.

1751
02:34:27,682 --> 02:34:32,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather say that to the commissioner than try to give us 10 days at this point.

1752
02:34:32,683 --> 02:34:39,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't even, I mean, if they want to say, well, you've had since February 18th, well, you know, there's been some things going on, whatever.

1753
02:34:39,164 --> 02:34:40,805
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had people resign.

1754
02:34:40,825 --> 02:34:41,765
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had coronavirus.

1755
02:34:41,785 --> 02:34:42,385
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had whatever.

1756
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:44,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not reasonable.

1757
02:34:45,644 --> 02:34:53,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe I can concur with Melanie on many of the points that she makes.

1758
02:34:54,437 --> 02:34:55,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not reasonable.

1759
02:34:55,278 --> 02:34:56,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It never was a reasonable timeline.

1760
02:34:58,323 --> 02:35:02,605
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems ludicrous that they're asking for such a quick return across the way.

1761
02:35:03,526 --> 02:35:05,787
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom used to say, it never hurts to ask.

1762
02:35:06,167 --> 02:35:18,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think putting together a well-crafted letter saying we would respectfully ask you for more time, we don't believe that this is an adequate amount of time for us to engage our families and whatever.

1763
02:35:18,293 --> 02:35:20,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would absolutely submit it.

1764
02:35:20,655 --> 02:35:23,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually go further and talk to the other

1765
02:35:23,476 --> 02:35:25,858
[SPEAKER_06]: superintendents who are also grappling with this.

1766
02:35:25,939 --> 02:35:34,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's a few who've managed to figure it out, but I bet there's a whole lot of superintendents trying to slam this together, as we will be doing.

1767
02:35:35,428 --> 02:35:38,370
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the other hand, I'm not willing to leave money on the table.

1768
02:35:39,151 --> 02:35:42,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we need to go ahead and send it to the engagement committee.

1769
02:35:43,173 --> 02:35:47,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to write the letter because nothing ventured, nothing gained, okay?

1770
02:35:47,955 --> 02:35:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: That we should do that and hope for the best.

1771
02:35:51,057 --> 02:36:01,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the meantime, do whatever work we can do so that we are prepared to file what we have, whether it's perfect or not, because I'm not going to leave $138,000 on the table.

1772
02:36:02,683 --> 02:36:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I can think of many, many different things that we've talked in the budget.

1773
02:36:07,225 --> 02:36:11,727
[SPEAKER_06]: that might be helpful to our students and to all students.

1774
02:36:12,247 --> 02:36:13,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1775
02:36:13,828 --> 02:36:15,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of clarification, member Ruseau.

1776
02:36:16,969 --> 02:36:19,370
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether we submit this or not has nothing to do with getting this money.

1777
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:22,451
[SPEAKER_23]: This is just our new chapter 70 formula.

1778
02:36:22,872 --> 02:36:23,312
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1779
02:36:23,432 --> 02:36:29,054
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the amount of the increase that will happen in the formula and it is not related to whether we submit this plan.

1780
02:36:29,134 --> 02:36:30,215
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to be clear on that.

1781
02:36:30,335 --> 02:36:33,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we don't submit the plan we automatically still get the money?

1782
02:36:34,144 --> 02:36:37,127
[SPEAKER_23]: The Chapter 70 formula is the Chapter 70 formula.

1783
02:36:37,147 --> 02:36:38,788
[SPEAKER_23]: It has nothing to do with anything else.

1784
02:36:41,431 --> 02:36:41,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion.

1785
02:36:41,751 --> 02:36:45,114
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a point of clarification.

1786
02:36:45,134 --> 02:36:46,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of clarification, member Laughlin.

1787
02:36:46,275 --> 02:36:57,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, and I would also encourage any folks that are watching from home out there or what have you that are these marginalized communities to reach out to this body, to this constituency to let us know.

1788
02:36:57,895 --> 02:37:10,846
[SPEAKER_10]: that you want to be involved and how you can get in and you'd like to have your voices heard and ways in which we can engage you further to make sure that these funds are being spent appropriately for those high needs families.

1789
02:37:10,907 --> 02:37:19,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that, again, respectfully to the committee, if we're talking about how these funds need to be spent, I think it's pretty clear it needs to be family and community engagement.

1790
02:37:19,958 --> 02:37:25,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just, again, my two cents, because we're already talking about how we don't have family and community engagement, and here's money.

1791
02:37:26,321 --> 02:37:29,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're talking about, well, how else can we spend this money that we don't have?

1792
02:37:30,222 --> 02:37:33,383
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just think it's a circular conversation, and just had to add that.

1793
02:37:33,423 --> 02:37:36,205
[SPEAKER_10]: But I appreciate your work, Dr. Cushing, as always.

1794
02:37:36,265 --> 02:37:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you taking our phone calls and clarifying questions for us.

1795
02:37:40,746 --> 02:37:43,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And clearly, I feel passionately about this.

1796
02:37:43,287 --> 02:37:45,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you don't take any of my passion personally.

1797
02:37:45,989 --> 02:37:49,150
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel that this is an important matter, and I wanted to speak up.

1798
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:49,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1799
02:37:50,114 --> 02:37:59,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, motion by Member Van der Kloot to send this to the Engagement, Communication, and Strategic Planning Subcommittee, seconded by... And to send a letter to the Department of Education.

1800
02:38:00,001 --> 02:38:02,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And to send a letter for requesting an extension, if that's possible.

1801
02:38:03,884 --> 02:38:06,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1802
02:38:06,707 --> 02:38:07,487
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1803
02:38:07,507 --> 02:38:07,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1804
02:38:08,268 --> 02:38:09,028
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1805
02:38:09,088 --> 02:38:09,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1806
02:38:10,569 --> 02:38:11,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1807
02:38:12,511 --> 02:38:13,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Any old business?

1808
02:38:15,673 --> 02:38:16,174
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1809
02:38:16,354 --> 02:38:17,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Communications?

1810
02:38:20,666 --> 02:38:21,506
[SPEAKER_23]: Member Ruseau.

1811
02:38:22,847 --> 02:38:24,368
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize, this is new business.

1812
02:38:24,908 --> 02:38:25,208
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct.

1813
02:38:25,828 --> 02:38:27,829
[SPEAKER_16]: So no old business, any communications?

1814
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:28,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

1815
02:38:29,310 --> 02:38:33,232
[SPEAKER_16]: New business, school safety procedural update.

1816
02:38:35,773 --> 02:38:36,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing.

1817
02:38:36,454 --> 02:38:39,175
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I will table that.

1818
02:38:39,255 --> 02:38:40,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I will table that.

1819
02:38:40,275 --> 02:38:46,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin, motion to table, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

1820
02:38:47,159 --> 02:38:47,839
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1821
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:48,959
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1822
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:49,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled.

1823
02:38:51,607 --> 02:38:53,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Status of outstanding reports.

1824
02:38:55,568 --> 02:38:56,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

1825
02:38:58,989 --> 02:38:59,449
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

1826
02:38:59,509 --> 02:39:03,910
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually have to wait because we didn't approve the ad hoc report procedure tonight.

1827
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:17,993
[SPEAKER_23]: So at the next meeting, I will actually suggest that each of these gets kind of wrapped up into the procedure that we have if we adopt it so we can get this list into something we can actually wrap our hands around.

1828
02:39:18,513 --> 02:39:19,973
[SPEAKER_16]: So motion to table.

1829
02:39:20,610 --> 02:39:25,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Mustone.

1830
02:39:26,353 --> 02:39:27,054
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1831
02:39:27,614 --> 02:39:27,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1832
02:39:27,754 --> 02:39:28,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Opposed?

1833
02:39:28,214 --> 02:39:29,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled.

1834
02:39:29,755 --> 02:39:34,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Number three, under new business, the function of the Medford School Committee 2020 to 2022 document update.

1835
02:39:34,678 --> 02:39:35,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table.

1836
02:39:35,698 --> 02:39:38,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1837
02:39:38,440 --> 02:39:39,240
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1838
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:39,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Aye.

1839
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:40,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper is tabled.

1840
02:39:41,135 --> 02:39:42,115
[SPEAKER_23]: I gotta update it.

1841
02:39:42,235 --> 02:39:57,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by, okay, be resolved that a playground advisory committee shall be created to oversee the completion of work associated with three CPC grants related to the Columbus and Brooks Playground Repair and Resurfacing and the McGlynn School Design Study.

1842
02:39:57,801 --> 02:40:04,084
[SPEAKER_16]: The work will include collaboration and review of the RFP for the McGlynn Design Study and the execution of the study.

1843
02:40:04,872 --> 02:40:19,675
[SPEAKER_16]: The advisory committee will also view all four school playgrounds and make recommendations regarding increased accessibility of playgrounds to all students to be completed within the existing scope of funding or provided to the school committee as additional recommendations.

1844
02:40:20,295 --> 02:40:31,157
[SPEAKER_16]: The advisory committee shall provide a preliminary update to the school committee no later than June 1st and then quarterly thereafter for up to one year from the date of creation or sooner if work is completed.

1845
02:40:31,943 --> 02:40:42,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Peter Cushing will issue a call for interested applicants and recommend members for the Playground Advisory Committee to the school committee no later than April 6, 2020 at the school committee meeting.

1846
02:40:43,672 --> 02:40:55,181
[SPEAKER_16]: The Playground Advisory Committee will include school administrators, at least one parent from each elementary school, and individuals with expertise in inclusive play and play spaces offered by Member Graham.

1847
02:40:56,703 --> 02:40:58,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham, would you like to say anything else on that?

1848
02:41:03,817 --> 02:41:04,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1849
02:41:05,859 --> 02:41:28,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the things that I'm thinking about in terms of the timeline, I know it's tight, but we have a really short window of time and opportunity to mobilize, particularly on the Brooks and Columbus play spaces so that those can be ready to be acted on this summer when kids are out of school.

1850
02:41:29,477 --> 02:41:32,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think we have an equally short timeline on the

1851
02:41:34,102 --> 02:41:43,086
[SPEAKER_09]: RFP to engage the proper partner to do the McGlynn design study because that study needs to

1852
02:41:45,799 --> 02:41:47,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sent out to RFP.

1853
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:48,560
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to select a bidder.

1854
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:50,741
[SPEAKER_09]: That bidder needs to be engaged.

1855
02:41:51,121 --> 02:41:52,362
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to do their work.

1856
02:41:52,922 --> 02:42:04,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we need to have our eye on the timeline that by November of this coming year, if we are going to be preparing to go back to the CPC, we'll need to be ready with information.

1857
02:42:04,848 --> 02:42:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was a lot of talk.

1858
02:42:07,389 --> 02:42:14,152
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a meeting a couple of weeks ago, a number of us and a number of other interested parties who want to make sure that

1859
02:42:15,312 --> 02:42:36,967
[SPEAKER_09]: this committee engages the right design firm, particularly for the McGlynn Playground that knows how to engage the community, how to engage with kids, how to engage with students of all abilities, and how to really sort of balance all the various needs across our student populations and really our community population to do that.

1860
02:42:37,767 --> 02:42:42,411
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think there's interested folks across the committee, across the community,

1861
02:42:43,442 --> 02:42:47,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think this committee has to be particularly small.

1862
02:42:47,784 --> 02:43:09,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think they have a lot of work to do to shepherd this through its process and make sure that along that process the right people are engaged for their input where it is particularly valuable rather than what I don't want to do is bog down folks who want to be part of

1863
02:43:10,271 --> 02:43:18,053
[SPEAKER_09]: the conversation in feeling like they have to sign on to review and write RFPs in order to be involved in the process.

1864
02:43:18,093 --> 02:43:24,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So the committee is really there to do that work to make sure that folks are appropriately engaged along the way.

1865
02:43:25,655 --> 02:43:39,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the interest of time, I'm suggesting that Peter, who has been front and central on all the CPC grants, sort of act to collect applications, vet them, and provide a recommendation to us.

1866
02:43:42,099 --> 02:43:42,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1867
02:43:44,721 --> 02:43:45,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I had some questions.

1868
02:43:46,623 --> 02:44:03,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I was also part of this conversation and I think it's really important for the community to understand that the opportunity at the McGlynn is a unique one in that we're bringing in a person or an entity to look at this playground space and to consider how we're making

1869
02:44:03,717 --> 02:44:08,540
[SPEAKER_10]: what would amount to be the first inclusive play space in Medford, which is a big deal.

1870
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:17,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So by inclusive, that's thinking about, as member Graham was saying, children of all abilities and backgrounds, and that they have expertise in that.

1871
02:44:17,145 --> 02:44:23,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a line item in there that there's an expert in inclusive play and play spaces, which I much appreciate.

1872
02:44:23,629 --> 02:44:24,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's very important.

1873
02:44:25,150 --> 02:44:32,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also encourage Dr. Cushing to, same as with our other committees, as we heard tonight, to be thinking about how we're addressing diversity.

1874
02:44:33,253 --> 02:44:55,664
[SPEAKER_10]: in our selection for committee members, and I would also advocate for a person with a disability, or somebody from the Disabilities Commission, or somebody with a disability from the Disabilities Commission to be on this committee, especially if we're thinking about how we're including children with disabilities in this playground space.

1875
02:45:00,686 --> 02:45:04,368
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that an amendment, or I request an amendment to this, or?

1876
02:45:06,709 --> 02:45:20,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, an amendment by Member McLaughlin, and I can work with Dr. Cushing as well with a meeting with the NAACP next week, you can join me, and then I also have additional people on the Disability Commission that weren't put on because there's

1877
02:45:22,173 --> 02:45:26,654
[SPEAKER_16]: many people that wanted to be on it, and there's some parents that I can refer, so we can work together on that.

1878
02:45:26,674 --> 02:45:27,775
[SPEAKER_16]: I can help however I can.

1879
02:45:28,195 --> 02:45:33,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, as amended by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1880
02:45:33,576 --> 02:45:34,377
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1881
02:45:34,397 --> 02:45:34,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1882
02:45:35,017 --> 02:45:35,617

[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1884
02:45:37,277 --> 02:45:39,538
[SPEAKER_16]: We have four condolences.

1885
02:45:39,558 --> 02:45:40,658
[SPEAKER_16]: I will read them all.

1886
02:45:40,819 --> 02:45:42,859
[SPEAKER_16]: We can stand for a moment of silence after that.

1887
02:45:43,919 --> 02:45:49,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of William,

1892
02:46:10,648 --> 02:46:16,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John Jackie Hamilton,

1893
02:46:17,335 --> 02:46:25,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Hamilton was the brother of retired elementary teacher, Judy Granara, and the brother-in-law of former school committee member, John Granara.

1894
02:46:26,304 --> 02:46:32,550
[SPEAKER_16]: And finally, be it resolved, the member of the school committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Shirley Van De Kloet.

02:46:33,511 --> 02:46:37,314

1897
02:46:37,655 --> 02:46:39,737

1898
02:47:00,698 --> 02:47:02,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, negotiations and legal matters.

1899
