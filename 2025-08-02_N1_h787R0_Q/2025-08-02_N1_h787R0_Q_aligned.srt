1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:07,012
Rowdy, it's a field of eight, but really it's a tail of two.

2
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,574
McIntosh and Ledecky.

3
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:13,257
More than a race, Jason.

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:21,903
This is a generational showdown against the greatest female swimmer in history.

5
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:27,568
On the right, and this teenage phenom on the left.

6
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:49,049
You're going to see this signature tempo of Ledecky going out.

7
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,633
Will she push Summer McIntosh to a limit that she's just not used to?

8
00:00:57,374 --> 00:01:00,416
But McIntosh has shown so much poise.

9
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,668
here in Singapore.

10
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,170
And then you don't, like you said, you talked about Pallister underneath Ledecky.

11
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,031
This is a great field.

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,372
Might be the best 800 field in history.

13
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:22,357
Five of the eight fastest swimmers ever in this race, including Pallister, who's the third fastest behind Ledecky and McIntosh.

14
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,140
So they are off and moving here in the 800 free.

15
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,361
And Ledecky,

16
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:40,139
In lane one, McIntosh just above her in lane three, Pallister below her in lane five.

17
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:44,482
The American champion and the Canadian challenger.

18
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,544
For more on Summer McIntosh, let's go to Nicole Auerbach.

19
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:56,751
Well guys, we've talked all week about summer trying to win these five gold medals here in Singapore, but this is the new addition to the program and the biggest challenge.

20
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,833
The one we've been most excited for her coach.

21
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:07,099
Frederick knew told me that this she thinks he thinks she can be the one to end Katie's reign in this event and stop her from winning a 7th world title in the 800 free now.

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:19,324
Summer wasn't as explicit, but she had told me that she has prioritized the 800 in her training above everything else, which is kind of scary to think about when you consider how well she's performed at all of these other events, Rowdy.

23
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,705
Yeah, and you're so right, Nicole.

24
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:24,286
She's got these events, but she's been fearless.

25
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:30,388
And she's got this incredible aerobic base she has built over the last six months.

26
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,829
But then you've got the experience

27
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,912
of Katie Ledecky and knowing what she's done this year.

28
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:40,194
She just broke the world record a couple of months ago.

29
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:45,199
So, you know, it's just so many great things coming together in this race.

30
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:58,950
I really believe unless something really wacky happens with Katie, I think this whole way is going to be just like what you're seeing here with Katie and Summer starting to extend that lead a little bit on Pallister.

31
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:05,439
As Nicole talked about, Summer McIntosh adding the 800 to her program this year.

32
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,922
Remember, Rowdy, she swam it at the Tokyo Olympics as a 14-year-old finished 11th, but it wasn't a priority in recent years.

33
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:22,785
But she talked about, it's not definitely my favorite event, but I'm good at it, so maybe I'll grow to like it again, and certainly,

34
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:41,169
the ability to come to these worlds and maybe potentially become the first woman to win five solo individual golds at one worlds to match Michael Phelps was an opportunity for her to add it to her resume and man she's excels.

35
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,909
She is pushing the pace.

36
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:46,670
Whatever happens she's going to make Summer McIntosh earn this first 400.

37
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,867
It doesn't mean that Katie's not going to hurt.

38
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:54,430
But trust me, she's going to go, I'm going to make you feel this first 400.

39
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:01,415
They're both, well, Ledecky's under three minutes at the 300.

40
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:07,619
He's about a half second ahead of that world record pace.

41
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,720
Pallister kind of hanging in there as well.

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,682
I can't imagine Pallister being able to

43
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:15,496
keep pace on this just wicked.

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,099
I mean, this pace is just wicked, Jason.

45
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,382
I mean, and Summer can't let her go.

46
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:25,846
I mean, she's got to say, you know, I can't let her get a body link from me.

47
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:32,712
I got to hang in there with her and then just hope and pray that aerobic pace I built will get me through this next 400.

48
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:41,576
Well, Summer McIntosh got out of the water after having what you could term a casual 800 free in the prelims.

49
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:43,797
Ledecky was not in her heat.

50
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:48,699
And she came out of the water, Rowdy, and was asked about her race and said it was kind of boring.

51
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:52,680
There's nothing boring about what's going on right now.

52
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:01,483
And she's tracking with the six-time world champion, Pallister of Australia, right there as well, just past the halfway point.

53
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,584
Boy, you know.

54
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,851
Boy, that was fast pace, Jason.

55
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,054
Her world record pace, 4.017.

56
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:12,496
She's about 6 tenths ahead of that.

57
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:20,121
It's eerie how similar their splits are when it comes to the two best times ever.

58
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:24,384
McIntosh was 4.011 when she went 8.05.

59
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,245
Right there, she was 4.013.

60
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:31,529
The next two, 200, they're exactly the same.

61
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,372
It's just eerie.

62
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:39,939
The only thing I... I'm just trying to look at these 50 splits.

63
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,147
I know... I know I get calls about, quit talking about the clock, but the splits tell you so much.

64
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:54,988
Ledecky out to Glitter, that previous 50, but that 50 was about a tenth faster for Summer McIntyre.

65
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,871
So now 14 one hundredths of a second.

66
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,474
Separates him and look at Pallister!

67
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:03,398
I mean, who asked her to join this party?

68
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:16,377
Well, it looked like a table for two, and now you might have to bring an extra chair and make this a setting for three, because Pallister is hanging right there, at least for now.

69
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:22,378
This trio looking spectacular here in this 800 free final.

70
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:26,479
I like Summer McIntosh, the way she's looking right now, though, Jason.

71
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,199
She still looks smooth.

72
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,800
She's not fighting that water at all.

73
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,501
This is watching an experienced,

74
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:47,723
Legacy-making swim by Katie Ledecky, colliding with this wall-rising brilliance from Summer McIntosh, and for that matter, Pallister.

75
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:52,624
But I just can't imagine Pallister hanging in there these last 200 meters.

76
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:56,585
It is really a great race for Lani Pallister right now.

77
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:01,406
And Ledecky has never lost this race at the World Championships.

78
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:05,511
This woman, six times, won all six.

79
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:18,427
She hadn't lost in 800 at all in well over a decade, and at a lower level meet last year in Orlando, McIntosh was able to best Ledecky in this race, but both

80
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:24,354
at various points of their training, getting ready for the Olympics last summer in Paris.

81
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:33,604
But here at the biggest meet of the year, it's those two going head to head with Pallister sticking in the mix as well.

82
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,826
I like McIntosh.

83
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:36,747
I don't know why.

84
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:42,413
I just get the feeling she hasn't shown everything yet.

85
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,896
She's so good coming home.

86
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:51,783
We saw her almost break the world record in the 200 butterfly and 100 meters left to go.

87
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:57,329
Stroke for stroke, this race does not disappoint in any way.

88
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:05,269
Well, the head-to-head showdown becoming a three-headed monster, at least for a while.

89
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:12,855
But Ledecky and McIntosh maybe trying to get some separation against Lonnie Pollister, who is not out of it yet.

90
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:19,080
The American ahead of the Canadian as they head for home here in the 800 free final.

91
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,723
Ledecky out-splitter there by four-tenths of a second.

92
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,584
And now she's increasing that pitfall.

93
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:27,606
And look at Ledecky go.

94
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:28,767
Look at Ledecky go.

95
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,408
The champion and the challengers.

96
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,009
McIntosh is fading.

97
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:34,830
Pallister is surging.

98
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,332
Ledecky trying to hold on to it.

99
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:44,997
And Katie Ledecky racing her way into history with another 800 free title.

100
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:48,619
A seven time champion of this event.

101
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:52,702
The first ever in world championship history.

102
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:09,536
Long live the queen of the 800 frame.

103
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:31,593
Well, you have anticipation of what you hope something can be.

104
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,403
That feels like it delivered more than we could have even expected.

105
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:44,908
And just like that, the legend grows, man.

106
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,592
She turned back that challenge.

107
00:09:53,135 --> 00:10:02,062
And she reminded, I hope she reminds every single person on the planet that knows anything about swimming,

108
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:07,594
that she is the gold standard.

109
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,677
That is the greatest... Think about that, Jason.

110
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:14,678
The greatest female swimmer in the history of the sport.

111
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,099
And we go back to 1896.

112
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:31,427
I mean... It's... I mean, I can't begin to tell you how many people... There's her coach, Anthony Nesting.

113
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,505
I can't believe, my phone blew up the last 24 hours.

114
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:39,326
McIntosh is taking her, McIntosh is taking her.

115
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,889
Didn't quite have it.

116
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,850
I thought she looked great going into the 700.

117
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,211
Oh boy, she fell off that last 100.

118
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:52,593
And she is not happy.

119
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,336
Oh boy.

120
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,098
Side by side.

121
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,516
Ledecky on the right.

122
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:18,521
And this is where I thought that, you know, Summer out split Katie on that 50 right there, Jason, by about 4 tenths.

123
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:20,982
So I thought, wow, she's just building to this 100.

124
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,283
And that's what made me believe it.

125
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:26,524
But boy, why do I question the heart of a champion?

126
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:27,825
Why do I do that?

127
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:30,166
I am just some big idiot.

128
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,232
And watch this final turn there.

129
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,313
Look at the way she comes off.

130
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,634
Look at that dolphin kick.

131
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,336
Four dolphin kicks coming off that wall.

132
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:47,240
And give Ronnie Pallister a lot of credit.

133
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,465
She goes her best time by three seconds and beats McIntosh.

134
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,887
And look at Team USA.

135
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,930
They've been ridden hard this week.

136
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,332
A lot of comments happening.

137
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:06,543
Katie, baby, Katie.

138
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:22,216
And for someone that has that quiet confidence and doesn't often show a ton of emotion post-race, that is a raucous celebration for Ledecky, Anthony Neste, and the rest of the coaching staff.

139
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,558
Mom and dad!

140
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,640
Mary Jen!

141
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,542
Summer McIntosh.

142
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,144
She's not done, by the way.

143
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:41,989
Already three goals for her here but Ledecky gets another her 30th world medal all time second only to Michael Phelps.

144
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,176
It's a twenty third world title only Phelps is more of those with twenty six.

145
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:54,061
And it's an 18th individual world title in swimming.

146
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,082
Nobody has more.

147
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,524
Ledecky with a championship record.

148
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,447
Palliser with an oceanic record, taking silver.

149
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,549
McIntosh with bronze.
