1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording in progress.

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:02,385
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

3
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everybody.

4
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,207
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a close call, but now we are ready.

5
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,908
[SPEAKER_08]: We're raring to go.

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Full power.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:20,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start with a quick roll call, followed by maybe a discussion of the minutes, but I'll just run down this nice and quick.

8
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:22,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Josh, are you here?

9
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:25,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Just barely.

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:25,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

11
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Lois?

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I see in the chat at least, so I'm going to... I'm here.

13
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:36,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't.

14
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:38,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having trouble unmuting.

15
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

16
00:00:40,883 --> 00:00:42,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Benji is not present.

17
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Barry told us he was not going to make it.

18
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Loretta?

19
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:47,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.

20
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:49,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathleen?

21
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:50,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.

22
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:59,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke is not here yet, but I heard tell that he might join us a little later.

23
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:02,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Resend.

24
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan, it's not on my list.

25
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob?

26
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:08,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Jessica?

28
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:11,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

29
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:16,354
[SPEAKER_08]: John, I'm not seeing him here.

30
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:21,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Will is here, and I'm not seeing Paul.

31
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,379
[SPEAKER_08]: But with eight, we have quorum.

32
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Did everyone get a chance to review the minutes?

33
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And does anyone feel strongly about them?

34
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:41,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel strongly about motioning to approve the minutes, unless anyone feels otherwise.

35
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

36
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:44,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

37
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:45,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

38
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,452
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's run down this one right quick.

39
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:52,372
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, in favor of accepting the minutes, Josh?

40
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:53,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

41
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Lois?

42
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

43
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

44
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:58,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

45
00:01:59,013 --> 00:01:59,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathleen.

46
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:00,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

47
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:01,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

48
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:03,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

49
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:18,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Will is a yes as well, brings us to a perfect unanimous eight on accepting limits.

50
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:19,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get started.

51
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,680
[SPEAKER_08]: First important order of business.

52
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:32,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Brenda brought up the fact that November 4th is election day.

53
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:41,499
[SPEAKER_08]: do we feel comfortable having our meeting the night before?

54
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do people have big plans and need to rest up beforehand?

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we have our meeting on November 3rd or the 10th?

56
00:02:56,783 --> 00:03:00,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the 10th.

57
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you taking a poll?

58
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:03,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

59
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'll de-advocate for the 10th.

60
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a holiday the next day?

61
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:11,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

62
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,046
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 10th, I don't think anything.

63
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,146
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean.

64
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Veterans Day is the 11th.

65
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:18,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

66
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:20,447
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still okay.

67
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:33,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob, I think it would be nice to know the results of the election for city council to see what our political climate is for planning purposes.

68
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the 10th would be advantageous in that respect.

69
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our meeting runs long, I cut the day off the next day.

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So it works out nicely.

71
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:49,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit.

72
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other strong emotions one way or the next?

73
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:56,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And this good.

74
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

75
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Loretta, you had mentioned the third.

76
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:09,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we OK with the 10th?

77
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,106
[SPEAKER_08]: should be able to work.

78
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:17,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, you mentioned it was when Mary wanted the 30.

79
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I had mentioned maybe the 10th.

80
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize.

81
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone present wants the 10th.

82
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to set that as the official date for next month.

83
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:31,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just concerned when I saw the holiday that people might be going away for that long holiday weekend.

84
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,921
[SPEAKER_09]: But if everybody says the 10th, that's fine with me.

85
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:38,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So it shall be done.

86
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:40,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you all on the 10th.

87
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,665
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

88
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm going to hand it off to Brenda for all the good news.

89
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:55,583
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another date, the December date, and the issue there is December 1 is right after the Thanksgiving weekend, and we'll sort of be zonked out.

90
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:56,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

91
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at my calendar.

92
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:00,969
[SPEAKER_09]: December.

93
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

94
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:18,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, my reaction was, oh gee, I don't know if I'll be ready, because I'll just be decompressing from a 48 weekend.

95
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:22,116
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very fair.

96
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:28,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we want to decide that right now, or just mold that over with that understanding in the back of our brains.

97
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:29,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

98
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:29,618
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

99
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:30,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

100
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:33,432
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

101
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to throw it over to Brenda.

102
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Administrative and city updates.

103
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:40,716
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

104
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No administrative updates this time.

105
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the city updates, I have a slideshow, actually, this time, because we have some visuals that I thought would be helpful.

106
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see my screen?

107
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, looks good.

108
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

109
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the first thing I have is events.

110
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:14,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had a lot of events so far in September and the beginning of October.

111
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:17,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a bunch more coming up.

112
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:19,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Fall is very event heavy.

113
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next few are the Hispanic Heritage Month event coming up this Saturday.

114
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:32,304
[SPEAKER_02]: and then obviously Harvest Your Energy the following Saturday.

115
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:37,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in a couple of weeks after that, we'll have the Pumpkin Smash at the McGlynn School.

116
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:55,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later in November, the winter preparedness event at City Hall where they give out lots of coats and things like that and have lots of organizations on hand to help people who need more assistance.

117
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:07,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wanted to mention that each member of the City of the Climate Equity Council is planning a climate change event for their focus area.

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:17,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of them did bingo, the bingo and ice cream social at the senior center with climate trivia questions.

119
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:30,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another one did sort of a, you know, more age appropriate questions with some of the middle school students at the Canoe Mobile event.

120
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:43,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're planning an energy bill checkup event with National Grid and ABCD in attendance so they can help people right on the spot with any issues with their bills.

121
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:52,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They're planning an induction cooktop demonstration and an event at the West Medford Community Center.

122
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last three things we don't have any clear details on yet.

123
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:04,148
[SPEAKER_02]: The energy bill checkup event might be the seventh at the library, but we haven't gotten confirmation from everybody participating in that yet.

124
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:18,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know some folks from this group had said that you wanted, you'd be interested in tabling at more events.

125
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:30,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there are, if I've ever highlighted an event coming up that you would be interested in having an energy committee table at, definitely let me know and I can help you connect with the right people for that.

126
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh, did you have something?

127
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:36,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just,

128
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:50,509
[SPEAKER_07]: If these are being primarily facilitated by the Climate Equity Council, I would love to be on hand as additional sets of hands to co-work on those with them.

129
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'd be a great opportunity to reconnect our committees.

130
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:56,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

131
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:01,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I will include you in the email chains then as we're talking about them.

132
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:05,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke, did you have?

133
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:06,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

134
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Brenda.

135
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, I'm a little late.

136
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:31,720
[SPEAKER_05]: But the last few, if there is a date for any of those, the energy bill checkup, induction cooktop demonstration, and whatever might be happening at West Medford Community Center, I might be able to attend one or something of those, but I would

137
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be interested in helping out at one or another.

138
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

139
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:37,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

140
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,720
[SPEAKER_02]: As they get planned, I'll give people a heads up what the date and time will be.

141
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also like to jump in very quickly.

142
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:55,277
[SPEAKER_08]: One, definitely keep us connected with Climate Equity Council.

143
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's silly that we don't talk as much as we should.

144
00:09:59,441 --> 00:09:59,801
[SPEAKER_08]: We should.

145
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it should be like this.

146
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:09,469
[SPEAKER_08]: The other side of it is, I believe October 18th that morning is the Junk in the Trunk

147
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:13,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to call it a festival.

148
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:17,507
[SPEAKER_08]: The event, Chunk in the Trunk, will be hosted by City Hall.

149
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it runs like 10 to 11.30 or something.

150
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But just another everything is free type event.

151
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:33,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Would recommend people stop by, maybe even on their way to the Harvest Energy Festival.

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it on the 18th, you said?

153
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I question whether that's true, because I think Teresa

154
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,129
[SPEAKER_02]: DuPont in my office organizes it.

155
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,210
[SPEAKER_08]: She has fully stepped out of it.

156
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't realize, okay.

157
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:56,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is now being planned solely by some of the old guard that just love Junk in the Trunk so darn much.

158
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:02,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been on their email chain, so I hear every little detail.

159
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:08,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And it means that it's been a hard road, but they're super stoked to have it.

160
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,306
[SPEAKER_08]: So celebrate the thing that almost never happened.

161
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,049
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it, Will?

162
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be the morning of the 18th, October 18th, over by City Hall, I believe 1030.

163
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,415
[SPEAKER_03]: October 18th?

164
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:28,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

165
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in two weeks?

166
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:31,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

167
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:36,780
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been accepting vendors for a while, but of course, you stop by and things are free.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So come by, I believe it's 10 to 1130.

169
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:41,641
[SPEAKER_08]: over by City Hall.

170
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:47,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll probably bike over there, check things out, and then keep biking over to the Harvester Energy Fest.

171
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be one swift, perfect movement.

172
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:54,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can't take any stuff if you're going to bike.

173
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring a backpack.

174
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,368
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll make it happen.

175
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so moving on to EV charging stations, we're still waiting for National Grid to connect the station at the West Medford parking lot.

176
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:23,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The new date we've been given by them is October 8th, so we'll see on Wednesday if that actually happens or if we get pushed out again.

177
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:42,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, um, when we had the traffic commission meeting for the, um, on street chargers, um, residents, some residents at a couple of the locations, um, uh, we're not happy with having the chargers there.

178
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we were sort of rethinking those.

179
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:50,824
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of combining the two charging stations at one location.

180
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:57,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're currently looking at 200 Boston Ave for that new location there.

181
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:05,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be at the traffic commission meeting next Tuesday that we'll be talking about that one.

182
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:07,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they say what they didn't like?

183
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:20,294
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, it sounded like they were worried that people from outside of their neighborhood would be coming into their neighborhood to use them.

184
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:31,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody who spoke at the traffic commission meeting actually parked on the street, but they were concerned that when they had visitors, their visitors wouldn't be able to park.

185
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two spots, right?

186
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two spots.

187
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

188
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:38,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

189
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Just check it.

190
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:40,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Just check it.

191
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:41,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

192
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:51,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem is with these sorts of meetings, the people who are against something tend to show up and the people who support it tend not to.

193
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a check off box that just says against change?

194
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:00,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I'm being...

195
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

196
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:06,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

197
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:10,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully 200 Boston Ave, it's between the two locations.

198
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:17,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in as much of a residential neighborhood.

199
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:20,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it will be more acceptable to people.

200
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:34,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know that like for at my work, we have chargers for charging vehicles and there's a $20 fine for parking a half an hour past when you're fully charged.

201
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Are these charges on that same system?

202
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not, but there's a $1 per hour charge if you stay past four hours.

203
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:44,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.

204
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, and that's the other thing is four hours, four hours or completely charged.

205
00:14:50,097 --> 00:15:03,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think you can set those because what they didn't want is they didn't want people to be, you know, cause there's like 2000 people that work where I work and they didn't want people, you know, clogging up the chargers.

206
00:15:03,241 --> 00:15:04,402
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be able to rotate them.

207
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

208
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:06,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, exactly.

209
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a problem at one point with people just parking their car there and being fully charged and then leaving it for 24 hours more or something like that.

210
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was why we added that additional fee.

211
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:21,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

212
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:26,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

213
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:32,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to Electrify Medford, we've had 202 signups so far, and we've coached 99 people.

214
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:45,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in, and we haven't had an update on the actions taken for a little while since I need to reach back out to the folks we haven't heard from.

215
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're in the process of a legal review of the MOU for Mass Saves Community First Partnership grant.

216
00:15:53,932 --> 00:16:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: still having issues with the data sharing aspect of it and how that intersects with public records law for municipalities.

217
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So still working on that.

218
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:10,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Main Streets Program for Small Business Energy Efficiency will start at the end of October.

219
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a kickoff event for that.

220
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:22,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, double checking when that kickoff event will be, I just found out about that today.

221
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the kickoff event for that there.

222
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to be talking about it at Harvester Energy Festival.

223
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do a coffee hour with businesses.

224
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But the official kickoff event is actually happening November six at City Hall.

225
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to be going out to the Medford Square first and going to the businesses there.

226
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:59,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over the next week or so, going out to the different squares and talking to businesses.

227
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,954
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews and McGlynn HVAC project.

228
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:14,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So the re-graining of the plazas at the front entrances and the kindergarten roof leak repair have all been completed.

229
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're diving into the actual HVAC part of this now.

230
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:28,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So the construction is going to continue through the summer of 2026 with the disruptive work happening on non-school days and evenings.

231
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:32,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cooling system replacement will actually start October 15th.

232
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when they officially turn off the, the cooling system, and then he, the backup heating system replacement is going to start May 15th when we're outside of the heating season.

233
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:51,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the McGlynn roof refurbishment will happen after that age for that work is done.

234
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So, summer of 2026.

235
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:09,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just the schedule for our solar projects that we're planning, the car park solar, that's going to start this fall or winter and finish early in 2026.

236
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrews will start the summer of 2026.

237
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like I said, and then after the McGlynn roof refurbishment is done, the solar will be installed there in the fall or winter of 2026.

238
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:33,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are working on a power purchase agreement for the McGlynn solar now, because if we sign it by the end of the year, it'll be eligible for tax credits.

239
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:43,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hiring a consultant to help apply for tax credits for the new EVs and solar projects.

240
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:54,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So the car park, the Andrew School, and the two EVs that we have gotten this year are estimated to total over $250,000 in tax credits.

241
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:58,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to make sure that we are dotting our I's and crossing our T's for that.

242
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:16,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, 1 thing that I wanted to mention is that, um, our streetlight management vendor, uh, their, their streetlight business, their, their.

243
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,950
[SPEAKER_02]: either selling that off or that's going out of business.

244
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking into options to integrate our technology that we have right now into a new software platform.

245
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been talking with a new vendor about that.

246
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But if anybody who works in this field has any insight into other vendors that we can be talking with.

247
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:39,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

248
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:41,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.

249
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll follow up with you, Will.

250
00:19:50,150 --> 00:20:03,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Green and Open Somerville is looking to partner on an MVP grant application for deep paving projects, a regional deep paving project.

251
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually talking with them.

252
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:14,248
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Wednesday with them and Malden, um, to try to, to start that off.

253
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:22,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are interested in being involved with this, I think they would, they would love to have the energy committee's involvement in it.

254
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:29,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they won't be able to make it to the harvest your energy festival, but they sent along some materials.

255
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you'd be willing to have that at the energy committee table, we could do that too.

256
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:38,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally a fan of having the info at our table.

257
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:40,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sounds great.

258
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

259
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:49,711
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already done a couple of depaving projects here in Medford, but they've mostly been focusing on Somerville so far.

260
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:53,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be cool to partner with Medford residents.

261
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it specifies Somerville.

262
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:03,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Do Medford residents benefit from the same free movement of things and free labor

263
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:07,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's exactly the same the same project model.

264
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.

265
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:20,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wanted to give you just a quick overview of our greenhouse gas inventory.

266
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:28,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, I submitted the last this year's inventory towards the end of September.

267
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:31,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gives you a little snapshot of.

268
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of how our emissions have trended over the last few years.

269
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:42,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our first inventory was actually 2017, but I kind of question the data.

270
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:49,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Brenda, I'm sorry, I think I'm just seeing Benji's email.

271
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:50,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he in the waiting room?

272
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:53,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he?

273
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:56,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe he's in the wrong link and I can just send him the right link.

274
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see him in the waiting room.

275
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,499
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, don't worry.

276
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just send him another link.

277
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry to disturb.

278
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

279
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:14,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you sent out the agenda at the bottom, one of the emails, there's a link to the city council meeting tomorrow.

280
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I clicked on that first too.

281
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what's going on?

282
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the city council meeting that was last week, I think, right?

283
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:24,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's when I sent out.

284
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:26,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was one on the deep paving.

285
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just emailed him the link.

286
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:32,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

287
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I think 2017 was the first year that we did an inventory, but the data is a little questionable there.

288
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's suspiciously low.

289
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:48,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm starting here with 2018 data.

290
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when we started using the MAPC.

291
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: We got assistance from MAPC for the project and started using their tool that we're still using today.

292
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And the biggest decrease I would say I've seen in this is in the building emissions.

293
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:21,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And that data we get directly from National Grid for community-wide emissions.

294
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty trustworthy data.

295
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:35,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just that the electric grid, for instance, has gotten a lot more, has had a lot more renewables come onto it.

296
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:41,405
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a reduction in energy use, both on the electricity side and the gas side too.

297
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really heartening data to see.

298
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:46,608
[SPEAKER_02]: The transportation numbers.

299
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:48,568
[SPEAKER_02]: have not dropped quite as much.

300
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:51,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've seen a drop of like 4%.

301
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:57,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely an area to focus in on more in the future.

302
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:11,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And transportation is not as large of a portion of our greenhouse gas emissions community-wide as buildings, but still a really big area to focus on.

303
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:15,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have Benji.

304
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Brenda, what's the population of infrared?

305
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:25,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that held steady, or has it increased or decreased, do we know?

306
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It has increased.

307
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:35,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's at 58,000 something, closer to 59,000 maybe at this point.

308
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:43,158
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the per person consumption has gone down even more.

309
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah.

310
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is just a little bit more digging into the data there.

311
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:07,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking out the municipal emissions from the total.

312
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So the municipal emissions are included in the total on the top there, but then we just broke them out separately to show them.

313
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:18,768
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to read the numbers.

314
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you give us your sense of

315
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:32,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so municipal emissions has definitely dropped a lot for the building level.

316
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:39,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen a 20% plus reduction in emissions.

317
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Transportation shows a big drop this year, but I question that data.

318
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:59,929
[SPEAKER_02]: MAPC changed the way that their tool was calculating that this year, and I think that's really the source of that change and not actually anything that changed on our part significantly, although we have been

319
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:06,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years, we've been doing more hybrids and things like that.

320
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:09,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I think we've also been adding more vehicles too.

321
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:15,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that municipal vehicle number is suspicious there.

322
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:27,428
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may say, it also shows railways as a significant, it's relatively stable over four years and then drops by 2,000 plus.

323
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:27,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

324
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:31,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The MAPC tool changed the way that it calculated those as well.

325
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's only calculating the MBTA emissions from lines that actually go through Medford.

326
00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:53,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is under-representing if Medford residents are using other forms of transportation in the city, if they change lines at some point.

327
00:26:55,071 --> 00:27:05,475
[SPEAKER_05]: May I ask, is the stationary energy, just to clarify on Bob's point, residential buildings includes all residences?

328
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:13,439
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all buildings in Medford, or is this municipally managed and whatever?

329
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So the middle section, that's just municipal.

330
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But the top and the bottom here, where it says stationary energy, that includes everything community-wide.

331
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

332
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:27,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

333
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:37,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one would have thought that during COVID, you would have seen a rise in community energy, everyone at home.

334
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:38,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.

335
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:47,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a really good point.

336
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:50,044
[SPEAKER_01]: There doesn't seem to be a drop in transportation, though.

337
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:58,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably rebounded after everyone got... Not very significant.

338
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very noticeable, actually.

339
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:03,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither the drop nor the increase from...

340
00:28:03,797 --> 00:28:07,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so the transportation number is 1 of the, this is a data issue.

341
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:16,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the statewide, uh, transportation data, um, didn't, we didn't have an update from that from, I think.

342
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014 to 2021, or something like that.

343
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:20,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, there's not a.

344
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:44,873
[SPEAKER_02]: The year-by-year data for many things other than the national grid data, I would say I would be very skeptical at looking at each individual year and comparing it to the previous year or the following year, just because there's sometimes lags and when we get updates to data sources.

345
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:51,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But the national grid, the building, the stationary energy data, that's very reliable.

346
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,464
[SPEAKER_03]: no matter what else, it's clear that things are getting better, not worse.

347
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:03,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

348
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, is it getting better at the rate that we need it to?

349
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:11,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the question, but it is getting better.

350
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:12,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.

351
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:15,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, change takes a long time.

352
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:18,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about changing people's behaviors.

353
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:25,518
[SPEAKER_03]: at personal and community and statewide levels.

354
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:30,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the first good news I've heard in quite a while, Brenda.

355
00:29:31,643 --> 00:29:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's encouraging.

356
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:34,345
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

357
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:42,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's all that I have for my updates.

358
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:45,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me stop sharing.

359
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Brenda, this is Bob.

360
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:53,729
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the status of the flipper ship connector?

361
00:29:56,291 --> 00:30:00,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So the section between Medford Square and the Andrews School is open.

362
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:05,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because I don't think there was like a ribbon-cutting ceremony or anything.

363
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there was a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

364
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:14,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a community bike ride that went through to celebrate it.

365
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Must have missed it.

366
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:15,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

367
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good.

368
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:18,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really smooth ride.

369
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:19,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I highly recommend it, Bob.

370
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,539
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good.

371
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a question for Will and Brenda.

372
00:30:27,002 --> 00:30:32,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I can't remember seeing the agenda before it was finalized.

373
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:41,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that you had sent it to the city council, the letter about municipal funding.

374
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:43,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was curious if there was any,

375
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:47,993
[SPEAKER_09]: if you've watched the city council meeting, any updates on that?

376
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:49,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you and Barry worked on it, Will.

377
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:57,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the electrical equity consumer watchdog letter.

378
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:01,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I submitted those a little over a week ago.

379
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:07,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not heard anything back, but I sent them out to our various reps and senators.

380
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a huge list from Barry of who to send it to, and I just made sure everyone got a copy.

381
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:19,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the, Loretta, were you asking about the electric suppliers letter or about the divestment?

382
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:25,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm confused because they talked about it at the city council meeting.

383
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:29,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that might be divestment.

384
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:34,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was a divestment letter that- Yeah, divestment was sent out months ago.

385
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:36,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that was discussed.

386
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:42,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and there were votes on it back in August.

387
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,112
[SPEAKER_07]: At the city council meeting last week, they moved it through the third reading.

388
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:50,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's in 10 Mayors.

389
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:52,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, it was very interesting.

390
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,134
[SPEAKER_09]: It was interesting to watch.

391
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was the divestment letter.

392
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:56,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

393
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you'd like to give an update, but thank you.

394
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:00,717
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I appreciate that update.

395
00:32:01,157 --> 00:32:12,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It was interesting hearing all the different comments and if you can watch the replay, it wasn't worth it because they stood up for passing it through to the next reading.

396
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:25,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And last week's discussion is much shorter than the previous 2 meetings where it was discussed a little more dejectable that definitely that definitely makes it a little more appetizing.

397
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:28,803
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be that's great.

398
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Brenda, that's it for city updates.

399
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:38,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

400
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:39,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

401
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:52,751
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, I don't want to take too much time on this, but I would love to devote a little bit of time to the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

402
00:32:52,771 --> 00:33:03,120
[SPEAKER_08]: In years prior, it has been me all on my lonesome, and I know some of you table other events and do other things and live busy lives.

403
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to do less than three hours of tabling.

404
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:14,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd love to get some partners to either keep me company or explore the space with me.

405
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:25,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd love to send out that humble request to get some tabling buddies for the Harvester Energy Festival.

406
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:29,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there.

407
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:31,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be happy to.

408
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:32,978
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you?

409
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,473
[SPEAKER_03]: When do we start?

410
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:37,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's 12 to three.

411
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 to three.

412
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:48,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, I remember I was there at like 10 o'clock helping to direct traffic and all, and was so exhausted by the time we started.

413
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:53,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's the other side of it is we have so many other things we do.

414
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you count on me to be there at 12 with you from 12 to three?

415
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:06,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I can sit still for three hours without any trouble.

416
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,912
[SPEAKER_08]: This will hopefully be the easier part of your day.

417
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:11,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there for a bit too, Will.

418
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, phenomenal.

419
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:20,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks like we just got a Qualtrics survey put in chat here.

420
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:26,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the survey is for helping to volunteer for other parts of the festival.

421
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know, Will, you're talking about actually tabling with the Energy Committee.

422
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:36,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to help direct traffic to recycling.

423
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Setting up the tables is a Herculean feat.

424
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

425
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:42,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So I usually do the traffic.

426
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:45,753
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I've just done for year after year after year.

427
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:46,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can sign up for that.

428
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:51,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

429
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

430
00:34:53,278 --> 00:35:00,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that gets really complicated except for a long time with people trying to get to the recycling.

431
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

432
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:09,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, depending on where I'm at, you know, at the festival, I plan to be there again this year.

433
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll pop in and relieve you at times.

434
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:12,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

435
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,343
[SPEAKER_09]: But they'd already sent out that survey.

436
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:17,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure if they're going to place me somewhere.

437
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:18,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know.

438
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:26,807
[SPEAKER_08]: If you find you have an open 45 minutes, I would love to grab lunch and would love to grab a moment of stretching my legs.

439
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:28,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

440
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:30,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have all the materials?

441
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:34,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we usually have a mix of things that we put on the table.

442
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:34,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

443
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:41,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the other side of it is we are making a pretty substantial list of things to just be handing out.

444
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:43,754
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like we're going to be a flyer-heavy table.

445
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:50,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we put together a pretty substantial list a few sessions ago.

446
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:53,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time I look at it, it gets a little longer.

447
00:35:54,711 --> 00:36:04,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be probably emailing Brenda in the next day or two to see what we can collect and make sure we have it all.

448
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget to bring rocks.

449
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:07,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So many rocks.

450
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,280
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I got so many paperweights.

451
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I even got a little anvil just to make sure we stay locked down.

452
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:28,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the reason I asked is I probably still have a huge folder of all the printouts and invasive plants and what to plant and tree information, all kinds of stuff.

453
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So I might just bring it.

454
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:31,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you need it, you need it.

455
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,407
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't, you don't.

456
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Loretta, do you want to bring that in and just drop those off in our office so that we can get an idea of what we have ahead of time and what we might need to print out?

457
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

458
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:44,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know.

459
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know he had a list already.

460
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:52,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see what I have, because every year, except the last year I did that, so I might be low.

461
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:53,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll have to dig it out.

462
00:36:54,729 --> 00:37:01,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a list of topics that people have expressed that they want to be showcased as what we do or what we're about.

463
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:04,517
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean I necessarily have a flyer ready for it yet.

464
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:08,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have something we can photocopy or something we can work with.

465
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I have that, but I have a lot on trees and invasive plants.

466
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: and rodent control, because I had worked on that previously with the health department, how to help prevent it from your property.

467
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:28,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know I still have those.

468
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'll drop them off to Brenda's office.

469
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:32,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Phenomenal.

470
00:37:32,974 --> 00:37:33,274
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

471
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we doing anything kid-friendly, Will?

472
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to my knowledge.

473
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,902
[SPEAKER_03]: We could get green candy.

474
00:37:44,195 --> 00:38:05,545
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah seriously yeah i'll um green gumdrops you know wrapped candy go green do you want that that hand crank um led incandescent um thing or is that kind of i don't mind it it's not okay

475
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:08,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's so old.

476
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:20,878
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 12 years old now, and everybody's using LEDs, but I think it's the crank aspect of it that might be... It definitely gets people here, and that sometimes is a big winner.

477
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

478
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:30,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I will look into potential handouts and things that might entice folks over.

479
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:39,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, email me if you have a thought in the middle of the night, something that comes up.

480
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:47,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I will be talking about some black plastic readings that you guys have put together.

481
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:52,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make sure that that has a place of honor.

482
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:56,349
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about our zero waste initiatives and things like that.

483
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:00,667
[SPEAKER_08]: showcase the fact that we've actually been working really hard this year.

484
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:06,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to celebrate that, celebrate us a little bit for doing such a good job.

485
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:11,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I got I reached out to a new exhibitor, if you want to hear about it.

486
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:18,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Briefly, it has to do with the zero waste idea.

487
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talked about this just briefly at the end of the last meeting.

488
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:29,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So the company named Sobago, they're located in Melrose, and they recycle thin film plastic.

489
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:38,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually, the owner's name is Dave New, so he's going to be tabling at the festival table.

490
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,738
[SPEAKER_09]: He said he will collect thin film plastic.

491
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,199
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes... Oh, fantastic.

492
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:44,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so that includes...

493
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:56,712
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the bubble mailers we get, like, from Amazon packages, and the thin plastic envelopes we get from, so that's really cool.

494
00:39:57,573 --> 00:40:13,579
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be also, in case anybody's listening to this meeting, besides us, that could be, you know, the plastic from toilet paper packages, paper towels, vegetable bags, you know, but they can't have the paper tag on them, so you have to remove them.

495
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:30,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So what he has is a machine that you can buy for your home and it compresses, it's a small machine, it compresses the plastic so you can push all the plastic into the machine, push the button, close the lid, push the button, it compresses it into a disc, a small disc like a puck.

496
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:48,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you do with the boxes that he has drop off locations there's two and one is with help see it's sort of a pilot program so there's a box for helps to drop off at the school on Main Street.

497
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:54,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think, the Curtis Tufts High School, I think it's called, on Main Street, but also at Whole Foods in Medford.

498
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And he picks them up.

499
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So he'll be demonstrating at the festival.

500
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:09,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And what happens, he picks up the pucks, and then he sends them off to companies that can use them in their products.

501
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fantastic.

502
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:18,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'll be good to... I always like knowing who's tabling, so it'll be good to point folks in all the good directions.

503
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:24,080
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any of that type of plastic, consider bringing it maybe to the supermarket or God knows what they do with it.

504
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:30,345
[SPEAKER_09]: You might want to, you know, save it for the festival and bring it over to his table.

505
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loretta, can you just repeat the name of that?

506
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:34,709
[SPEAKER_05]: OBAGGO.

507
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,650
[SPEAKER_09]: O-B-A-G-G-O.

508
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

509
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other company I was looking at was Ridwell, but that's out of California and they have a big campaign.

510
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:49,022
[SPEAKER_09]: They are, you know, having events.

511
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:51,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Will had mentioned that at the last meeting.

512
00:41:52,683 --> 00:42:02,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they do is pick up from your home, you contact them and you have a contract with them, but they pick up clothing, all kinds of things, plus plastic.

513
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:05,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And they charge you also, you know, for the pickup.

514
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:11,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plan is like 17 a month and up, depending on how many items you want to recycle.

515
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:14,080
[SPEAKER_09]: But we already have some of that in management.

516
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:22,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this little machine was interesting that he has produced at Obago for home use.

517
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:25,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be great to see it in action.

518
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:27,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he does events.

519
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:31,847
[SPEAKER_09]: He did, what is it called?

520
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,789
[SPEAKER_09]: God, my mind is blank.

521
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:38,792
[SPEAKER_09]: The event on the Charles River, the head of the Charles, something like that.

522
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:43,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And he had a team there and they collected tons of plastic after the event.

523
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying he's going to do that.

524
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,239
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be his first time at this festival.

525
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:50,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I just heard about this.

526
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So he'll be showing his products.

527
00:42:53,262 --> 00:42:56,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Loretta, so the machine just makes it recyclable?

528
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:57,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what the machine does?

529
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:59,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can put it in your recycle?

530
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: The machine, you stuff your plastic into this little machine, it compresses it, it makes a puck, and then you drop it off, you know.

531
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:13,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he picks them up.

532
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:23,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, or he's hoping to get in areas with more high demand in the future, drop off boxes just with his company name on it.

533
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:27,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But now he has the pilot programs with retailers.

534
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:32,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm actually looking at the website right now.

535
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, me too.

536
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:45,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like it's about the size of a coffee maker and it looks like it heats up the plastic and kind of melts it into... Yeah, and then it compresses it.

537
00:43:45,858 --> 00:43:46,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

538
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I thought, oh, maybe we could recycle it after that.

539
00:43:49,664 --> 00:43:49,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

540
00:43:49,964 --> 00:44:00,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So Trex is one of the companies that, you know, makes products, the flooring, the Trex and furniture makers and other people.

541
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:04,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was, I think when he did the head of the child, that's what it's called.

542
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:18,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember seeing something about Market Basket actually helped pick up all the bags of plastic and sent them over to Trex or something like that, or maybe to his company, I don't know, something like that.

543
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:25,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's interesting that they have that option for now anyways.

544
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:31,804
[SPEAKER_09]: including all those plastic bags that they might get.

545
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:42,169
[SPEAKER_05]: In the About Us section, he does talk about the goal of having it be accepted as a densified plastic for curbside recycling.

546
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the moment, that may not be accepted.

547
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:50,114
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a different material, I guess.

548
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:53,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're both foods.

549
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:54,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

550
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:55,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

551
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Whole Foods does take it, and has all along.

552
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:06,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so this, you can then drop it off at Whole Foods?

553
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:07,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

554
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:07,665
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

555
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:18,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you can take the pucks, you know, the pressed plastic hockey puck kind of thing that's densely packed and drop it off at Whole Foods in Medford.

556
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:18,851
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to know.

557
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:32,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the Helpsie bin in front of the school that I had mentioned, Helpsie Material Recycling at the, I think it's the Curtis Tufts School on Main Street, South Medford.

558
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,579
[SPEAKER_09]: So there should be a bin outside there somewhere on the property.

559
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

560
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll pick his brain on Saturday.

561
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:46,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

562
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:50,322
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

563
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:56,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I hope to see most if not all of you at Harvest Your Energy at least a little bit.

564
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:04,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll show off a little bit and enjoy all the cool stuff going on.

565
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:28,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, next on the list here, uh, many of you are asking about getting our Medford Climate Action Plan, uh, in a way that we can monitor and look at ourselves, uh, just to be a sort of third party that's observing and making sure we are on track to do things, uh, correctly.

566
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,172
[SPEAKER_08]: and at a pace that is perhaps correct and right for what we're trying to do.

567
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:43,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it took a little bit of digging, but Brenda was able to find a copy that we are allowed to play with.

568
00:46:46,457 --> 00:46:58,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I can do is I can share my screen, but I'd love to have Brenda give a little pitch as to what we are and aren't allowed to do, just to be sure we're following the rules correctly.

569
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:07,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't see the screen yet.

570
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:09,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, iOS channels.

571
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:14,429
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you should see a really empty looking Excel spreadsheet to start.

572
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:15,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

573
00:47:18,011 --> 00:47:28,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can give a quick overview of what we do have, which is basically it's broken down into these sections down at the bottom.

574
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:35,587
[SPEAKER_08]: the overarching goal, but then more importantly, section by section here.

575
00:47:36,848 --> 00:47:51,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We have things ranging from buildings and energy, which have a string of objectives, ranging from retrofits to renewable energy systems, some of which we are on track to do and some of which we maybe haven't started.

576
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:57,966
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can see these updates have not really been updated.

577
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:11,781
[SPEAKER_08]: which I think is where we can come in and discuss where we think we are, how much effort we think is best employed from us and our group and where interests lie.

578
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:29,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can see we got transportation, buildings and energy, ecosystems, and the natural environment, including work of tree canopy preservation that we've already touched on, but then also some stormwater infrastructure that maybe we don't touch nearly as much.

579
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:33,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And then issues of public health.

580
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:38,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as we know, all these things are interconnected, interrelated.

581
00:48:39,354 --> 00:48:47,798
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's great to have these issues of equity also intertwined and tangled with all the things we need to be doing.

582
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:54,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe this was sent out to everyone with the agenda.

583
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:05,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So everyone has access to this, and it might make sense to have one shared copy that we can continuously update.

584
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:09,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So I might import this into a Google Doc that would allow for live edits.

585
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:22,392
[SPEAKER_08]: But the general idea is, as it was pitched to me at least by some of you, to have this as a potential project for a committee.

586
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:38,953
[SPEAKER_08]: One that as we see areas of interest that we are passionate about, things that we care about, or hear about projects that we think constitute success, or at least a substantial milestone towards some of these objectives, we can make notes.

587
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:49,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And we use this as a tool to remind ourselves and remind our legislators how far we're going and what still needs to get done.

588
00:49:52,497 --> 00:50:04,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I was going to say, do you think that it would be useful if we set aside a portion of each meeting for the next few months to just go through a section of this?

589
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:15,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, maybe not an entire tab at a time because I have been I do have a version of this where there are where I do have some notes in the update section.

590
00:50:15,703 --> 00:50:17,664
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't ready for public consumption yet.

591
00:50:18,945 --> 00:50:20,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just gave you guys the blank one right now.

592
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could, you know, go through and talk about each one in turn and where we think we are and what what info we need to find out.

593
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:35,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Miranda, so on that note, I have a question.

594
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:44,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand that what version you're working on right now is not ready for public consumption.

595
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:47,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But how can we reduce redundancy?

596
00:50:47,059 --> 00:51:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you've already input some information, do you have any thoughts on how we could avoid redundancy and really just focus our time and energy on something?

597
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,591
[SPEAKER_04]: very, you know, there's a gap.

598
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why I was suggesting maybe focusing on a certain section each time that we're we're meeting, because then I can, you know, make sure that I'm running by anything that we're going to be talking about past, you know, Alicia or the mayor if I needed to.

599
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So then for each section, we could be confident that we could we could talk in detail about these things.

600
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would add that the contacts that I have in here, I think they're up to date.

601
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:50,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as I've been going through and talking with people, um, these are the folks that I've been, uh, directed to, but it could be as we go along and we, we follow up, uh, for more information with some of them that those will change.

602
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And are all these contacts city staff people, or some of them like committee folks or.

603
00:52:04,903 --> 00:52:07,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they're all city staff people.

604
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:18,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that anybody outside of the city was identified as the lead or the city steward for a particular strategy.

605
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Although that was something Josh and I were actually in a meeting about lead for cities last week.

606
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:32,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that might be a useful thing to do to sort of

607
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:44,404
[SPEAKER_02]: to help to track our progress and document that and have it certified before we move along to the next action plan update.

608
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:57,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is a process that I'll be going through that will last for probably much of next year, it sounds like, the whole cohort model that they're using to do that.

609
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:05,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So this could help feed into the data we'd be collecting for that and getting certified.

610
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:17,764
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the interesting things about that was that I think it was that, or it was a representative city that they were using as an example for that.

611
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:32,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about each strategy having both a city staff lead and a community member lead, whether it's a nonprofit that's working on the subject or whatever.

612
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was a really interesting thing, having the sort of the marriage between the two.

613
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:38,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds cool.

614
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:49,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, first and foremost, I'd like to open it up for a brief discussion.

615
00:53:49,668 --> 00:53:55,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Just how do we feel about this, what could be potentially a substantial undertaking?

616
00:53:56,595 --> 00:54:10,402
[SPEAKER_08]: it would mean using a bit more of our time to do a little more research and compile sources and be something of a check on all the things that go on.

617
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:20,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a project that we as a full committee would like to undertake or as maybe a smaller subset of us, depending on wants and ability?

618
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:48,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be cool to do this because I know a lot of us have passions and projects, but also matching it up with having a yardstick, if you will, and really putting it back on to contributing to the goals of the city for sustainability, greener space.

619
00:54:48,138 --> 00:54:50,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be motivating.

620
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:56,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a big fan of this.

621
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:57,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Luke, please.

622
00:54:57,952 --> 00:54:59,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, thank you.

623
00:54:59,072 --> 00:55:00,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Josh.

624
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:10,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I am in agreement that it is very much in line with our kind of our charter, this work.

625
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:23,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can be helpful to the city, this is a good effort that can help support the community and the city's goals.

626
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:43,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps through focusing on a few of these items, we can also better understand or better prepare to provide more information to the community as well on these topics.

627
00:55:48,420 --> 00:56:16,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for me as a new member, this exercise will really help inform me as to the state of affairs and what opportunities there are for celebrating all the progress that Brenda gives us updates on every month, how we really are doing a lot of work and figuring out where our support as a volunteer group of experts will be valuable.

628
00:56:17,012 --> 00:56:27,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Luke, to your note on how this would be helpful, I think it'd be worth us thinking about not just, can it go deeper than an update?

629
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:41,297
[SPEAKER_07]: What is a unifying set of questions we ask or data that we're looking to gather so we can really strategically get to the bottom of each of these action items?

630
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:56,223
[SPEAKER_05]: The one concern is I'm on too many committees now.

631
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is reminding me of the current messages building codes.

632
00:57:05,446 --> 00:57:06,646
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot here.

633
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:09,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of these topics could be a deep dive.

634
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:23,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously there's a limited amount of time and so understanding kind of how much effort we're going to put in and over what period would be important.

635
00:57:24,078 --> 00:57:31,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So to Brenda's point again, focusing on one section and kind of tackling that would be helpful I think.

636
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:42,175
[SPEAKER_05]: and then working our way to the next, maybe we can prioritize which sections we want to focus on first too.

637
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it feels like something that perhaps as we choose to take on, Brenda, we can discuss which objectives need to be looked at.

638
00:58:00,422 --> 00:58:05,806
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, looking at some of these are much easier to parse than others, to Luke's point.

639
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:12,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I could imagine, I don't know, I'm looking at launching a cool Medford outreach campaign.

640
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Either it's done or it isn't.

641
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can just Google it to know if it happens.

642
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That will take about 12 seconds.

643
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:29,442
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you have some where it's, you know, how do we tabulate the extensive amounts of buildings that have or don't have solar and this, you know.

644
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:35,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anything is as cut and dry as it might seem.

645
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for instance, the cool Medford outreach campaign, I don't think there is a large outreach process that's happening directly to residents right now about that.

646
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:59,828
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a lot of work done with non-profit partners and getting them cooling kits and educating them about things like that so that they can then help to, especially at events that they're doing, get word out to people.

647
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:05,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's nuances to all of this that unfortunately is going to take some time.

648
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:34,961
[SPEAKER_08]: But if this is something that we choose to pursue, which it sounds like people seem to already be at least in agreement that it's an important thing to be thinking and talking about, I can do some brainstorming along with Brenda to see how to do it in a way that feels manageable and respectful of the amount of time it would probably take.

649
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:43,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to be mindful of all the time we have and do not have.

650
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:59,062
[SPEAKER_08]: But knowing this, I'm ready to go forward and start pestering Brenda all about it and see if we can make this into a formal activity for our meetings.

651
01:00:04,118 --> 01:00:09,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this will be really helpful too, because I could continue collecting data for this forever.

652
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:18,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having something that's more public like this, that is more sort of putting a pin on things as we talk through them will be really helpful.

653
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:28,332
[SPEAKER_08]: As a side note, it could also be something that can and probably should be publicized.

654
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:37,178
[SPEAKER_08]: As we get a new check mark, maybe after a meeting, I can post it onto social media and say, look, our bar just got a little bit bigger.

655
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:40,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Things are looking a little bit cleaner, a little bit greener.

656
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:42,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

657
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:51,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it gets to showcase that people are thinking about this and that Medford's making progress that a lot of people maybe aren't seeing day to day.

658
01:00:52,202 --> 01:00:56,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love this piece a lot more because it also involves community engagement, right?

659
01:00:57,173 --> 01:00:57,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

660
01:00:58,736 --> 01:00:59,217
[SPEAKER_04]: All for it.

661
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:11,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the magnitude of the task, looking at this, the, uh, on the, on the sidebar, it looks like you've moved down the sheet, like 1% or 2%.

662
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:12,875
[SPEAKER_06]: How deep does this go?

663
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:13,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this just keep going?

664
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:14,635
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not that bad.

665
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:15,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Not terribly.

666
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:18,156
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they put down... They copied and pasted.

667
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

668
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:22,016
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a thousand and one rows, but most of them aren't used.

669
01:01:22,617 --> 01:01:22,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully.

670
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:26,217
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I've scrolled to the bottom of each page just over the course of us talking.

671
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:29,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's, there's no more than three objectives per section.

672
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:30,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

673
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:31,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

674
01:01:32,408 --> 01:01:32,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Will?

675
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:33,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

676
01:01:34,009 --> 01:01:37,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you print out a copy of that and bring it to the table?

677
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we can spend some time looking at it.

678
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:44,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think that's a great idea.

679
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:48,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And other people in the group can come by and look at it.

680
01:01:50,495 --> 01:01:54,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some time that we won't be engaged directly with the public.

681
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We can engage indirectly with the public by doing that.

682
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:11,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, but just maybe even just an informal inventory of the tables at the event might help inform you to see where you're at here too.

683
01:02:12,658 --> 01:02:16,919
[SPEAKER_08]: See what people are talking about, see who's showing up and putting in those hours with us.

684
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is a wonderful idea.

685
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else good for the order?

686
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I'm just super excited to get this one started.

687
01:02:35,683 --> 01:02:40,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been brought up a couple of times, and each time I go, gosh, we should really get started, huh?

688
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:43,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy to launch this properly.

689
01:02:47,365 --> 01:02:55,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we will get things prepped and ready for Harvester Energy Festival as probably an impromptu in-person soft launch.

690
01:02:56,147 --> 01:03:01,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We get to just chat about it, look at it all in person, and discuss a little informally

691
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:17,973
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, we got about 10-ish minutes that I wanted to devote to little updates for our projects.

692
01:03:20,906 --> 01:03:26,392
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are things that you need help with, major updates that we should be aware of.

693
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:35,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Trees Medford is always cooking along and we should always have an ear listening for our trees.

694
01:03:40,637 --> 01:03:52,623
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, if there's anything on people's minds, projects where they need assistance from the greater group, I want to set aside these 10 minutes for that.

695
01:03:54,184 --> 01:04:07,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, speaking of Trees Medford, do we want to invite someone from the consultant who's doing the master plan to our next meeting to talk about

696
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:15,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The master plan and how the inventory went and where we're where we are moving forward with that.

697
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:18,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some discussion of it.

698
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:20,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are really sobering.

699
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:29,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to be a little bit more depressing than our greenhouse gas inventory, but I think it's really important to have that context as we move forward.

700
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:32,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like a deeply important one.

701
01:04:33,356 --> 01:04:34,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So I say yes.

702
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:35,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be good.

703
01:04:35,196 --> 01:04:36,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be good, Brenda.

704
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:40,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would invite TreesMedfit to that, too.

705
01:04:40,538 --> 01:04:43,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know they've talked to Western Samson.

706
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be great.

707
01:04:47,361 --> 01:05:00,466
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been some sobering reckoning about the tree canopy because of the Norway Naples, which are deteriorating rapidly.

708
01:05:01,882 --> 01:05:13,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are not building back tree canopy at a pace that will make, I mean, we're like 100 years behind.

709
01:05:13,045 --> 01:05:16,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very sobering.

710
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the discussion isn't increasing the tree canopy, it's trying to slow down the decline of the tree canopy.

711
01:05:24,648 --> 01:05:26,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

712
01:05:33,383 --> 01:05:35,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll, Brenda, you'll invite her or, I mean.

713
01:05:36,405 --> 01:05:37,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will.

714
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:39,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll reach out.

715
01:05:39,987 --> 01:05:41,108
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, yeah, please.

716
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:45,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give them at least an hour to say whatever they need to tell me.

717
01:05:45,531 --> 01:05:49,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And ways we can help.

718
01:05:49,454 --> 01:05:57,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they can give us some pathways that we can follow as a committee and individually.

719
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:05,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd love to learn more about like Councillor Callahan's canopy crew effort.

720
01:06:07,336 --> 01:06:11,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That feels potentially really actionable, especially for folks on this committee.

721
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I could talk just for a minute.

722
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:26,363
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I've been working on off and on, but it's been a little bit of a struggle.

723
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:27,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope to get back to that.

724
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:31,376
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's okay to talk, I don't know if there was someone ahead of me.

725
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:34,898
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm leaving this as more of an open.

726
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:35,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

727
01:06:35,898 --> 01:06:51,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the concerns across the United States, but in Massachusetts, in something that I had brought up for Methodist, not using rodenticides for rodent control.

728
01:06:51,384 --> 01:06:51,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

729
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:58,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get back to that after the festival, doing some more research.

730
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:13,770
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one particular group, Save Arlington Wildlife, has done a tremendous job with informing and keeping track of the cities that have agreed to ban it on municipal

731
01:07:14,623 --> 01:07:31,856
[SPEAKER_09]: owned properties, that's the rodenticide called escars, which kills also not just the rodents, but also, unfortunately, the predators and pets and contaminates our land and water.

732
01:07:33,357 --> 01:07:43,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So many municipalities have actually agreed to not use this particular form of rodenticide

733
01:07:45,093 --> 01:07:51,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's for municipal owned buildings or managed buildings, which is a great thing.

734
01:07:51,557 --> 01:07:53,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're building the list.

735
01:07:53,578 --> 01:08:00,381
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably have the list already, but it seems like every month, another, every few months, another city signs on to that.

736
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:04,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope to be in touch with them to learn more about that.

737
01:08:05,184 --> 01:08:08,065
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, they've actually gotten billboards up.

738
01:08:10,742 --> 01:08:15,086
[SPEAKER_09]: in different locations that say, you know, stop using rodenticides and why.

739
01:08:15,126 --> 01:08:20,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And they show pictures of the other animals that are getting killed by this when they eat these rodents that are poisoned.

740
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,972
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens is they're bludged.

741
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:32,780
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a dog, it could be a cat, an opossum, birds, owls, anything that would go after a rodent, foxes in particular.

742
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:38,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just horrific death because they can't handle that kind of poison and they bleed out.

743
01:08:39,425 --> 01:09:02,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and unfortunately the, what is it called, the pesticide company, companies and organizations are against this and have been fighting this and actually going up to cities asking them to not pass any of these bans because that's their business.

744
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:05,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the, unfortunately that's,

745
01:09:07,639 --> 01:09:08,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

746
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:15,004
[SPEAKER_09]: What they think is effective, and they sell that, and they put it in the black bait boxes that you see.

747
01:09:15,024 --> 01:09:30,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really sad because there are other strategies like rodent birth control, which diminishes the reproduction because they do have blitters a lot, like every six weeks.

748
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:35,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of the warming of the climate, we see more and more rodents.

749
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:58,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I've been involved with this for a while, but to get it to a point where I can speak better about that and get actual information, I had said before a few months ago, I'd like to see how the health department feels about this first, because if they're not on board with it, you know, it's very hard to get something like this as a city ordinance.

750
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where I'm at.

751
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to give the update on this.

752
01:10:04,558 --> 01:10:06,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you had any questions about it.

753
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to maybe give a positive notice in my backyard.

754
01:10:11,363 --> 01:10:14,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have cameras in my backyard that I really watch the animals with, you know.

755
01:10:15,225 --> 01:10:17,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a pack of foxes here now.

756
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:26,213
[SPEAKER_06]: They're little, but it has really diminished the rodent population in my backyard a lot, like significantly, that I'm noticing.

757
01:10:26,713 --> 01:10:28,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good news.

758
01:10:28,835 --> 01:10:33,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have to say, I kind of have a little bit of a fox problem now, but

759
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:39,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's what they eat mainly, is rodents, right?

760
01:10:39,908 --> 01:10:42,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

761
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:50,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are other rodenticides that you can purchase that don't cause the anticoagulant bleeding out.

762
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:58,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I was wondering if, like the birth control one, does that affect the birth cycles of the foxes?

763
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it transmit that way?

764
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:04,478
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, we actually tried it.

765
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,045
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy it on Amazon now too.

766
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:11,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Evolve, I think it's called.

767
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:13,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to get the little black box.

768
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:18,758
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, you know, it's like $60 for a three or five pound bag.

769
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like little sausages.

770
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like that.

771
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And you put it in the big traps and they're attracted to it.

772
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:29,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, some cities have done it as a targeted area.

773
01:11:30,128 --> 01:11:31,369
[SPEAKER_09]: It's expensive for cities.

774
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:37,194
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you pick a targeted small area, the problem is, you know, somebody has to keep going and filling these up.

775
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:42,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not suggesting that yet to the city.

776
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:47,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to see if they would consider banning the companies they use.

777
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:48,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And they may already.

778
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:55,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be surprised and they might say, we know about this already and we don't allow them to use this type of rosenticide.

779
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:57,604
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll get back to you on that.

780
01:11:57,804 --> 01:12:01,968
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the meantime, I had a really good situation with

781
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:07,097
[SPEAKER_09]: a property near me, so that really kept me going.

782
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:11,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is about sailing up the property and not keeping your rubbish barrels open.

783
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: We literally had over 100 rats next to- Oh my.

784
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:26,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I have not been, it was like a full-time job actually handling this with neighbors because people will even leave their rubbish open.

785
01:12:26,323 --> 01:12:31,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you feed the rats, they're gonna come.

786
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:33,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

787
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:41,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if the floor is open again.

788
01:12:41,973 --> 01:12:45,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Loretta.

789
01:12:47,175 --> 01:12:48,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get to the next topic?

790
01:12:48,976 --> 01:12:50,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have probably two minutes left.

791
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:52,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Plenty of time, please.

792
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:05,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I brought it up last week at our MEEC monthly meeting and then I had a chat with separately with Luke and Will.

793
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:07,893
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about zero waste medford.

794
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:15,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We touched on it briefly the last meeting and we discussed about the

795
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:23,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibility of starting a subcommittee zero waste subcommittee zero waste Medford subcommittee.

796
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just to again, circle back to some of our discussions.

797
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:40,075
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our efforts are already geared towards waste reduction and will point it out in a nice bullet format or black plastic.

798
01:13:42,997 --> 01:13:47,699
[SPEAKER_04]: reduction, the free flea market, the repair clinics.

799
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:52,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are undertaking a lot of efforts that are geared towards waste reduction.

800
01:13:53,542 --> 01:14:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe we want to get the support of the committee to start a subcommittee for zero waste Medford so that we could be, you know, a group of us could

801
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:21,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Work in a more focused manner on really just defining some of the plans for what the subcommittee would do.

802
01:14:21,737 --> 01:14:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I would like to hear any thoughts and inputs and however we want to take this forward.

803
01:14:28,641 --> 01:14:31,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to.

804
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Clarify about the subcommittee, so I, I was warned by Alicia that her understanding is that if we have an official subcommittee that it's something that has to be have open public meetings.

805
01:14:45,972 --> 01:14:46,613
[SPEAKER_02]: If you meet, so I, I.

806
01:14:50,277 --> 01:15:09,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of hesitate to to say we should have a zero waste subcommittee and instead maybe just have some people who in the same way that we're working, each person is sort of working or groups of people are working on different side projects, a group of people who are focusing on zero waste, but not making it an official subcommittee.

807
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:18,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like it would complicate things if every time you met to talk about that, you had to have a public meeting.

808
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:31,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so any meeting, if it is a subcommittee and if there's any meeting to discuss agenda or whatever, it has to be a public meeting.

809
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:32,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

810
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for my understanding.

811
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:35,670
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have been told.

812
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's an official subcommittee, then meetings have to be open to the public.

813
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:55,573
[SPEAKER_09]: not a subcommittee that just meets to talk about projects and ideas, and we don't vote on anything.

814
01:15:56,033 --> 01:16:01,676
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we would have done previously before you had started helping with this.

815
01:16:02,056 --> 01:16:08,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm told that it's the difference between having an official subcommittee and just having groups of people who are working on different projects.

816
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,502
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may jump in, because

817
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:22,487
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Loretta and Curtis and I acted as a perhaps unofficial, I don't even know, subcommittee for the tree committee way back when.

818
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:30,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had done similar things for a variety of approaches, but that's many years ago now.

819
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:36,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I guess the question is, whether it's an official subcommittee or not,

820
01:16:37,675 --> 01:16:51,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there, I guess, some open meeting law requirements, even just if a few of us as committee members gather and discuss committee-related topics?

821
01:16:52,359 --> 01:17:01,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Would zero waste, for instance, be considered if a few of us took that on as a project?

822
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:15,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, would we be running into any open meeting law issues or only if you had enough people participating that it that it was a quorum for for the group?

823
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:23,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if you're just, you know, some members of this committee who are getting together to to work on things and to prepare for these meetings, that's that's 1 thing.

824
01:17:23,492 --> 01:17:28,194
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an official subcommittee, then that are, you know, there are 3 of you.

825
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:31,096
[SPEAKER_02]: If 2 of you get together, that's a quorum of that subcommittee.

826
01:17:31,116 --> 01:17:31,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

827
01:17:32,818 --> 01:17:37,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what if we call them working groups, right?

828
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of subcommittees?

829
01:17:41,486 --> 01:17:47,090
[SPEAKER_08]: The project, I've been very deliberate about how we phrased our passion projects.

830
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:55,117
[SPEAKER_08]: With this, this expressly in mind, we can tackle a lot of passion projects on our own.

831
01:17:56,018 --> 01:18:00,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We cannot discuss subcommittees as openly.

832
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:08,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, without falling into a whole bunch of requirements that need to be followed.

833
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:17,170
[SPEAKER_08]: But here, at least we're able to, we could convene and talk about these sorts of things unofficially and then represent them to the larger group.

834
01:18:18,717 --> 01:18:28,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So a working group, we could call ourselves a working group or like the project group, but just the word subcommittee seems like it has a little bit of a legal, okay.

835
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it may also be the number of people.

836
01:18:34,081 --> 01:18:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if we call it a working group, if there are five of us who are all

837
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:50,273
[SPEAKER_05]: energy committee members, we are technically kind of, I don't know what the number is, but if... It's eight for the quorum.

838
01:18:50,454 --> 01:18:50,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

839
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:51,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

840
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:53,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can have seven people working on this.

841
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:55,178
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not so bad.

842
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:57,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.

843
01:18:58,001 --> 01:19:01,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought open meeting was a little bit more strict than that, but okay.

844
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:02,966
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

845
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:04,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, good.

846
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:10,678
[SPEAKER_08]: So all this to say, the potential is certainly there, just we'll be very cognizant of our verbiage.

847
01:19:11,299 --> 01:19:12,219
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

848
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:18,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, again, you're right in saying we have a lot of zero waste projects that we're undertaking.

849
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:23,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be really important that we talk about them and move them in meaningful ways.

850
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:31,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We better not call them passion sessions, because inevitably social media will pick up on it right away.

851
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, and Prabita, feel free to edit this suggestion, but maybe we

852
01:19:47,090 --> 01:20:07,324
[SPEAKER_05]: suggest that there will be a small working group to focus on zero waste in Medford, and we will report to this group when we can on some zero waste ideas that the group then as a whole could perhaps help move forward.

853
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:09,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that sounds great.

854
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That pretty much sums it up.

855
01:20:12,768 --> 01:20:12,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

856
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:17,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm checking with legal and I think it checks out.

857
01:20:17,435 --> 01:20:19,580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not sub, working group.

858
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,261
Right.

859
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:40,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And to kick off that part of the working group, I'm in a tense battle with Tufts University Legal on how to get fix-it clinics spread out on Tufts campus.

860
01:20:40,683 --> 01:20:41,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

861
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:44,685
[SPEAKER_08]: As a way of expanding that zero waste policy.

862
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:52,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be spending a good hour of my day tomorrow convincing them that taking apart your phone will... Why is it a legal issue now?

863
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:54,111
[SPEAKER_08]: They really are worried about liability.

864
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:57,956
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's becoming a much bigger fight than it needs to be.

865
01:20:57,976 --> 01:21:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: If it gets into real tech, that can be a problem.

866
01:21:03,839 --> 01:21:11,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Fix-it clinics typically are a bit more like, my fan is broken, and I need to fix that, or my bike is broken.

867
01:21:12,222 --> 01:21:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't do like Apple phones and stuff, is that the legal issue?

868
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:22,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That starts to get into, yeah, like real... So we're seeing how much we can... I'm seeing how much I can get away with

869
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:27,888
[SPEAKER_08]: But reality is we're going to see what is allowed to happen.

870
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:34,830
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're expanding that as another arm of this not subcommittee.

871
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:36,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

872
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:37,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Not subcommittee.

873
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:39,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero waste, not subcommittee.

874
01:21:39,671 --> 01:21:40,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call it that.

875
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Will, I gather you are connected to the FixIt clinic?

876
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:50,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was a policy advocate for a long time.

877
01:21:51,754 --> 01:21:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a FixIt helper on a number of events.

878
01:21:58,876 --> 01:21:59,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fantastic.

879
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So could we highlight any FixIt events too, then, as part of our event highlights?

880
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:23,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know I'm jumping into the new business section, but I do want to make one formal on-the-record pitch once again that we get some form of social media access.

881
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:30,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you opened, Brenda, by talking about how the Climate Equity Council is hosting events, and I got very jealous.

882
01:22:32,754 --> 01:22:44,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the very least, advertising really important metrics and things within our broad scope of energy and environment.

883
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure everyone hears about that.

884
01:22:49,627 --> 01:23:00,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can discuss in our own not subcommittee what that needs to look like and what that needs to mean, because I know some things pre-exist and some things don't.

885
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:10,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we'd like to see our own things get pushed out into the great wide somewhere as well.

886
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:23,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, we have my department's newsletter and social media, which was what we've been using in the past for these things.

887
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:31,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we can talk next time if you want to do something more than that.

888
01:23:32,253 --> 01:23:38,617
[SPEAKER_08]: With a minute left on the clock, do we have any new business, anything good for this committee to hear about?

889
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:41,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Something you really want to get on record?

890
01:23:42,574 --> 01:23:46,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was supposed to give the update about the treaty committee ordinance.

891
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:49,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was, unless that was bumped off the agenda.

892
01:23:51,180 --> 01:24:03,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's the tree committee ordinance by trees Medford passed the second meeting and I paid attention to the city council meeting last Tuesday and they moved the agenda around and I waited and waited and waited.

893
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:10,029
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm assuming it went past the second meeting and they just said, yes, and they gave it a document number.

894
01:24:10,049 --> 01:24:15,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, where was, so it will be up for the third meeting, the tree committee.

895
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:19,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a expected date for that?

896
01:24:20,016 --> 01:24:22,018
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't know when.

897
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:23,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know when.

898
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,885
[SPEAKER_08]: We will keep our eyes peeled.

899
01:24:27,966 --> 01:24:28,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Very exciting.

900
01:24:32,572 --> 01:24:32,873
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

901
01:24:33,213 --> 01:24:34,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Any lingering business?

902
01:24:37,295 --> 01:24:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Related to Trees Medford, Lois put me in touch with Jared from Trees Medford and we are working on a pocket forest, the Miyawaki forest.

903
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's quite exciting.

904
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:59,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in a future meeting, we can bring a couple of people to just talk about it.

905
01:24:59,443 --> 01:25:02,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we've decided the location to be at Tufts Park.

906
01:25:03,304 --> 01:25:04,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super cool.

907
01:25:04,804 --> 01:25:09,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning a lot, but I think it'll be very nice to hear from those folks at some point.

908
01:25:11,465 --> 01:25:17,667
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could maybe start an email chain, I would love to make November our tree session.

909
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're going to have our surveyor come in, we can get our Trees Medford folks in as well and make that devoted to, make that a kind of themed session.

910
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:33,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

911
01:25:33,455 --> 01:25:43,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll start an email chain between you and Jared and we can... Minute pass.

912
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:45,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything anyone has to say?

913
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:50,482
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a meeting, actually regarding trees in the Memorial Grove.

914
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:54,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Brenda, do you know what everybody's inviting?

915
01:25:56,393 --> 01:25:59,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's next, is it this week or did it happen already?

916
01:25:59,275 --> 01:26:00,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it happened on Sunday.

917
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, was it Sunday already?

918
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:03,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

919
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:05,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm thinking of the Tufts Community Day.

920
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,941
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the same day?

921
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:09,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same day.

922
01:26:09,863 --> 01:26:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

923
01:26:11,724 --> 01:26:12,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

924
01:26:12,305 --> 01:26:17,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that project is funded through the city, maybe some grant.

925
01:26:18,529 --> 01:26:23,713
[SPEAKER_09]: But the new project that they're working on with Jared in Milwaukee,

926
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:27,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyawaki Forest.

927
01:26:28,492 --> 01:26:30,835
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be looking to see how to fund that.

928
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:34,838
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is an interesting concept.

929
01:26:35,559 --> 01:26:40,123
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to apply to the community grant funds.

930
01:26:40,163 --> 01:26:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: This week we're meeting to apply to a couple of funds.

931
01:26:44,027 --> 01:26:47,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking to Teresa as well.

932
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like an update on the COVID Memorial Grove, I can talk to Amanda Centrella in my office who's sort of heading that up.

933
01:26:59,472 --> 01:27:02,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I just brought it up in case the rest of the members didn't know about it.

934
01:27:03,754 --> 01:27:06,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw the plans are on the city website.

935
01:27:06,194 --> 01:27:08,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they were actually.

936
01:27:08,235 --> 01:27:08,935
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very pretty.

937
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:10,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Very pretty.

938
01:27:16,037 --> 01:27:16,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I have to say.

939
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

940
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:25,432
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes me excited to have a bunch of new things to talk about with you all next month.

941
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:28,814
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

942
01:27:30,134 --> 01:27:33,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've wound down all the things I could talk about.

943
01:27:36,858 --> 01:27:38,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll meet again on the 18th.

944
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

945
01:27:39,559 --> 01:27:40,880
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

946
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:41,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

947
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:42,941
[SPEAKER_03]: In person.

948
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:43,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

949
01:27:44,242 --> 01:27:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.

950
01:27:49,164 --> 01:27:51,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Any final movements of the evening?

951
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:55,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.

952
01:27:56,049 --> 01:27:56,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

953
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:57,810
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

954
01:27:58,831 --> 01:27:59,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It is done.

955
01:27:59,492 --> 01:27:59,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

956
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:03,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for a wonderful session.

957
01:28:03,535 --> 01:28:04,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

958
01:28:04,255 --> 01:28:04,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

959
01:28:06,737 --> 01:28:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: See you on the 18th.

960
01:28:08,098 --> 01:28:09,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

961
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:15,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.
