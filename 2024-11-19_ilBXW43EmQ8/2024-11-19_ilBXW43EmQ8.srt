30
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,223

31
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:05,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see Mary Ann.

32
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there she is.

33
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:09,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, Mary Ann.

34
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:11,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everyone.

35
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:11,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

36
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann, if you can give us a brief update of what's happening with the vaccinations.

37
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

38
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,469
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of things I want to go over first.

39
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk a little bit about the case counts and what we're seeing happening here in Medford.

40
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:31,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you've heard

41
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:38,561
[SPEAKER_07]: on the news lately that everyone is seeing an uptick in cases and that's certainly happening here in Medford.

42
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:52,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want everyone to be aware that while we seem to be opening things back up and vaccines are on the horizon and things look good, we are definitely seeing an uptick.

43
00:02:52,187 --> 00:03:01,551
[SPEAKER_07]: We're certainly not seeing an uptick like we did with the winter surge, but we were at our lowest in February with 81 cases a week.

44
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:21,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And as of last week we had 121 cases just last week and our positivity rate is climbing, you know, from a low in February of point seven five and now we're at 1.28 so I just really want people to be aware that we still need to be

45
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,930
[SPEAKER_07]: paying close attention to the guidelines.

46
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We know what we need to do and we just have to do it until all the vaccines are out there and we're good.

47
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:44,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And the age distribution is pretty interesting in that in March to date, we've had 356 cases this month alone.

48
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not a good trend, right?

49
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:53,958
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't wanna see that.

50
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:57,660
[SPEAKER_07]: But 319 of the 356 are people under 60 years of age.

51
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Half of those 356 are people under the age of 30.

52
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:12,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, these are folks who aren't qualified yet for vaccinations, but yet we feel like the spring is here.

53
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:15,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all kind of sick and tired of social distancing and wearing masks.

54
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:21,736
[SPEAKER_07]: and we know hope is on the horizon, but it's not time to let down our dad.

55
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:27,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanna really make that message loud and clear.

56
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Vaccination updates, we're going okay.

57
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:40,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, the state is still very flat in their distribution and what they're getting from the feds.

58
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like the federal government is really boosting up their,

59
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: federal pharmacy programs.

60
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:53,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll see more CVS is coming online, go to cvs.com.

61
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:09,451
[SPEAKER_07]: The feds goal is to really have people say 90 90 goal to have folks 90% of the people within five miles of local pharmacies is what they're thinking.

62
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,334
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are going to be upticking these the CVS

63
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:16,076
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution, which is really the main distribution here in Massachusetts.

64
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I think a lot more Walgreens will be coming online as well.

65
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:26,259
[SPEAKER_07]: We did finish up our homebound second doses this week.

66
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,020
[SPEAKER_07]: We finished up 90 homebound individuals.

67
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:36,283
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another 66 second doses of homebound to do.

68
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And the state has opened now their homebound program

69
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:51,645
[SPEAKER_07]: and people can access that homebound program through calling the state number, which is 833-983-0485.

70
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:57,930
[SPEAKER_07]: We as the local board of health here at Medford have chosen to do our own homebound.

71
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:07,297
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not having people have to go through the state program, but if they call that number, they will be referred to us and put on a list.

72
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:12,275
[SPEAKER_07]: We are expecting to receive vaccines from the state for our homebound.

73
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:21,243
[SPEAKER_07]: They are supposed to be Johnson & Johnson, the J&J, the Janssen, the one-shot deal that you're one and done.

74
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:25,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are expecting to receive those within the next week or so.

75
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So if people want to be put on that list, they can either call us directly or call that state number.

76
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:35,955
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be doing our second round of doses for the

77
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:39,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford Housing Authority next week.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,983
[SPEAKER_07]: We have three clinics scheduled for Tampone, Walden, Walden, and Wockling next week.

79
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:54,525
[SPEAKER_07]: We did do 462 residents of our housing authority.

80
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:59,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So within the next week or two, they will all be receiving their second dose.

81
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:01,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's good news.

82
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We are part of that housing authority program with the state as well.

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,020
[SPEAKER_07]: One more update.

84
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:16,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our new public health nurse on board, Sarah Harris, who I'd love to introduce you to soon.

85
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:18,404
[SPEAKER_07]: She's great.

86
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, many of you do know that Janet, our longtime 13-year public health nurse, retired last September, but hung on with us, gratefully, thankfully, until this month, working as a retired nurse.

87
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:40,672
[SPEAKER_07]: to do all the contact tracing and all the help with this pandemic.

88
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:41,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Janet.

89
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:48,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But Sarah is on board now and Janet can finally officially retire and Sarah will be taking over.

90
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to introduce you to Sarah soon.

91
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

92
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Marianne, it sure sounds like there's a lot going on in your office.

93
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:00,629
[SPEAKER_11]: You're pretty busy, isn't that correct?

94
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,950
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

95
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:17,055
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many I guess you're putting in on average, you and your staff.

96
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:22,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know a lot.

97
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:27,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's well, seven days a week, basically.

98
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,518
[SPEAKER_11]: So 12 hours a day, seven days a week.

99
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Close to sometimes Yeah.

100
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And then how many how many members do you have in your staff up there?

101
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh gosh, we're all working extremely hard.

102
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:53,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have three inspectors, my prevention and outreach staff who have been amazing and totally turned around their worlds and helped with this.

103
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:58,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's Brooke and Penny and Sarar and Alicia.

104
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:06,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so everybody's really been putting 100% towards COVID as well as trying to cover and do their grant work

105
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,305
[SPEAKER_07]: They're real jobs.

106
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:10,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus this new permitting thing, huh?

107
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:13,788
[SPEAKER_11]: With LaConti and home.

108
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,710
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not new.

109
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's a safety guideline we've been trying to do since the emergency orders were put in place.

110
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:26,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing safety checks, safety plans on all events.

111
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:28,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's nothing really new.

112
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So you think your office has the capacity based upon the number of hours that everybody's putting in right now to do these?

113
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,961
[SPEAKER_11]: pre-screenings of applications for people that are looking to rent the Hormel Stadium on the Coffey Rink?

114
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:40,841
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been doing that.

115
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:43,141
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been doing that since the beginning.

116
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:48,662
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was never a pre-screening before you could apply or get placement.

117
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:49,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It should have been.

118
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,143
[SPEAKER_11]: It should have been.

119
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:52,203
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the intent.

120
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to be a pre-screening before approval.

121
00:09:55,684 --> 00:10:02,825
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the intent, and that was what was put in place for all events, not just Hormel or anywhere else, but all events.

122
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:11,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So so how's this going to work now can you just explain to me based upon you know the fact that your office is going to be handling the majority of these requests how this permitting is going to work for home Ellen my look on it.

123
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,881
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing this since the beginning of Council night I'm sorry I don't understand.

124
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:23,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone who submits it needs to have it wants to have an event has to submit a safety plan.

125
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has always been in place.

126
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:28,865
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact that we got an email this morning saying that they've made.

127
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:35,937
[SPEAKER_11]: a number of changes to the way that two of our revenue-generating properties that we have here in the community are gonna be conducted.

128
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:47,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, previously the way it worked would be that the applicant would seek placement at La Conte O'Hamel, they'd be provided placement, they'd be put in the schedule, they'd then have to go through a screening process.

129
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:58,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it looks like that process is backwards or different, it seems like, from what I understood from this email that I got from Mayor Ungo, that she's taking control of some of the authority that the O'Hamel Commission has.

130
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:03,588
[SPEAKER_11]: relative to how they're supposed to be, you know, scheduling and booking events.

131
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:09,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And where these are two revenue generating facilities that we have here in the community.

132
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, they're very successful.

133
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,535
[SPEAKER_11]: If it ain't broken, don't try to fix it.

134
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:21,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I can answer that quite frankly, that it wasn't happening the way it was supposed to happen.

135
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: No events were supposed to be approved or scheduled prior to having approval from the Board of Health on their safety plans.

136
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:39,901
[SPEAKER_07]: What was happening is that events were scheduled and approved and then given to the Board of Health and then realizing you're gonna have a thousand spectators at an event?

137
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,642
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's not approved.

138
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And these events were already being scheduled.

139
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:53,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why the change has been made because what was happening, what was put in place with the emergency orders was not actually happening.

140
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was not getting the ability

141
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:04,145
[SPEAKER_07]: to approve these events prior to the event hosts thinking they were approved.

142
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why things changed.

143
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:08,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what happened with Ellington Catholic?

144
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

145
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

146
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:11,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

147
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:12,992
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes sense, though.

148
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:17,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if they have a plan that's in place, I mean, the CDC guidelines are going to be controlling it.

149
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:18,856
[SPEAKER_11]: You know,

150
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:22,117
[SPEAKER_11]: we're really... They weren't following the guidelines.

151
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:23,178
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the problem.

152
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:26,179
[SPEAKER_07]: They were approved prior to being approved.

153
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me tell you what, every single event that took place down there.

154
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,902
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm pretty sure, you know, they may or may not have.

155
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:32,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's a blood accusation.

156
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:39,126
[SPEAKER_11]: In any organization that hasn't followed the CDC guidelines, I'm sure that your office has taken the appropriate steps to find them and document such, right?

157
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:43,968
[SPEAKER_07]: If they weren't, they shouldn't have been approved to begin with if they hadn't had proof of them.

158
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:49,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everybody knows what the CDC guidelines are, or they think they do, but then they change the next day.

159
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:55,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why our office was charged with reviewing all of these safety plans prior to approval.

160
00:12:56,065 --> 00:13:01,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, they were getting approved prior to us even seeing these events.

161
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,227
[SPEAKER_07]: But wouldn't it make sense- That's what happened.

162
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but that's what happened.

163
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:15,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't it make it more sense from a number one, a consistency of government standpoint, number two, an operational standpoint that- No, not in a pandemic, I'm sorry.

164
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,332
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they need to come to the Board of Health first for approval.

165
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:19,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done talking, Rick.

166
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:19,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

167
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:25,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to be able to finish, Mr. President, so I'll just stop right now.

168
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:25,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

169
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mary Ann, for your update.

170
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:45,673
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like, again, the clarion call is needed to say that we are not out of the woods and that we are months away, if not several months away, from being able to

171
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:49,426
[SPEAKER_06]: have gatherings or, you know, anything like that.

172
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:58,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I just appreciate you noting that the cases are back on the rise, uh, and that we aren't, you know, we haven't even, we aren't even at the levels we were at last summer.

173
00:13:59,171 --> 00:13:59,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

174
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:02,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are still above the levels we were at last summer.

175
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, when, you know, we, that was the lowest we've been since this started.

176
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:11,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I just wanted to ask, um, has there been any discussion

177
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:16,127
[SPEAKER_06]: of slowing down Medford's progression through the reopening phases.

178
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of local communities have said that they feel the governor's approach has been too aggressive.

179
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just wondering if you had discussed that or if there was anything on the horizon on that front.

180
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking at the data.

181
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,749
[SPEAKER_07]: We're monitoring it closely.

182
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,950
[SPEAKER_07]: If need be, we may have to.

183
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But at this point right now with the data, we're okay.

184
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,311
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it continues,

185
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:45,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It certainly is something we may need to look at rolling back on some of the openings.

186
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:47,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Marianne.

187
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,308
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I just think we need to stay strong.

188
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:55,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want our summer to be ruined by trying to do too much this spring.

189
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:58,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So stay safe and get a vaccine.

190
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Marianne.

191
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Marianne, thank you for your update.

193
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:12,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to mention that I did have an opportunity to visit the website this weekend.

194
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:25,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw the new pie charts with all of the data with regard to COVID and the different populations that hits and basically you split out, I think by ages as well.

195
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought that was actually a good addition to the website.

196
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:34,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It just tells a better story or a very accurate story as to who it's hitting and who it's not hitting.

197
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,346
[SPEAKER_09]: that type of thing.

198
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank you for that.

199
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:46,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to welcome Sarah Harris and also congratulations to and thank you to Janet who retired.

200
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:50,034
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say thank you for, I think you said it's 15 years of service.

201
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, thank her for her service to the community.

202
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:56,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

203
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:57,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

204
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the Board of Health Director for being on tonight.

205
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Ann, could you give us a brief update on where we stand with our application to be a mass vaccination site?

206
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:10,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And where do we stand with the Tufts University proposal?

207
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, good.

208
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:13,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for bringing that up.

209
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have been approved by the state to be a regional vaccination site.

210
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:24,516
[SPEAKER_07]: We were given that approval last week, maybe, maybe the week before.

211
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:48,241
[SPEAKER_07]: can't remember, all the weeks went together, but we are still waiting to hear from them, from the state that is, like I said, the state's vaccine allocation has been kind of flattened from the feds as they focus on their federal pharmacy program and the federal community health center programs that they're dealing with now.

212
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:57,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were told by the state that we could have vaccine as early as three five, which is next week.

213
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:57,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

214
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,023
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have not heard an update from them since.

215
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was their hope to have us actually receiving vaccine and be able to be up and running slowly.

216
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:12,889
[SPEAKER_07]: not to the maximum capacity, but to start us off at least next week.

217
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,752
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not heard that that's gonna be the case at this point.

218
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,635
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been several regional sites approved.

219
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:24,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think 12 additional regional sites approved.

220
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:31,083
[SPEAKER_07]: We are one of them, but none of us have heard as to when we will actually begin receiving vaccine.

221
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:37,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we do, that'll be at the Gancho Center at Tufts at least several days a week at this point.

222
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:54,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm sure you're aware of this, but the number one call I'm receiving is the fact that residents have to go outside the city to get their shots, many of which that may be homebound or unable to travel too far.

223
00:17:55,625 --> 00:18:04,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So the quicker we can get this on board, and I realize there's a lot of moving parts, so I'm not pointing the finger at the city, but the quicker we can get a local vaccination site

224
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: on board would be beneficial to our residents.

225
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:16,123
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, we're gonna be opening up, I guess, for everyone over the age of 16, is it?

226
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:19,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometime at the end of April or May.

227
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:25,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the numbers that are gonna need the shot are gonna quadruple in the city.

228
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:31,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a little concerned that we're not gonna have anything set up by that point.

229
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

230
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we are reliant.

231
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We are reliant on whatever we get from the state.

232
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:39,983
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have doses.

233
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:44,564
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the doses, we can't give them, but we are reliant on what the state gives us.

234
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:57,767
[SPEAKER_07]: But if anyone is really considered homebound, they should certainly call our office and we can see what we can do for them as we are now part of the state homebound program.

235
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:04,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we working with agencies that deal with people that are homebound?

236
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:08,922
[SPEAKER_03]: to reach out and do some proactive outreach in our community?

237
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, yes.

238
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,487
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working really closely with the Mystic Valley Elder Services, obviously with that Council on Aging.

239
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:26,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So Marianne, what percent do you think we identified of having their first or second shot in the community that are homebound?

240
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have already completed 90.

241
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:32,834
[SPEAKER_07]: homebound folks with their second vaccination.

242
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:46,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've already done an additional 66 with their first dose and that's even without being part of the state program we did that ourselves before the state even began their program.

243
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:55,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We did that, we got our 75 plus doses and we realized these were our most vulnerable and at risk folks.

244
00:19:55,491 --> 00:20:03,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And we reached out to MidState Valley Elder Services and to our partners, Council on Aging and other groups to identify these folks.

245
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:07,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, we've already completed 90 have had their second dose, which is great.

246
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And another 66 have received their first dose.

247
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:15,742
[SPEAKER_07]: We have now, since the state announced their program and people are actually calling that number,

248
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:25,127
[SPEAKER_07]: and being referred to us, we probably have another 25 on our list, but are certainly ready to accept additional ones.

249
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:26,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

250
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:38,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's excellent work, but I'm not quite sure that I would list it as great because I don't know the total overall number of homebound residents in the community.

251
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:44,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're talking, you know, vaccinating 10% of them, to me, that's not great.

252
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:55,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really hard for me to put a handle on this until I have, and I realize you're not going to get exact numbers, but do we know what percent that is?

253
00:20:55,924 --> 00:21:03,312
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would have no way of knowing that between the several agencies or physician's offices, people reaching out to us.

254
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:06,055
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only way we know if they reach out to us, we know.

255
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:17,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no way of knowing how many people in the city of Medford are actually, but specifically by the state's criteria, the state's criteria is extremely strict as to what homebound is.

256
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:24,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So by that criteria, I really wouldn't have any way of knowing.

257
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:28,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really not able to measure a success rate of

258
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:34,736
[SPEAKER_03]: outreach and making sure our most vulnerable population is getting vaccinated.

259
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:51,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know we've we've outreached to pretty much every 75 plus person that we've had on our list at thousands and thousands and thousands of phone calls Council, Mark so I don't know.

260
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,551
[SPEAKER_07]: know, we've outreach to pretty much everyone in the community over this last year.

261
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:04,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I'm really not getting at anything.

262
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:07,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to figure out what our numbers are in the community.

263
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:14,097
[SPEAKER_03]: When I turn on the news, and they tell me throughout the state X number of seniors are already vaccinated.

264
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw a number tonight 16% of

265
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:26,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts, the entire population now has a second second vaccination, which sounds like there's progress happening.

266
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just trying to get a handle on our own numbers.

267
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:39,732
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go on our website, you'll see by age, the percent vaccinated and 76% of our 75 plus year old seniors have been vaccinated.

268
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:41,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

269
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: but that doesn't include homebound or may include a portion of homebound.

270
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:48,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all folks, 75 plus.

271
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:49,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but you could be 50.

272
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would include homebound.

273
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, exactly.

274
00:22:55,681 --> 00:23:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're saying 76% of what we have recorded have received the second dose.

275
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:05,429
[SPEAKER_07]: State has recorded.

276
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again, sorry, I didn't get it.

277
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:12,588
[SPEAKER_07]: That's from the state data that comes out every week, comes out on Thursday evenings.

278
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:18,953
[SPEAKER_07]: They show you by age, by race, how many people in your community have been vaccinated.

279
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:26,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And by that, as of last week, 76% of our 75 plus were vaccinated.

280
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, I didn't know that number.

281
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:30,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good to hear.

282
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:31,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

283
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mary.

284
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions for Mary Ann?

285
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay, Marian, I wanna thank you again for being here this week.

286
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:54,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can give a little shout out to one of our own community, Noah Kreatz, who has been deployed by FEMA out to Oregon to help vaccinate people out there.

287
00:23:54,129 --> 00:24:00,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a little shout out to Noah, one of the good young men in our community, a member of the CCSR program.

288
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:05,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, glad to see that he's doing, the young man is doing some good things.

289
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to him.

290
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:09,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne, thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you again.

291
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:10,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

292
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

293
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:13,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

294
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:14,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

295
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:23,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see that Marianne Broxton does have her hand up, actually, but I guess Marianne just left us, so maybe might not be able to answer.

296
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne Broxton, name and address of the record, please.

297
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:29,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Marianne.

298
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,964
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in South Medford.

299
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:33,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had two questions.

300
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:34,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

301
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:36,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have your address, Marianne?

302
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:38,384
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 exchange 25 exchange out.

303
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:39,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

304
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:55,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if, if, if Tufts does come online as a mass vaccination site, my questions were, um, would method residents receive priority since it is in our community.

305
00:24:55,811 --> 00:25:04,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do have that as a VAX, as a mass site, does method receive anything financially for having as a site.

306
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Ann, can you answer that question?

307
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Mary Ann.

308
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:20,788
[SPEAKER_02]: According to what Mary Ann said last week, that is a mass vaccination site, and it is open to everybody in the state.

309
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:31,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They do reserve, I think she said 25% of the vaccines, where for the local communities, the surrounding communities, we get a 25% priority.

310
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:32,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is open to,

311
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,829
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone in the whole state.

312
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not think we get any financial remuneration from them as far as I know.

313
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that answer your question, Marianne?

314
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:52,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne?

315
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,053
[SPEAKER_00]: She just has to be unmuted.

316
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:56,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, yeah, I couldn't unmute for a second.

317
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:59,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I, yeah, very much so, thank you.

318
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

319
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:02,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other further questions?

320
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,095
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

321
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing none, thank you very much.

322
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, hearings.

[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mallet?

335
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:26,796
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

336
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:28,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's find Mr. Mallet here.

337
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:31,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I see him right here.

338
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,541
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't unmute.

339
00:27:37,702 --> 00:27:38,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

340
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:39,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Mallet?

341
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you unmuted?

342
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:42,326
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

343
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:52,233
[SPEAKER_12]: You got it?

344
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:53,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on one second.

345
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to unmute Mr. Mallet.

346
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:57,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Pat?

347
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

348
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:22,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, uh, I have pressed the button asking them to unmute.

349
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:25,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they may need, they need to accept it on their end.

350
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:29,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you need to press a button that'll come up on your screen.

351
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:32,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I, I did.

352
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:42,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, there we go.

353
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:44,458
[SPEAKER_09]: They unmuted us, Fantasia's autobody.

354
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:55,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, who are we speaking with now?

355
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:03,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Fantasia's autobody before, I believe, who was speaking, so I don't think we're having any luck with

356
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Mallett just yet.

357
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:13,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hold on with Brenda.

358
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:21,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything Mr. Clark?

359
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:27,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, hold on.

360
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:41,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Caraviello?

361
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:41,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

362
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:41,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm here.

363
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:42,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

364
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:43,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Caraviello?

365
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:44,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

366
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:45,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm here.

367
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:46,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this Eddie?

368
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:00,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

369
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:02,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.

370
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mallard, are you in favor of this petition?

371
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I am.

372
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:07,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

373
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back to you.

374
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing, seeing none.

375
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anyone here opposed to this hearing?

376
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing none.

377
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll close that portion of the meeting.

378
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:22,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Mr. Mallard.

379
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:23,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.

380
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming out tonight.

381
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn this over to Councilor Scarpelli.

382
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:30,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

383
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Mr. Mallon, how are you?

384
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:48,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've looked at all of your documents, everything seems in order, but I mean, to keep it simple and streamlined, could you give us just a brief synopsis of what's happening with the site that's there now and what you plan to be doing there?

385
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's just a turnover, but if you can explain it, that'd be great.

386
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:54,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's as simple as that, sir.

387
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:59,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We have been operating as a gas station in West Medford across the street.

388
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:05,346
[SPEAKER_08]: And the operation over there at Fantasia, he was kind of retiring.

389
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just wanted to continue his business over there.

390
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So we released his business.

391
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:18,128
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to continue operating the body shop and we want to operate a inspection station as well over there.

392
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those changes or those that's already been occurring?

393
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:26,473
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no changes at all.

394
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:33,358
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually trying to reorganize his old company with the inspection and the body shop and the repair.

395
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, perfect.

396
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:44,226
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I just want to be clear just because I, um, the way you answered it might've sounded as if you were adding something new, but this is just an existing, um, uh,

397
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:57,703
[SPEAKER_03]: a body shop, a repair garage that is just changing over, hours operations staying the same, parking for your vehicles are staying the same, everything seems to be in order, correct?

398
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:58,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

399
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:12,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so everything else I see, Mr. President, all of this paperwork is in order, every department has signed off on it favorably, so I would move approval, pending any questions from my fellow councilors.

400
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:14,570
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by

401
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

402
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:21,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

403
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:25,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'm just taking a look at the zoning use chart.

404
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:30,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly don't have any issue with Millett Automotive taking over this Fantasia Automotive location.

405
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:31,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I live in West Medford.

406
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:35,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Mr. Millett, I see the type of business he's done down there for a number of years.

407
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,118
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done a great job over there.

408
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:38,818
[SPEAKER_11]: He keeps his lot clean.

409
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:40,258
[SPEAKER_11]: He is a good neighbor.

410
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:45,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have no issue or concern whatsoever about his ability or whether or not he'll be a good neighbor at the Fantasia site.

411
00:32:46,381 --> 00:33:08,239
[SPEAKER_11]: But in looking at the zoning use chart, it says that under use 27, the accessory storage conducted entirely with an enclosed structure, the sale of rental motor vehicles, exclusive abuse car sales in a C1 district would be required for a special permit of the council, but it would also be required to be referred to the community development board first for review, Mr. President.

412
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly don't have any issue approving this license this evening,

413
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:18,711
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if there is a requirement that it has to go before the CD board for hearing of some sort, I do want to make sure that the council is in compliance.

414
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:26,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess the question would lie as to whether or not Mr. Moki designates this application as a use 27 on the principal use chart.

415
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:35,935
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll refer it to, if there's an issue, we'll refer it over to Mike and step out and call him even Mr. President, because I don't want to hold Mr. Mullet up.

416
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:39,476
[SPEAKER_11]: This is more of a technicality and formality than anything.

417
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:41,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be a subject to,

418
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Mulkey has approved.

419
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Morell.

420
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say Councilor Morell.

421
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:58,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as someone who used to live across the street from these buildings for a number of years, I would be remiss if I didn't ask if it was the same hours of operation.

423
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,634
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually less hours.

424
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,915
[SPEAKER_08]: We only operate Monday through Friday over there.

425
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:08,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

426
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Marks.

427
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:20,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Subject to Mr. Moki's approval.

428
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

429
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:25,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

430
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:26,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

431
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Franco.

432
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:28,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

433
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

434
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:30,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

435
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

436
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:32,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

437
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:33,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

438
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:33,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

439
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:35,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

440
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:36,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

441
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:41,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

442
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:42,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

443
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:46,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And good luck with your expansion.

444
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:47,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much Council.

445
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:48,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

446
00:34:52,935 --> 00:34:54,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to order the resolutions.

447
00:34:54,475 --> 00:35:00,617
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020-570 offered by Councilor Falco and Vice President Knight.

448
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Update on the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

449
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:02,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

450
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

451
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:10,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was kind enough to forward all the correspondence this morning.

452
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:16,062
[SPEAKER_11]: The correspondence would provide us with an update as to the status of the ongoing construction of the ambulatory care center.

453
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:25,168
[SPEAKER_11]: This email goes on to read that beginning on Monday, March 22nd, we will begin planting trees and plants in the parking lot, islands, and surrounding buildings.

454
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:27,509
[SPEAKER_11]: This work should be completed by Friday, March 26th.

455
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So that looks like that was last week, Mr. President.

456
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Landscaping work will be taking place on the corner of Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road.

457
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:37,667
[SPEAKER_11]: and crews will be placing loom to prep for seating.

458
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:43,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Following the completion of the landscaping work, the repaving of the parking lot is scheduled to take place during the week of April 5th.

459
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,650
[SPEAKER_11]: All work is weather dependent.

460
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:58,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, also in their correspondence, if you bear with me for one moment where I can find the other section of it, I will tell you that at 5.30 PM, the caffeine inside lobby lights will be reduced to 30%.

461
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:03,296
[SPEAKER_11]: At 7 PM daily, the exterior bulbs and canopy lights will shut off.

462
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:04,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And at 8 p.m.

463
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:10,912
[SPEAKER_11]: the ambulatory surgical care centers lights will shut off as well as the PACU, which faces the lot.

464
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:18,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Also the landscaping work was what the major activity was on the corner of Governor's Avenue, Winthrop Street, that was such a concern.

465
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:23,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not Winthrop by Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road, which was such a concern, Mr. President.

466
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:28,245
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the latest update from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital based upon the correspondence that they were so kind to forward to us.

467
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

468
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you Councilor Knight for that update.

469
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:40,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just basically an update with regard to the progress that they've made on that campus.

470
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:47,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I know in our last meeting, I think most of the questions that people have were a regard to final steps.

471
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it was the plantings and the landscaping and whatnot.

472
00:36:50,953 --> 00:36:56,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like that is underway and the paving of the driveways coming soon.

473
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:58,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have no further questions.

474
00:36:59,138 --> 00:36:59,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

475
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:02,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

476
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:05,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Launch Memorial for their update.

477
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:20,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was several weeks back, residents across the street on Governor's Ave raised concern about the perimeter lighting around the hospital and how it was shining into windows up and down Governor's Ave.

478
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:24,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe last I heard that many of the lights were redirected.

479
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:29,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we heard from Council Vice President Knight, that they are turning lights off

480
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:36,252
[SPEAKER_03]: at night and still maintaining safety in the lot, which is important as well.

481
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:39,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank them for that, Mr. President.

482
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: The last outstanding issue that I know residents brought up was the cooling tower that's on the top of the front of the facade.

483
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And that still remains an issue for area residents, Mr. President.

484
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:57,346
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask that we move that.

485
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:00,508
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked about the update for

486
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:08,048
[SPEAKER_03]: the cooling tower, and if they have any current plans on addressing some of the aesthetic concerns of neighbors.

487
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:09,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

488
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

489
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:15,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so on the motion.

490
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we want to, we want to report back on the cooling tower.

491
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:25,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And correct Council Members?

492
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:29,053
[SPEAKER_03]: To the coverage around the cooling tower.

493
00:38:29,093 --> 00:38:30,653
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been made an issue for

494
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:31,897
[SPEAKER_03]: some time now.

495
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:32,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

496
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:43,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the motion by Vice President Knight, um, as amended, uh, by Councilor Marks, who would send a, uh, a letter to the, uh, Washington Borough.

497
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:51,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You, uh, give us the next, uh, what's going on with the coverage of the cooling tower, uh, seconded by Councilor Falco.

498
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:53,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

499
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:54,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

500
00:38:54,554 --> 00:38:55,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on.

501
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Councilor Best, I apologize.

502
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:58,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

503
00:38:58,657 --> 00:38:59,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

504
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I just wanted to

505
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:15,591
[SPEAKER_06]: add a further amendment that Lawrence Memorial come back 90 days after they complete the project, just so we can make sure that as operations continue, that the commitments are being met.

506
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear about the lighting.

507
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that was a major concern, but I just want to make sure that the lights are really shutting off at those times once things are underway.

508
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have the opportunity to drive by last night and

509
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:39,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the change in the lights and they were up pretty dimly lit and they weren't coming out on the street as much as they were the last time.

510
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will put that in there for a 90 day review.

511
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:45,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

512
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:49,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, that'd be 90 days after it opens, correct?

513
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:50,234
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 days after it opens, yes.

514
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:57,959
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Markson and amended by Councilor Bears.

515
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

516
00:40:01,394 --> 00:40:02,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Council bears.

517
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

518
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:04,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Falco.

519
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:04,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

520
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:05,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President night.

521
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Council marks.

522
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:07,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

523
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:08,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Morell.

524
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:08,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

525
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilors compelling President Gary off.

526
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:24,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm in the permanent motion passes to 1302 offered by President Gary yellow Council felt will be resolved with Medford City Council, have the T reinstate the 710 bus route that services residents of Fulton Heights with service

527
00:40:24,735 --> 00:40:27,937
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lawson Memorial Hospital, Stop and Shop, Wegmans and Wellington Station.

528
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:39,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to MassDOT Secretary and CEO James Tesler, and MBTA General Manager Steve Puftak.

529
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

530
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I received many calls from people on the heights about this bus being canceled.

531
00:40:50,354 --> 00:40:52,376
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bus route that's been around

532
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:56,905
[SPEAKER_02]: many, many years going back to the old Hudson bus days.

533
00:40:57,446 --> 00:41:01,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, this is really the only transportation people up at the Heights have.

534
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:11,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, it's been expanded to go over to stop and shop Wegmans, it stops in the square and it goes all the way to Wellington station.

535
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, the T has been given more money to update, to reinstate all the routes.

536
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:21,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no reason why this route

537
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,281
[SPEAKER_02]: should be also put on there.

538
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the city of Medford is one of, I think we're the fourth to fifth highest payer to the T for an assessment.

539
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:34,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we deserve the service that we paid for.

540
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:37,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and Councilor Falco.

541
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:38,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

542
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:51,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may add as well, as someone who lives up in Fulton Heights, this is really the only bus route that is really easily accessible to all residents in Fulton Heights.

543
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:57,553
[SPEAKER_09]: When you look at that bus at 710, it cuts right up, right through the middle of the heights.

544
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:02,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Easily accessible, seniors want to take it, they can walk to it.

545
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,447
[SPEAKER_09]: If they need to walk to the 100, that's a long way to walk down to 710.

546
00:42:07,912 --> 00:42:10,533
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the Felsway or up to Highland Ave.

547
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:15,195
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a route that I feel is a necessity, the 710.

548
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:22,438
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this wasn't even a service reduction, it was a service elimination, which is the worst.

549
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:29,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I know with COVID, you know, people probably aren't commuting as much, but there still needs to be options.

550
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:36,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel that pulling away the 710 or pulling it out of the neighborhood, it just really does a disservice to anyone that lives in that neighborhood.

551
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:43,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the MBTA is getting, I think about, I thought I heard about a billion dollars in pandemic relief.

552
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:44,876
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of money.

553
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that there's plenty of routes that have been eliminated.

554
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know 325 and 326 here in Medford have been eliminated, but

555
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I hear, from what I've seen in the past, anytime a route is eliminated, it's really hard to bring it back.

556
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:06,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel that the 710 needs to be brought back, and it needs to be brought back sooner than later.

557
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:11,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk about the MBTA assessments, and we've talked about that numerous times.

558
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:16,814
[SPEAKER_09]: This city is assessed millions of dollars on a yearly basis by the MBTA.

559
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:22,081
[SPEAKER_09]: and we need to get millions and millions of dollars year after year.

560
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:26,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a service reduction in my eyes, it's absolutely unacceptable.

561
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:31,730
[SPEAKER_09]: The MBTA needs to bring this line back into service.

562
00:43:32,892 --> 00:43:37,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said before, it really covers, there's necessities that a lot of seniors need.

563
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:42,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it takes you to stop and chop, it takes you to Wegmans, Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Wellington Station.

564
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:56,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these are places where people need to go and now more than ever, this bus needs to be in service and ready for people to take so I just wanted to, at this point I guess move approval.

565
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:56,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

566
00:43:57,187 --> 00:43:57,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

567
00:43:58,288 --> 00:44:05,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President, I want to thank you and Councilor Falco for bringing this forward because I think this is so important.

568
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:09,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that every route that someone relies on in the city is essential to them.

569
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:22,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really important that the City Council continues to be loud and communicate this to the powers that be because the MBTA has suggested and walked back a number of cuts.

570
00:44:22,448 --> 00:44:28,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really important that we raise the issue that this needs to be brought back immediately and get them to make that change.

571
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:34,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And Councilor Falco brings up a really good point that when these routes go away, they tend not to come back.

572
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:40,667
[SPEAKER_01]: the councilors for bringing this forward because I think it's really important that the council and the city sends this message.

573
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:41,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

574
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:45,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

575
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:48,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on.

576
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:55,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a resident of the Heights as well and grew up here and took the 710 regularly when I was younger.

577
00:44:55,029 --> 00:45:00,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you, you know, the people who use this, this is seniors getting groceries and prescriptions.

578
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,411
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is families who may not have a car who need to access essential services.

579
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:14,677
[SPEAKER_06]: even regardless of commuting and not commuting, what this is providing is people access to local businesses, grocery stores, pharmacies.

580
00:45:14,737 --> 00:45:18,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's incredibly important that the service is reinstated.

581
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:28,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also just like to amend the resolution to see if there's an update from our resolution around the 325 and 326 service cuts as well.

582
00:45:28,548 --> 00:45:35,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so amended by Councilor Bears to update for the 325

583
00:45:36,843 --> 00:45:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: and the 326.

584
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:40,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

585
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:41,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

586
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

587
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:55,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember this bus line is how all the kids from the Heights got the public skating when we were kids growing up and Kenny Phillips would be driving the bus and bringing everybody up and down the hill and putting up with kids to watch around.

588
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:58,833
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, in all seriousness, it's not just kids.

589
00:45:58,873 --> 00:45:59,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just seniors.

590
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:01,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just commuters that are using this bus.

591
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,455
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really one of the,

592
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:09,925
[SPEAKER_11]: only bus lines that we have here in the community that connects certain portions of Fulton Heights to the rest of the city.

593
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:17,189
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the MBTA talks about how they wanna restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but they're not gonna.

594
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: The MBTA talks about how they want to see increases in ridership as the Metropolitan Area Planning Council has all the communities surrounding us stop more and more people into high rise luxury condominiums.

595
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:32,019
[SPEAKER_11]: The MBTA continues to cut service, cut lines,

596
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, with the 326, the 325, the 710 commuter rail hours are being cut back.

597
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:44,104
[SPEAKER_11]: The service that's being provided to this community, Mr. President, in my opinion, does not add up to the amount of money that we're paying on our assessment.

598
00:46:44,944 --> 00:46:53,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite frankly, I feel like Medford is somewhat always the heel because of where we are geographically located between that crux of rail service and bus service.

599
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:55,227
[SPEAKER_11]: We get beat up on both ends.

600
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:59,749
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we look at the issues that we've had over time with the Salem Street car bond,

601
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:02,796
[SPEAKER_11]: and other facilities here in the community.

602
00:47:03,096 --> 00:47:05,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we raise concern, they fall on deaf ears.

603
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:12,723
[SPEAKER_11]: But when the MBTA wants to come in and cut service, it's pat on the back and, you know, take your lumps kid.

604
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:18,927
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting kind of old, Mr. President, quite frankly, and I'm tired of the attacks that we're seeing the MBTA take on our community.

605
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:24,091
[SPEAKER_11]: The MBTA raises that green flag, the Green Line extension, and they say, well, we're giving you the Green Line.

606
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:29,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm going to tell you right now, I know a lot of people in the Fulton Heights that are never going to see that Green Line extension, they're never going to step foot on it.

607
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,780
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll tell you what, the 710 bus does a lot.

608
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you and I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution forward.

609
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:39,348
[SPEAKER_11]: It does bring back some great memories of taking that bus as a child being from West Metro.

610
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,330
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was no other way to get up to the heights.

611
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:43,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly wasn't walking that hill.

612
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:44,414
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for sure.

613
00:47:44,714 --> 00:47:48,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a child, Cow Park was one of the most active parks in the city.

614
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:54,093
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no other park where you could find a better pickup basketball game besides Carr Park and Duggar Park.

615
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Two parks that always had kids playing, Harris Park.

616
00:47:56,214 --> 00:48:01,535
[SPEAKER_11]: The three parks that always had kids playing, all geographically located in the community that are real far apart from each other, Mr. President.

617
00:48:01,575 --> 00:48:03,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So this connectivity is important.

618
00:48:03,536 --> 00:48:05,296
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about wanting to take cars off the road.

619
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:07,577
[SPEAKER_11]: We're putting bike lanes in, bus lanes in, and everything else.

620
00:48:07,777 --> 00:48:10,818
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we put bus lanes on Mystic Avenue and then take away a bus in the community?

621
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:12,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we want to promote bus use?

622
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:16,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I thank you both for putting this resolution on.

623
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:20,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I just ask that it also be sent copies to our state delegation so that they're aware of this correspondence going out.

624
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:23,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

625
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

626
00:48:25,062 --> 00:48:26,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:48:26,223 --> 00:48:29,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank my two colleagues for putting this on tonight.

628
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:40,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to hear what I've been preaching about for the last 20 years about the MBTA and the assessment that it's starting to actually finally get some traction.

629
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:55,834
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've offered several resolutions before the city council requesting that the millions of dollars in tax exempt property that the MBTA has offset what they're charging us for millions of dollars on the cherry sheet, Mr. President.

630
00:48:56,394 --> 00:49:02,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think it's about time we take a look at the services we're receiving in this community.

631
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:09,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's face it, many people come to the city of Method because of our transportation services, and they're not paying the additional

632
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:12,319
[SPEAKER_03]: tax on their cherry sheet, Mr. President.

633
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:14,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on that, we are as a community.

634
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:17,623
[SPEAKER_03]: The T has three different revenue sources.

635
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:22,147
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the percent of the sales tax that they get.

636
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:30,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one is the fares when you go onto the train or the bus, which has been hit because of COVID, Mr. President.

637
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what we have to do is take a long, hard look at what we're actually paying now, several million dollars a year,

638
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,662
[SPEAKER_03]: for service in this community.

639
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:40,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

640
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That assessment the T is assessing us, it's only gonna get higher with the green line.

641
00:49:46,565 --> 00:50:03,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we really need to take a close hard look at why our assessment is so high in this community and why the T, as my colleagues mentioned, continue to cut routes and much needed buses that impact the most vulnerable community, Mr. President.

642
00:50:03,618 --> 00:50:05,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us don't have to worry.

643
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:09,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We get in the car and we go to stop and shop, or we go to a convenience store.

644
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We do our shopping and we get around.

645
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many other ones of us, Mr. President, that rely on public transportation.

646
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have a population in particular with this route is in the heights, Mr. President.

647
00:50:23,817 --> 00:50:37,048
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna really impact, even if it impacts dozens of people, that's a huge impact, Mr. President, when it comes to needs that we just heard about getting to and from Wegmans and stop and shop in the hospital.

648
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:42,712
[SPEAKER_03]: These are dedicated stops on that route for the 710 bus.

649
00:50:43,193 --> 00:50:49,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not just a luxury when you're going to a doctor, when you're going to get food, that's a necessity.

650
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that really shouldn't be cut, Mr. President.

651
00:50:53,413 --> 00:50:58,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard the news, the city of Boston is fighting now the MBTA cuts in the city of Boston.

652
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:02,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree, we have to get more vocal as a community.

653
00:51:03,118 --> 00:51:10,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's great to send out a letter to the T and the head of the T, and then they respond back saying, we'll look into it, we'll investigate and so forth.

654
00:51:10,842 --> 00:51:12,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it ends there to be quite honest with you.

655
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: There's never any follow-up.

656
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:16,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to take action, Mr. President.

657
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what it's going to take.

658
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:28,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we have to sit at the table and refuse to give the $3 million or so that we give on the cherry sheet every year.

659
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:32,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll be the first city in the state to do that.

660
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:33,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

661
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:36,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But it takes bold action sometimes to get bold results.

662
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm willing to do that.

663
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been talking about this issue for 20 years.

664
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:45,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And when, you know, and I brought up before fell on deaf ears, no one wanted to talk about it.

665
00:51:46,158 --> 00:51:54,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the team's making some big service cuts and all of a sudden it's the topic of conversation, the cherry sheet and why we're paying so much.

666
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to hear that's it, Mr. President, but these are things that should have been looked at over the years.

667
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:00,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

668
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:01,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

669
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:09,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, this is not just the Heights, this bus stops in the square, stops at the senior center, either services all the residents, Riverside Avenue.

670
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So they go to Wellington.

671
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:15,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's a little bit more than that.

672
00:52:15,443 --> 00:52:31,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bears to update the 325 and the 326 and amended by Councilor Knight to make sure we send a letter to our state delegation.

673
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:35,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Marks.

674
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

675
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:40,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

676
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:41,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

677
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:43,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

678
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:43,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

679
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:44,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

680
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:45,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

681
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

682
00:52:47,055 --> 00:52:47,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

683
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:48,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

684
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

685
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:50,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

686
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:50,898
Yes.

687
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:51,798
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello.

688
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:56,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, seven in the affirmative motion passes.

689
00:52:56,062 --> 00:53:08,411
[SPEAKER_02]: 21-303 offered by Councilor Morell, be it so resolved that the administration provide the city council with an update on expected direct local aid to the city from the American rescue plan and potential impact on the upcoming budget.

690
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell.

691
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

692
00:53:10,993 --> 00:53:13,094
[SPEAKER_01]: This resolution is pretty self explanatory.

693
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:18,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we all know, not too long ago, we were talking about the deficit we're looking at for this year's budget.

694
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:27,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And now within the past few weeks, we've heard tell of, you know, perhaps $39 million in direct local aid coming to the city.

695
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:32,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most recent estimates published in the globe last week were $50 million for the city.

696
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:36,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand that, you know, even just by those changing numbers, this is

697
00:53:36,843 --> 00:53:38,864
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously something that's kind of hard to keep track of.

698
00:53:38,924 --> 00:54:02,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's learning as we go along, but as we're looking to do, you know, really the most important role of the council in a few short months, I think it would be very helpful to have an idea, any information, any official information we can get from the administration about how this money, you know, what they've heard about how this money has to be used, the timeframe, how they're hoping to use it, what ideal scenarios would be.

699
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:09,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I mean, I did have the chief of staff reach out to me earlier, just saying that director and only Benjamin couldn't be here tonight.

700
00:54:09,268 --> 00:54:14,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just hoping we can get an update on this soon, because this is, this is an incredible amount of money.

701
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:17,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do understand it can't likely cannot be used for everything.

702
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:26,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be strings attached, but it's still a large amount of money that we haven't gotten any update on what it might look like for the city and what the administration is thinking.

703
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:27,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I move approval.

704
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

705
00:54:29,072 --> 00:54:29,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

706
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:30,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

707
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:34,556
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by?

708
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:34,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

709
00:54:35,496 --> 00:54:36,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

710
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:38,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

711
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:45,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears?

712
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:45,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

713
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:47,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

714
00:54:48,339 --> 00:54:48,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

715
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:49,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Nights?

716
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:50,099
Yes.

717
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:50,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

718
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

719
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell?

720
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:52,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

721
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

722
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:54,841
Yes.

723
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:55,741
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello?

724
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:56,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

725
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:57,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

726
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,722
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-1-3-0-4, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved.

727
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:13,955
[SPEAKER_02]: that the 35 subsidized affordable living units in Medford set to expire in 2023 and 2025 be discussed for options to preserve the affordability of the publicly assisted housing.

728
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:14,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

729
00:55:16,076 --> 00:55:17,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

730
00:55:17,557 --> 00:55:23,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a very important issue that we will be confronted with in the very near future.

731
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:30,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is losing affordable housing within our community after so much talk about

732
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:34,886
[SPEAKER_03]: how we increase our affordable housing stock here in the city of Method.

733
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:51,257
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the city's draft housing production plan, which I think we're all gonna receive a copy of very shortly, there are 35 HUD subsidized affordable rental units in Method that are set to expire in 2023.

734
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a mere year and a half, two years away, Mr. President.

735
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And those units, those 35 units are located at

736
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:02,518
[SPEAKER_03]: 42 Water Street.

737
00:56:03,178 --> 00:56:14,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another three that are subsidized by DHCD, Department of Housing and Community Development, which are run by Tri-City Housing Task Force for the homeless.

738
00:56:14,523 --> 00:56:19,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're at 196, 198 Felsway, and they're set to expire in 2025.

739
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a total of 38 units that are subsidized, Mr. President, for low income residents that could potentially be lost

740
00:56:30,342 --> 00:56:31,082
[SPEAKER_03]: in this community.

741
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:40,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my opinion, that is extremely sizable and something, Mr. President, I am going to fight hard to make sure we maintain.

742
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:43,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a way of maintaining it.

743
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:47,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that we can get some answers from this resolution tonight.

744
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:59,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But the affordability of privately owned affordable housing units that were produced using state or federal housing resources can expire as owners pay off their subsidized mortgages.

745
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,923
[SPEAKER_03]: or opt out of their existing Section 8 rental subsidy contract.

746
00:57:04,764 --> 00:57:11,250
[SPEAKER_03]: When such affordability restrictions expire, property owners can convert the affordable units to market-rate housing.

747
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:22,159
[SPEAKER_03]: On November 23, 2009, the governor signed a general law, Chapter 40T, which is an act preserving publicly-assisted affordable housing.

748
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this legislation did, Mr. President,

749
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:32,326
[SPEAKER_03]: was aimed at helping preserve existing privately owned affordable housing in Massachusetts.

750
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It also established notification provisions for tenants along with modest tenant protections, very modest, I should add, and terminate the right of first refusal for DHCD or its designee to purchase publicly

751
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:55,132
[SPEAKER_03]: assisted housing.

752
00:57:56,092 --> 00:58:08,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I was never aware of this law, Mr. President, and maybe because we haven't seen the likes of so many housing units coming up, affordable housing units, coming up at once in this community.

753
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:19,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you read Chapter 40T, Section 3, which deals specifically regarding the right of first refusal for DHCD,

754
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:36,863
[SPEAKER_03]: and the ability to sign a designee if someone is interested, i.e., in particular, a municipality, if they are interested in becoming the designee to publicly purchase the affordable housing before it gets on the market.

755
00:58:37,323 --> 00:58:39,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found that very interesting, Mr. President.

756
00:58:39,785 --> 00:58:49,032
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, it's pretty brief, and it's part of my motion, so I'd just like to read what, for the edification of the viewing audience and my colleagues,

757
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:50,734
[SPEAKER_03]: section three.

758
00:58:51,474 --> 00:59:09,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It says an owner shall offer the department an opportunity, when they say department they refer to DHCD, an opportunity to purchase publicly assisted housing prior to entering into an agreement to sell such property pursuant to the time periods contained in this section.

759
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:17,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But no owner shall be under any obligation to enter into an agreement to sell such property to the department.

760
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:33,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes on subsection B. The department may select a designee, that's DHCD, to act on its behalf as purchaser of the publicly assisted housing and shall give the owner written notice of its selection.

761
00:59:33,858 --> 00:59:42,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So my first motion, Mr. President, is has DHCD selected a designee as purchaser?

762
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my first motion.

763
00:59:45,677 --> 01:00:04,607
[SPEAKER_03]: The section goes on to say the department shall probably consult with the affected municipality before selecting a designee and shall immediately designate the affected municipality as a designee upon written request of the affected municipality.

764
01:00:05,108 --> 01:00:14,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion number two, has DHCD reached out to the city of Method and has the city of Method expressed interest in becoming the designee

765
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:23,816
[SPEAKER_03]: for these two particular properties, which is 42 Water Street and 196-198 Felsway.

766
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:43,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it goes on to say, unless the department determines that such request is not feasible for the reasons set forth in the department's regulations, the department shall enter into a written agreement with its selection designee, providing that the designee and any of its successors assigns

767
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:47,783
[SPEAKER_03]: agreed to preserve the affordability of the publicly assisted housing.

768
01:00:48,783 --> 01:01:01,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Once such an agreement is executed, the designee shall assume all rights and responsibilities attributable to the department as a prospective purchaser under this section, section four.

769
01:01:02,086 --> 01:01:07,047
[SPEAKER_03]: My next motion, Mr. President, is that we create a committee of the whole meeting

770
01:01:07,774 --> 01:01:10,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we have one scheduled for next Tuesday.

771
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:15,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that's the case, Mr. President, that would suffice for my resolution.

772
01:01:16,097 --> 01:01:32,624
[SPEAKER_03]: But my motion is that the city council meet and committee the whole to discuss options for preserving the existing privately owned publicly assisted affordable housing and method and review housing production per housing production plan.

773
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of the motion, it's to invite

774
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:42,134
[SPEAKER_03]: the consultant that was hired by the city, Jen Golson, from the firm of J.M.

775
01:01:42,174 --> 01:02:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Golson, and to invite our consultant attorney, Bob Bobrovsky, to be a part of that meeting, Mr. President, to discuss what our next steps are so we don't use or lose this opportunity for maintaining our affordable housing.

776
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:05,049
[SPEAKER_03]: One other portion I'd like to bring up, Mr. President of NLN, is that

777
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people realize Chapter 40B establishes a goal that every Massachusetts community must work to provide affordable housing at a minimum of 10% of their overall housing stock.

778
01:02:18,595 --> 01:02:33,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you read the housing production plan, you will notice, Mr. President, on page 82 of the draft plan, it states that Medford has four 40B projects currently right now in the pipeline.

779
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:54,706
[SPEAKER_03]: If all four of these projects come to fruition, Method will have an additional 1,087 units eligible to be counted on the subsidized housing inventory, bringing the city's portion of the subsidized housing inventory units to 11.7%, which would be above the 10% better right now.

780
01:02:56,826 --> 01:02:59,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people are eager to move on from 40B,

781
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:12,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The true hard facts is the only way we really been making significant change in this community for affordability has been through the state law, chapter 40B, Mr. President.

782
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:16,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we've added the most affordable housing in this community.

783
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:30,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other ways which the housing production plan addresses and that's something we're reviewing as a council, but I would strongly ask the administration because they are looking at these 40B projects

784
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:50,377
[SPEAKER_03]: in court right now, I would strongly ask that they take a closer look, Mr. President, at what these units can bring to our community in regards to affordability and move forward on these 40B projects in the interest of adding more affordability in our community.

785
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:53,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I have, Mr. President.

786
01:03:54,058 --> 01:03:55,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And tax revenue, of course.

787
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:57,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And tax revenue, absolutely.

788
01:03:58,279 --> 01:03:58,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

789
01:03:58,659 --> 01:03:59,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

790
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:01,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

791
01:04:02,945 --> 01:04:03,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Best.

792
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

793
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:07,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward.

794
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:23,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering if I could amend, I may not have gotten the language quite right, but amend the first motion to have a list of any subsidized units that may be expiring in the next 10 years, because I do recall a meeting

795
01:04:24,401 --> 01:04:32,043
[SPEAKER_06]: where there were a number of units in addition to the 38 that Councilor Marks mentioned that had time limits on the affordability requirements.

796
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:38,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not opposed to that, Mr. President, but according to J.M.

797
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:46,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Golson report, this 120 page report, they listed those two particular properties.

798
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure maybe because they're the most recent, but I would hope this is a thorough report

799
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: but I am not opposed to looking at, you know, this all 10 years, I am not opposed to that.

800
01:04:57,756 --> 01:05:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to plan and I think that's a worthy suggestion.

801
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

802
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion by Council Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco as amended by Council Marks and Councilor Bears.

803
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, you have those four amendments?

804
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,021
[SPEAKER_02]: four from Councilor Marks and one from Councilor Bears.

805
01:05:23,322 --> 01:05:25,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

806
01:05:27,204 --> 01:05:27,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears?

807
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:28,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

808
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:30,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco?

809
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:30,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

810
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:31,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight?

811
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:32,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

812
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:33,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

813
01:05:33,547 --> 01:05:33,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

814
01:05:33,987 --> 01:05:34,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell?

815
01:05:34,908 --> 01:05:35,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

816
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:36,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

817
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:36,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

818
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:38,010
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraviello?

819
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm in the prayer, motion passed.

820
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks, if I'm not mistaken, the housing production plan, I think is scheduled for Councilor Lee the whole next week.

821
01:05:46,397 --> 01:05:47,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Next Tuesday, right?

822
01:05:47,198 --> 01:05:48,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Next Tuesday, I think, I'm not sure.

823
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that's the date I gave you.

824
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:52,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So as one of my motions, we can meet that night.

825
01:05:52,761 --> 01:05:55,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to meet a separate night to discuss that motion.

826
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:57,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

827
01:05:57,084 --> 01:06:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, 21305, offered by Council Member Marks, be it resolved that a complete annual listing of all park method financial reports submitted to the city since inception 2015, along with the city's own sustainable accounting, including, if any, unpaid revenue balances carried forward

828
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:18,476
[SPEAKER_02]: since 2015 be provided to the council.

829
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bax.

830
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:20,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

831
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:30,345
[SPEAKER_03]: If we all recall, our former esteemed councilor, Councilor Bob Penta, appeared under community participation a few weeks back.

832
01:06:30,806 --> 01:06:37,791
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, the council requested that the city council take a vote on several requests for information.

833
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:43,196
[SPEAKER_03]: However, because it was offered under public participation, we could not take a formal vote

834
01:06:43,703 --> 01:06:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: and I recommended that we put it on the agenda so we can take a formal vote.

835
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:54,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, Mr. President, I would welcome up former councilor Penta for his presentation.

836
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:56,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

837
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Robert Penta.

838
01:06:57,647 --> 01:07:03,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Penta, could you just step back a little bit?

839
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stand back in the tape.

840
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:07,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

841
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:07,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

842
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I'm picking up on your resolution.

843
01:07:12,483 --> 01:07:17,126
[SPEAKER_04]: that took place in 2016, because at that time it was the second year.

844
01:07:17,987 --> 01:07:28,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe along with you and Councilor Knight and then Councilor Brianna Longo, there was some concerns with Park Method and their distribution of how the revenue was going to be coming in.

845
01:07:29,214 --> 01:07:36,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, as a result of that, what we needed to go to, as I indicated back then, was to go to the contract.

846
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:40,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the contract on page five, there is two specific sections.

847
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:42,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically includes

848
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:58,111
[SPEAKER_04]: that states 20 days after the end of each month, a monthly report would be submitted to the city of Method as it relates to a whole host of issues relative to the inventory of monies taken in and what's going out and what the fees and everything were.

849
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:08,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's an inclusion in there that the operator, meaning Park Method, would agree to submit on an annual basis the gross revenue and the operating expenses

850
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:25,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So on an annual basis, so rather than having you go and get all the monthly things, I'm requesting that the council puts a resolution forward, making that request as it relates to their annual revenue, relative to the fact that this is what took place.

851
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:38,270
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, you would have net city parking revenue, that's annual appeals, the annual appeal, dismissal, forgiveness, annual resident visitor parking permits, business permits,

852
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: commuter permits, annual parking citations.

853
01:08:42,074 --> 01:08:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get to the issue on an annual basis of the $50,000 annually that would go to the commercial districts here in the city of Medford.

854
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that was something that came up by Mayor McGlynn in, I believe, October of 2014.

855
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a result of that, that became a bone of consternation between

856
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:16,581
[SPEAKER_04]: the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the business people, and as well as the issue on the city council relative toward the business districts not getting X amount of dollars.

857
01:09:17,182 --> 01:09:31,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, as a result of that, what took place was that in October of that year, the city at that time through Mayor McGlynn, and then Park Medford came to a final resolution before January of 2015,

858
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:33,671
[SPEAKER_04]: and 15.

859
01:09:35,412 --> 01:09:44,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 2015, that $50,000 for each square was then included as part of the agreement between Park Method and the City of Method.

860
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:52,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And in their brochure, they note specifically that $250,000 annually will be subject to the appropriation for district improvements.

861
01:09:53,243 --> 01:09:53,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Now,

862
01:09:54,269 --> 01:09:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where that money is, if it's ever gone there.

863
01:09:57,311 --> 01:09:58,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people say it's gone out once.

864
01:09:59,392 --> 01:10:01,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people say maybe it has, maybe it hasn't.

865
01:10:01,753 --> 01:10:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I can't answer that.

866
01:10:03,354 --> 01:10:08,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reason why I'm asking for this breakdown and how the money was being expended.

867
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have the issue relative toward $2 million a year is what Park Method said that they would bring in annually to the city of Method.

868
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:22,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we look at that $2 million per year,

869
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:34,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the contract, there was an inclusion that anything over $1,250,000 annually, the city would increase from its annual 35% net revenues to 83%.

870
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The question then becomes where, and if in fact, has Park Method submitted that type of information to the city of Metro?

871
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

872
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:45,803
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us know.

873
01:10:45,823 --> 01:10:50,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, once again, that's the reason why I'm here asking you folks to do this.

874
01:10:50,902 --> 01:11:03,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So then let's go to the issue that basically talks about, I think it was in October during a city council strike that award six committee candidates on October of 2019.

875
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:11,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Then council Longo addressed the community at that point in time as it related to the method parking program.

876
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, this is what she said, as to parking enforcement, it is broken.

877
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,043
[SPEAKER_04]: If elected, I will end the contract that expires during the next mayoral term.

878
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:29,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go back to the committee recommendations of 2009 to implement in-house enforcement and replace the kiosks with meters.

879
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I will provide free parking for our seniors.

880
01:11:33,532 --> 01:11:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: The city will benefit by keeping 100% of the gross revenue for our city services and schools.

881
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:40,577
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently see only 35% of the revenues.

882
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:44,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's a tough point right there.

883
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:49,403
[SPEAKER_04]: 35% of the revenues, because we really don't know because you've never received the public documentation back.

884
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:52,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You, Mr. President, have asked three times.

885
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:55,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolutions go back and suggest that and prove that.

886
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do we go from there?

887
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:03,517
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the question of why I think you really need to know how much money has come in.

888
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:11,211
[SPEAKER_04]: How has park method delivered as they're supposed to occur, so into the contract and the city of Medford, how they made an accounting for it.

889
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:13,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's public information, it needs to be made public.

890
01:12:14,213 --> 01:12:28,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question then becomes, if in fact the contract has been adhered to, and if in fact revenues have exceeded that for which the 35% formula has taken place.

891
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:31,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question then becomes, if it hasn't taken place,

892
01:12:32,346 --> 01:12:34,548
[SPEAKER_04]: then where are those revenues?

893
01:12:35,228 --> 01:12:41,654
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a report that's out that you can go on Google and it's by the Method Parking Commission.

894
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:57,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a report that goes out there that basically says, through their Google webpage, that on an annual basis, the city of Method is, if you add up their numbers, that the city of Method has only collected approximately $436,000 per year.

895
01:12:57,567 --> 01:12:58,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's number one.

896
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:20,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, the statistics that the city has in the city of Medford allegedly will substantiate that we're only getting 35% rather than the 83%, which would indicate we haven't exceeded that for which you would get the $1.3 million annual money that they collected.

897
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:25,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But according to Park Medford, when they first came in, they said that their annual revenue would be in excess of $2 million.

898
01:13:26,243 --> 01:13:31,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So $2 million over a period of 20 years, or even over a period of eight years, would give you $16 million.

899
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:34,726
[SPEAKER_04]: We're nowhere, we're nowhere near that type of money.

900
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would strongly suggest that if this be the case, what really needs to be addressed is as follows.

901
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:54,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the 2009 report to which Council Marks served on there with the then former Chief of Police Sacco and a whole list of other folks who made up an extensive and an exhaustive report.

902
01:13:54,952 --> 01:14:02,135
[SPEAKER_04]: as to how much they went to other communities, they checked it out, they saw how the revenues could come in and where it should go in here for the city of Medford.

903
01:14:02,935 --> 01:14:07,477
[SPEAKER_04]: The question then becomes Mr. President, if elected means she has been elected.

904
01:14:07,837 --> 01:14:11,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So since the mayor has now been elected, the question then becomes the 35%.

905
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to get these numbers to find out, are we in the 35% or are we above the 35%?

906
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:22,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, just let me say this, and this is really the perplexing question.

907
01:14:23,063 --> 01:14:24,604
[SPEAKER_04]: If in fact we follow what the mayor

908
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Then city council said in October of 2019, to follow that formula of this report, why then do we have another new committee report of people?

909
01:14:37,326 --> 01:14:42,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the mayor going to change plans, change direction, not follow the 2009 report?

910
01:14:43,107 --> 01:14:44,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you people really need to know that.

911
01:14:44,807 --> 01:14:54,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people are sitting on that committee and it's gonna be a waste of time because you're just gonna follow the exhausted committee report of 2009, that needs to be relegated out there.

912
01:14:54,534 --> 01:14:56,195
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is a lot of money.

913
01:14:57,116 --> 01:15:06,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're only looking at $436,000 a year as compared to a lot more than that, because we haven't gotten to the $2 million mark per year, you need to know that.

914
01:15:06,824 --> 01:15:08,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really need to have a discussion.

915
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:18,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was you then Councilor, Mr. President and Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks and Councilor Brianna Longo-Cunningham had serious questions with Park Method over this.

916
01:15:18,962 --> 01:15:21,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You indicated, Mr. President, that this is year eight.

917
01:15:21,905 --> 01:15:25,227
[SPEAKER_04]: This is years eight, nine, and 10 are the years for negotiation.

918
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're taking them one year at a time.

919
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if they're taking them one year at a time, and the mayor said, and when she ran for mayor, that she was going back and she was going to get rid of Park Method, then the plan ought to be that Park Method's going to go.

920
01:15:38,559 --> 01:15:40,981
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be no negotiation to extend anything here.

921
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:44,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to be clear.

922
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:54,452
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow cops can help, but the committee that you're referring to, is this the traffic committee that the mayor just put together?

923
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:57,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the committee you're referencing?

924
01:15:57,293 --> 01:15:58,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is the committee.

925
01:15:58,713 --> 01:15:59,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have the wrong terminology.

926
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the committee to discuss parking in the city of Medford.

927
01:16:02,594 --> 01:16:08,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I believe they said that they had no privy to discuss anything dealing with Republic Park.

928
01:16:08,775 --> 01:16:16,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's what they, that's what was quoted to us that when we asked questions about Republic Park to them, that they were directed not to,

929
01:16:17,421 --> 01:16:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: that wasn't what they were looking to do.

930
01:16:20,024 --> 01:16:27,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe that's what it was correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe we can ask Councilor Morocco you're on that committee.

931
01:16:27,811 --> 01:16:28,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Mr. President.

932
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:29,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's correct.

933
01:16:29,353 --> 01:16:32,977
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my understanding was more about looking at, you know, zones.

934
01:16:33,097 --> 01:16:38,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, there was a number of things I addressed, but yes, it wasn't, it didn't really, it didn't touch on our public parking.

935
01:16:38,622 --> 01:16:41,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kept separate from the commission.

936
01:16:44,457 --> 01:16:59,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So then the question that I asked the council and to you, Mr. President, if the mayor indicated she was going to look at the 2009, she was going to adhere to that report, then the traffic, this new committee that's been put together, are they discussing this report to add or subtract?

937
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the mayor not going to support this?

938
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:04,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Are she going to entertain another type of situation?

939
01:17:04,441 --> 01:17:06,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is very conflicting.

940
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:09,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that they're on the series of one year renewals now.

941
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:14,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're going to be on one year renewals in years eight, nine, and 10, give you the option to bow out.

942
01:17:15,689 --> 01:17:20,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've had plenty of time to realize coming into your option year that something should be taking place.

943
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we going to, as a community, take three years in a row as option years and work at it one at a time?

944
01:17:28,355 --> 01:17:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know.

945
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:33,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

946
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:36,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that when this matter came before the council,

947
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:43,925
[SPEAKER_11]: The vote that the council was asked to take was to whether or not they were going to allow the administration to enter into a contract that exceeds 36 months.

948
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Pursuant to state law, a municipality can only enter into a contract with a maximum term of 36 months.

949
01:17:49,948 --> 01:17:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So the issue that was before the council wasn't whether or not we wanted to have pocket meters or no pocket meters, have pocket enforcement officers, but not have pocket enforcement officers.

950
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:03,634
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue before the council at the time was whether or not we wanted to authorize the administration the opportunity to negotiate a contract that exceeded three years.

951
01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:05,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was the matter that was before us.

952
01:18:05,455 --> 01:18:07,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly have the same concerns that I had

953
01:18:07,654 --> 01:18:12,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, for previously when it comes to Republic packing and the accounting methodology that's being used with the president.

954
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but that's neither here nor there.

955
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,484
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration is the entity that's responsible for the chief negotiation of the contract.

956
01:18:18,564 --> 01:18:22,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And these three air extensions are going to be incumbent upon her purview, not us.

957
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:24,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to answer that question.

958
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:28,213
[SPEAKER_04]: A constant night brings up a good point that three years when it first came up.

959
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:31,912
[SPEAKER_04]: was nixed by then city solicitor Mark Romney.

960
01:18:31,992 --> 01:18:35,434
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it would not serve in the best financial interest of the city of Medford.

961
01:18:36,074 --> 01:18:44,417
[SPEAKER_04]: That bumped up the contract to 10 years, but given years eight, nine, and 10, the flexibility, whether you'd want to renegotiate, get out or whatever it might be.

962
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:54,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only concerned over the fact that you, Mr. President, dating back at least three times going back to 2016, coming forward with council resolution have asked for these numbers.

963
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:59,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Senior citizens have been waiting to park for nothing for free, because that's what was alleged.

964
01:19:00,106 --> 01:19:05,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Same comment was made in Inauguration Day, same comment was made in 2009.

965
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:23,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're not going to follow this report of 2009, which is very extensive, and it wasn't just for the city of Medford, you can correct me Councilor Marks, you went to other cities and towns, you saw how they derived their revenue through meters and their timing, and whether they had resident parking, commuter parking, this and that.

966
01:19:24,068 --> 01:19:30,861
[SPEAKER_04]: If that is not going to really be entertained, I just think that this parking commission, Councilor Scott Bell, it's just a waste of time.

967
01:19:31,624 --> 01:19:33,904
[SPEAKER_04]: We either follow something or not.

968
01:19:33,964 --> 01:19:34,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to change it?

969
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:40,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the mayor has an obligation to tell you and the taxpayers of this community, whether in fact we're going forward.

970
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:46,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you want to go into two more years of one year contracts trying to figure out what you're going to do?

971
01:19:46,967 --> 01:19:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: You should know by now.

972
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:54,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolutions dating back to 2016 and 17 with her name and many councilors names on there.

973
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:59,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Question, just as councilor Knight has indicated, the veracity of this contract.

974
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how is it going to work with the city of Method?

975
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:07,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Approximately $2 million in uncollected money is still outstanding again.

976
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,343
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on the Google page of the Medford Parking Commission.

977
01:20:11,463 --> 01:20:13,985
[SPEAKER_02]: As Councilor Knight mentioned, this is the preview.

978
01:20:14,405 --> 01:20:19,069
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor is the chief negotiating authority for the city, not the city council.

979
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:24,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, we don't get a say in who gets the contract or doesn't.

980
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:30,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor President, I'm going to disagree with you, because when this council issue came up before the council, it started in May of 2014.

981
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:33,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ran on for a few months.

982
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:36,083
[SPEAKER_04]: While the mayor and some of the councilors had a difference of opinion,

983
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:38,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It did go on, there was some public interaction.

984
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:47,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this mayor is going to entertain a new contract without having the council interaction and public awareness and public input, that's bad.

985
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:50,631
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really bad because that's not what you call transparency.

986
01:20:51,771 --> 01:20:53,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this the transparency administration though?

987
01:20:54,253 --> 01:20:55,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be.

988
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:55,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

989
01:20:57,154 --> 01:20:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Locks.

990
01:20:58,655 --> 01:20:59,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

991
01:20:59,496 --> 01:21:04,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna thank my colleague, Councilor Penta for his insight on this issue.

992
01:21:06,254 --> 01:21:15,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when the mayor first established this working committee, I was under the impression they were going to look at the parking program in the city of Medford.

993
01:21:17,577 --> 01:21:31,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did hear bits and pieces of what their mission statement is, but I wasn't aware that they're not going to look at the current entity that oversees parking, which is Park Medford in this community and their contract.

994
01:21:32,162 --> 01:21:33,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't aware that

995
01:21:33,646 --> 01:21:49,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't going to look at taking this service in-house, which has been an issue since, as Councilor Penta mentioned, since 2009, when the committee I sat on for two years, Mr. President, we visited, we did our due diligence, we did our homework.

996
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:53,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the city of Boston and met with their chief parking clerk.

997
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,041
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Malden.

998
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:56,022
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Everett.

999
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:57,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Somerville.

1000
01:21:57,883 --> 01:22:03,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent countless hours and came up with recommendations, Mr. President, all of which

1001
01:22:03,769 --> 01:22:07,330
[SPEAKER_03]: were to do meters and take the service in-house.

1002
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:14,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the major recommendations of which the mayor at the time, and that's his authority, decided to do neither.

1003
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:20,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And he hired an outside company and he put kiosks all over the streets.

1004
01:22:20,953 --> 01:22:23,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we spent two years for, he did the total opposite.

1005
01:22:24,793 --> 01:22:31,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm hoping, Mr. President, because as Councilor Penta mentioned, there was a commitment made by this current mayor back in 2019,

1006
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:34,392
[SPEAKER_03]: that seniors were going to get free parking.

1007
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:37,273
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 15 months later.

1008
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:41,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Seniors have not received free parking, Mr. President.

1009
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:49,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Elimination of the kiosk, 15 months later, and taking it in-house, parking enforcement.

1010
01:22:50,720 --> 01:23:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Now come to find out it's not even a subject of discussion among the committee that she handpicked and appointed, Mr. President, to discuss

1011
01:23:01,075 --> 01:23:02,977
[SPEAKER_03]: the parking program in the community.

1012
01:23:03,898 --> 01:23:06,680
[SPEAKER_03]: She may decide to do this outside of that, I don't know.

1013
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:18,289
[SPEAKER_03]: But what better time when they have in public hearings, public meetings, sending out surveys, spending countless hours working on this to discuss the program in its entirety.

1014
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:22,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes zero sense to me, Mr. President.

1015
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:26,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wait with bated breath in June when this report's supposed to come out.

1016
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:41,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to belabor the subject, Mr. President, but I think it was two or three years ago, the city hired a consultant and spent close to $100,000 to look at resident permit parking in the city.

1017
01:23:41,862 --> 01:23:46,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And the consultant came out with a report, it's probably worth all the other reports, collecting dust.

1018
01:23:48,168 --> 01:23:59,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But this consultant came out with a report and stated that we'd like to do a pilot program because the city is so diverse in their parking needs, and we'd like to start off with Salt Method and the hillside.

1019
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:05,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made recommendations on creating a Salt Method hillside permit parking program.

1020
01:24:06,471 --> 01:24:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did the city do with the $100,000 report?

1021
01:24:10,972 --> 01:24:11,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Circular file.

1022
01:24:14,813 --> 01:24:17,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are back at the table again, Mr. President.

1023
01:24:18,257 --> 01:24:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we here just because it's election year, and we have to keep up with campaign promises, and we're going through the motions?

1024
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:29,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do we really want to see change to this program that's needed?

1025
01:24:29,785 --> 01:24:33,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been tweaked in more than seven years, this program.

1026
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:37,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs tweaking, Mr. President, a lot of tweaking.

1027
01:24:38,632 --> 01:24:41,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I supported at the time, and I still stand by it.

1028
01:24:42,068 --> 01:24:48,654
[SPEAKER_03]: in-house, taking this in-house and having our own people control this program, Mr. President, and the revenue stays here.

1029
01:24:48,994 --> 01:24:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And I supported at the time, and I still do, having double head meters rather than kiosks.

1030
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Kiosks are great for parking lots.

1031
01:24:57,142 --> 01:25:02,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't work on the streets, Mr. President, as we found out from the number of complaints throughout this community.

1032
01:25:03,127 --> 01:25:07,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank my colleague for putting this on and for bringing up this issue.

1033
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:08,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope in June,

1034
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:11,433
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that we discussed, Mr. President.

1035
01:25:11,833 --> 01:25:14,896
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the fire report that was just issued that the mayor commissioned.

1036
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't gone through that yet.

1037
01:25:16,818 --> 01:25:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes out with a list of recommendations and so forth.

1038
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of reporting going on, Mr. President, but very little action.

1039
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of reports, you can hire consultants, put together reports, but they're meaningless if there's nothing tied to them, if there's no action.

1040
01:25:33,232 --> 01:25:34,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1041
01:25:34,173 --> 01:25:35,554
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

1042
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Ville.

1043
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, one quick thing.

1044
01:25:39,441 --> 01:25:41,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Pinto, you're all over your time.

1045
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks, you talked about Everett, talked about Revere, talked about Somerville, you talked about Boston, Brookline, Malden, and Everett.

1046
01:25:52,483 --> 01:25:57,745
[SPEAKER_04]: A thorough report from the hiring of a clerk to the amount of people that walked the streets and the monies that were collected.

1047
01:25:58,605 --> 01:26:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not gonna get more of a thorough report than that.

1048
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:04,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And this new commission, for whatever the reason is, it's out there and why the mayor is doing it,

1049
01:26:05,505 --> 01:26:07,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody knows, but that question ought to be asked.

1050
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:13,369
[SPEAKER_04]: If you made the commitment in 2019 to do with this one, why are you going in a different direction?

1051
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:14,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1052
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:17,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I could.

1053
01:26:18,432 --> 01:26:18,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Council member.

1054
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:20,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1055
01:26:20,233 --> 01:26:34,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I do just want to note that there are, I can find the best way to get it to the council, but there are a number of public folders and documents about the work that the commission has been doing and what the charge from the mayor is specifically, I think is actually on the city website.

1056
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:40,871
[SPEAKER_01]: just to add some clarity to that, that that information is readily accessible for those questions around it.

1057
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1058
01:26:43,192 --> 01:26:43,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1059
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:57,394
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, I mean, in the past when a representative of the council is selected by the mayor to be on a committee, ad hoc committee, whatever you want to call it, they usually report back to the council.

1060
01:26:58,355 --> 01:27:00,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have yet to receive any report back

1061
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:05,204
[SPEAKER_03]: from our representative on the board, and maybe there's nothing to report back now.

1062
01:27:05,244 --> 01:27:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, they've been meeting for several months, but I think it would be interesting, rather than pointing us to a website on the city website, is to give us an update, Mr. President, on what's happening, and things that we should be made aware of.

1063
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:19,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1064
01:27:19,871 --> 01:27:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, on the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Scott Kerr, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1065
01:27:24,313 --> 01:27:24,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

[SPEAKER_02]: Seven affirmative motion passes.

1075

[SPEAKER_02]: Reports of committees to one to one by 23 community of the whole.

1076
01:27:45,325 --> 01:27:53,232
[SPEAKER_02]: This community of the whole was to introduce our new employee Victor Schrader, and he gave him.

1077
01:27:53,752 --> 01:27:56,094
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave a little description of the job and what he's looking to do.

1078
01:27:58,272 --> 01:28:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And we welcome to our community so motion to approval.

[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President.

Yes.

1085
01:28:17,303 --> 01:28:17,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1086
01:28:18,984 --> 01:28:19,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:20,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1089
01:28:26,633 --> 01:28:33,996
[SPEAKER_02]: This committee as a whole was in regards to changing the size of the board of appeals from three to five.

1090
01:28:35,297 --> 01:28:38,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And the motion was made to report this to the OCD board.

01:29:00,406 --> 01:29:01,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1096
01:29:01,286 --> 01:29:05,348
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not in here for the glory.

1097
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:07,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bears.

1098
01:29:08,268 --> 01:29:08,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1099
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:10,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1100
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President night.

1101
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:12,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Council marks.

1102
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:13,330
Yes.

1103
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Morell.

1104
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:14,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1105
01:29:15,491 --> 01:29:16,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1106
01:29:16,211 --> 01:29:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1107
01:29:17,411 --> 01:29:18,132
[SPEAKER_02]: President carry off.

1108
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:18,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1109
01:29:18,712 --> 01:29:20,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me defer with the motion passes.

1110
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:42,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, moving forward, I just want, if we can, just remind the residents that are watching that tomorrow's meeting for the Verizon 5G towers, it will be at six o'clock, I believe.

1111
01:29:42,153 --> 01:29:46,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that six o'clock via Zoom?

1112
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1113
01:29:47,274 --> 01:29:53,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've been getting phone calls and people begging us to please vote against it.

1114
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:56,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a clarification.

1115
01:29:56,994 --> 01:30:06,462
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no vote that this council can take to stop anything that we have issues on, because I think all of us do have some concerns.

1116
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, this does not fall on our privy.

1117
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:24,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be on the call tomorrow as a resident, making sure that I get the answers that I need for my family and my neighbors as well, dealing with safety and public health.

1118
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:24,818
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1119
01:30:26,374 --> 01:30:27,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1120
01:30:27,654 --> 01:30:28,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1121
01:30:28,275 --> 01:30:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Markswell.

1122
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to follow up with Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I received on my desk tonight a letter from Mary Ann Aducci.

1123
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,559
[SPEAKER_03]: She lives on North Street in Medford.

1124
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:45,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us know her very well, but she did send in a two page letter that she wants read into the record.

1125
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:49,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I will submit it to the clerk and if my colleagues want it as well.

1126
01:30:50,023 --> 01:30:53,304
[SPEAKER_03]: It's regarding the March 31st Verizon hearing.

1127
01:30:54,066 --> 01:30:57,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And she wants to express her concern with 5G.

1128
01:30:58,267 --> 01:31:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Mr. President, that she has no access to a computer and finds it very difficult, Mr. President, and hard for most people that would like to attend the meeting.

1129
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:15,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is no way of attending it unless you have access to a computer or a call-in, Mr. President.

1130
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And the call-in is extremely difficult.

1131
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:22,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So she also asked within this letter that boards and commissions

1132
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:30,692
[SPEAKER_03]: and any other committee in the city return to in-person hearings and meetings so everyone can participate equally.

1133
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:33,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would support that as well, Mr. President.

1134
01:31:34,653 --> 01:31:35,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1135
01:31:36,553 --> 01:31:37,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1136
01:31:38,633 --> 01:31:39,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Records.

1137
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:40,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pass to Councilor Marks.

1138
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:43,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1139
01:31:43,294 --> 01:31:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have a chance to review them.

1140
01:31:44,475 --> 01:31:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked them to be tabled for one week, Mr. President.

1141
01:31:46,775 --> 01:31:50,156
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Marks to table the records for one week,

[SPEAKER_02]: And before we adjourn, I just want to wish everybody a happy Easter and a happy Passover.

1159

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1165
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:38,625

1166
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:40,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I called immediately right to New Jersey.

1167
01:32:41,006 --> 01:32:44,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, and the number of phone calls you made, and I'd like to personally thank you.

1168
01:32:44,048 --> 01:32:44,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
