00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for hopping on.

59
00:02:56,633 --> 00:03:07,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think this will be a very brief meeting, but I did want to give you a number of updates just in terms of where we are in the process and what we have ahead of us.

60
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:08,596
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that in just a minute.

61
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:18,118
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a consent agenda to approve the meeting minutes from the 7-17 full committee meeting.

62
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to approve the minutes?

63
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

64
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:24,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a second?

65
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

66
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:33,800
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so motion by Tracy Keene to the minutes with a second by Aranulopade.

67
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

68

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

88
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily Lazzaro.

89
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:15,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

90
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:16,958

[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron Olapade.

93
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

94
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And Luke Preissner.

95
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:33,307
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, four absent, the minutes are approved.

96
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:44,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so flipping back to our agenda, I just wanted to give you all a couple of updates, and then we have really one topic to discuss.

97
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:50,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you know, when we met back even in July, we talked about

98
00:04:52,301 --> 00:05:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: that all of our documentation had been submitted and that we were awaiting information from the MSBA about the enrollment study.

99
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:10,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that time, we have met with the MSBA about our enrollment projections.

100
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,172
[SPEAKER_02]: If you all recall,

101
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:27,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a critical step in this eligibility phase because what the design enrollment is certified at that we will ultimately agree to with MSBA is how we will go forward to size the building.

102
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:37,722
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of any project that comes next, so that we all have to agree on how many students are we trying to accommodate for.

103
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,723
[SPEAKER_02]: We provided a whole bunch of information to them about Medford's housing market,

104
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:50,998
[SPEAKER_02]: about our historical enrollment, among other things, and we did hold an enrollment meeting with them.

105
00:05:51,738 --> 00:06:01,263
[SPEAKER_02]: They presented us their preliminary numbers, and they had a series of really good questions for us about what may not have like

106
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:09,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say like come through in answering the questions that they standardly pose.

107
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:16,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a really good conversation about some of the like additional factors from Medford's perspective.

108
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:22,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor is part of the Metro Planning Council and they are committed to helping the governor.

109
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve their goals.

110
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an aggressive housing production plan, those kinds of things.

111
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:32,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to have some good conversation about a whole variety of topics that impact enrollment.

112
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:36,199
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the conversation, they asked us for some more information.

113
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:40,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually did provide that to them in mid-August.

114
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:44,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are awaiting feedback from them about the next step.

115
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So more to come on getting through this last piece of the eligibility phase.

116
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:54,045
[SPEAKER_02]: as we hear from them.

117
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have done in the meantime is thanks to the help of Will Pippicelli, who's on the call.

118
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:10,763
[SPEAKER_02]: He is replacing Tom Dalton on the committee as soon as the school committee votes that change through officially, but he's here tonight.

119
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:11,784
[SPEAKER_02]: He's joined us.

120
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our director of communications for the district.

121
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:22,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to welcome him to the team unofficially and we'll welcome him officially once the committee goes through that process.

122
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:27,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But Will and I have been working on two efforts.

123
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:34,908
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to take all the documentation that we had to submit to MSBA around this enrollment study.

124
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: and put it into a digestible format.

125
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:56,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The other was to do the same with all the maintenance and capital planning information that we had to submit because all of those submissions go into their computer system and they don't spit out all that great or with like enough context that it would sort of resonate for us to post that on our website.

126
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that you all received both of those documents before the meeting.

127
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:06,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really just more for you to have.

128
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:15,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we do plan to post those on the website so that everybody can see them, but those two documents are hot off the presses.

129
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Will and I were working on finalizing them today.

130
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:24,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many thanks to Will for his work on that, pulling together all of

131
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:33,851
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the information was not an easy task there's lots of attachments, the enrollment projection information is particularly sort of tedious to.

132
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,002
[SPEAKER_02]: to get through and understand.

133
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that, Will.

134
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:43,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to make sure that you all saw those attachments from Lisa just a little bit ago.

135
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a look.

136
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,273
[SPEAKER_02]: We will post them on the website.

137
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:51,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I will plan to share them out on social media.

138
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:58,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And Will and I will talk about a plan to do that from the school account instead of from my personal account so that there can be record of that.

139
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that one is to provide that update.

140
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're still very much in wait mode.

141
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:15,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, we are, you know, waiting on those next steps from the MSBA and just, um, ready and, and willing when they have questions.

142
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:24,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I am planning to touch base with, um, our contact there later this week, and I will, um, let you know if there's anything material that sort of comes next.

143
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in terms of the timeline, I'm not 100% clear when we will

144
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:39,968
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of exit this phase because we're sort of at the end, but we're not done.

145
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:47,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some of that will drive the board meeting placement wherever we land once we get through this process.

146
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:55,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part of the timeline is I haven't scheduled any meetings because I don't want to take up your valuable time.

147
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,358
[SPEAKER_02]: until we have better clarity on those next steps.

148
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We will talk a little bit about sort of getting ready for the next phase in just a minute, but we are going to try to use this time to provide some opportunities for folks to go tour other buildings.

149
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:15,941
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a tour of Arlington High School on the books for next week.

150
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all welcome to join us.

151
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at three o'clock on the 24th.

152
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,323
[SPEAKER_02]: The Arlington project is

153
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:30,684
[SPEAKER_02]: probably even more open now than it was when I went to tour the building back in like May or June.

154
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:33,496
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is a phased renovation.

155
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:46,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also working on plans to talk to Waltham, Somerville, Stoneham and Billerica.

156
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:54,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So more to come as we get those dates on the calendar and Lisa will push out invitations to you all to join us as you are able.

157
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:59,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're sort of taking this time where we have some quiet time to also

158
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,548
[SPEAKER_02]: take some tours and get inspired.

159
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:11,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's on the immediate agenda and we'll work through getting those on the books and then we can regroup if there's anywhere else that we want to take a look at.

160
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:14,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions about the timeline?

161
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:42,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the other major part of our agenda today is that as we start sort of looking forward to that next phase, assuming that we are invited to the next phase, which is part of this MSBA process, the next phase really would be for us to

162
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: put out a public procurement and onboard our owner's project manager who will help lead this project forward as it gets increasingly technical.

163
00:11:53,473 --> 00:12:10,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to do that under MSBA's guidelines, what we need to do is form an OPM selection committee that will help sort of get that procurement in place and out the door and shepherd that through the selection process.

164
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain people that have to be on the committee.

165
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiona is one of them.

166
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Bob Dickinson is another.

167
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:22,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he has to be on the committee.

168
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:34,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did want to talk about that among this group because there is also a gate that the school committee will need to approve whoever that selection committee is.

169
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:41,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though they're a subcommittee of our committee, according to MSBA, the school committee needs to sign off.

170
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to open that up for a little bit of discussion about the sort of our best next steps.

171
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:55,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to nominate folks tonight so that I can sort of be ready to feed that to the school committee when appropriate?

172
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we want to do that at a later meeting?

173
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm open to both options.

174
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know the school committee agenda can be sort of

175
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: big impact at times.

176
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:11,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So advanced notice would be helpful because then I have a little bit of runway to figure out how to get on the agenda.

177
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:22,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But that team, I believe, can start meeting to start to do the documentation work to put the procurement documents in place.

178
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:22,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So

179
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think if we sort of have that committee at the ready, they can be moving along because the ultimate goal of this next phase is to get the OPM on board and then ultimately the designer or the architect.

180
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But the OPM comes first.

181
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:45,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to do the OPM and then the architect, and then we can get to, you know, ultimately the feasibility study.

182
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll stop there.

183
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone has any comments, questions, thoughts, I'm happy to take them.

184
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:54,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny, can I just say two things?

185
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

186
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:01,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I was just called to a meeting yesterday via Zoom for Everett.

187
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:08,277
[SPEAKER_00]: What I don't think we knew, or maybe you all knew and I didn't, Everett is looking to build a new school and enhance their vocational programming.

188
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:12,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember before when we didn't really look in our range because nobody was a competing factor?

189
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that this is competing, but they're opening similar programs.

190
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:18,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're on the same timeline as them.

191
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:20,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you call that?

192
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:20,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

193
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:22,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.

194
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were invited to stay at the same meeting we were.

195
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,972
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the second thing was any time we can tour Somerville or Waltham will be amazing, because that's really the vision of our blended school.

196
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:34,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all.

197
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:36,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Waltham, beautiful.

198
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,074
[SPEAKER_00]: When I drive by it, it's incredible.

199
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:40,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Except those bleachers.

200
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:46,396
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you all haven't seen the news articles, there's a

201
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:55,042
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, an issue in their gymnasium of the newly opened school where their bleachers are too big for the gym itself.

202
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they, the bleachers come out onto the playing floor.

203
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:16,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so now that I've said that it'll be in your social media feed and you can take a look at the article, but, um, yeah, so we, we are trying to, um, to get to, to Waltham, um, in particular, I know that they just opened, so they will, it'll be a different,

204
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:22,171
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect of their reactions to that building for sure.

205
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:42,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Jenny, in reference to this committee, I want to say what demographics of this committee do you want represented on that in terms of how you see expertise that we could bring to the committee and what is the time commitment?

206
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, you know, part of the work of that committee is going to be to.

207
00:15:50,575 --> 00:16:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: To sort of follow the template set out by MSBA around the procurements and make sure that we're in good position to be in compliance with all of Medford's procurement.

208
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:02,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know.

209
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have procurement experience, that's a plus, because that is fundamentally what we're doing.

210
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:16,128
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have experience working with OPMs, I think that is also a plus.

211
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:31,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bringing bringing that group together the other thing that group will do is figure out like, what is the process that we're going to go through to actually select the and.

212
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine that this larger group will certainly be invited to the table to to listen to presentations and things like that.

213
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:50,785
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, the recommendation and the selection of the OPM is going to have to go through the selection committee and then to us.

214
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I think time-wise, it's going to happen in bursts, and I can't really even tell you when the bursts will happen.

215
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, there's some upfront work to get those RFPs out.

216
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:04,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they're out,

217
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:11,555
[SPEAKER_02]: There's sort of a quiet period, right, where we have to answer some questions and then we really can't talk about the bid.

218
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once everything comes in, we'll have to have an established timeline to work through all of those submissions, do interviews, and ultimately make a selection.

219
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever that happens, it's going to be the most time intensive space.

220
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that will be a function of how many OPMs

221
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:40,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's really hard to know, but doing bid reviews can be really, really time consuming.

222
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:45,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I do think there's, you know, a decent amount of work there for the team.

223
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I wanted to ask about the OPM.

224
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:50,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you mentioned the OPM.

225
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Normally, there's three agents involved in these construction projects.

226
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from the OPM, there's an architect, there's a construction manager.

227
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,183
[SPEAKER_07]: We pick the OPM first, fine.

228
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:08,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the OPM have a role in selecting or influencing the other two, or is it a forced marriage?

229
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:21,003
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at press articles and just kind of look at all the other projects in the region, it becomes clear that there's a handful, probably somewhere between a half dozen and a dozen companies that do this.

230
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:25,266
[SPEAKER_07]: And they typically swap hats depending on which project they're working on.

231
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:38,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, is it a forced marriage or does the OPM have a role in guiding their preferred construction manager partner as well as their preferred architect?

232
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple questions there.

233
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,692
[SPEAKER_02]: One is not all people play all roles.

234
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all organizations do all the roles.

235
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Some do.

236
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So some are architects and OPMs.

237
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are just architects.

238
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are just OPMs.

239
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:56,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And any version of that could

240
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: be what we see in terms of our bid.

241
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:05,761
[SPEAKER_02]: The OPM is going to help us do the heavy lifting to get the designer and the construction manager on board.

242
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:10,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So this work of getting the OPM on board is our work to do.

243
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:16,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we do that, we now have somebody like paid staff that's going to help shepherd the rest of that along.

244
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:21,989
[SPEAKER_02]: They certainly are going to have a wealth of information about who does this work,

245
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: who they've worked with before, but ultimately this committee is going to make those selections.

246
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, there is no such thing as a forced marriage.

247
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:36,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Who we hire to be the architect, who we hire to be the construction manager is up to this committee.

248
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:46,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But the OPM, you know, ideally is the person who can help guide this committee and do the heavy lifting for us once we have them on board.

249
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:51,643
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is really important to pick an OPM that sort of reflects

250
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,153
[SPEAKER_02]: what we want to see as we go forward.

251
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:59,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, finding the OPM that's a good fit for us is really, really important.

252
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

253
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:19,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair Graham, could you just tell me the timeframe that we would be putting out an RFP?

254
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would you need to want to put on RFP?

255
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:24,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

256
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:45,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think as soon as we are invited to the next phase, I would like our RFP to be out the door within 30 days, max, because the sooner we do that, the sooner we have somebody on board and the sooner those next phases can happen, which is why I would like to get the procurement documents created in advance of that.

257
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really hard to say because it will be driven by when MSBA invites us to

258
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,116
[SPEAKER_02]: the board meeting to advance us to the next round.

259
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Those options, they meet every other month.

260
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not meet in September, so they meet in October, they meet in December, and they meet in February.

261
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,884
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to guess, I think we're likely to be at the December board meeting.

262
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:16,565
[SPEAKER_02]: There's maybe an outside chance we'll make it to October.

263
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:21,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were not originally slated to go to a board meeting until I think February.

264
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:36,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm sorry if I missed it, can we set up, can we let you know who on this committee is interested in being on that procurement team and form that procurement team prior to the board meeting?

265
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:44,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think we can make, we can have that conversation and decide who those folks are.

266
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go to the school committee for approval.

267
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:53,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't believe there's any reason why we can't begin work, but I will confirm that with MSBA.

268
00:21:54,056 --> 00:22:01,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if there are people who want to be part of this process, those nominations tonight would be helpful.

269
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:04,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Luke?

270
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

271
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:10,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, follow up question to the earlier.

272
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:16,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of next step, feasibility is the next phase in this launching process.

273
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:34,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we need to have all of the agents, OPM, architect, construction manager named in order to begin a feasibility study or can we proceed with a feasibility study with just the OPM?

274
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The next phase is forming the team, which includes the OPM and the architect.

275
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the feasibility study happens.

276
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:50,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two things that must happen are we must have an OPM and we must have an architect.

277
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get invited to feasibility.

278
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The construction manager comes later.

279
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But we, so we have to get the OPM on board, they will help us get the designer on board, and then we will be ready for feasibility.

280
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:09,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's actually several, there's a couple of MSBA gates there in the middle.

281
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:17,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they do have to approve our OPM, they have to approve our designer, there's a lot of approvals that they have to do along the way.

282
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that Fiona has to be on the team, and I believe Bob does.

283
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are both non-voting members of this committee, so there need to be at least three voting members of the committee on this subcommittee as well.

284
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So I certainly will be on the committee, but I would love other folks to join us as well.

285
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:56,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Having worked for many OPMs, please excuse my voice tonight.

286
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be happy to be on the committee.

287
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:01,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Libby.

288
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:14,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody else that's dying to be on the committee?

289
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:19,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes for non-voting members as well.

290
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,342
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very welcome to be on the committee.

291
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we just need to make sure we have enough voting members that it can be a legitimate committee to.

292
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:35,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I would, but I don't have any real construction experience here in this area.

293
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:39,497
[SPEAKER_08]: All mine's in the West Coast, so I don't have the contacts.

294
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,638
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you guys get desperate, let me know.

295
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:45,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I can do investigation, look up companies.

296
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:50,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few references and stuff with the union also, and know a couple architects locally.

297
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:54,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we could work together and figure out who would be good.

298
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:58,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's definitely a circuit of folks that play in this space.

299
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:02,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will proactively reach out to all of them.

300
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're at conferences.

301
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They're at school committee conferences and things like that.

302
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:10,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have plenty of opportunities to meet folks.

303
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear Peter has some experience.

304
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing?

305
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I worked with CEO and owner Paul Riggi

306
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:32,292
[SPEAKER_04]: and other members on the HVAC OPM selection team and have previously worked on OPM selections for other districts.

307
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:46,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody else out in the universe here that would like to participate?

308
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:54,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like Larry, I can offer to support.

309
00:25:54,607 --> 00:26:05,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no experience in this particular, but I'm happy to learn if people feel like I would be an addition, I'm happy to be involved, but I do not have any experience directly.

310
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

311
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I can also just say that I would be,

312
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:24,120
[SPEAKER_01]: less than an asset to this sort of committee and also that I don't have time.

313
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:28,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really sorry, but I'm here and I'm listening.

314
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:41,069
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so Aaron, maybe you can be our fourth member so that we have some flexibility in terms of having a quorum.

315
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:47,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you just need arms and legs, people to review, make sure things make sense.

316
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:52,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that would be a great role for you.

317
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can learn all about the city's procurement process.

318
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm sure that can be useful somewhere else.

319
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:11,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what I have is Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, Fiona, and Bob, if Bob is required and or wants to be on the committee.

320
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody else?

321
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:15,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, I'll help out any way I can.

322
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:22,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I have experience with the science lab project, with the boiler room MSBA projects, and obviously with Fiona.

323
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can help you, I'll help you out any way I can.

324
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,463
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm going to put your name down.

325
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion to approve this group, Fiona, Bob, if required, Jenny, Libby, Peter, Aaron, and John?

326
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:37,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

327
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Emily.

328
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by?

00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:45,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

[SPEAKER_02]: Tracy?

331
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll do a quick roll call because we have to.
