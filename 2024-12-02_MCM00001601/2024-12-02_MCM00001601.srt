11
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I'm a friendly.

12
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe never Graham here.

13
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Member and papa absent member all about it.

14
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:18,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Member rental here.

15
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:20,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Members present?

16
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:23,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor and Logo Karen.

17
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So, four present and three absent.

18
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,323
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can all please stand to salute the flag.

19
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:43,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:47,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

21
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:52,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Our agenda today is long and short.

22
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,543
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one item on the agenda, that's the short part.

23
00:01:57,724 --> 00:02:09,174
[SPEAKER_02]: The long part is that it is the first reading of policy ACGB Title IX sexual discrimination grievance procedure resolution 2024-38 offered by member Rousseau.

24
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, before we dive into reading this 18-page policy, did you want to give us some headlines about what this policy is all about?

25
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:27,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

26
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really hard to give out.

27
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to note, we have another member online now.

28
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, recorded member Branley.

29
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:36,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

30
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:40,039
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very long policy.

31
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:43,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never draft a policy of this length.

32
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:48,203
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so long that we might be the only people to ever read it.

33
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:58,648
[SPEAKER_00]: But this came from our professional association and came down from a set of lawyers that they contract with regarding Title IX changes.

34
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:05,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Title IX has sort of been batted back and forth through each of the administrations that we have had in the

35
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,291
[SPEAKER_00]: White House.

36
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Biden version.

37
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we don't have to go through all of this again in the next couple of years.

38
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:21,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of many policies that we have been going through related to Title IX.

39
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,718
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grievance procedure.

40
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:30,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who wishes to file a grievance through Title IX would follow this procedure.

41
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,741
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of preamble.

42
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are step-by-steps, who has what rights and when.

43
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:49,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will admit that I lack knowledge about prior versions of this, so I can't really speak to the what changed.

44
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:51,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Ms.

45
00:03:52,985 --> 00:04:02,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen, if you, I didn't even ask you, but is there any big, giant change that you feel, or is it just such a wholesale change that you don't,

46
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:12,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of it is the scope of the sexual discrimination and sex-based harassment, so it's very clearly defined in that.

47
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:20,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And also just bits and pieces here and there about the process, how that is different, witnesses.

48
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:27,428
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a part in here previously about being able to question the accuser.

49
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:33,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they've changed a lot of those types of language and processes.

50
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:41,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But it mostly was just about the sex discrimination and sex-based harassment that they really clearly defined, I feel.

51
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

52
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:44,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

53
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:48,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having the knowledge of the previous one, it sounds like really

54
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:53,750
[SPEAKER_00]: fleshing out the areas where there was always litigation, because it's like, well, what does that really mean?

55
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,315
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good news.

56
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:56,996
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good news.

57
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:00,242
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have an update of this size, it's good to see that.

58
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:01,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Member Framley.

59
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:17,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I attempted to do an AI summary and I failed because this is too big for the free AIs to ingest.

60
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:24,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't about to pay for an AI subscription just to be able to do it on this one giant policy.

61
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean,

62
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:35,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go through it page by page or section by section and just like, this is what this section means.

63
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have a strong.

64
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:42,273
[SPEAKER_00]: disliked the idea of reading it because I did time it.

65
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:55,659
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to have a Siri or AI read us the policy, it's an hour and 27 minutes just without us stopping or having questions.

66
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was with a pretty fast voice.

67
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping nobody here is desiring that we do that.

68
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I,

69
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,358
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know in the policy, and this is something new.

70
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:11,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never put this in a policy before at the very end.

71
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,661
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a statement that I think we might want to put into other policies.

72
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:22,885
[SPEAKER_00]: It says updates to contact information of school staff identified within this policy may be made without school committee notification.

73
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:30,189
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's bad form to have in your policies like the names and phone numbers of individuals.

74
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,372
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case where it's sort of part of the point of the policy is that that's all there.

75
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:44,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was a good workaround so we are not reviewing this policy every single time a staff member retires or we hire somebody new.

76
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:50,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's sort of the outlier for how the policy language is drafted.

77
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:57,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the 10-mile diversion.

78
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:01,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to waive the reading?

79
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make that motion.

80
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So a motion to waive the reading by Member Ruseau.

81
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

82
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Member Branley.

83
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:15,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

84
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:17,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Branley?

85
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

86
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:21,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

87
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

88
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Intoppa is presently absent still, I think.

89
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:27,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Olapade?

90
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:28,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

91
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:30,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Reinfeld?

92
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

93
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Members say yes, and Mayor Langenkern is still not quite with us.

94
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So five in the affirmative, two absent.

95
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reading is waived.

96
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've just saved an hour and 27 minutes.

97
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:44,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for...

98
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:45,455
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.

99
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:59,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So members, so I think it probably makes sense to go through this like chunk by chunk and just ask for folks to let us know if they have questions or comments about that as we go through.

100
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:13,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once we go through that, we can sort of see where we land and decide, you know, if there's another motion to entertain whether to pass this or pass it on to another meeting or

101
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:19,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of waving reading both readings here tonight.

102
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

103
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:37,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we do that, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components.

104
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:52,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,

105
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,718
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things.

106
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:09,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, so yes, it is so that that language went to the lawyers, I forget the law firm that uses and they.

107
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:14,895
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded upon and translated it as much as was actually needed.

108
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:19,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read the DESE, I mean, not the DESE, the Department of Ed Language.

109
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:22,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's, if they simply copied it and stuck their name on it, I wouldn't know.

110
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:32,878
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is, I did not make changes other than updating the contact information, replacing the district with Medford.

111
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:38,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, there were a few places, you know, punctuation and

112
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, there were some typos.

113
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,241
[SPEAKER_00]: But so other than that, I did not change the content.

114
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, of course, malegal perspective, a comma can matter.

115
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very cautious.

116
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use Grammarly.

117
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:57,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Grammarly has a lot of recommendations to make this thing better.

118
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:04,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not take any of them other than where a comma was necessary or not necessary.

119
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,392
[SPEAKER_00]: It was clearly just a mistake in the drafting of the language.

120
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't like the format.

121
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,675
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many levels.

122
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I felt uncomfortable really making a big change because it did come from lawyers and because Title IX is such a gigantic, complex thing that I don't fully understand.

123
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:31,344
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're at.

124
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having Member Ruseau and Ms.

125
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:45,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.

126
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So, would you like me to share the screen?

127
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be great.

128
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:54,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think that's a good idea.

129
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's we can start at the top.

130
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,509
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a preamble that goes on for several pages.

131
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So, up until page.

132
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:18,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Halfway down page five is a preamble that in my reading describes what the intention of the policy is and why it was built in the first place.

133
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:22,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will open the floor to any questions about the preamble.

134
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Just realized you can't see me shaking my head probably because I have this text up.

135
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,220
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything on the preamble.

136
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:42,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing no questions on the preamble, the next section is definitions.

137
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble.

138
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:52,979
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 1 piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination.

139
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Should that be sexual discrimination?

140
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:57,624
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.

141
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:09,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail.

142
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting that- I can search.

143
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm searching too.

144
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:22,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's 26 instances of the words sex discrimination.

145
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Now- I'm not inclined to go in and

146
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 43 of sexual discrimination.

147
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:38,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that it is not the only thing in this document that I have similar concerns about.

148
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:42,898
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't actually know technically if there are differences between the two.

149
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,759
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem like the same thing to me.

150
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:55,027
[SPEAKER_01]: My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.

151
00:12:57,582 --> 00:13:09,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fine with a fine and replace with sex discrimination with sexual discrimination if nobody has any reason to disagree with that.

152
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, I guess my only thought is,

153
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:30,376
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're not changing anything of substance, but we might be if we make this change, right?

154
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:37,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not intending for it to be substantive, but it could be unbeknownst to us.

155
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would advocate that we leave it alone.

156
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:41,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

157
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:42,745
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

158
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,067
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

159
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,430
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll completely mess up the formatting to add a few characters anyways.

160
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:56,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so about halfway down page 5, we start with definitions.

161
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:04,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like they go to page 8, halfway down page 8.

162
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham, are you looking at the agenda?

163
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am looking at the agenda.

164
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:09,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

165
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:10,943
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.

166
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on page 3 to page 6.

167
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,629
[SPEAKER_00]: 6, thank you.

168
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:19,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

169
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:20,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

170
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:30,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, definitions, I don't think they're particularly consistent, but I don't want us to have to engage lawyers.

171
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions about the definitions?

172
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:45,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

173
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:46,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

174
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The next section is about reporting sexual discrimination.

175
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:58,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and filing a formal complaint, so that goes on for several pages.

176
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:06,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I can just kind of give, like, quick.

177
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through the steps process real quick.

178
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, that would be great.

179
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, starts out with who may.

180
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:19,388
[SPEAKER_00]: file reports, and it's anyone, which I think is interesting.

181
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:27,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be the victim or whatever the proper term isn't, according to the definitions.

182
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:33,401
[SPEAKER_00]: How to report the discrimination is in the

183
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:41,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are not steps, sorry, this again, this organization of this document was a challenge.

184
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,328
[SPEAKER_00]: There's internal reporting that's related to employees.

185
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:53,975
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the district, next is the district response to the report, which of course the district will respond.

186
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:56,878
[SPEAKER_00]: There are five

187
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:15,185
[SPEAKER_00]: things that the district will do properly and confidentially, contact the complainant, inform the complainant of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes.

188
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:24,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what the point of number four is.

189
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:25,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

190
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:32,615
[SPEAKER_00]: The complainant will have, it will be explained to the complainant what the process is for filing the complaint.

191
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:36,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Next we have filing itself.

192
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,742
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the actual process.

193
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Who may file it?

194
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,625
[SPEAKER_00]: A much longer version.

195
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,928
[SPEAKER_00]: This document is very good at repeating itself.

196
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:55,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So a much longer version of who may file the process again.

197
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:01,198
[SPEAKER_00]: in the longer words, more words.

198
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:10,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it say step one somewhere?

199
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:11,004
[SPEAKER_00]: It did.

200
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:11,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

201
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:12,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one.

202
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:16,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So step two is the consideration of supportive measures.

203
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,149
[SPEAKER_00]: So the complainant and the respondent.

204
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three is written notice of the allegations.

205
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a definition of the word consider?

206
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:45,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not offer, it's not, like I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other.

207
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,612
[SPEAKER_00]: For the rest of us.

208
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:49,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

209
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in the policy that I can see.

210
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:51,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

211
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:56,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

212
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus offering those supportive measures.

213
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit.

214
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:09,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a section up here about, what was it?

215
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it up here?

216
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you go up to the part D of the reporting discrimination.

217
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: It's provided.

218
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bullet four.

219
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: which I agree with Maru, so that doesn't make, how do you determine?

220
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:34,005
[SPEAKER_01]: That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why.

221
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:38,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons.

222
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,130
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an imminent danger.

223
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:49,417
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.

224
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:54,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

225
00:18:54,145 --> 00:19:02,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the non-punitive.

226
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:09,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we continue?

227
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

228
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:21,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hard part is, of course, without specific examples, it gets really, this is not easy stuff to draft.

229
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:30,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so those are the written notice, what will be included in the notice, there will be a statement for evading retaliation, of course.

230
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Submitting false information, all the things you'd expect.

231
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:56,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Step four is the consideration of whether to dismiss the formal complaint.

232
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,580
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some mandatory, yes.

233
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:06,202
[SPEAKER_05]: On section three, number seven, just need a capital on that.

234
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

235
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:11,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

236
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Grammarly didn't notice that.

237
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It also doesn't want to read 18 page prophecies.

238
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

239
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:31,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, step four is about whether or not the complaint is subject to mandatory discretionary dismissal.

240
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:38,561
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the district cannot identify the.

241
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:40,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Respondent.

242
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:55,157
[SPEAKER_00]: which is often known as the accused in regular language, then of course there's no way to further deal with the complaint.

243
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,162
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a may dismiss, these are the may dismiss.

244
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:11,489
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the person is not involved in their educational programs and is not involved with the district, we may dismiss, not to say we have to,

245
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,325
[SPEAKER_00]: if the complainant voluntarily withdraws.

246
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:31,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's more stuff about dismissal.

247
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:40,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to summarize without just reading it, but I'm not reading it.

248
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:53,672
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dismissal is appealed, the district will do a set of things, notifying all the right people.

249
00:21:56,094 --> 00:22:01,256
[SPEAKER_00]: When the complaint is dismissed, the district will, at a minimum, offer supportive measures.

250
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:12,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Respondent will be notified of the allegations and supportive measures will be offered there as well.

251
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Isis underscored, okay.

252
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:19,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, so let's see.

253
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,273
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's more just dismissal.

254
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:26,873
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important there.

255
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let me read that one since I can't remember it.

256
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:43,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Dismissal of a formal complaint for purposes of Title IX from the district from addressing allegations under any other relevant district policies or procedures, including but not limited to the civil rights grievance procedure,

257
00:22:44,438 --> 00:23:02,334
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullying prevention and intervention plan, that thing, the student code of conduct and or collective bargaining contract, nor will it preclude the district from addressing the allegations pursuant to the grievance process set out in section two of this procedure.

258
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:09,801
[SPEAKER_00]: The Title IX coordinator shall have the discretion to make any such referrals and proceed as appropriate in regard to the allegations.

259
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:19,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because a dismissal within this final line has happened, that doesn't mean it's the end, necessarily.

260
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:27,017
[SPEAKER_01]: This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other.

261
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:31,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

262
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, step five is the initial inventory deletion.

263
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,082
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the...

264
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:41,874
[SPEAKER_00]: The details on what the district will do standard approved.

265
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:45,516
[SPEAKER_00]: The burden is on the district.

266
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Election of evidence, let's see.

267
00:23:58,321 --> 00:23:59,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Presentation of witnesses.

268
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:05,785
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have no, there'll be no gag orders.

269
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Each party will have one advisor.

270
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:36,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice, we can see privacy, medical treatment, so the district cannot access medical information in any situation here.

271
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless, of course, they can unless they consent to it.

272
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:50,022
[SPEAKER_00]: The investigator timelines, so speed matters.

273
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It always matters to everybody involved in these things.

274
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's 1 of the changes that did happen that.

275
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,453
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a 10 day waiting period.

276
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:07,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you're involved in this as the victim or accused or whatever the proper terms here are.

277
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:13,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And once all the investigations are done, everybody has to sit on their hands for 10 business days.

278
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:20,208
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's going to school, everybody's, you know, it didn't make a lot of sense.

279
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:27,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was one big change that they made is that that 10 day mandatory waiting period is gone.

280
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:32,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

281
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.

282
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:42,046
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.

283
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:43,547
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't.

284
00:25:43,787 --> 00:26:01,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that for minor things, I think everybody would think reasonable is, you know, same day, a day or two, but for major, major things, I can certainly see it taking many days or longer once there's lawyers and, you know, all kinds of other things involved.

285
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint.

286
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:09,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

287
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:10,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

288
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,141
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's, this is the opportunity for parties to access and respond to the evidence.

289
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:22,102
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence, there's limitation in here.

290
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:29,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to redact confidential information not directly related to the allegations.

291
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,204
[SPEAKER_00]: FERPA is very much still in effect here.

292
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:38,505
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an override FERPA.

293
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:53,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anybody in the public that wants to know, that's the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is, you'll hear school committee members use it when we respond to you about why we can't actually do things you ask us to do sometimes.

294
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:03,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody is prohibited from disseminating any of the evidence for any purpose not directly related to the grievance procedures.

295
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:08,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't take it and go to Facebook or anything.

296
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:15,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It is evidence that you have the right to see, but you do not have the right to disseminate.

297
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:18,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Memorandum wants to say something.

298
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, so this is the section where, yeah, thank you.

299
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:26,874
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the section where I had a lot of questions and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well.

300
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,236
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are more than two parties, right?

301
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:46,007
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about a group, like a team of people or multiple staff, I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people

302
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:49,759
[SPEAKER_01]: as a group talking amongst themselves.

303
00:27:49,799 --> 00:28:13,515
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being, or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these, where it's multiple things happening simultaneously versus an investigation into a group situation.

304
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:16,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really addressed and I don't know

305
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,157
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's guidance there.

306
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:40,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.

307
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Franklin, can you give us an example?

308
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not tracking like a group.

309
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:52,146
[SPEAKER_02]: If a group does something, it's because individuals in the group did something, right?

310
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:59,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I have examples that aren't Title IX specific, is that?

311
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

312
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:02,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

313
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:11,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.

314
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:26,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different.

315
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen.

316
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,010
[SPEAKER_01]: One student is suspended, another one isn't.

317
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:38,753
[SPEAKER_01]: parents are comparing notes and they're saying, this is what the administration told me.

318
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:52,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this is what they told me and I can't release information about this other student, but the parent has given me this information and I want to bring that as part of my complaint because our kids were together.

319
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:53,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that helpful?

320
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little helpful.

321
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Ms.

322
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen, if you have any thoughts on that.

323
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:15,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think in the end, like the district can't, like they can't broadly meet out consequences.

324
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they have to do that specifically and individually, right?

325
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see why AA parents would do that or want to know like what else is happening.

326
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,134
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like there's a video of something that happens and

327
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:40,639
[SPEAKER_01]: One complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.

328
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:51,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think it's not, so the consequence wouldn't necessarily be one size fits all.

329
00:30:51,200 --> 00:31:05,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we start doing these investigations, we find out more information and then apply what the discipline would be or what sort of restorative circles or supportive measures would be.

330
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,386
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's,

331
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:21,537
[SPEAKER_03]: like finding out what each student's specific role was, you know, like in regards to vaping, maybe the student that brought all the vapes in might have a heavier consequence than a student that just took one.

332
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:30,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's really doing a deep dive into all the information and then looking at what is going to be the best line of

333
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,986
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how do we handle this with each student?

334
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:40,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can have conversations with parents like your child's role was a little bit different.

335
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:47,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is this is why the consequence was a little more severe or was not as severe, if that makes sense.

336
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:56,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember, I felt as it relates to a Title nine investigation.

337
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, if some if.

338
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:10,192
[SPEAKER_01]: there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students.

339
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:27,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the schools say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.

340
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And we as a group want to file a complaint.

341
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:40,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints?

342
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be a group complaint and then it may it may.

343
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,553
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, separate into more individual investigations.

344
00:32:53,653 --> 00:33:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there are, say, four women who don't feel like the accommodations are appropriate and they file together, then we would look at it and as a as a group, look at a solution for them.

345
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:13,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be a little bit different, I think, than, say, a bullying or sexual harassment

346
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: like a group response to that.

347
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's looking at each individual's actions and part of, say, a sexual harassment complaint, and then going from there.

348
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:41,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They vary so widely when things happen, so it's really hard to give a if-then sort of answer because it's really, really, you never know.

349
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:48,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Once this complaint comes in and you start to do the investigation, it takes a life on its own and it does involve more people.

350
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like really doing that due diligence and looking into it and then going from there.

351
00:33:56,718 --> 00:34:00,121
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the ramifications for the students?

352
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we discipline them?

353
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we not?

354
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we say like, we work with the parents about maybe they need some social skills groups or counseling in school or whatever it may be.

355
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:23,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's really hard to say we're gonna do this if this happens, because when we're in the midst of the investigation, we're seeing a lot more things come to light, either for the positive or for the negative.

356
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:32,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to jump in here also that this is the scenario given there has to be a victim.

357
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:37,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch of students getting in trouble for vaping is not title nine.

358
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:43,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we decided we were going to say just the girls are going to get in trouble and not the boys, because.

359
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:48,865
[SPEAKER_00]: The victim who's the victim, the district enforcing a policy.

360
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:55,033
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking action is we, I suppose we could be the perpetrator.

361
00:34:56,415 --> 00:35:01,441
[SPEAKER_00]: As a district, but I don't think this policy considers that the district is actually a perpetrator.

362
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:14,047
[SPEAKER_00]: In violation, I mean, obviously plenty of title nine things are about the district refusing to, you know, deal with sports and all the other types of things, but there are victims there.

363
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:17,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind and I'm trying.

364
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:18,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

365
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:21,850
[SPEAKER_01]: To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and.

366
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:28,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so let me find a page we're on since I've already.

367
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were on.

368
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:34,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Page nine.

369
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:37,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Step seven, if you keep going down further.

370
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:37,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.

371
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad somebody is paying attention to that.

372
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:44,013
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so.

373
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:48,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all right, so let's see.

374
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:54,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure.

375
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:57,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is a interconnected.

376
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigation that remains within

377
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:05,066
[SPEAKER_01]: single grievance or.

378
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:08,031
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you.

379
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:10,615
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

380
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:14,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So next up is step seven, completion of the investigative report.

381
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:21,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eight is the party's opportunity to respond to the report.

382
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:25,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Step nine is directed written questions from the parties.

383
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:33,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the investigative report has been sent to the parties, but prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility.

384
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:55,784
[SPEAKER_00]: The decision-maker shall award both the complainant and the respondent the opportunity to submit to the decision-maker relevant questions of the other party or any witness, provide the party with the other party's and our witness's written responses to said questions, and allow for additional limited follow-up questions from each party in writing.

385
00:36:57,044 --> 00:37:02,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions that seek disclosure information protected under legally recognized privileges, such as FERPA,

386
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:08,829
[SPEAKER_00]: will shall not be permitted unless the person holding the privilege waives their right.

387
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:18,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is seems pretty standard, not as awful as an actual deposition, but so.

388
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:32,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this 10 days to submit directed relevant questions.

389
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:36,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is still 10 days.

390
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,696
[SPEAKER_00]: There was that other 10 days on top of that 10 days.

391
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:45,543
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be hard to feel like things are being taken seriously if we just keep adding two-week increments.

392
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:49,427
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

393
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:09,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 days to craft your questions, five days to get before your answers are due, another three days, and then another three days.

394
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:15,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's no wonder things take forever, but they have to.

395
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:19,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody has to do the work and have their rights protected.

396
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:30,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, and then step 10 is determination of responsibility, findings of act by the decision maker, who's on this call.

397
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Joan is, oh to Joan, we just lose Joan?

398
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:35,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we, oh no, there you are, sorry.

399
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:37,386
[SPEAKER_00]: She's here, she's here.

400
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,668
[SPEAKER_00]: You moved to the top for some reason on my screen.

401
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard of proof, decision makers findings,

402
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:54,186
[SPEAKER_00]: The determination will be written, of course, and sent simultaneously to both parties.

403
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,928
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some more very long time frames here.

404
00:39:04,848 --> 00:39:06,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Section C, remedies.

405
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:10,629
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what can be done.

406
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,171
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the remedies, the elimination of the harassing environment.

407
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:31,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is section D, page will be on 15.

408
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:33,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Persons doing discipline.

409
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about discipline, as you would imagine.

410
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:49,453
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is a reference to the two Massachusetts general laws related to special, to behaviors that are attributable to disabilities.

411
00:39:51,843 --> 00:39:55,366
[SPEAKER_00]: But I won't go into those, because those stand alone.

412
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:09,517
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's the imposition of sanctions, compliance with the imposition of the sanctions.

413
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:17,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

414
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:19,018
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of important.

415
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:35,762
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, if there was a determination that it had not happened or that it was not, sorry, not that it not happened, that it was not, um, considered, um, am I misreading this?

416
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:41,843
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the sentence make this one mean?

417
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:42,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?

418
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:48,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it means that if they make a false statement.

419
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:56,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let me read this again.

420
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:57,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

421
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:19,580
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, it seems like it's reading as if the timeline coordinator will not discipline a party witness or other participating entity if they make a false statement about sex discrimination, or if they felt as though it was, but it was not actually based off of the determining criteria after a review process had occurred.

422
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So there'll be no repercussions towards the original respondent.

423
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:27,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is how it reads.

424
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:29,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

425
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:30,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound right to you, Jo?

426
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:31,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

427
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:32,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

428
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:33,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

429
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:35,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

430
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:39,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawyers do know how to make it hard.

431
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might have been the previous section, but so there's this timeline.

432
00:41:47,564 --> 00:41:53,467
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made.

433
00:41:54,168 --> 00:42:02,753
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe.

434
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So those would be the supportive measures that you offer?

435
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:08,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, in advance.

436
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:09,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

437
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:11,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

438
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:11,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

439
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

440
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen, correct me if I'm wrong, but supportive measures could be quite substantial.

441
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:29,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we felt the student couldn't be in the building, we would be offering them another option for how to get an education outside of the building.

442
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:34,150
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that they just get to come to school and we're like, be nice.

443
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,390
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we mean.

444
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,052
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something as significant as that, correct?

445
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, and if it was a staff member who made a complaint that they were being sexually harassed, walking them to the car at night, offering them counseling, that sort of thing.

446
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:59,743
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a wide range, but yes, it could be a big supportive measure that we offer depending on the situation.

447
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:03,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that supportive measure potentially include

448
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,099
[SPEAKER_01]: removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator?

449
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to go back and see.

450
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:25,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can remove until you do the investigation, but you can separate sort of, you know, really close supervision, put in a safety plan.

451
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would have to go back and I haven't experienced that yet.

452
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:32,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I don't.

453
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:34,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you have to

454
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:39,769
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that you do the investigation first before you can remove.

455
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:54,102
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant.

456
00:43:54,202 --> 00:44:01,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.

457
00:44:02,977 --> 00:44:03,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

458
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:13,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's really important that when we have a conversation about the supportive measures, we also can have like counseling staff there with us.

459
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:18,464
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents can be involved in what sort of protections do we need to put into place?

460
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:27,668
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any legal protections that may have to happen as well, like involving the school resource officer and that sort of thing as well.

461
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,968
[SPEAKER_01]: but like administrative leave can't happen during it.

462
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And when does administrative leave?

463
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,971
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the.

464
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:43,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It could possibly, it could possibly.

465
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we really, um, engage with our, with our attorney to say like, this is what has been reported to us.

466
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:53,280
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the process of an investigation.

467
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Does somebody go out on paid leave until the full investigation is happening?

468
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:02,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's where we would seek how a green spans, um,

469
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:04,833
[SPEAKER_03]: advice on that.

470
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:07,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Privacy challenges on both sides are significant.

471
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:08,575
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

472
00:45:08,675 --> 00:45:08,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

473
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:12,037
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

474
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:15,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up we have, did I finish this section?

475
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:16,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.

476
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Informal process.

477
00:45:19,721 --> 00:45:19,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So

478
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,774
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an option to have an informal process.

479
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:31,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an option to have an informal process.

480
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,086
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next is section F, emergency removal under Title IX.

481
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:04,836
[SPEAKER_00]: The district may remove a respondent on an emergency basis at any time that the district one undertakes an individualized safety and

482
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:24,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And risk analysis to determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual discrimination justifies removal and that there is no alternative to the respondents emergency removal to mitigate the threat presented.

483
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:30,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And three, provides the respondent with notice and the opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following removal.

484
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's there.

485
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:35,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we never have to use that.

486
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:37,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Anonymous reporting.

487
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:46,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that we may take anonymous reports.

488
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:55,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

489
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:56,693
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do supportive measures.

490
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,924
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot provide, oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:12,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we can't do supportive measures if we don't know who is supporting.

492
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, that seems...

493
00:47:23,738 --> 00:47:35,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we don't know who the reporter is, that's different than confidentially reporting, but there's really not much, there's pretty significant limitations on what could actually be done.

494
00:47:36,865 --> 00:47:43,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody wanna talk about that one at all?

495
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:47,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint.

496
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:49,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where,

497
00:47:51,257 --> 00:48:16,780
[SPEAKER_01]: That's certainly where we've seen in higher education, these things come out is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint or whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just people need to,

498
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,084
[SPEAKER_01]: people need to be good people, but.

499
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:25,026
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so next up is appeals.

500
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:36,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an entire appeals process, of course, says who to send the appeal to five days after the determination.

501
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:45,896
[SPEAKER_00]: The decision maker may not take, sorry, the decision maker for the appeal cannot take part in the event.

502
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:49,594
[SPEAKER_00]: could not have taken part in the investigation.

503
00:48:52,716 --> 00:49:03,184
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have the original policy as I received it had, frankly, a lot more decision makers that we have decided to go with.

504
00:49:04,385 --> 00:49:07,208
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some freedom and leeway to do that.

505
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:13,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see both sides of that, but I'll explain that when I get to that section later.

506
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:20,735
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if.

507
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:28,822
[SPEAKER_01]: This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeal officer is involved in this?

508
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:31,624
[SPEAKER_01]: There needs to be an alternative.

509
00:49:31,644 --> 00:49:34,947
[SPEAKER_00]: The phone, can you answer that?

510
00:49:35,505 --> 00:50:01,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be, so the roles can be interchangeable, like one person could fill all these roles, but if say like John Bruno, who is the appeal officer is involved in the case, then I might be the appeals officer, or we might look at other people like the informal resolution facilitators, if they were not involved, that they could make the decision at that point about the appeal.

511
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:24,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths.

512
00:50:24,704 --> 00:50:27,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only because that particular role had one person.

513
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:40,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So, is your suggestion that there be more than 1 person listed as an appeals facilitator?

514
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Appeals for what they, what the.

515
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:50,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think what I'm hearing is Bowen saying is that frankly, all these people are interchangeable.

516
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:56,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if if John Bruno was involved, then obviously.

517
00:50:56,977 --> 00:51:02,039
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not going to be the investigator or the, I mean, you know, if.

518
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:09,275
[SPEAKER_00]: that these are all roles that can just be swapped around to ensure that there's not a conflict.

519
00:51:09,295 --> 00:51:13,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we'd have to list every person under every section.

520
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the point is sort of that people know who to call.

521
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:24,991
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you were concerned about John Bruno as like you're writing a complaint against him,

522
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:30,872
[SPEAKER_00]: then obviously you're not going to want him to be the appeals officer.

523
00:51:30,912 --> 00:51:32,994
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wouldn't be a very good investigator.

524
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:39,622
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are just sort of like defaults is how I take them.

525
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:44,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how I take them as well.

526
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:48,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that.

527
00:51:48,908 --> 00:51:52,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much.

528
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:56,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

529
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:59,937
[SPEAKER_01]: At my childhood school, just not picking on him.

530
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:02,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

531
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:05,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I on this?

532
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:07,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Age 15?

533
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.

534
00:52:15,513 --> 00:52:15,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

535
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:18,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

536
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:19,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had finished that section there.

537
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:25,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Record keeping.

538
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:34,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, just keep records related to this procedure maintained for a period of seven years.

539
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:36,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I said days.

540
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:36,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confused.

541
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:37,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Years.

542
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:45,710
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much standard stuff.

543
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:54,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Employment agencies, this is boilerplate stuff, where to go.

544
00:52:59,153 --> 00:53:00,594
[SPEAKER_00]: is identification of key personnel.

545
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:02,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's this section down here.

546
00:53:03,355 --> 00:53:11,317
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in some, the boilerplate code that I originally had had an investigator at each school.

547
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:14,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sort of see the value in that.

548
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:18,040
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if somebody's

549
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,641
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly well-trained in that, then maybe they're a better choice.

550
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:33,424
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other part of that that I was a little bit like, so McGlynn is kind of far away from the Missittook.

551
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:42,328
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that Mr. O'Brien is going to be doing Title IX investigations over at the Minnesota.

552
00:53:42,488 --> 00:53:49,351
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other side, I also was kind of like, it seems better to have somebody not at your school doing the investigation.

553
00:53:49,871 --> 00:54:01,096
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if we were to do it where we had really, it would have to be an entire table of like, if you're here, this is who you contact.

554
00:54:01,556 --> 00:54:02,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it gets really messy.

555
00:54:02,997 --> 00:54:03,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

556
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, Joan's at the top, so Joan's gonna get the calls.

557
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:19,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this does not preclude an investigator at another school doing it.

558
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:21,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Right correct.

559
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

560
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:24,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had 2 people.

561
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:30,142
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 administrators that did any sexual harassment complaints.

562
00:54:31,362 --> 00:54:35,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this has expanded it to a few more roles throughout the district.

563
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, if it's at the McGlynn Elementary School, then we might have Jen Skane or Sheila do it.

564
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:45,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interchangeable.

565
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:52,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, you know, depending on the specific situation, we would look at who would be the best person to do the investigation.

566
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:54,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be myself.

567
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:59,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be, you know, human resources might get involved as well.

568
00:54:59,419 --> 00:55:04,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do like how we have more people involved.

569
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:09,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

570
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:22,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, this prominently displayed on the district website.

571
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:30,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's anybody who has an idea what the word prominently displayed means in a in legalese but I.

572
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:48,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I will ask, I'll send an email afterwards to ask that, that if it's not already there that, you know, Jonah's listed as the title and coordinator maybe in the about or section or somewhere very prominently.

573
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:58,251
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think on the actual main page, just like right there makes a lot of sense, because that gets very much.

574
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:02,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have the non-discrimination statement.

575
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:10,139
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have the district educational statement.

576
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,920
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets very long.

577
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:14,762
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just my opinion.

578
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:22,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at an hour and we have sort of been through it.

579
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot to digest.

580
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:35,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have another chance at a regular meeting when we do the second reading, which we will not read also, hopefully.

581
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other

582
00:56:43,103 --> 00:56:46,927
[SPEAKER_02]: questions or changes suggested?

583
00:56:46,947 --> 00:57:02,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent, because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything.

584
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:03,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm

585
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:11,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I think another difficulty is, is trying to.

586
00:57:12,225 --> 00:57:19,549
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are components of things that we want to change without changing, like, state or federal guidelines and the terminology that they're using.

587
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't want to do anything that's going outside of what their expectations or recommendations are.

588
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not kind of following their requirements.

589
00:57:29,254 --> 00:57:30,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another difficulty.

590
00:57:30,495 --> 00:57:30,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

591
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:33,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean.

592
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:51,011
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whenever I tell people what it's like to be on the school committee, I do talk about that the federal, the state, and of course, the local, everybody's got their hands in the pie, and nobody talks to each other or cares, frankly, what the other one thinks.

593
00:57:51,231 --> 00:58:02,795
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do end up with definitions that can not only be not consistent, but can even be contradictory, and we're just left to sit in that stew.

594
00:58:04,015 --> 00:58:11,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's tough, especially when you're writing, you know, we write one policy like the bullying one, which comes from the state house.

595
00:58:12,942 --> 00:58:19,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are very specific definitions of, you know, aggressor is the word they use.

596
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:30,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here there's there's the respondent, which is like the most mild mannered version of that probably anybody could ever come up with.

597
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:30,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

598
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:39,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just have to live with the fact that in some policies we are calling those folks the respondent and other ones that are the aggressor.

599
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:42,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the state one actually has two different words.

600
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:45,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Perpetrators have been proven.

601
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:46,927
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't put that in.

602
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:47,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

603
00:58:48,748 --> 00:58:49,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

604
00:58:49,128 --> 00:58:53,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, victim isn't even listed in this one as the act in their definition section.

605
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do say that alleged victimism.

606
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:58,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

607
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that person, but that's not.

608
00:59:05,328 --> 00:59:06,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard.

609
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:15,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully nobody has to go through any of this, especially if they have to go through it in multiple offices, because that would be terrible.

610
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:29,595
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a motion to approve the first reading.

611
00:59:33,322 --> 00:59:34,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll make a motion.

612
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:38,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve the first reading by member of the party.

613
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:42,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second seconded by member Branley.

614
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:44,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

615
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:48,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Branley.

616
00:59:50,051 --> 00:59:50,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

617
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:51,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

618
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So does this automatically go to a regular meeting, or do we waive?

619
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:16,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So 5 in the affirmative, 2 absent, motion passes.

620
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:28,858
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the question that you have is, does this go, are we waiving a second reading, or is this going to another meeting?

621
01:00:29,218 --> 01:00:30,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that your question?

622
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:30,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my question.

623
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:41,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I know we accidentally did we have 2nd readings 2 meetings ago and then several of us, we already did the 2nd reading.

624
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:42,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it on the agenda?

625
01:00:43,276 --> 01:00:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: The 2nd reading has to actually be on the agenda because that's the opportunity for the public to.

626
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,220
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the 2nd chance it's not for us.

627
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,501
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the public to be like.

628
01:00:53,740 --> 01:01:01,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you saw if you're watching the meeting and you see something discussed and you want to discuss it, you may not be prepared.

629
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:05,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second reading, I think, should happen at the next meeting.

630
01:01:05,347 --> 01:01:11,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be submitting a clarifying rule update to make that clear, because it's not clear.

631
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:21,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second reading will be on our next school committee agenda, which is a week from today.

632
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:28,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other motions on the floor?

633
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:31,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn.

634
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeld.

635
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a second roll.

636
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:36,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

637
01:01:37,691 --> 01:01:39,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Branley, roll call.

638
01:01:40,332 --> 01:01:41,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Branley.

639
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:42,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

640
01:01:43,254 --> 01:01:43,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

641
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

642
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:47,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Tapas-Epstein.

643
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:47,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Olapade.

644
01:01:48,296 --> 01:01:48,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

645
01:01:49,336 --> 01:01:49,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Reinfeld.

646
01:01:50,437 --> 01:01:50,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

647
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:53,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Members say yes, Mayor Lengel-Kern is also absent.

648
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been the affirmative to absent.

649
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting is adjourned.
