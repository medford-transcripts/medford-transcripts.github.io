1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:28,229
I will read the agenda, and then we can call the roll. Please be advised that on October 28th at 5 p.m., there will be a special meeting of the Medford School Committee to be held remotely via Zoom. This meeting is being recorded. The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools' YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast Channel 9, 8, or 22, and Verizon Channel 43, 45, or 47.

2
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:50,757
The meeting will be recorded since the meeting will be held remotely. Participants can log in by using the following information. The meeting ID is 917-5576-1532. Questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

3
00:00:51,787 --> 00:01:19,192
And those too many questions must also include the following year Nate first and last name your Medford street address and your question or comment. Member so if you could call the role. Certainly I'm a friendly. I believe never Graham here. Member and papa absent member all about it. Member rental here.

4
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:48,115
Members present? Mayor and Logo Karen. So, four present and three absent. If we can all please stand to salute the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Okay.

5
00:01:48,757 --> 00:02:12,196
Our agenda today is long and short. We have one item on the agenda, that's the short part. The long part is that it is the first reading of policy ACGB Title IX sexual discrimination grievance procedure resolution 2024-38 offered by member Rousseau.

6
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:33,931
Member Rousseau, before we dive into reading this 18-page policy, did you want to give us some headlines about what this policy is all about? Sure. It is really hard to give out. Just to note, we have another member online now. Yes, recorded member Brantley.

7
00:02:36,277 --> 00:03:05,791
Thank you. So this is a very long policy. I would never draft a policy of this length. It's so long that we might be the only people to ever read it. But this came from our professional association and came down from a set of lawyers that they contract with regarding Title IX changes. Title IX has sort of been batted back and forth through each of the administrations that we have had in the

8
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:34,242
White House. So this is the Biden version. Hopefully we don't have to go through all of this again in the next couple of years. So this is one of many policies that we have been going through related to Title IX. This is the grievance procedure. So anybody who wishes to file a grievance through Title IX would follow this procedure. There is a lot of preamble.

9
00:03:34,394 --> 00:04:02,170
And then there are step-by-steps, who has what rights and when. And I will admit that I lack knowledge about prior versions of this, so I can't really speak to the what changed. I don't know, Ms. Bowen, if you, I didn't even ask you, but is there any big, giant change that you feel, or is it just such a wholesale change that you don't,

10
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:21,965
I think most of it is the scope of the sexual discrimination and sex-based harassment, so it's very clearly defined in that. And also just bits and pieces here and there about the process, how that is different, witnesses.

11
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:48,661
There was a part in here previously about being able to question the accuser. And so they've changed a lot of those types of language and processes. But it mostly was just about the sex discrimination and sex-based harassment that they really clearly defined, I feel. Great. Thank you. So not having the knowledge of the previous one, it sounds like really

12
00:04:49,623 --> 00:05:02,245
fleshing out the areas where there was always litigation, because it's like, well, what does that really mean? That's good news. That's good news. If we have an update of this size, it's good to see that. Hello, Member Framley.

13
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:27,068
So, I mean, I attempted to do an AI summary and I failed because this is too big for the free AIs to ingest. And I wasn't about to pay for an AI subscription just to be able to do it on this one giant policy. So, I mean,

14
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:38,797
We could go through it page by page or section by section and just like, this is what this section means. I personally have a strong.

15
00:05:39,472 --> 00:06:05,763
disliked the idea of reading it because I did time it. If we were to have a Siri or AI read us the policy, it's an hour and 27 minutes just without us stopping or having questions. And that was with a pretty fast voice. So I'm hoping nobody here is desiring that we do that. But the other thing I,

16
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:23,245
We'll know in the policy, and this is something new. I've never put this in a policy before at the very end. There's a statement that I think we might want to put into other policies. It says updates to contact information of school staff identified within this policy may be made without school committee notification.

17
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:51,781
So I think it's bad form to have in your policies like the names and phone numbers of individuals. But in this case where it's sort of part of the point of the policy is that that's all there. I thought this was a good workaround so we are not reviewing this policy every single time a staff member retires or we hire somebody new. But that's sort of the outlier for how the policy language is drafted.

18
00:06:53,452 --> 00:07:22,375
So that's the 10-mile diversion. Is there a motion to waive the reading? I'll make that motion. So a motion to waive the reading by Member Rousseau. I'll second. Seconded by Member Branley. Roll call. Member Branley? Yes. Member Graham? Yes.

19
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:44,853
Member Ntapa is presently absent still, I think. Member Olopade? Yes. Member Rheinfeld? Yes. Members say yes, and Mayor Langenkern is still not quite with us. So five in the affirmative, two absent. So the reading is waived. So we've just saved an hour and 27 minutes. Thank you all for...

20
00:07:45,055 --> 00:08:14,317
for that. So members, so I think it probably makes sense to go through this like chunk by chunk and just ask for folks to let us know if they have questions or comments about that as we go through. And then once we go through that, we can sort of see where we land and decide, you know, if there's another motion to entertain whether to pass this or pass it on to another meeting or

21
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:22,585
Take care of waving reading both readings here tonight. So.

22
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:53,062
Before we do that, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components. So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,

23
00:08:54,597 --> 00:09:09,802
We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things. Remember, so yes, it is so that that language went to the lawyers, I forget the law firm that uses and they.

24
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:39,839
expanded upon and translated it as much as was actually needed. I didn't read the DESE, I mean, not the DESE, the Department of Ed Language. So if it's, if they simply copied it and stuck their name on it, I wouldn't know. But yeah, this is, I did not make changes other than updating the contact information, replacing the district with Medford. And I also, there were a few places, you know, punctuation and

25
00:09:39,839 --> 00:10:09,792
Frankly, there were some typos. But so other than that, I did not change the content. Although, of course, malegal perspective, a comma can matter. I was very cautious. And I use Grammarly. Grammarly has a lot of recommendations to make this thing better. I did not take any of them other than where a comma was necessary or not necessary. It was clearly just a mistake in the drafting of the language.

26
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:31,544
I really didn't like the format. There's so many levels. But again, I felt uncomfortable really making a big change because it did come from lawyers and because Title IX is such a gigantic, complex thing that I don't fully understand. That's where we're at.

27
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:46,141
Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having Member Russo and Ms. Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.

28
00:10:47,153 --> 00:11:04,771
So, would you like me to share the screen? It'd be great. Okay, I think that's a good idea. And then let's we can start at the top. There is a preamble that goes on for several pages. So, up until page.

29
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:35,500
Halfway down page five is a preamble that in my reading describes what the intention of the policy is and why it was built in the first place. So I will open the floor to any questions about the preamble. Just realized you can't see me shaking my head probably because I have this text up. I don't have anything on the preamble.

30
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:57,944
Hearing and seeing no questions on the preamble, the next section is definitions. And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble. There's 1 piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination. Should that be sexual discrimination? You know.

31
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:27,138
Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail. Interesting that- I can search. I'm searching too. Okay, so there's 26 instances of the words sex discrimination. Now- I'm not inclined to go in and

32
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:55,167
And there's 43 of sexual discrimination. I will say that it is not the only thing in this document that I have similar concerns about. But I don't actually know technically if there are differences between the two. They seem like the same thing to me. My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.

33
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:22,471
So I'm fine with a fine and replace with sex discrimination with sexual discrimination if nobody has any reason to disagree with that. And this is, I guess my only thought is,

34
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:49,910
that we're not changing anything of substance, but we might be if we make this change, right? We're not intending for it to be substantive, but it could be unbeknownst to us. So I would advocate that we leave it alone. I agree. OK. All right. We'll completely mess up the formatting to add a few characters anyways.

35
00:13:51,952 --> 00:14:21,770
Okay, so about halfway down page 5, we start with definitions. And it looks like they go to page 8, halfway down page 8. Member Graham, are you looking at the agenda? Yes, I am looking at the agenda. I'm sorry. That's okay. So I'm on page 3 to page 6. 6, thank you. Yes. Yep.

36
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:51,385
Again, definitions, I don't think they're particularly consistent, but I don't want us to have to engage lawyers. Questions about the definitions? Okay. Okay. The next section is about reporting sexual discrimination.

37
00:14:51,875 --> 00:15:14,217
Um, and filing a formal complaint, so that goes on for several pages. So, I can just kind of give, like, quick. Go through the steps process real quick. Sure, that would be great. So, um, starts out with who may.

38
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:34,062
file reports, and it's anyone, which I think is interesting. It doesn't have to be the victim or whatever the proper term isn't, according to the definitions. How to report the discrimination is in the

39
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:57,518
Well, these are not steps, sorry, this again, this organization of this document was a challenge. There's internal reporting that's related to employees. There is the district, next is the district response to the report, which of course the district will respond. There are five

40
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:26,813
things that the district will do properly and confidentially, contact the complainant, inform the complainant of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes. I don't really know what the point of number four is. And then,

41
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:55,872
The complainant will have, it will be explained to the complainant what the process is for filing the complaint. Next we have filing itself. So this is the actual process. Who may file it? A much longer version. This document is very good at repeating itself. So a much longer version of who may file the process again.

42
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:25,893
in the longer words, more words. Did it say step one somewhere? It did. I apologize. Step one. So step two is the consideration of supportive measures. So the complainant and the respondent. Step three is written notice of the allegations.

43
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:53,517
Is there a definition of the word consider? Because it's not offer, it's not, like I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other. For the rest of us. Yeah. Not in the policy that I can see. Yeah.

44
00:17:56,437 --> 00:18:23,318
Nope. Versus offering those supportive measures. Like I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit. Yeah, there was a section up here about, what was it? Was it up here? So if you go up to the part D of the reporting discrimination. It's provided. Yeah, bullet four.

45
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:49,677
which I agree with Maru, so that doesn't make, how do you determine? That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why. Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons. There was an imminent danger. This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.

46
00:18:53,204 --> 00:19:22,347
I understand that. It's the non-punitive. Shall we continue? Yeah. I think the hard part is, of course, without specific examples, it gets really, this is not easy stuff to draft.

47
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:37,754
Okay, so those are the written notice, what will be included in the notice, there will be a statement for evading retaliation, of course. Submitting false information, all the things you'd expect.

48
00:19:48,875 --> 00:20:15,166
Step four is the consideration of whether to dismiss the formal complaint. So there are some mandatory, yes. On section three, number seven, just need a capital on that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Even Grammarly didn't notice that.

49
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:41,103
It also doesn't want to read 18 page prophecies. Thank you. So yes, step four is about whether or not the complaint is subject to mandatory discretionary dismissal. So if the district cannot identify the. Respondent.

50
00:20:42,267 --> 00:21:12,170
which is often known as the accused in regular language, then of course there's no way to further deal with the complaint. There is a may dismiss, these are the may dismiss. So if the person is not involved in their educational programs and is not involved with the district, we may dismiss, not to say we have to,

51
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:43,321
if the complainant voluntarily withdraws. So then there's more stuff about dismissal. So it's really hard to summarize without just reading it, but I'm not reading it.

52
00:21:45,228 --> 00:22:02,677
If the dismissal is appealed, the district will do a set of things, notifying all the right people. When the complaint is dismissed, the district will, at a minimum, offer supportive measures.

53
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:19,906
Respondent will be notified of the allegations and supportive measures will be offered there as well. Isis underscored, okay. And then, yeah, so let's see.

54
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:44,358
then there's more just dismissal. That's really important there. Okay, so let me read that one since I can't remember it. Dismissal of a formal complaint for purposes of Title IX from the district from addressing allegations under any other relevant district policies or procedures, including but not limited to the civil rights grievance procedure,

55
00:22:44,358 --> 00:23:10,582
the bullying prevention and intervention plan, that thing, the student code of conduct and or collective bargaining contract, nor will it preclude the district from addressing the allegations pursuant to the grievance process set out in section two of this procedure. The Title IX coordinator shall have the discretion to make any such referrals and proceed as appropriate in regard to the allegations.

56
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:37,042
So just because a dismissal within this final line has happened, that doesn't mean it's the end, necessarily. This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other. Thank you. Next, step five is the initial inventory deletion. This is the...

57
00:23:37,312 --> 00:24:06,185
The details on what the district will do standard approved. The burden is on the district. Election of evidence, let's see. Presentation of witnesses. We will have no, there'll be no gag orders.

58
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:37,049
Each party will have one advisor. Notice, we can see privacy, medical treatment, so the district cannot access medical information in any situation here.

59
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:56,911
Unless, of course, they can unless they consent to it. The investigator timelines, so speed matters. It always matters to everybody involved in these things. I think that's 1 of the changes that did happen that.

60
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:13,972
There used to be a 10 day waiting period. Imagine if you're involved in this as the victim or accused or whatever the proper terms here are. And once all the investigations are done, everybody has to sit on their hands for 10 business days.

61
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:40,617
everybody's going to school, everybody's, you know, it didn't make a lot of sense. So I think that was one big change that they made is that that 10 day mandatory waiting period is gone. Let's see. And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.

62
00:25:41,326 --> 00:26:10,756
No, I don't. No, we don't. I mean, I think that for minor things, I think everybody would think reasonable is, you know, same day, a day or two, but for major, major things, I can certainly see it taking many days or longer once there's lawyers and, you know, all kinds of other things involved. But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint. Right. Yeah.

63
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:38,785
Then there's, this is the opportunity for parties to access and respond to the evidence. The evidence, there's limitation in here. So we have to redact confidential information not directly related to the allegations. FERPA is very much still in effect here. This is an override FERPA.

64
00:26:40,253 --> 00:27:08,992
And for anybody in the public that wants to know, that's the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is, you'll hear school committee members use it when we respond to you about why we can't actually do things you ask us to do sometimes. And everybody is prohibited from disseminating any of the evidence for any purpose not directly related to the grievance procedures. So don't take it and go to Facebook or anything.

65
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:18,053
It is evidence that you have the right to see, but you do not have the right to disseminate. Memorandum wants to say something.

66
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:46,387
I do, so this is the section where, yeah, thank you. This is the section where I had a lot of questions and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well. If there are more than two parties, right? If we're talking about a group, like a team of people or multiple staff, I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people

67
00:27:47,618 --> 00:28:17,217
as a group talking amongst themselves. If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being, or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these, where it's multiple things happening simultaneously versus an investigation into a group situation. And that's not really addressed and I don't know

68
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:40,623
if there's guidance there. Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.

69
00:28:42,462 --> 00:29:11,673
Franklin, can you give us an example? Like I'm not tracking like a group. If a group does something, it's because individuals in the group did something, right? Yeah, so I have examples that aren't Title IX specific, is that? Sure. Okay. So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.

70
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:32,530
And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different. And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen. One student is suspended, another one isn't.

71
00:29:33,391 --> 00:30:02,500
parents are comparing notes and they're saying, this is what the administration told me. Oh, well, this is what they told me and I can't release information about this other student, but the parent has given me this information and I want to bring that as part of my complaint because our kids were together. Is that helpful? I think it's a little helpful. I don't know, Ms. Bowen, if you have any thoughts on that.

72
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:32,774
I mean, I think in the end, like the district can't, like they can't broadly meet out consequences. Like they have to do that specifically and individually, right? So I could see why AA parents would do that or want to know like what else is happening. There's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like there's a video of something that happens and

73
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:43,405
One complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.

74
00:30:44,198 --> 00:31:07,486
So, I mean, I think it's not, so the consequence wouldn't necessarily be one size fits all. I think when we start doing these investigations, we find out more information and then apply what the discipline would be or what sort of restorative circles or supportive measures would be. But I think it's,

75
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:31,465
like finding out what each student's specific role was, you know, like in regards to vaping, maybe the student that brought all the vapes in might have a heavier consequence than a student that just took one. So I think it's really doing a deep dive into all the information and then looking at what is going to be the best line of

76
00:31:31,465 --> 00:32:00,777
you know, how do we handle this with each student? And we can have conversations with parents like your child's role was a little bit different. And this is this is why the consequence was a little more severe or was not as severe, if that makes sense. So remember, I felt as it relates to a Title nine investigation. Right, if some if.

77
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:27,963
there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students. Or the schools say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.

78
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:48,820
And we as a group want to file a complaint. Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints? I think it could be a group complaint and then it may it may.

79
00:32:49,630 --> 00:33:15,128
you know, separate into more individual investigations. But if there are, say, four women who don't feel like the accommodations are appropriate and they file together, then we would look at it and as a as a group, look at a solution for them. So that would be a little bit different, I think, than, say, a bullying or sexual harassment

80
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:28,898
like a group response to that. I think it's looking at each individual's actions and part of, say, a sexual harassment complaint, and then going from there.

81
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:55,865
They vary so widely when things happen, so it's really hard to give a if-then sort of answer because it's really, really, you never know. Once this complaint comes in and you start to do the investigation, it takes a life on its own and it does involve more people. So it's like really doing that due diligence and looking into it and then going from there.

82
00:33:56,658 --> 00:34:24,080
What are the ramifications for the students? Do we discipline them? Do we not? Do we say like, we work with the parents about maybe they need some social skills groups or counseling in school or whatever it may be. So I think it's really hard to say we're gonna do this if this happens, because when we're in the midst of the investigation, we're seeing a lot more things come to light, either for the positive or for the negative.

83
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:43,672
And I just want to jump in here also that this is the scenario given there has to be a victim. So a bunch of students getting in trouble for vaping is not title nine. Even if we decided we were going to say just the girls are going to get in trouble and not the boys, because.

84
00:34:45,241 --> 00:35:03,263
The victim who's the victim, the district enforcing a policy. We're taking action is we, I suppose we could be the perpetrator. As a district, but I don't think this policy considers that the district is actually a perpetrator.

85
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:31,394
In violation, I mean, obviously plenty of title nine things are about the district refusing to, you know, deal with sports and all the other types of things, but there are victims there. Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind and I'm trying. Yeah. To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and. So, yeah, so let me find a page we're on since I've already. Yeah, we were on.

86
00:35:32,744 --> 00:36:01,668
Page nine. Step seven, if you keep going down further. Oh, thank you. Glad somebody is paying attention to that. OK, so. Yeah, all right, so let's see. Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure. So if there is a interconnected. Investigation that remains within

87
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:15,843
single grievance or. OK, thank you. You're welcome. So next up is step seven, completion of the investigative report.

88
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:33,933
Then eight is the party's opportunity to respond to the report. Step nine is directed written questions from the parties. So after the investigative report has been sent to the parties, but prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility.

89
00:36:34,034 --> 00:37:03,667
The decision-maker shall award both the complainant and the respondent the opportunity to submit to the decision-maker relevant questions of the other party or any witness, provide the party with the other party's and our witness's written responses to said questions, and allow for additional limited follow-up questions from each party in writing. Questions that seek disclosure information protected under legally recognized privileges, such as FERPA,

90
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:22,955
will shall not be permitted unless the person holding the privilege waives their right. So this is seems pretty standard, not as awful as an actual deposition, but so.

91
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:49,887
So there is this 10 days to submit directed relevant questions. So again, this is still 10 days. There was that other 10 days on top of that 10 days. It would be hard to feel like things are being taken seriously if we just keep adding two-week increments. So let's see.

92
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:20,482
So 10 days to craft your questions, five days to get before your answers are due, another three days, and then another three days. It's really, it's no wonder things take forever, but they have to. I mean, everybody has to do the work and have their rights protected.

93
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:46,452
Let's see, and then step 10 is determination of responsibility, findings of act by the decision maker, who's on this call. Joan is, oh to Joan, we just lose Joan? I think we, oh no, there you are, sorry. She's here, she's here. You moved to the top for some reason on my screen. Standard of proof, decision makers findings,

94
00:38:49,625 --> 00:39:18,751
The determination will be written, of course, and sent simultaneously to both parties. There's some more very long time frames here. Section C, remedies. So this is what can be done. So there's the remedies, the elimination of the harassing environment.

95
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:50,273
Next is section D, page will be on 15. Persons doing discipline. So this is about discipline, as you would imagine. However, there is a reference to the two Massachusetts general laws related to special, to behaviors that are attributable to disabilities.

96
00:39:51,843 --> 00:40:11,198
But I won't go into those, because those stand alone. So then there's the imposition of sanctions, compliance with the imposition of the sanctions.

97
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:42,383
Okay. So this is sort of important. So, um, you know, if there was a determination that it had not happened or that it was not, sorry, not that it not happened, that it was not, um, considered, um, am I misreading this? So what does the sentence make this one mean? Do you know?

98
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:58,027
I would say it means that if they make a false statement. Hold on, let me read this again. Yeah.

99
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:27,524
If I may, it seems like it's reading as if the timeline coordinator will not discipline a party witness or other participating entity if they make a false statement about sex discrimination, or if they felt as though it was, but it was not actually based off of the determining criteria after a review process had occurred. So there'll be no repercussions towards the original respondent. I think is how it reads.

100
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:47,133
Okay. Does that sound right to you, Jo? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Lawyers do know how to make it hard. And this might have been the previous section, but so there's this timeline.

101
00:41:47,504 --> 00:42:11,838
talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made. It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe. So those would be the supportive measures that you offer? Okay, in advance. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you.

102
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:38,332
And Ms. Bowen, correct me if I'm wrong, but supportive measures could be quite substantial. Like if we felt the student couldn't be in the building, we would be offering them another option for how to get an education outside of the building. It's not that they just get to come to school and we're like, be nice. That's not what we mean. It could be something as significant as that, correct?

103
00:42:38,669 --> 00:43:04,066
Correct, and if it was a staff member who made a complaint that they were being sexually harassed, walking them to the car at night, offering them counseling, that sort of thing. So it's a wide range, but yes, it could be a big supportive measure that we offer depending on the situation. Does that supportive measure potentially include

104
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:35,065
removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator? I would have to go back and see. I don't think you can remove until you do the investigation, but you can separate sort of, you know, really close supervision, put in a safety plan. But I would have to go back and I haven't experienced that yet. I hope I don't. But I think you have to

105
00:43:35,065 --> 00:44:02,369
make sure that you do the investigation first before you can remove. One of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant. And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.

106
00:44:02,977 --> 00:44:27,968
Correct. And I think it's really important that when we have a conversation about the supportive measures, we also can have like counseling staff there with us. The parents can be involved in what sort of protections do we need to put into place? If there's any legal protections that may have to happen as well, like involving the school resource officer and that sort of thing as well.

107
00:44:33,385 --> 00:45:02,427
but like administrative leave can't happen during it. And when does administrative leave? If that's the. It could possibly, it could possibly. And that's where we really, um, engage with our, with our attorney to say like, this is what has been reported to us. We're in the process of an investigation. Does somebody go out on paid leave until the full investigation is happening? Um, and that's where we would seek how a green spans, um,

108
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:21,462
advice on that. Privacy challenges on both sides are significant. All right. Thank you. All right. Next up we have, did I finish this section? I believe so. Informal process. So

109
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:43,248
There's an option to have an informal process. So there is an option to have an informal process.

110
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:05,877
All right, next is section F, emergency removal under Title IX. The district may remove a respondent on an emergency basis at any time that the district one undertakes an individualized safety and

111
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:35,813
And risk analysis to determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual discrimination justifies removal and that there is no alternative to the respondents emergency removal to mitigate the threat presented. And three, provides the respondent with notice and the opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following removal. So that's there. Hopefully we never have to use that.

112
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:58,274
Anonymous reporting. So this is that we may take anonymous reports. Let's see. We can do supportive measures.

113
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:21,376
cannot provide, oh, I'm sorry. Obviously, we can't do supportive measures if we don't know who is supporting. Let's see, that seems...

114
00:47:23,738 --> 00:47:50,772
I mean, if we don't know who the reporter is, that's different than confidentially reporting, but there's really not much, there's pretty significant limitations on what could actually be done. Anybody wanna talk about that one at all? I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint. And I think that's where,

115
00:47:51,177 --> 00:48:17,080
That's certainly where we've seen in higher education, these things come out is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint or whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just people need to,

116
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:46,156
people need to be good people, but. All right, so next up is appeals. So there's an entire appeals process, of course, says who to send the appeal to five days after the determination. The decision maker may not take, sorry, the decision maker for the appeal cannot take part in the event.

117
00:48:47,472 --> 00:49:14,033
could not have taken part in the investigation. So we do have the original policy as I received it had, frankly, a lot more decision makers that we have decided to go with. We have some freedom and leeway to do that. And I can see both sides of that, but I'll explain that when I get to that section later.

118
00:49:15,451 --> 00:49:35,127
OK, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if. This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeal officer is involved in this? There needs to be an alternative. The phone, can you answer that?

119
00:49:35,465 --> 00:50:01,992
So that could be, so the roles can be interchangeable, like one person could fill all these roles, but if say like John Bruno, who is the appeal officer is involved in the case, then I might be the appeals officer, or we might look at other people like the informal resolution facilitators, if they were not involved, that they could make the decision at that point about the appeal.

120
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:27,946
And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths. It was only because that particular role had one person.

121
00:50:34,628 --> 00:51:02,759
So, is your suggestion that there be more than 1 person listed as an appeals facilitator? Appeals for what they, what the. Well, I think what I'm hearing is Bowen saying is that frankly, all these people are interchangeable. So, I mean, if if John Bruno was involved, then obviously. He's not going to be the investigator or the, I mean, you know, if.

122
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:25,692
that these are all roles that can just be swapped around to ensure that there's not a conflict. I mean, we'd have to list every person under every section. And then the point is sort of that people know who to call. I think if you were concerned about John Bruno as like you're writing a complaint against him,

123
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:40,643
then obviously you're not going to want him to be the appeals officer. He also wouldn't be a very good investigator. And so these are just sort of like defaults is how I take them.

124
00:51:42,263 --> 00:52:07,964
That is how I take them as well. I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that. And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much. Me too. At my childhood school, just not picking on him. Yeah. Where was I on this? Age 15?

125
00:52:13,972 --> 00:52:39,031
So let's see. Sorry. Okay. So we had finished that section there. Record keeping. So obviously, just keep records related to this procedure maintained for a period of seven years. I said days. I was confused. Years.

126
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:55,096
It's pretty much standard stuff. Employment agencies, this is boilerplate stuff, where to go.

127
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:18,940
is identification of key personnel. So that's this section down here. And, you know, in some, the boilerplate code that I originally had had an investigator at each school. I can sort of see the value in that. On the other hand, if somebody's

128
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:36,305
particularly well-trained in that, then maybe they're a better choice. But the other part of that that I was a little bit like, so McGlynn is kind of far away from the Missittook.

129
00:53:36,305 --> 00:54:05,498
That means that Mr. O'Brien is going to be doing Title IX investigations over at the Minnesota. But on the other side, I also was kind of like, it seems better to have somebody not at your school doing the investigation. So, you know, if we were to do it where we had really, it would have to be an entire table of like, if you're here, this is who you contact. And I think it gets really messy. So.

130
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:19,302
I think, you know, Joan's at the top, so Joan's gonna get the calls. So, and this does not preclude an investigator at another school doing it.

131
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:37,105
Right correct. Yep. I mean, we had 2 people. 2 administrators that did any sexual harassment complaints. So, this has expanded it to a few more roles throughout the district.

132
00:54:37,713 --> 00:55:04,240
But yeah, if it's at the McGlynn Elementary School, then we might have Jen Skane or Sheila do it. And it's interchangeable. So we, you know, depending on the specific situation, we would look at who would be the best person to do the investigation. It might be myself. It might be, you know, human resources might get involved as well. So I do like how we have more people involved.

133
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:31,612
Right. So this, this prominently displayed on the district website. I don't know if there's anybody who has an idea what the word prominently displayed means in a in legalese but I.

134
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:51,338
I will ask, I'll send an email afterwards to ask that, that if it's not already there that, you know, Jonah's listed as the title and coordinator maybe in the about or section or somewhere very prominently.

135
00:55:52,267 --> 00:56:14,862
I don't think on the actual main page, just like right there makes a lot of sense, because that gets very much. We want to have the non-discrimination statement. We want to have the district educational statement. It just gets very long. But that's just my opinion.

136
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:40,478
So we're at an hour and we have sort of been through it. It's a lot to digest. And we will have another chance at a regular meeting when we do the second reading, which we will not read also, hopefully. Are there any other

137
00:56:43,043 --> 00:57:04,087
questions or changes suggested? I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent, because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything. So I'm

138
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:34,917
I think another difficulty is, is trying to. If there are components of things that we want to change without changing, like, state or federal guidelines and the terminology that they're using. So, I don't want to do anything that's going outside of what their expectations or recommendations are. So we're not kind of following their requirements. So that's another difficulty. I think. Yeah, I mean.

139
00:57:35,727 --> 00:58:03,655
You know, whenever I tell people what it's like to be on the school committee, I do talk about that the federal, the state, and of course, the local, everybody's got their hands in the pie, and nobody talks to each other or cares, frankly, what the other one thinks. So we do end up with definitions that can not only be not consistent, but can even be contradictory, and we're just left to sit in that stew.

140
00:58:03,655 --> 00:58:32,157
And yeah, it's tough, especially when you're writing, you know, we write one policy like the bullying one, which comes from the state house. And we are very specific definitions of, you know, aggressor is the word they use. And then here there's there's the respondent, which is like the most mild mannered version of that probably anybody could ever come up with. So.

141
00:58:32,377 --> 00:58:58,735
I think we just have to live with the fact that in some policies we are calling those folks the respondent and other ones that are the aggressor. And I think the state one actually has two different words. Perpetrators have been proven. They can't put that in. Right. Right. And then, you know, victim isn't even listed in this one as the act in their definition section. So they do say that alleged victimism. Yeah.

142
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:29,735
And so that person, but that's not. Yeah, it's hard. And hopefully nobody has to go through any of this, especially if they have to go through it in multiple offices, because that would be terrible. There are a motion to approve the first reading.

143
00:59:33,262 --> 01:00:02,118
Yeah, I'll make a motion. Motion to approve the first reading by member of the party. I'll second seconded by member Brantley. Roll call. Member Brantley. Yes. Yes.

144
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:31,480
So does this automatically go to a regular meeting, or do we waive? So 5 in the affirmative, 2 absent, motion passes. And I think the question that you have is, does this go, are we waiving a second reading, or is this going to another meeting? Is that your question? That is my question.

145
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:52,861
So, I know we accidentally did we have 2nd readings 2 meetings ago and then several of us, we already did the 2nd reading. Why is it on the agenda? The 2nd reading has to actually be on the agenda because that's the opportunity for the public to. It's like the 2nd chance it's not for us. It's for the public to be like.

146
01:00:53,620 --> 01:01:21,717
Oh, yeah, you saw if you're watching the meeting and you see something discussed and you want to discuss it, you may not be prepared. So the second reading, I think, should happen at the next meeting. And I will be submitting a clarifying rule update to make that clear, because it's not clear. So the second reading will be on our next school committee agenda, which is a week from today.

147
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:51,097
Are there any other motions on the floor? Motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeld. I'm on a second roll. Let's do it. Member Brantley, roll call. Member Brantley. Yes. Member Graham. Yes. Member Tapas-Epstein. Member Olopade. Yes. Member Reinfeld. Yes.

148
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:58,792
Members say yes, Mayor Lengel-Kern is also absent. I've been the affirmative to absent. The meeting is adjourned.
