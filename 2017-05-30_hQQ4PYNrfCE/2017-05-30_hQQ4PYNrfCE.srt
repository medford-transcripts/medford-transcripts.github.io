11
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,461
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have a moment of silence, please.

12
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,290

14
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:34,040
[SPEAKER_04]: As we're all aware, Timothy Brennan passed away some years ago with some complications to a health issue, but he was the consummate professional public servant

15
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:38,656

00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Tim was a good friend of mine.

28
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:27,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, as Council Knight mentioned, uh, the Brennan family is synonymous with, uh, public safety in this community and, uh, have been, uh, providing, uh, the residents of this community with, uh, great public safety for many decades in this community.

29
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:34,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, with the loss of, uh, Tim at such a young age and someone that had a very promising future,

30
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, it was real devastating.

31
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:43,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I just want to thank Councilor Knight, uh, for putting this on tonight and remembrance of not only a great firefighter, but a good friend.

32
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president on the motion by Councilor Knight seconded by Councilor Marks.

00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Lungo-Koehn be resolved.

37
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The director that the director of public works,

38
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:10,173
[SPEAKER_02]: update the Medford City Council with regards to the stop sign that is down with a cone on top of Brookside Parkway.

39
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:11,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

40
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

41
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:18,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I did receive an email complaining about this.

42
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:24,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the stop sign was left in the middle of the street and a resident of Medford had to move it over to the side.

43
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:27,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I did contact the Department of Public Works.

44
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: They said they would take care of it and

45
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:34,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to just get an update on that, because after they said they'd take care of it, I think there was just a cone on top of it.

46
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:50,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been noticing a lot of cones and big barrels in different places around the city, and I'm not sure if that means, I'm assuming that means we're getting to it, but obviously that stop sign needs to go up where it needs to go, or it needs to be taken off the side of the road.

47
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:56,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Public safety issues, obviously, when you have things either in the middle of the street or the side of the road.

48
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we just could get an update with regards to

49
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,391
[SPEAKER_09]: when this is going to be reinstalled or removed, that would be appreciated.

50
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:05,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kearns.

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Alango-Kern.

144
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let the petitioner speak.

145
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:20,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

146
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

147
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

148
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:30,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the Chair, thank you, Councilor Alango-Kern, for taking this out of order under suspension of the rules.

149
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:35,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to seem, you know, selfish about Evans Street,

150
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:52,502
[SPEAKER_11]: coming up here again because I know there's a lot of streets and sub water and gas systems across Medford that need to be looked at, but I'm a little disheartened before this body tonight to come and speak on this matter yet again.

151
00:17:54,143 --> 00:18:03,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the administration's office, through the DPW, a letter came out saying that contracts would go out in May,

152
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:15,877
[SPEAKER_11]: for the work that needs to be done on Evan Street that members of this body have said in the past is in the top five of worst condition streets in the City of Medford.

153
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:28,747
[SPEAKER_11]: When that letter came out, it prompted some City Councilors, when they saw it, in good faith, to tell neighbours of mine and myself that work is going to be done this spring

154
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:30,499
[SPEAKER_11]: specifically this May.

155
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:50,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So a week and a half ago, one of my neighbors, Mr. Rob McGuire, knowing how often I come to the council meetings and discussions I have with the honorable members of this body, asked me point blank on Facebook, hey, well, my nickname's Booch, hey Booch, when are they gonna do the repairs on Evans Street?

156
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, I'm not sure, I only know what we were told, what you were told.

157
00:18:56,313 --> 00:19:11,138
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another neighbour of mine in the discussion on Facebook posted the picture of the letter that came out, and it was said that last week somebody was going to bring it up for discussion on this body, and for whatever reason, probably a good reason, it didn't come up for discussion.

158
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was going to speak last week on it.

159
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:23,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So the next day, last Wednesday, after work, I came right to City Hall, and I went into the engineer's office, Cassandra, and I asked point blank.

160
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Neighbours are asking me.

161
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:25,123
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told.

162
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:28,176
[SPEAKER_11]: that work was going to be done this spring, this May.

163
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:33,817
[SPEAKER_11]: She told me, and this is no offence, but these are the slow wheels of government.

164
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:43,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford has been waiting over six decades, not Medford, but Evans Street, for repairs that really need to be done.

165
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a water pipe that burst just before Christmas, this past Christmas, on Evans Street.

166
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:59,123
[SPEAKER_11]: But what the engineer told me, who also I know is constrained by a lot of projects that are going on, but what she said was, I'm finalizing the contract now.

167
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it goes to the purchaser's office.

168
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Once it gets approved there, then it goes out for bids.

169
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:08,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Then once the bids come in, the mayor has to choose the best one.

170
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:12,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, well, my neighbors are asking me, when is this work going to be done?

171
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:14,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly July.

172
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:20,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Mr. President, but with all due respect, I really don't see it happening this year.

173
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:32,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you have to account for there's 26 houses, four on the corner, that's 30 houses, paying at least $1,200 in property taxes, paying God knows what in water taxes.

174
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Even the people that rent there, their rent's going up because of property taxes, the surcharges on property taxes.

175
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,511
[SPEAKER_11]: We're paying a lot.

176
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a ballpark figure.

177
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,720
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking over six decades.

178
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,641
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking millions of dollars in taxes from this one street.

179
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:59,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I'm here tonight to tell you that I spoke to my fellow residents and, uh, I'm not even here to ask for the work to be done anymore.

180
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:10,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, uh, a year and a half ago, this administration ran on a promised on her platform that she was going to dust off the master plan.

181
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,354
[SPEAKER_11]: A year and a half later, Mr. President, there's another inch of dust on the master plan.

182
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:18,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The citizens on Evans street are disappointed.

183
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

184
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

185
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:23,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor.

186
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:25,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

187
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I just want to speak in support of this.

188
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:35,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a number of us Councilors have brought up Evans street and I believe it was last spring and even before that, that we started complaining about it.

189
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And last spring when a number of residents,

190
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:42,743
[SPEAKER_09]: came before us begging, I mean, basically begging for some relief on the street.

191
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:54,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Children, who I see in the audience today, can't even ride their bikes without, I mean, when I drove down it after I got the complaints, it's like torn up with rocks and it's unsafe.

192
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:56,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were told it was gonna be done by now.

193
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:02,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I did reach out to the city engineer on the 8th of May just to ask for an update.

194
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:06,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told that Evans is in queue for later this year.

195
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,444
[SPEAKER_09]: as we need to replace the water main first.

196
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:12,165
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the information I got on the 8th.

197
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:21,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping sooner than later this year, what seems is you're getting information that it's going to be done sooner than the end of the year, which would be great if it could be done by July.

198
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:31,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But how many times, you know, can we be told, just keep being pushed off and pushed off when it's, top five, I think it's one of the worst streets.

199
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:37,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it might be top one or two in Medford from me just driving around and witnessing what's going on.

200
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:44,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think we need some definite answers, and that needs to come from the mayor's office, who's going to be footing the bill.

201
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:48,757
[SPEAKER_09]: The engineer is probably doing what she needs to do, and she's being responsive.

202
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, July is better, kind of, than the answer I got.

203
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,139
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is, you know, really, when is it going to be done?

204
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:58,580
[SPEAKER_09]: When is the bid going to be accepted, and are we going to pay for it?

205
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something we all need to demand come a few weeks from now when we are asked for a vote on the budget.

206
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:10,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we all need to think about a number of different things, including Evans Street, before we can vote on a budget.

207
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:17,633
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the potholes and painted striping of our streets and the sunken manholes that aren't taken care of needs to be priority number one.

208
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:18,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a safety concern.

209
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:20,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

210
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:31,217
[SPEAKER_11]: If you drive around the corner on Pinkett Street, the potholes there, you have to navigate around them to not put damage on your car.

211
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,918
[SPEAKER_11]: The potholes on Evans Street,

212
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:38,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there were baseball size rocks coming out of the, out of the gravel, out of the street.

213
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:42,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been by there next Tuesday night at six o'clock.

214
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:47,835
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be having a council, the whole meeting with the city engineer on a lot of these issues.

215
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I urge you to come to that meeting at six o'clock.

216
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,801
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of disappointed people on Evans street and this is my name.

217
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

218
00:23:58,023 --> 00:23:58,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

219
00:23:58,884 --> 00:23:59,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

220
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:04,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I was here last year.

221
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:28,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was around this same time and I was told the exact same thing about the budget and approving the budget and not approving a certain amount of money for her until she said that and we're here a year later and it's still exactly the same and I keep hearing

222
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:56,208
[SPEAKER_10]: later on this year, later on this year, next spring, next spring, and here we are, and it's summertime, and we're hearing later on this year, and then we're hearing July, and it's been, I've lived on that street for 41 years, and that street hasn't been repaved, and I, she said it, I have an eight-year-old daughter, she can't ride her bike, I have to put a bike rack on the back of my car and drive her to the bike path for her to ride her bike,

223
00:24:56,876 --> 00:25:00,380
[SPEAKER_10]: In that neighborhood, because the rocks are on the sidewalk, the rocks are on the street.

224
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinkett Street is probably worse than Evans.

225
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for saying that, because I live on Evans.

226
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:07,526
[SPEAKER_10]: But Pinkett Street is pretty bad, too.

227
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,008
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't ride your bike in that neighborhood.

228
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know what has to happen.

229
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,134
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you get the street fixed?

230
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:16,595
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you get the street fixed?

231
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:19,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody, I think.

232
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:34,792
[SPEAKER_10]: except for him, said that it's really bad, it's a really bad street, so everybody knows that it's really bad, aside from whoever's on C-Click Fix checking it off as repaired, because it's the furthest thing from repaired, but everybody knows that it's really bad.

233
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And I... And you were promised that it was gonna be fixed.

234
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,716
[SPEAKER_10]: For a long time.

235
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:41,058
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time.

236
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,380
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know what else.

237
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,490
[SPEAKER_10]: to do.

238
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anybody, I asked my neighbors, I asked my really sweet neighbors if they wanted to come and they don't want to come.

239
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:51,033
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to come.

240
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,333
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to deal with it anymore.

241
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:54,254
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they, they, they gave up.

242
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,895
[SPEAKER_10]: They, they gave up and that's sad.

243
00:25:57,795 --> 00:25:57,975
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

244
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:02,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.

245
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:03,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

246
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:04,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

247
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:05,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

248
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

249
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to thank Mr. Capucci and Ms.

250
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Smith for being here this evening.

251
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

252
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:13,653
[SPEAKER_04]: On St.

253
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:18,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day, 3-17-17, we received a response to paper 17209 from the administration.

254
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:25,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And this paper clearly said that the contract will be in place in mid-May, and construction will proceed with the schedule thereafter.

255
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:31,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we put this paper initially on the agenda in October.

256
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:40,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm at a loss to figure out how long it takes to get the contract in place, but this all should have been done well before the construction season started, Mr. President.

257
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:45,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And not a week goes by now that I don't scratch my head and wonder what's going on inside that engineering office.

258
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:51,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I really have significant concerns about the way that that office is being managed and what's going on in the community.

259
00:26:51,864 --> 00:27:04,346
[SPEAKER_04]: For us to have to wait 18 months for a response to a paper, for residents to have to wait six, seven, eight, nine months for a contract just to go out so that the work can be done that they said they've been scheduling for three years is ridiculous.

260
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not one to go out on these rants, Mr. President, about the administration not doing this and not doing that.

261
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:09,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my style.

262
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,152
[SPEAKER_04]: But enough's enough.

263
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:24,563
[SPEAKER_04]: This office has got to keep its eyes on the prize, because the engineering office is far too vital to the delivery of the requisite services that we're here to provide, to be asleep at the switch.

264
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

265
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

266
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:32,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

267
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:40,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to go on the record, too, that Parris Street was also listed as a street that was supposed to be addressed this year.

268
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:45,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't get into a debate about what street is worse.

269
00:27:45,745 --> 00:27:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on our side of Medford, we have a lot of very, what I call, depressed streets that haven't really been attended to, the street nor the sidewalks.

270
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,897
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hole that has been in front of my house for 46 years.

271
00:28:02,357 --> 00:28:03,378
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been able to, I mean,

272
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,865
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of laughable, but it isn't.

273
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,487
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps getting larger and larger and larger.

274
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:13,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Our elderly community on our street cannot walk down the sidewalks.

275
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's abhorrent.

276
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:24,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And often when we attend these dialogues and discussions about development, we hear these developers tell us that our neighbourhoods are depressed and blighted.

277
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,909
[SPEAKER_01]: It really boils down to our streets not being able to be taken care of.

278
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we've got a committee of the whole meeting.

279
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:40,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd ask that you consider Paris Street and maybe a few more of those surrounding streets in our neighborhood.

280
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:44,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a while since they've been attended to.

281
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:53,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would go a long way for a number of elderly people we have, as well as mobily challenged folks in our neighborhood.

282
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:07,687
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our area of Medford, I think the last time I checked, we have like 45% of the people who live in North and East Medford that are senior and disabled and lower income.

283
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:12,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder for them to get around because not all of them do have cars and they like to walk.

284
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I know you've got a meeting coming up Tuesday.

285
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to attend as well.

286
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to that dialogue.

287
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:23,076
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could consider our area as well, that would be great.

288
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:23,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

289
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

290
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

291
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's a shame when you have to have residents come up over and over again on the same issue.

292
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:43,304
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's even more of a shame, Mr. President, when department heads tell residents that something's going to be done and then there's no follow-up.

293
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:48,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, sometimes the schedule doesn't work according to how it was planned.

294
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:59,501
[SPEAKER_14]: And all you need to do is reach back out to residents and say, you know what, I might have told you it was May, but now because of the RFP or whatever went through, it took us a little longer, now we're looking at July or August.

295
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:04,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think residents would feel happy that the communication was there, Mr. President.

296
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:08,803
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what happens is the fact that there is a lack of communication,

297
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:23,589
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact, Mr. President, that this council has been asking for a master plan from this mayor for the past year and a half, a master plan, Mr. President, not because we want a master plan for the sake of a master plan.

298
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,710
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to address issues like this.

299
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Within a master plan, you would have someone that would go out and do a street audit and say, what are the top

300
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:37,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Dozen streets, two dozen streets, three dozen streets that need to be repaired.

301
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,302
[SPEAKER_14]: When is the last time they were repaired or resurfaced?

302
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:41,304
[SPEAKER_14]: You heard from Ms.

303
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:46,050
[SPEAKER_14]: White that mentioned she's been on the street for 41 years, four decades.

304
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,553
[SPEAKER_14]: That street has never been repaved.

305
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,757
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm referring to Evans Street, Mr. President.

306
00:30:52,509 --> 00:31:03,664
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really think, Mr. President, the fact that we don't have any type of master plan, the fact is that we don't have a full assessment of our streets, we're always chasing our tail.

307
00:31:04,685 --> 00:31:05,907
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even keep track.

308
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:07,589
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about repaving roads.

309
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,431
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even fill potholes.

310
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:12,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Forget about repaving roads.

311
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,945
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even do the basic fundamentals of filling potholes.

312
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Our staff is so undersized in the DPW that we can't even stay on top of a basic, basic city service.

313
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:39,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And then people are coming up asking about their roads, and they're very right, Mr. President, as Mr. Capucci mentioned, paying tens of thousands of dollars in property tax, and you have to look out and see your street look like Beirut, Mr. President.

314
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:46,534
[SPEAKER_14]: You get small potholes that could be swimming pools.

315
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:52,699
[SPEAKER_14]: It's unacceptable, rocks that could get kicked up when a car drives over them.

316
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,681
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a public safety concern.

317
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,484
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not, if it was one or two streets, I'd say, you know what, we're in pretty good condition.

318
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:02,747
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seven square miles, we're a big city, we're in good condition.

319
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,448
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not one or two streets.

320
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,271
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost every street in the city, Mr. President.

321
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,073
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have no game plan.

322
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:18,616
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I attend events, Mr. President, and you see the mayor walking around with all her assistants.

323
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:26,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Rather than have a pen and paper in their hand, taking down notes when people say, I need my street done, they have a camera.

324
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:29,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Because all they want to do is capture the mayor with a picture.

325
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:32,604
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not looking for anything else, Mr. President.

326
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,625
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't want to hear your gripes or your concerns.

327
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:37,907
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to capture the mayor at events by taking her picture.

328
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:39,768
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we have now.

329
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,530
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a photo op mayor that walks around and only looking for a picture.

330
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,654
[SPEAKER_14]: when the real nitty gritty needs to take place.

331
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:53,659
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't provide basic city services in this city, we might as well lock the door at City Hall.

332
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,742
[SPEAKER_14]: We might as well lock it, Mr. President.

333
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:03,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm equally as disappointed with this administration, and you know what?

334
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:06,390
[SPEAKER_14]: When a department's not doing their job, I'll call them out, and I've been doing it for years.

335
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,293
[SPEAKER_14]: But as I stated before, a fish rots from the head down.

336
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:24,975
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to look at who's not doing their job, Mr. President, and who ultimately is responsible, the chief executive officer of this community that runs the day-to-day operations, it's the mayor of this community, Mr. President.

337
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:32,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to point fingers at departments that are a shell of departments that barely have enough staff to do a day's worth of work.

338
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes from the top, Mr. President.

339
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,902
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, and I'd ask our council liaison

340
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:44,085
[SPEAKER_14]: that the mayor appointed, but she happens not to be here tonight.

341
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, she hasn't attended since she was appointed a year and a half now.

342
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:58,235
[SPEAKER_14]: The council liaison, someone that would be here to sit in the audience, go back to the mayor and say, Madam Mayor, this was brought up tonight.

343
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:00,096
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the concerns at the council.

344
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,258
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the concerns I heard from residents.

345
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:10,201
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why that position was made, Mr. President, to address issues like this and bring them to the mayor's attention.

346
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:15,583
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize the mayor can't be everywhere, and that's why she has assistance, Mr. President, to help.

347
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:20,124
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what's rotten within this community, Mr. President.

348
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:26,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm tired of talking about we can't go on to new issues when we talk about the same old issues over and over again.

349
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,901
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel the residents' frustration.

350
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:39,946
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I agree with Parrish Street and all the host of other streets, Mr. President, because I receive the phone calls and the emails, as we all do, when people say, what about my road?

351
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:41,046
[SPEAKER_14]: What about my street?

352
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:43,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And what do you tell them?

353
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:45,989
[SPEAKER_14]: You tell them to call the mayor's office, and they laugh.

354
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Say, I don't even get a call back.

355
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we have to be more, Mr. President, than just a sounding board, this council.

356
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:57,755
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to be able to hold the mayor's feet to the fire.

357
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:06,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And if people behind this reeling are going to give the mayor unconditional support all the time, that's why we're not getting anywhere.

358
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,400
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we're not holding the mayor's feet to the fire, Mr. President.

359
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:22,745
[SPEAKER_14]: We have plenty of enablers behind this reel that allow this mayor to go off and do what she wants to do and then want to talk a big game after the fact.

360
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hold the mayor's feet to the fire.

361
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:28,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hold her accountable to the job she was elected to do, Mr. President.

362
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

363
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

364
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:33,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

365
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:34,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

366
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:40,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I also like to thank, uh, uh, Mr. Capucci for bringing this issue forward tonight.

367
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:44,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have been down in that neighborhood and a number, a number of times over the past year.

368
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:48,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, the street is in deplorable condition and it's been like that for a long time.

369
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:55,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, promises were made that this was going to be fixed and it's extremely disappointing that it seems like it's,

370
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,755
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it really might not even be on the radar.

371
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:02,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it should be, but it seems like nothing's getting done.

372
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:05,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's long overdue.

373
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:06,980
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to get done.

374
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, too, question why is it delayed?

375
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:11,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it being delayed?

376
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:11,904
[SPEAKER_08]: What has happened?

377
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:14,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And when is the work going to be done?

378
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And what exactly is going to be done?

379
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:26,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could get an official correspondence back from the engineer's office, I'd like to see something officially from her basically telling us why it has been delayed.

380
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:30,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this will be something we'll discuss next Tuesday at the council meeting also.

381
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:35,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we will, but I want to see something in writing, something officially as to why it was delayed.

382
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:44,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to find out when it's, when they plan on actually getting this kicked off and going in a process it has to go through because everyone should be on the same page.

383
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:49,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it was mentioned earlier communication and a lot of this comes down to communication.

384
00:36:50,827 --> 00:37:02,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they actually sent the memo to us saying, you know what, this was promised last year, but it's going to be delayed, at least when the calls come in, we can say, you know what, we received a communication back from the engineer's office.

385
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:08,839
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be delayed because of reasons A, B, and C. But we haven't received anything back.

386
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And the neighbors haven't received any news.

387
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore, we're all kind of standing around looking at each other.

388
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of it comes down to communication.

389
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:22,951
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as this issue goes, there really hasn't been any, any communication.

390
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:29,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can get an official correspondence from the engineer's department with those details, I greatly appreciate it.

391
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, if you could make that note, please.

392
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:31,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

393
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:33,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

394
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Rec cycle 21 Ridgeway road method.

395
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:37,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I wasn't going to speak tonight.

396
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:41,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I just came down to, you know, witness the council meeting.

397
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:47,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, but, uh, I'm going to go back a few years, just a few.

398
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

399
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,187
[SPEAKER_13]: At one time we had a paper, it was called the Medford Mercury.

400
00:37:53,528 --> 00:38:03,774
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I remember correctly, every year the city would go out, like Councilor Marks would say, they'd go out and they'd gauge these streets.

401
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:07,056
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, they prioritize what streets are going to be done.

402
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:10,918
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, not this year, not this fiscal year.

403
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:18,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Fiscal year 2018, they knew five streets, five critical streets.

404
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:24,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Those streets were published in the newspaper, and they were prioritized.

405
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:38,558
[SPEAKER_13]: So the citizens on those streets, a year before the street was even going to be reconstructed, those citizens knew that they were going to be in for a new street, new sidewalks, whatever the construction is.

406
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:44,681
[SPEAKER_13]: That gave the administration plenty of time if they had to put a water line in, or they had to put a gas line in, or whatever they had to do.

407
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems today that the planning is like

408
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:51,835
[SPEAKER_13]: The cart is going before the horse.

409
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:54,336
[SPEAKER_13]: They plan the street.

410
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:55,396
[SPEAKER_13]: They get the street planned.

411
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,256
[SPEAKER_13]: They go out and do it.

412
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,657
[SPEAKER_13]: And then about six months later, oh, we've got to put a water line in.

413
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Very frustrating, poor planning.

414
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:13,919
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to bring up that this is the way the citizens of Medford knew where they stood with their streets, the condition of their streets.

415
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a very simple thing to do.

416
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm not sure.

417
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:22,294
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could ask the council now, do you know what the top five streets are in Medford that have to be paved?

418
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anybody know the top five?

419
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:27,736
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

420
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:28,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you're close.

421
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:28,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

422
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:30,617
[SPEAKER_13]: You got the city council.

423
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:32,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I live on Ridgeway road.

424
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:34,459
[SPEAKER_13]: My streets, my streets in great shape.

425
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

426
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:44,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you go up the top of fells F you know, fells F you know, fells F they tore that street up.

427
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:47,745
[SPEAKER_13]: It's washing away.

428
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:52,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Come down Fells Ave to Murray Hill, one hole on the left side, it's gone.

429
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:54,154
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all being washed away.

430
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,596
[SPEAKER_13]: The contractor did a horrible job.

431
00:39:56,636 --> 00:40:01,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Now where's the penalty there on these reconstructions on these streets?

432
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:01,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

433
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:02,759
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another issue.

434
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:07,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to get into that, but that's something that the council maybe should look at.

435
00:40:07,902 --> 00:40:15,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they should go back to the DPW, go back to the mayor's office and say, listen, when we do the budget, we want to know what streets are going to be done.

436
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:22,192
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to know not only what streets are going to be done, we want to know, number one, Evans is going to be number one.

437
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:24,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two is going to be Mystic Ave.

438
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, whatever, okay?

439
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:32,814
[SPEAKER_13]: That way you know, going into that budget meeting, five streets, $2 million, okay?

440
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:38,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gives everybody right up front what has to be done.

441
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:44,497
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no going back saying, well, we're going to have to put in gas, we have to put in a water line, or whatever we have to do on that street.

442
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:49,026
[SPEAKER_13]: That also eliminates a lot of going back in and tearing up our streets.

443
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:53,268
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called planning, master planning.

444
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:54,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

445
00:40:54,508 --> 00:40:58,090
[SPEAKER_13]: It might not include a building of a police station, but it's critical.

446
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,390
[SPEAKER_13]: It's our infrastructure.

447
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:02,671
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, simple things.

448
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:10,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just talking to the councilor tonight, go down Salem street, Fellsway to Medford, to Salem, all the way down.

449
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:13,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Not one crosswalk is striped.

450
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:15,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Not one, you can't even see them.

451
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:24,046
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our main street, highly visible, highly pedestrian areas, okay?

452
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:27,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Simple little things, all right?

453
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:29,568
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I just wanna throw that out.

454
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you were aware of it.

455
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:39,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of you councilors might've been aware of it, but there are things that you can do to make the citizens aware where they stand, okay?

456
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:43,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And it gives the citizens plenty of time

457
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:48,185
[SPEAKER_13]: to make any adjustments and contact the council, contact the mayor's office, the DPW.

458
00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:51,808
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be a street, a tree that has to be taken down or something.

459
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:53,629
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called planning.

460
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,651
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all I have to say.

461
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:56,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the time.

462
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:57,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

463
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address of the record, please.

464
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:10,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add one thought after hearing the gentleman before me speak so eloquently about planning.

465
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:13,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that

466
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:25,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Recognizing that budget is always a concern in this day and age and recognizing that some streets need to be put off.

467
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:35,735
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could even be successful in our pothole repair, so currently what they'll do if you're fortunate enough to have a pothole filled, they'll do that.

468
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fill it and they'll tamp it down.

469
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:40,898
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not actually the right way to repair a pothole.

470
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:45,761
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to actually cut so many inches, a surgeon would call it the clear margin.

471
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:50,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut so many inches and then you re-tamp and you fill with a square.

472
00:42:51,383 --> 00:43:02,486
[SPEAKER_01]: If we made those types of repairs, the roads would look less like patchwork and you'd feel potholes less because when they're patched, they'd be patched more appropriately.

473
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:08,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the secondary and possibly more important thing we could do, and occasionally I hear it,

474
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:21,972
[SPEAKER_01]: when different developers step before you, when they fall under your purview, but what we should do overall is we should never let anybody who's opening our street open up a one-foot trench.

475
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:31,575
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to open up a minimum width for a minimum duration so that they have the appropriate space to reset and tamp down

476
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:45,428
[SPEAKER_01]: put in the subsoil, put in the proper layers of the different products that are required depending upon where they're working at the right grade so that you don't wind up with the puddle and all of that stuff.

477
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:53,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can forward to all of you, some of you may be aware, but I'm happy to share with you some general links to help you get a little bit more up to speed.

478
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:54,296
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think

479
00:43:55,317 --> 00:44:01,346
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of where we go with our repair of streets, we can do no harm.

480
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:10,400
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we open up our streets and we're working in our streets, if we require folks that are doing this work, and they know how to make those repairs because in other cities

481
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,942
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't dare open up the street for a foot and a half for, you know, four or five feet.

482
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:23,786
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd open it up properly and they'd, you know, reset to existing or better condition the same way.

483
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:31,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also wouldn't use hot top patches on the sidewalk where there's concrete, where we've had some upgrades done.

484
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:32,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that.

485
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:37,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might have been NSTAR that did the gas upgrades.

486
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:45,661
[SPEAKER_01]: They would cut out the street, the sidewalk, dig that hole out, and they wouldn't properly set the patch and put concrete back in.

487
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:49,445
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd just tamp in hot top like someone was going to come later.

488
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:53,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some of those on Paris Street that go down the street.

489
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:56,031
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably 30 or 40 of them at least.

490
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:59,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even one for every single address where they tie into the different homes.

491
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,055
[SPEAKER_01]: But those few measures don't really reside back with us, our budget, taxpayer money.

492
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:09,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It resides to the projects that are being done.

493
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:26,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a city, if we require those things, then our streets are gonna look better because we're requiring that people working in them maintain and return them to us in a condition that we're not gonna have to be doing repair work in two or three years.

494
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to raise that.

495
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:30,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone's interested, I'm happy to share some of those links.

496
00:45:30,337 --> 00:45:30,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

497
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:30,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

498
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:32,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

499
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

500
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:35,839
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could just amend the paper and ask

501
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: point blank to the mayor's office, will this be in this money for Evans Street and possibly Paris and Pinker, two other streets that we were promised, will this be in our next year's budget?

502
00:45:49,098 --> 00:46:02,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's really just the ultimate answer that we need because I truly feel if the mayor's office wanted it done, they would have told the engineer's office to go out to bid months and months ago like we were promised.

503
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's really unfortunate we have to

504
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:15,688
[SPEAKER_09]: ask questions at this stage of the game, when in two weeks we're gonna be asked for a vote on a budget, and we haven't even seen any part of the budget whatsoever.

505
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a little late for that.

506
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:23,855
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at the last meeting in May, and we haven't even, like you said last week, they won't even answer you.

507
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have your budget book on Tuesday.

508
00:46:27,397 --> 00:46:30,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Next Tuesday, so we're gonna meet on the week after, the 12th, 13th.

509
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:30,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Tuesday coming up.

510
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:35,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so, and I mean, I agree with Council Member Marks,

511
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,171
[SPEAKER_09]: forget about a master plan.

512
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:39,692
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't even have the budget book.

513
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:42,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you see some frustration tonight.

514
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:46,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And you definitely see it from the Evans Street residents, Parris Street.

515
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:48,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're seeing it all over.

516
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:53,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a gentleman today threaten on Dune and threatened he's going to call the Globe.

517
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:55,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he called the news channels.

518
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:59,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Because simple potholes are just everywhere.

519
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:04,003
[SPEAKER_09]: On my way to work, to eat dinner at home, and then come here, I think I saw

520
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:15,020
[SPEAKER_09]: eight cones and one big barrel just plopped on, and my heights friends will know, plopped on manholes and sewer grates that are just sunken in so deep.

521
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget about it if a child veered off.

522
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:19,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, somebody's going to get really, really hurt.

523
00:47:19,563 --> 00:47:25,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, most of the grates and sewers that I'm seeing are on the side of the road, but it's terrible.

524
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:30,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And these cones have been there for so long, they're not even standing up straight to let people know.

525
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:31,711
[SPEAKER_09]: They're falling over.

526
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:39,806
[SPEAKER_09]: So I for one I did not vote for the budget last year And I think I gave like a 20 or 30 minute speech why and Evans Street?

527
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:56,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe was one of the reasons one of the many reasons, but that's what we need We need you need four votes for the budget And I think we need to send a loud and clear message to the mayor's office that the number one the simple Things need to be in this budget whether we have to use outside contracting or not.

528
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:01,793
[SPEAKER_09]: We need our sidewalks We need potholes filled we need

529
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:05,384
[SPEAKER_09]: some work on our manholes that are sunken in.

530
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:10,866
[SPEAKER_09]: We need our streets repainted with regards to crosswalks for simple safety.

531
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:17,268
[SPEAKER_09]: We had children, a child almost get hit up near the Brooks School, I believe months ago.

532
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:26,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, that's just repaint our crosswalks, nevermind fulfilling promises that were made last year with regards to Evans Street.

533
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:31,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we just really need to come together and figure out what the goals are of this city

534
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And the simple things need to be done.

535
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:41,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really, it's very frustrating driving around this community the last month or two and getting the phone calls and the emails.

536
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:44,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And people just stopping me while I'm walking in my neighborhood.

537
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,260
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on with this pothole or that pothole?

538
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, cars are bumping over them.

539
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:52,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something we need to get a handle on.

540
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we need some outside contracting to help us do that.

541
00:48:56,346 --> 00:49:00,409
[SPEAKER_09]: But that comes at budget time when we need to be able to hire somebody to do it.

542
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam Council.

543
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:08,822

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

552
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:47,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

553
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:49,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Montgomery?

554
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:49,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks?

556
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:51,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

557
00:49:51,775 --> 00:49:52,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

558
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:52,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

559
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:54,295
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

560
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:54,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

561
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:57,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

562
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

563
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:05,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Councilor Marks to revert back to regular business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

564
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

565
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:08,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes. 17489.

566
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:36,413
[SPEAKER_02]: offered by vice president marks be it resolved that the city ordinance be drafted that requires any store furnishing shopping carts to patrons to transport items purchased from this store be required to develop and implement the plan to prevent the removal of shopping carts from his property and create a specific plan to retrieve a shopping carts that are found on public property.

567
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:37,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice president box,

568
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

569
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:54,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I offer this resolution tonight to address an issue that exists in many areas in our community that are but business districts, in particular stores that have shopping carts that are allowed to leave the premise.

570
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,934
[SPEAKER_14]: And you only need to drive up

571
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Salem Street or Riverside Ave.

572
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:06,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll see these cots throughout neighborhoods, uh, just abandoned on a sidewalk in front of someone's home.

573
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:17,279
[SPEAKER_14]: And I offer this tonight, Mr. President, to allow the city to first of all, get a handle on, uh, what ordinance would make sense in our community.

574
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:26,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and also secondly, uh, for enforcement, uh, and to provide an arm of enforcement within our community when it comes to this.

575
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:31,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm offering this tonight, Mr. President, and hope it goes to one of the subcommittees.

576
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not opposed to it going to the public works subcommittee or any other subcommittee, Mr. President.

577
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:39,806
[SPEAKER_14]: It definitely is an issue that needs to be looked at.

578
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:55,850
[SPEAKER_14]: The responsibility of the owner, which would be the store, Mr. President, it shall be unlawful for any owner of any cart to permit any cart to be removed from the store premise and left unattended or abandoned on any city street or public place within the city.

579
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:04,372
[SPEAKER_14]: This would also require mandatory implementation and ongoing use of measures to prevent removal of shopping carts.

580
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:14,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And shopping cart owners shall implement and enforce, on an ongoing basis, measures to contain the shopping carts within the premise of its business establishment.

581
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:22,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a couple of businesses we worked with over the last several years, Sharp and Sharp to be one in the Wellington area.

582
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:31,778
[SPEAKER_14]: They put on a wheel locking mechanism that prevents the cart from exiting the barrier of their premise.

583
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:34,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is one mechanism.

584
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:42,043
[SPEAKER_14]: You install those locking mechanisms along with an electronic barrier, which stops the cots.

585
00:52:42,444 --> 00:52:52,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Another one is shopping cots equipped with a protruding arm or a similar device, prohibiting the cot from leaving the interior of the business.

586
00:52:52,813 --> 00:52:55,996
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems to be very effective.

587
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:59,978
[SPEAKER_14]: and a retrieval plan, Mr. President.

588
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:18,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Any ordinance that's worth its weight would require the store to submit a retrieval plan to the building commissioner, and they would have a system where they have prompt removal of carts that are located on city property.

589
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:28,030
[SPEAKER_14]: In order to do this, we would require any of the business establishments that have shopping carts to put identification on their carts.

590
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:37,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, you may see some faint identification on certain carts based on the store, but that's all you may see, Mr. President.

591
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:48,226
[SPEAKER_14]: What I would ask is that the carts be affixed with the name, address, and phone number of the cart, the owner of the cart.

592
00:53:49,040 --> 00:54:03,951
[SPEAKER_14]: And also that every establishment that has a shopping cart have a sign at the beginning of their store location that lets patrons know that this cart cannot leave the premise.

593
00:54:04,882 --> 00:54:08,045
[SPEAKER_14]: and that there are means to protect this cot from leaving the premise.

594
00:54:08,466 --> 00:54:25,122
[SPEAKER_14]: That way, people that do want to take the cot for a walk to their home know that that's no longer going to be allowed, Mr. President, based on the fact that many of these cots are just finding their way on city streets and ending up in front of someone's home for weeks at a time.

595
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:30,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And really, there's been no relief under any city ordinance to address this issue.

596
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:40,587
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Wegmans coming in, Bob Sporting Good, PetSmart, Aldi's in Wellington has a pretty creative way of doing it.

597
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:46,071
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to put a quarter in to get the shopping cart, and when you bring it back, you get your quarter back.

598
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:53,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, there are people that are not worried about their quarter and taking the carts and using them to

599
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,547
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, traverse around the community.

600
00:54:57,007 --> 00:55:07,510
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think it's a good way, but I also think they should put a locking mechanism, Mr. President, or another way of retrieving these carts so they don't get off their property.

601
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:13,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I would ask, Mr. President, that this paper be sent to the Subcommittee on Public Works.

602
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,731
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's probably the most likely.

603
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety, Mr. Vice President?

604
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety would be fine.

605
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:20,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Public safety and public works.

606
00:55:20,832 --> 00:55:23,213
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, it seems like a public work issue because it's

607
00:55:23,794 --> 00:55:25,775
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a, you know, a card on a city street.

608
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:27,316
[SPEAKER_14]: No public works.

609
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:31,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I would ask that it be sent to public works, Mr. President.

610
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:41,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and that, uh, similar to the issue with having these, uh, big box metal boxes, uh, for drop off that are popping up all over the city.

611
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:45,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, there's one, Mr. President in the fells Plaza now.

612
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,820
[SPEAKER_14]: that's actually manned.

613
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:54,228
[SPEAKER_14]: The box is probably 15 feet long by 8 feet wide, and there's someone there at the entrance of the box.

614
00:55:54,248 --> 00:56:00,974
[SPEAKER_14]: They open up the big gate to the box during the day, and someone sits out there in a lounge chair accepting items.

615
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:04,158
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't know where we're going with this, Mr. President, but

616
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:08,680
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, homeowners shouldn't have to see this across the street from their homes, Mr. President.

617
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,742
[SPEAKER_14]: They shouldn't have to look at an abandoned mattress where it says we accept books.

618
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:22,666
[SPEAKER_14]: They shouldn't have to look at items that are left out there on days on end, Mr. President, that is just a public nuisance.

619
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:32,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I'm hoping that we can address the shopping cart issue and the drop-off boxes pretty soon, Mr. President, so we can

620
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:35,148
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, tackle this very important issue.

621
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:40,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you were recommending that this be sent, referred to the public works committee, correct?

622
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:41,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

623
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Public works me, which is, uh, chaired by Councilor Knight, uh, and yourself, uh, vice-president marks around it.

624
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:50,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And councilor Dello Russo was also on that committee.

625
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:59,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would hope that your committee would, um, would call a subcommittee meeting as soon as possible on the motion by councilor marks.

626
00:57:00,062 --> 00:57:01,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo.

627
00:57:01,363 --> 00:57:03,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President for recognizing me.

628
00:57:03,862 --> 00:57:21,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And just if the council could refresh my memory, and I certainly don't want to belabor the laborious presentation that we've already had, but I was, for some reason I have in my mind that there's already an ordinance on this, or did we not discuss one and it went nowhere?

629
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:29,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember some, it might be a decade ago that this matter was before us for quite lengthy discussion.

630
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:38,197
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, uh, clerk has informed me that something that emotion was made on this about a year ago when it was received and placed on file.

631
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

632
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:44,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember something even further back that the clerk, uh, let us know where that is.

633
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And nonetheless, thank you, Mr. President.

634
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:49,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to addressing this in subcommittee.

635
00:57:49,943 --> 00:57:50,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

636
00:57:51,064 --> 00:57:57,067
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by council, but by vice president mocks seconded by Councilor Knight.

637
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:57,888
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor.

638
00:57:58,968 --> 00:57:59,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

639
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered $17,490.

640
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:16,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the pothole on Short Street that is filled with sand be filled in the interest of public safety.

641
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

642
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

643
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:26,432
[SPEAKER_09]: This pothole, I think I brought up a few weeks ago, is filled with sand.

644
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:32,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Two feet by two feet, I feel like it's a big pothole and just looking to get it filled.

645
00:58:32,994 --> 00:58:46,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate they did some pothole filling on Rita and a few other streets that I've noticed, but Short Street needs to be done and there's a few others, if I can amend this paper, on Bell Ave that I got a call on today.

646
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:47,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Bell Ave also?

647
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:47,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

648
00:58:51,964 --> 00:58:53,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

649
00:58:54,252 --> 00:59:01,315
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended to add Bella Evolandia, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

650
00:59:01,515 --> 00:59:02,456
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

651
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:07,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

652
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:09,779
[SPEAKER_02]: 17491 offered by Vice President Mox.

653
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:15,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the protection of our city shade trees be discussed.

654
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

655
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:18,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

656
00:59:19,103 --> 00:59:23,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, as I mentioned a few weeks back, uh, for the last several years, maybe 10 years,

657
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:29,482
[SPEAKER_14]: We've received the distinct award of being recognized as Tree City USA in this community.

658
00:59:30,223 --> 00:59:50,141
[SPEAKER_14]: And we received that award based on the number of trees that we plant on an annual basis, the fact that a certain percentage of our per capita budget is spent on shade trees, and the fact that we have a tree department with the tree warden, which is all great news, Mr. President.

659
00:59:51,089 --> 01:00:02,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we first have to do is recognize that the trees that are lining our streets are an important resource for the whole community and provide shade and protection to our pedestrians.

660
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Street trees help clean air.

661
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:07,983
[SPEAKER_14]: They help lower heating and air conditioning costs.

662
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:13,788
[SPEAKER_14]: They provide environmental benefits by filtering and reducing storm water runoff.

663
01:00:14,629 --> 01:00:18,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Trees reduce noise and create a visual buffer between streets and private homes.

664
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:23,533
[SPEAKER_14]: And they also boost property value and enhance the character of a neighborhood.

665
01:00:24,673 --> 01:00:46,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, right now, Mr. President, when work is done in the community, I think everyone would be surprised that you would think the first person that a contractor would have to go to or anyone that's doing work around a city tree on a city street would have to contact or be in touch with the tree warden.

666
01:00:47,317 --> 01:00:48,877
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not the case, Mr. President.

667
01:00:49,793 --> 01:01:04,565
[SPEAKER_14]: For most construction work that's performed in our city, around city shade trees, the construction company or whoever's doing the work is typically required to go to OCD or the engineering office.

668
01:01:05,526 --> 01:01:13,572
[SPEAKER_14]: So they don't have to go to our great tree warden, Aggie Tudin, to get her professional opinion as an arborist.

669
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:33,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mr. President, the work that was done recently on Boston Ave, where contractors did a lot of work on sidewalks that contain trees, the OCD and engineering department sometimes will consult or get the opinion of our tree warden.

670
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a problem with that, Mr. President.

671
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:40,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Aggie Tudin was a very capable person

672
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:49,959
[SPEAKER_14]: and has done a tremendous job in this city on our shade trees in the community, should be the go-to person as far as I'm concerned.

673
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:59,086
[SPEAKER_14]: When a utility company comes into this community and start veeing out our trees because the branches are getting too close to their wires,

674
01:01:59,786 --> 01:02:02,527
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a concern if Aggie Tudin's not aware of this.

675
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:06,748
[SPEAKER_14]: If our tree warden's not there to oversee the veeing out.

676
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:12,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen trees, Mr. President, that really don't look like a tree anymore when the utility companies are done with them.

677
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:14,510
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how bad it is.

678
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:24,632
[SPEAKER_14]: These are long established shade trees that have been in our community for 40, 50, 60 years that are being desecrated, Mr. President, across our community.

679
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:37,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask tonight, Mr. President, and I think we can do this in two ways, an administrative policy which can be done through the administration or city ordinance, but oversight of construction work.

680
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:43,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that any approval by the tree warden required for construction work

681
01:02:44,022 --> 01:03:01,695
[SPEAKER_14]: including work by the city or its contractors or by any utility company that will impact a public shade tree or the roots within a defined distance of a tree stem, impose a fine if the approval is not obtained ahead of time, exception in the case of an emergency work, Mr. President.

682
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be the first recommendation that I offer.

683
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:07,066
[SPEAKER_14]: And we could send it to the administration.

684
01:03:07,406 --> 01:03:08,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe the mayor will pick up on this.

685
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:14,953
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, I think it deserves merit in one of our fine subcommittees.

686
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:19,837
[SPEAKER_14]: And also the establishment, Mr. President, which we don't currently have right now.

687
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:26,582
[SPEAKER_14]: We have revolving accounts in this city, which is money that's earmarked and dedicated for certain purposes.

688
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,886
[SPEAKER_14]: For everything under the sun, you name it, we have a revolving account.

689
01:03:31,466 --> 01:03:35,029
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have one currently for our shade trees, Mr. President.

690
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:51,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of trees in this community that, as you know, provide a direct benefit not only financially but physically to the residents of this community, and we don't have any type of dedicated revolving fund.

691
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:56,807
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask that a tree fund revolving account be earmarked

692
01:03:57,147 --> 01:04:22,353
[SPEAKER_14]: for tree plantings, Mr. President, and also to any fines that are issued by the city for any damage to public shade trees, and believe it or not, we do issue fines every so often for damage to our shade trees, not go into the general fund where the money goes now, that's similar to when our police write tickets, the money goes into the general fund,

693
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:24,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, we need police cruises.

694
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We need new equipment.

695
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:27,572
[SPEAKER_14]: We need radar signs.

696
01:04:27,892 --> 01:04:28,893
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a host of things.

697
01:04:29,253 --> 01:04:31,795
[SPEAKER_14]: But it goes into the general fund and gets swallowed up.

698
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:43,344
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm asking for, Mr. President, is that any fines issued on behalf of our trees and also any other money that's recovered within the tree program go into a revolving account.

699
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:52,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And any donations that people may want to make to the trees in this community go into a dedicated account, Mr. President, for the preservation

700
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:55,750
[SPEAKER_14]: and protection of our city shade trees.

701
01:04:56,351 --> 01:05:09,581
[SPEAKER_14]: It just so happens, and myself, I think it was Councilor Longo, and you, Mr. President, we received an email today regarding a tree that was damaged at Columbus Park.

702
01:05:10,402 --> 01:05:14,465
[SPEAKER_14]: And a picture was sent, and I'll pass it around to my colleagues, Mr. President.

703
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:17,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the weekend, someone took

704
01:05:18,162 --> 01:05:30,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I would assume some type of hatchet or carving knife, and carved all the bark off the tree from the base of the tree to about six feet up on the tree at Columbus Park.

705
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:34,426
[SPEAKER_14]: And this looks like a pretty young tree.

706
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:36,966
[SPEAKER_14]: And I reached out to Aggie Tudin.

707
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:39,867
[SPEAKER_14]: She did go out because she received the same email.

708
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:46,429
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, based on her observation, she doesn't believe the tree will survive.

709
01:05:48,328 --> 01:05:55,058
[SPEAKER_14]: This is only one thing, Mr. President, and it just so happens I put this on the agenda prior to even getting this email.

710
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:01,108
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it shows you that, you know, we really need to step up our game.

711
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,830
[SPEAKER_14]: when it comes to the shade trees in our community.

712
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,250
[SPEAKER_14]: We're a big asset.

713
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:12,292
[SPEAKER_14]: For many years, you've heard people say, the only thing that separates us from Somerville is we're Somerville with trees.

714
01:06:13,072 --> 01:06:15,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of it's true, Mr. President.

715
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:20,474
[SPEAKER_14]: The trees in this community, Mr. President, do a lot for our community.

716
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:22,835
[SPEAKER_14]: And it makes a neighborhood what it is.

717
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,832
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think we should take them for granted.

718
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:36,100
[SPEAKER_14]: This council was very strong for years when the city was posting signage on trees, using our trees to post all sorts of metal signs.

719
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:44,626
[SPEAKER_14]: It was this council, through its persistency, Mr. President, that stopped that policy of using trees to post signage.

720
01:06:45,086 --> 01:06:50,611
[SPEAKER_14]: And the administration came out with a policy that prohibits that now, and it was this council,

721
01:06:51,771 --> 01:07:05,400
[SPEAKER_14]: something I'm very proud of, Mr. President, and I think this council should be very proud of, because, you know, it's important as a community, you know, that we appreciate and respect all living things.

722
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, you may not realize the different animals that live in a tree.

723
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:11,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their home.

724
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:20,389
[SPEAKER_14]: You may not like squirrels that run around or birds that are doing their duty on your car, but, you know, they live in the trees, Mr. President.

725
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:21,816
[SPEAKER_14]: and we have to respect them.

726
01:07:22,136 --> 01:07:37,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to have administrative policies and ordinances that allow us as a community to protect them and to stop utility companies and any other private company that's coming in and doing work on a public street, Mr. President, from desecrating our trees.

727
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:48,362
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the administration for administrative policy and that, I guess, if public works, again, we're going to be a busy committee.

728
01:07:49,053 --> 01:08:15,928
[SPEAKER_14]: with Chairman Knight as the Chairman, that the Public Works Committee looks at the creation of a city ordinance that provides oversight to construction work, that gives the tree warden, Aggie Tudin, more authority over work that's being done and approval by the tree warden, and also that we create a dedicated revolving urban forestry fund to fund our shade trees in the community, Mr. President.

729
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

730
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had the opportunity to drive by that tree, and it had to take some time to chop all the bark off.

731
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:26,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how somebody didn't drive by to see that happening.

732
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:31,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you know, you tell the people, see something, please say something.

733
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address of the record, please.

734
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:37,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, Christian Street Method Mass.

735
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:39,427
[SPEAKER_00]: The trees are very nice.

736
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:41,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, maintenance can be a problem.

737
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard the terminology

738
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:53,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Difference between Somerville and Medford would be we're a city, or they're a city without trees.

739
01:08:53,093 --> 01:08:54,254
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.

740
01:08:55,314 --> 01:09:01,057
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern is we gotta maintain and take care of our basics.

741
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:05,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain what we have, let alone building anew.

742
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:14,225
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, behind, by Riverbend, I'm sorry, the term would be Ring Road,

743
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:25,111
[SPEAKER_00]: That parking lot back there, there's hunks of cement that are supposed to be in place to stop cars from encroaching upon the sidewalks.

744
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:28,454
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place, from the snow plowing.

745
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:34,378
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't see them when they plow, and there's one on the other side, almost in the river, mind you.

746
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:38,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned someone's gonna get seriously, seriously hurt.

747
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:42,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potholes, as Councilor Del Russo calls them,

748
01:09:42,931 --> 01:09:48,494
[SPEAKER_00]: potholders, I am not sure if there is a better way to build a mouth strap.

749
01:09:48,894 --> 01:10:00,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should talk to Montreal or some other locale where they have pothole problems big time, and maybe we can learn from the engineering process what would actually hold up.

750
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:08,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it has to be cut in a V or an opposite angle and filled maybe with cement if the tire is not going to stay.

751
01:10:08,346 --> 01:10:10,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not that savvy in this area.

752
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:20,820
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my concern is if you don't take care of our basics, I don't know about some of them, but I'm concerned that we're going to be having like a weekend in Chelsea here.

753
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:28,503
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my concern with your massage parlors or your hawk shops.

754
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:32,784
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some plane noise also.

755
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:34,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

756
01:10:34,865 --> 01:10:35,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lego Kern.

757
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

758
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:39,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to go on record as seconding the motion.

759
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great resolve.

760
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:44,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to see if we could maybe take it one step further.

761
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:56,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Back maybe eight years ago, there was a number of residents, and I remember clearly Roberta Cameron was pushing hard for a tree ordinance to be put in place.

762
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:05,050
[SPEAKER_09]: We met in committee a few times, and I drafted maybe a two or three page ordinance from some research I did.

763
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:09,833
[SPEAKER_09]: with regards to a few different cities and towns.

764
01:11:10,494 --> 01:11:14,176
[SPEAKER_09]: We had, we met a committee on it and then it was sent to the city solicitor for review.

765
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:25,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been eight years reviewing, but I believe it didn't go anywhere because the votes really weren't there to create a tree ordinance back eight, 10 years ago and the administration was not for it.

766
01:11:25,525 --> 01:11:32,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it kind of died down because at the right around the same time, maybe, maybe three, six months, nine months later, Aggie Tudin was hired.

767
01:11:33,486 --> 01:11:39,731
[SPEAKER_09]: And she obviously came in and gave us a great spiel of what she's going to do and how good she's going to do it.

768
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:45,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that kind of has appeased the citizens, especially over the last several years.

769
01:11:45,495 --> 01:11:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, especially after seeing this, and I agree with Councilor Marks with regards to everything he spoke about, I think it's time that maybe we bring that back and try to create an ordinance if our city solicitor would

770
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:01,384
[SPEAKER_09]: try to dig that up.

771
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:05,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I have it on my old computer, but dig that up, see if he has done any review.

772
01:12:05,765 --> 01:12:11,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this council is a good example of making the changes that need to be changed.

773
01:12:11,447 --> 01:12:16,008
[SPEAKER_09]: We've changed more ordinances and done more work in the last year and a half.

774
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think changed more ordinances than I ever remember doing in a term.

775
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:29,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's, and I think it would have support now to review an entire ordinance and make it so we do a number of changes and make it a number of positive

776
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:37,390
[SPEAKER_09]: take positive steps moving forward, and a tree ordinance is something that's gonna give Aggie Tootin Teeth, it is gonna give her more power.

777
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:47,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It may cause her a little bit more aggravation with having, you know, the way we set it up, obviously, which I believe the prior tree warden was against an ordinance because of that fact.

778
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:58,588
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is something that will protect our trees, and I think it's, now is a really good time, especially if we can get the budget done in the next few weeks, maybe meet on it at the end of June, and try to

779
01:12:58,965 --> 01:13:04,289
[SPEAKER_09]: get the language to review over the summer, I think it's something that this council definitely can move forward and should move forward.

780
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:06,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

781
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

782
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:10,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Neuzil, 35 Paris Street, Medford.

783
01:13:11,193 --> 01:13:22,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just am thrilled to hear the phrase tree ordinance and I've had some conversations both online and sidebar with various people.

784
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:33,794
[SPEAKER_01]: who are concerned both for our public shade trees, but also for some of the old majestic beauties that are being torn out that we'll never see again.

785
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:35,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is great.

786
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:45,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the idea of those fines going to a fund that people can also voluntarily contribute to if it's a topic that's near and dear to their heart.

787
01:13:45,116 --> 01:13:47,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's a great thing to be looking at.

788
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:51,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank you all for considering it and put my citizenry support behind it.

789
01:13:53,248 --> 01:13:53,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

790
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:55,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

791
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:04,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to point out that our tree warden, Maggie Tooden, was the two-time tree warden of the year, consecutive years in a row.

792
01:14:05,276 --> 01:14:12,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we'd be remiss in moving forward without first getting some input and some feedback from Maggie as to what direction she'd like to see this going as well.

793
01:14:13,302 --> 01:14:15,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to amend the paper and request that the tree warden provide input.

794
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:23,126
[SPEAKER_04]: what you would like to see, an administrative procedure, an ordinance, and if she could make some recommendations thereof.

795
01:14:24,946 --> 01:14:25,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

796
01:14:28,107 --> 01:14:36,869
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, as seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Knight.

797
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:37,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get them all?

798
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: To be sent to Public Works and to the Mayor's Office.

799
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:46,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, all those in favor?

800
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:50,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes and then again, this came out today.

801
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:54,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had to take an hour or two to cut all this down.

802
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe nobody saw this happen.

803
01:14:58,564 --> 01:15:00,165
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this is right in the middle of the park there.

804
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:01,686
[SPEAKER_02]: People go by it all the time.

805
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm shocked that no one saw anything happen there.

806
01:15:04,689 --> 01:15:04,709
[SPEAKER_02]: 17-492.

807
01:15:14,705 --> 01:15:21,347
[SPEAKER_02]: be resolved that the manhole cover on the bottom of Rita Drive with cones on it be fixed in the interest of public safety.

808
01:15:21,587 --> 01:15:22,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

809
01:15:22,627 --> 01:15:23,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

810
01:15:23,928 --> 01:15:30,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even sure if it's a manhole cover or a sewer grate, but it's on the side of the road.

811
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I mentioned it earlier.

812
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:39,533
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could get an update with regards to when that's going to be fixed, because it does have two cones on it, and if I could amend the paper.

813
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:53,748
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to Bell Ave, there is another sewer cover that is probably two feet deep with a cone and a barrel on it that if we could get an update when they're going to be fixed and that they'd be fixed as soon as possible in the interest of public safety.

814
01:15:54,148 --> 01:15:54,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

815
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:02,854
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight, with Bell Ave being added there too.

816
01:16:04,095 --> 01:16:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

817
01:16:06,017 --> 01:16:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

818
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ask for a roll call, ma'am?

819
01:16:11,961 --> 01:16:12,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk.

820
01:16:15,162 --> 01:16:18,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, the Councilor has asked for a roll call.

821
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:21,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I mistakenly did a voice vote.

822
01:16:24,386 --> 01:16:25,387
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could please call the roll.

823
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:27,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

824
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:28,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

825
01:16:29,156 --> 01:16:29,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

826
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:30,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

827
01:16:30,437 --> 01:16:30,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

828
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kerr?

829
01:16:31,977 --> 01:16:32,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

830
01:16:32,638 --> 01:16:33,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Monk?

831
01:16:33,478 --> 01:16:33,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

832
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:34,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

833
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:35,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

834
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:36,639
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

835
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:36,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

836
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

837
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:40,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

838
01:16:41,121 --> 01:16:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: My apologies, Councilor.

839
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:53,826
[SPEAKER_02]: 17.494 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the city council discuss the street work that was performed on Clifton Road.

840
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

841
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:57,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

842
01:16:57,764 --> 01:17:01,806
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this, uh, it seems like there's a common thread here.

843
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:23,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I know I've been talking about this since I first arrived here in this council and, uh, the resident that called and I took a ride down to Clifton and, uh, witnessed the street that was, uh, dug up for utility work, uh, is now, uh, has been patched and now sinking.

844
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:24,759
[SPEAKER_12]: So again,

845
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:37,479
[SPEAKER_12]: If we can ask the, I believe it was Councilor Knight who asked the, correct me if I'm wrong, asked for the city engineer to give us an update of all the utility work that was done.

846
01:17:37,959 --> 01:17:55,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we can ask the city engineer to please bring that, if she can bring that to the meeting next week, I think it'll be pretty eyeopening to see the concerns and the calls and the issues we've got, we've received from our constituents about the biggest areas

847
01:17:56,411 --> 01:18:12,355
[SPEAKER_12]: of concern were mainly because of our utilities not doing what they've been promised to us to maintain a level that our constituents deserve.

848
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:21,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So, again, I'm not, I think I made a motion a while back that I wanted to halt all work in public utilities.

849
01:18:23,233 --> 01:18:31,577
[SPEAKER_12]: that are asking, coming to this rail and asking for a permit to start work in our community.

850
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:51,545
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I don't, for one council, if I don't get the information that I need next week and we don't have a sit down with the public utilities and talking about our roads and our streets, I think that something has to be done with this council.

851
01:18:52,570 --> 01:19:06,536
[SPEAKER_12]: motioning moratoriums or delays for those, uh, those organizations, because when they can't work and, um, they can't perform the duties that brings the money to their, to their, their, uh, businesses.

852
01:19:07,196 --> 01:19:08,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's when we'll start to listen.

853
01:19:08,897 --> 01:19:16,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, I appreciate the opportunity to address, uh, a council with this concern.

854
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:17,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

855
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

856
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

857
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:24,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

858
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:39,623
[SPEAKER_04]: When we passed Resolution 16404, we asked for all of the work that was done on our roadways and sidewalks by public utilities for the years 2014, 15, 16, and to date.

859
01:19:40,183 --> 01:19:50,906
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been 16 months since that resolution's passed, Mr. President, so I'd like to update it so that the engineer can come to our meeting next week prepared with this information to date.

860
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:53,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd also have 2017 included.

861
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:55,748
[SPEAKER_04]: in this report that we're seeking.

862
01:19:56,148 --> 01:20:06,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that, um, the administration provide us with all the C-Click fix reports related to work done by public utilities on the roadways, uh, in preparation for the meeting on Tuesday as well.

863
01:20:09,595 --> 01:20:15,078
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Knight.

864
01:20:15,138 --> 01:20:17,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, do you have all those changes?

865
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

866
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:22,022
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

867
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:30,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes 17 four nine five offered by councilor Scarpelli.

868
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:37,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the city council discuss the gas station hood located on Winthrop street.

869
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:39,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

870
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

871
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:51,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I've received a few phone calls, emails, and, um, uh, concerns about, uh, the hood that this is the canopy.

872
01:20:51,630 --> 01:21:15,723
[SPEAKER_12]: that is being built over on the gas station on Winthrop Street and the concerns of how large it is and concerns of what that canopy makes the changing of the neighborhood and what it looks like today.

873
01:21:15,843 --> 01:21:19,665
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did contact the city

874
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:25,918
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, city administration talked to Paul Moki, talked to Jeff Fargo.

875
01:21:26,658 --> 01:21:29,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, they were very, very involved, although they didn't have to be.

876
01:21:30,259 --> 01:21:33,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that Mr. Moki was out that site many times.

877
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:44,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, looking at the, um, the canopy, they realize that it's actually smaller than what, what is actually passed, which brings me to my number one concern.

878
01:21:44,123 --> 01:21:46,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, we hear it over and over again.

879
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:49,525
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like every, every council meeting we talk about this is,

880
01:21:50,128 --> 01:21:51,988
[SPEAKER_12]: what happens when it comes to our zoning.

881
01:21:53,429 --> 01:22:02,250
[SPEAKER_12]: This was something that was passed at a meeting with the neighbors that were on site, and there were two, I believe there were two issues on that agenda.

882
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:08,252
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one that called for another bay, which was denied, and then the canopy.

883
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:12,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Some neighbors said that they didn't realize the canopy was on that, so they left the meeting.

884
01:22:13,453 --> 01:22:19,354
[SPEAKER_12]: But the biggest concern I have is really not that

885
01:22:19,738 --> 01:22:22,739
[SPEAKER_12]: we can do anything about this now because the cat's out of the bag.

886
01:22:22,799 --> 01:22:32,044
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been approved is again, the way we're looking at our, uh, ordinances that our zoning board, uh, their tools they're given to make decisions.

887
01:22:32,684 --> 01:22:45,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, some questions, some of our residents were, did they see specs where they're, um, do they understand how, how big this would be and how much it would change the appearance of the neighborhood.

888
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,192
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, I don't know if that was, that's the case.

889
01:22:48,232 --> 01:22:49,152
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know that,

890
01:22:49,923 --> 01:23:02,706
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, a city, um, uh, departments did their due diligence when it came to the fire department giving, um, permission for that, that canopy that needed to be there.

891
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:11,328
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the new laws state that there has to be some sort of fire apparatus that extinguishes any type of gas fire.

892
01:23:11,869 --> 01:23:17,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's actually powdered from a form that, uh, extinguishes blazes that, uh, to do with gasoline.

893
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So public safety is number one.

894
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:37,864
[SPEAKER_12]: But, again, I think that we need to, again, I know I mentioned the Metropolitan Planning Council and working with them to try to start a dialogue in our zoning and reviewing our zoning so we can control or support

895
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:41,349
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on in our neighborhoods.

896
01:23:41,589 --> 01:23:53,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And so things like this issue aren't brought up after the fact and the concerns of our neighbors are heard too late.

897
01:23:55,241 --> 01:24:08,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything was done, the up and up and the due diligence of our city departments maintained, making sure that the residents were contacted.

898
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:08,592
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of the

899
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:34,815
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the concerns that was brought to my attention and from what I was told and shown that that was covered and the neighbors were at the meetings, but I think that we really have to, again, bring up the discussion of our zoning and our ordinances because it's issues like this that change the face of our neighborhoods.

900
01:24:34,976 --> 01:24:38,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And until we do that, and this council does that and finds a way to get that done,

901
01:24:39,502 --> 01:24:42,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we're going to keep hearing the same issue over and over again.

902
01:24:42,303 --> 01:24:44,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, again, thank you.

903
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:51,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I know that I'm rambling, but I, it's an issue that, uh, was brought to our attention and, uh, thank you again.

904
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:56,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all received phone calls on that and, um, and we've got the same answer.

905
01:24:56,886 --> 01:25:00,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yes, Mr. President, I did have a question for the gentleman.

906
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if, um, because it's new construction and the canopy was put in, is that the new code?

907
01:25:05,915 --> 01:25:06,875
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the fire chief.

908
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

909
01:25:07,376 --> 01:25:08,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the new code.

910
01:25:08,056 --> 01:25:09,056
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't appear as the new code.

911
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And that gas section has been there for many, many years.

912
01:25:11,478 --> 01:25:16,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And the matter was brought before the zoning board of appeals because they were looking for a nonconforming use of the existing city zoning.

913
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:17,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

914
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

915
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:19,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval, Mr. President.

916
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

917
01:25:20,802 --> 01:25:21,562
[SPEAKER_12]: They were supposed to.

918
01:25:22,462 --> 01:25:23,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you have any more?

919
01:25:24,103 --> 01:25:25,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, no, that was just to answer.

920
01:25:25,504 --> 01:25:25,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

921
01:25:26,727 --> 01:25:27,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

922
01:25:27,987 --> 01:25:29,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

923
01:25:30,488 --> 01:25:37,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only advise you as I have in the past, having attended these community development meetings and zoning board meetings.

924
01:25:38,469 --> 01:25:55,292
[SPEAKER_01]: When you attend, there's no real effort made to make sure that residents are able to see the documentation, can clearly hear the documentation, presenters are regularly advised, speak to the board,

925
01:25:57,303 --> 01:26:00,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, when you're sitting in the audience, you'll have a back.

926
01:26:01,844 --> 01:26:16,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone with experience in transformational change and change management understands that the best way to deal with pushback and resistance is to make sure that expectations are set.

927
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:25,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is another example of the right equipment in these rooms and the right opportunities presented to make sure that

928
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:28,533
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors get to hear what's happening.

929
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:34,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this could have been avoided and people could have been less upset about it.

930
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:41,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also a good case for more transparency in this documentation.

931
01:26:41,637 --> 01:26:49,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, if a resident wanted to know about that project, they would have to go down to the Office of Community Development.

932
01:26:50,099 --> 01:26:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to request to see the documentation.

933
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:55,757
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to be allowed to have that documentation.

934
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:58,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have to be readily available and not under review somewhere.

935
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:01,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would have to do it right there in the space.

936
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:06,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people, they're not out of work and home before 4 or 5 o'clock at night.

937
01:27:06,503 --> 01:27:08,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes very difficult for us to see this.

938
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:12,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know previously we've had some conversations.

939
01:27:12,506 --> 01:27:16,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was in one of the subcommittee meetings about some

940
01:27:17,307 --> 01:27:20,188
[SPEAKER_01]: software that's available that would make some of these things.

941
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:34,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so I know Jean's going on, but tomorrow we have a meeting, a committee of the whole meeting at six o'clock that purpose of the meeting is to view presentation of Acela Corporation on the government legislative management program agenda minutes and video streaming.

942
01:27:34,634 --> 01:27:36,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the product you're talking about.

943
01:27:36,174 --> 01:27:37,755
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just so you know that's happening tomorrow.

944
01:27:37,775 --> 01:27:38,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, perfect.

945
01:27:38,475 --> 01:27:41,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe one of the things people might want to ask them is if there's, uh,

946
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:46,622
[SPEAKER_01]: module that would allow for a mechanism for these documents.

947
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:53,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some surrounding cities, even Melrose and Malden, have a good portion of theirs readily available.

948
01:27:53,246 --> 01:28:02,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's through Google Docs or Excel, but I think it would go a long way because most people, if they have the opportunity to see it, their expectations are set.

949
01:28:02,972 --> 01:28:09,596
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not surprised driving home from work, and it keeps from having emotions elevated because they have that information.

950
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:28,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But the software or some Google Docs solution, maybe temporarily, coupled with maybe some technology, simple technology in the room so that people can hear a little better, even if it's a lapel microphone and a speaker, could go pretty far with some of these meetings.

951
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:35,130
[SPEAKER_01]: But just so you have that information, because I've attended a lot, and I know you guys have other ones you go to, and you don't always get to be at those.

952
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

953
01:28:36,872 --> 01:28:37,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Member O'Kary.

954
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:39,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

955
01:28:40,169 --> 01:28:43,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for bringing that up.

956
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:56,603
[SPEAKER_09]: On topic, with regards to maybe just a little more information on what the Zoning Board of Appeals had to approve, I think I did see people discussing this issue, and people were a little upset with the way it went down.

957
01:28:57,204 --> 01:29:04,070
[SPEAKER_09]: But what Gene Nuzzo had brought up, not only does it have to be a resident

958
01:29:04,502 --> 01:29:08,785
[SPEAKER_09]: come down to City Hall between 9 and 5 or 9 and 4.30, depending on the day.

959
01:29:08,805 --> 01:29:20,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also heard complaints from residents who aren't allowed to see the plans unless somebody specific is in the office, or they may have to come back another day at another time.

960
01:29:20,174 --> 01:29:32,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is kind of hampering residents' ability to view plans and to actually, we talk about transparency, but that's kind of cutting people off from seeing what should be honestly posted online.

961
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:48,755
[SPEAKER_09]: a proposal, I think it should, of any sort, with regards to building or construction or anything that's going to need a variance or OCD approval, that should be something that's readily available to anybody that wants to view it, whether they're at city hall or not.

962
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:51,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that would be helpful to the council, too.

963
01:29:52,135 --> 01:30:01,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I've come down and reviewed plans, and I went from, I believe I ended up at the engineer's department, but I went to OCD first.

964
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:02,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't there.

965
01:30:02,157 --> 01:30:03,137
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, not only

966
01:30:03,578 --> 01:30:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: are people not allowed to see it unless the director's in the office, but you have to kind of go through city hall and try to figure out where the plans even are.

967
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:23,007
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe whether it be tomorrow night or be a separate amendment to this paper, I think plans, proposed plans should be online and accessible to anybody that wants to view them.

968
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:26,208
[SPEAKER_09]: So they know, should I go to this OCD meeting?

969
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:28,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I go to the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting?

970
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:32,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll be able to see it on their computer while they want to decide.

971
01:30:32,744 --> 01:30:36,405
[SPEAKER_09]: rather than searching through City Hall or kind of just giving up on the fight.

972
01:30:36,926 --> 01:30:39,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's extremely important.

973
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:40,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank Gene for bringing that up.

974
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:42,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up too.

975
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I was unaware of exactly what was going on with the zoning or with this one, but maybe you can just enlighten, if you know what zoning, what they needed, what type of permit or override, variance, I'm sorry.

976
01:30:59,161 --> 01:30:59,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

977
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:04,322
[SPEAKER_12]: The non-conforming, I believe, was one for code.

978
01:31:04,442 --> 01:31:09,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other one was for the addition of a bay.

979
01:31:09,043 --> 01:31:10,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was denied.

980
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,144
[SPEAKER_07]: That was denied.

981
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:24,487
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that, like I said, I think that the due diligence from our department, city departments, and making sure and understanding that that being an issue of fire apparatus,

982
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:37,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there might've been, the question was that a few phone calls that I got were questions about, could there have been something that was maybe smaller or more tasteful for that area?

983
01:31:37,768 --> 01:31:40,169
[SPEAKER_12]: But from what I was told, there isn't.

984
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,170
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's what?

985
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:42,911
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too late.

986
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:44,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's not that it was too late.

987
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:55,540
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I gather is that, just from a phone call I just received before I came in, is that the understanding of that type of canopy, you need that for existing gas stations being that it's always been permitted.

988
01:31:56,203 --> 01:32:03,085
[SPEAKER_12]: and always been a gas station that, um, that's what they had to maintain.

989
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:04,905
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

990
01:32:05,885 --> 01:32:06,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

991
01:32:06,826 --> 01:32:07,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

992
01:32:07,726 --> 01:32:14,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank council Scarpelli for bringing this forward because this is an important, uh, issue and a zoning and ordinances.

993
01:32:15,168 --> 01:32:19,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, um, you know, it's, it's really, it's one of our biggest responsibilities.

994
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:24,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we've had a lot of discussions over the past term with regard to zoning and ordinances and a lot of changes.

995
01:32:25,264 --> 01:32:35,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of, you know, when we talk a lot about zoning in ordinances, a lot of it is about communication, but a lot of it is also about transparency.

996
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:45,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And Gene Nozzo brings up a good point, which goes into the meeting tomorrow night with regard to, you know, legislative software.

997
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:51,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a resolution that I brought up about a year ago with regard to legislative software.

998
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:58,385
[SPEAKER_08]: finally the meeting's going to happen tomorrow night, but it's important because it brings everyone onto the same page.

999
01:32:58,525 --> 01:33:04,027
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone has any questions or any issues, what they can do is they can find all that information online.

1000
01:33:04,527 --> 01:33:18,072
[SPEAKER_08]: All the boards and commissions can put all of their minutes, agendas, meeting minutes, all of their, anything that has to do with plans or documents, they can all be scanned to PDF and seen online.

1001
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all the information that we receive every week,

1002
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:23,964
[SPEAKER_08]: all kinds of memos, reports, all that detail.

1003
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:25,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We get it behind the reel.

1004
01:33:26,906 --> 01:33:31,128
[SPEAKER_08]: But out in the community, no one really gets to see that.

1005
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:33,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the unfortunate part.

1006
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:37,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Because really, it's your government.

1007
01:33:37,672 --> 01:33:40,814
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be able to see everything with the click of a mouse.

1008
01:33:41,034 --> 01:33:42,575
[SPEAKER_08]: All the data should be at your fingertips.

1009
01:33:43,175 --> 01:33:45,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what this legislative software is going to do.

1010
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:49,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's well worth the money to actually invest in that.

1011
01:33:50,952 --> 01:33:56,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it really puts everyone on the same playing field, the same level playing field.

1012
01:33:56,995 --> 01:33:58,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone has access to the data.

1013
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've used a perfect example.

1014
01:34:00,536 --> 01:34:04,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Councilor Marks had asked for a number of times for a public safety summit.

1015
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:13,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and if he wanted to, if someone wanted to go in and research that, they could actually take a look, plug in public safety summit and see every time it was mentioned during a council meeting.

1016
01:34:14,642 --> 01:34:16,623
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so they could actually go back and look at the detail.

1017
01:34:17,404 --> 01:34:17,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a look at the,

1018
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,201
[SPEAKER_08]: The report, we talked about the FEMA document a few weeks ago.

1019
01:34:21,621 --> 01:34:23,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 138 page document.

1020
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:25,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we really probably shouldn't be printing that.

1021
01:34:25,663 --> 01:34:27,783
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very green, but everyone should have a copy.

1022
01:34:28,144 --> 01:34:29,644
[SPEAKER_08]: The public should have access to it too.

1023
01:34:30,044 --> 01:34:31,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And it should be easy to access.

1024
01:34:32,005 --> 01:34:36,146
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is put that PDF online and everyone has access with the click of a mouse.

1025
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:40,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's important that we do more in zoning and ordinances.

1026
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:47,191
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, I think, thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this issue up tonight, but really it's one of our biggest responsibilities.

1027
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:48,291
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do more there.

1028
01:34:48,919 --> 01:34:55,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think we're heading in the right direction, but I think, uh, really one of the big things tomorrow night is that meeting with regard to legislative software.

1029
01:34:56,326 --> 01:35:10,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think it really will make, um, it doesn't all, it makes us an informed council, but also makes us an informed community because all the boards and commissions will have access to that data and have access to put all that information out there for the community to see.

1030
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:12,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

1031
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1032
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope everyone wants to come.

1033
01:35:14,221 --> 01:35:16,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be the six o'clock tomorrow evening.

1034
01:35:17,918 --> 01:35:20,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1035
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1036
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,921
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1037
01:35:24,061 --> 01:35:24,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1038
01:35:24,621 --> 01:35:26,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1039
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:28,543
[SPEAKER_02]: 17.496 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1040
01:35:29,084 --> 01:35:37,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss scheduled work and blasting hours for the construction work located on Winthrop Street.

1041
01:35:38,308 --> 01:35:39,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1042
01:35:39,629 --> 01:35:40,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1043
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:44,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how much my fellow colleagues love to discuss.

1044
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:46,973
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, the last piece is that the, um,

1045
01:35:47,642 --> 01:35:54,923
[SPEAKER_12]: the blasting that was conducted, I believe, last week over at the new site on the ledge over on Winthrop Street.

1046
01:35:57,304 --> 01:36:11,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving forward, I know that, I believe that it's the fire chief in his department that issues the permits, and I believe they notify, is it their department that notifies the neighborhood?

1047
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they have a detail there also.

1048
01:36:13,626 --> 01:36:16,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, so I just wanted to make sure that

1049
01:36:17,186 --> 01:36:23,467
[SPEAKER_12]: As I made my phone calls, from what I gathered, there will be more blasting down the line.

1050
01:36:23,547 --> 01:36:31,809
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can, if we could just ask the chief, making sure that the school department was notified.

1051
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:43,231
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Six Acres, with today's crazy world that we live in, that they know when they hear that type of work going on, that something's happening.

1052
01:36:43,271 --> 01:36:46,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing is the timeline, when that's going to happen.

1053
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:52,734
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that some of the residents are a few senior residents that like to sleep in a little bit.

1054
01:36:53,094 --> 01:36:55,195
[SPEAKER_12]: We're woken with a big boom.

1055
01:36:55,736 --> 01:37:03,721
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, if we can just make sure that, uh, everybody again is notified with any upcoming blasting if that, that needs to occur.

1056
01:37:04,121 --> 01:37:04,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1057
01:37:04,702 --> 01:37:05,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1058
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:07,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1059
01:37:07,663 --> 01:37:13,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I just, uh, would like to amend the paper to request that the notice be given no less than 48 hours in advance.

1060
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:17,171
[SPEAKER_02]: As amended by Councilor Knight.

1061
01:37:19,712 --> 01:37:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1062
01:37:25,934 --> 01:37:26,674
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1063
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:28,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1064
01:37:32,776 --> 01:37:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take hands, papers in the hands of the clerk.

1065
01:37:39,419 --> 01:37:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1066
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1067
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Our motion passes.

1068
01:37:44,601 --> 01:37:45,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved.

1069
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1070
01:37:49,423 --> 01:38:00,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council wish Michael and Sheila McGlynn a warm and heartfelt congratulations on the momentous occasion of their 40th anniversary.

1071
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:01,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1072
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

1073
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:13,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing former Mayor McGlynn and his wife Sheila a very happy and exciting

1109
01:40:37,993 --> 01:40:40,094

1110
01:40:41,154 --> 01:40:47,256
[SPEAKER_14]: It's directly behind the Sunoco from Riverside, and it leads to the Fellsway.

1111
01:40:47,996 --> 01:40:56,339
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have done gas utility work there back, and I believe it was finished in October, November of last year.

1112
01:40:56,959 --> 01:41:00,840
[SPEAKER_14]: A small portion behind the Sunoco station was repaved.

1113
01:41:01,475 --> 01:41:06,436
[SPEAKER_14]: And the rest of the street that was dug up is still gullies and potholes, Mr. President.

1114
01:41:07,176 --> 01:41:26,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that the city engineer report back to us immediately on the status of the street, when it's going to be repaved curb to curb, and why is it taking so long, Mr. President, on a stretch of road that may be 100 yards, 250 yards, why is it taking so long, Mr. President, to put that

1115
01:41:31,582 --> 01:41:33,983
[SPEAKER_14]: street back to the condition it was originally found.

1116
01:41:34,343 --> 01:41:35,384

01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,926

1119
01:41:39,946 --> 01:41:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask this matter be added to next week's agenda as well when we request that the city engineer come prepared to discuss this matter.

1120
01:41:46,789 --> 01:41:47,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1121
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor, if I could amend that to also repair the sidewalks that were damaged during that work also.

1122
01:41:58,535 --> 01:42:00,456
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Vice President Marks.

1123
01:42:01,335 --> 01:42:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: as amended by Councilor Knight and President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1124
01:42:06,316 --> 01:42:07,016
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1125
01:42:08,097 --> 01:42:09,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1126
01:42:10,057 --> 01:42:16,439

1127
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:21,260

1128
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:22,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

1129
01:42:23,341 --> 01:42:24,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1130
01:42:24,481 --> 01:42:28,722
[SPEAKER_14]: The sidewalk in front of 39 Stearns Avenue had utility work some time back

1131
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:41,187
[SPEAKER_14]: For whatever reason, the utility company left after the work was completed and the sidewalk was never restored, Mr. President, which creates a slip and fall hazard in that particular area.

1132
01:42:41,528 --> 01:42:49,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that the sidewalk in front of 39 Stearns Ave be replaced immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

01:42:49,352 --> 01:42:49,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

01:42:55,682 --> 01:42:56,723
[SPEAKER_04]: on the agenda this evening.

1137
01:42:56,763 --> 01:43:02,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd request that this matter be added to next week's agenda with the city engineer, and we'd request that the city engineer be prepared to discuss it next week as well.

1138
01:43:03,167 --> 01:43:03,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1139
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion by Vice President Marx as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1141
01:43:10,352 --> 01:43:10,852

01:43:11,412 --> 01:43:12,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Offered by Vice President Marx be it resolved that the debris from the catch basin located at the corner of 2nd and Middlesex Avenue

1144
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:25,966

1145
01:43:26,606 --> 01:43:27,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

1146
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1147
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:36,029
[SPEAKER_14]: The state was out within the last several weeks cleaning the catch basins on state roads.

1148
01:43:36,849 --> 01:43:49,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the corner of Middlesex and Second Street, they cleaned out the catch basin, threw it on the sidewalk, the dirt and debris, and never picked up the dirt and debris.

1149
01:43:49,493 --> 01:43:50,493
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's sitting out there.

1150
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:52,654
[SPEAKER_14]: It smells awful, Mr. President.

1151
01:43:53,033 --> 01:43:53,914
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks awful.

1152
01:43:54,714 --> 01:43:57,717
[SPEAKER_14]: And I put in a request to our state delegation.

1153
01:43:58,477 --> 01:43:59,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully they'll attend to it.

1154
01:44:00,178 --> 01:44:10,246
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, Mr. President, I realize it's on a state road, but it's still a road that has residents, taxpaying residents of this community.

1155
01:44:10,626 --> 01:44:19,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that our DPW go out there, Mr. President, and clean up whatever was left behind by this particular contractor.

1156
01:44:19,734 --> 01:44:21,055
[SPEAKER_14]: in the interest of public safety.

1157
01:44:21,115 --> 01:44:30,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the corner of second street and Middlesex F. Thank you, Mr. Vice president on the motion by vice president marks seconded by council on a knife.

1158
01:44:31,483 --> 01:44:32,223
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor.

1159
01:44:33,204 --> 01:44:34,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1160
01:44:39,629 --> 01:44:44,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have anything else to do with that.

1161
01:44:44,212 --> 01:44:47,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is something the council voted on a few weeks ago.

1162
01:44:47,055 --> 01:44:47,355
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a,

1163
01:44:48,974 --> 01:44:58,196
[SPEAKER_09]: response on 17383, where we asked for council litigation monies.

1164
01:44:59,036 --> 01:45:07,218
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor responded, the council legislative budget currently has approximately 4,300 available funds and other expense accounts that could be used for legal fees.

1165
01:45:11,559 --> 01:45:17,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to move that we take a vote to transfer these funds into, obviously, that account.

1166
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:22,013
[SPEAKER_09]: for obviously that's all she's going to give us right now, so.

1167
01:45:22,754 --> 01:45:23,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scapoli.

1168
01:45:23,715 --> 01:45:24,635
[SPEAKER_12]: All set, thank you.

1169
01:45:25,256 --> 01:45:27,058
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Long-Tam.

1170
01:45:27,078 --> 01:45:32,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that should be okay to get us through the next several months because the motion is pending.

1171
01:45:44,048 --> 01:45:50,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Your ordinary expense stuff is going to be, you know, you don't have anything for your budgets, you know, all that, just to let you know.

1172
01:45:52,432 --> 01:45:53,012
Okay.

1173
01:45:53,893 --> 01:45:55,373
[SPEAKER_04]: One information comes to mind.

1174
01:45:55,453 --> 01:46:05,558
[SPEAKER_04]: What impact would this have on our ability to meet our requirements in posting in the newspapers, so on and so forth, if we exhaust our ordinary expense account?

1175
01:46:08,196 --> 01:46:10,218
[SPEAKER_05]: As required by the law.

1176
01:46:10,338 --> 01:46:12,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The advertising budget comes out of the clerk's budget.

1177
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:21,866
[SPEAKER_05]: What it is, is that all your meeting expenses that you're going to have for budgets and stuff like that, you won't have any funds available for that.

1178
01:46:21,886 --> 01:46:28,411
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't have any supplies coming up, which is all this paper that you get.

1179
01:46:28,451 --> 01:46:29,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Letterhead.

1180
01:46:30,053 --> 01:46:30,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Business cards.

1181
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:31,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's free.

1182
01:46:38,062 --> 01:46:39,302
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1183
01:46:39,322 --> 01:46:46,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we should hold off on the vote and we should ask, um, let her know, let the mayor know that we, we need some of that money for come budget time.

1184
01:46:46,744 --> 01:46:55,625
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously our ordinary expenses are used for that legal fund and see if we can get some money just to hold us over for six months because discovery.

1185
01:46:55,645 --> 01:47:03,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I did speak to the mayor and I think she was going to give us enough money to hold us over to the budget time.

1186
01:47:05,097 --> 01:47:07,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Was she considering it this though, I think.

1187
01:47:07,319 --> 01:47:07,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1188
01:47:07,559 --> 01:47:12,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, and then we'll revisit, uh, and that'll be in the next budget.

1189
01:47:13,523 --> 01:47:17,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1190
01:47:17,046 --> 01:47:21,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, normally, normally when our budget debates start, the first item that we discuss is the legislative budget.

1191
01:47:21,529 --> 01:47:22,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to get our budget books.

1192
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:25,291
[SPEAKER_04]: You said hopefully by Tuesday for next week's meeting.

1193
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:25,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1194
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:26,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so,

1195
01:47:28,015 --> 01:47:35,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can set up the meeting for the legislative portion of the budget ASAP because once that's submitted to us, that's the budget.

1196
01:47:35,638 --> 01:47:41,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get that wrapped up and potentially maybe get an increase in funds there if it's not already included there.

1197
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you want to hold that tool?

1198
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:44,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1199
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:49,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could, while we're discussing the budget, we're going to plan on doing like a school budget.

1200
01:47:49,865 --> 01:47:50,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1201
01:47:50,445 --> 01:47:53,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But on that, are we going to plan on just for scheduling purposes?

1202
01:47:53,306 --> 01:47:54,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to be thinking the week of the 12th?

1203
01:47:54,926 --> 01:48:01,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after the meeting, if we could talk about it before we, before we go home this evening, if we could just stay a second and we can talk about that.

1204
01:48:01,507 --> 01:48:02,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1205
01:48:02,107 --> 01:48:03,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1206
01:48:03,267 --> 01:48:04,988
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1207
01:48:06,328 --> 01:48:07,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1208
01:48:07,728 --> 01:48:17,750
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can, before we go to the records, if my council members can indulge me, I know that there's a couple of, um, um, announcements, uh, multi-use path project.

1209
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:18,510
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be a meeting.

1210
01:48:19,233 --> 01:48:22,614
[SPEAKER_12]: on Thursday, June 8th, 7 to 8.30 at the Andrews Middle School.

1211
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:28,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that that's been a very interesting topic all over our community.

1212
01:48:28,156 --> 01:48:44,121
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a connector for, this is so the meetings at DCI will present and obtain feedback on concept design, alternatives to this clipper ship connector, a proposed multi-use pathway to be located along the north bank of the Mystic River, downstream of Method Square.

1213
01:48:44,761 --> 01:48:46,302
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a very important meeting.

1214
01:48:46,342 --> 01:48:47,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to give everybody

1215
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:53,784
[SPEAKER_12]: a little extra time to make sure they're involved in such an important meeting.

1216
01:48:54,384 --> 01:49:01,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that the residents of Ship Ave were very concerned about being notified for these meetings.

1217
01:49:01,247 --> 01:49:02,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very important that they hear it.

1218
01:49:04,469 --> 01:49:10,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, talking to the residents, one of the biggest issues, the path being so close to

1219
01:49:11,283 --> 01:49:12,624
[SPEAKER_12]: their decks and backyards.

1220
01:49:13,024 --> 01:49:25,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to make sure that the DCR, one of his, one of their proposals might be a, a, a path moved all the way to the water.

1221
01:49:25,371 --> 01:49:29,213
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's actually over the mystic.

1222
01:49:29,273 --> 01:49:34,856
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's something they've done down the line down the road near assembly row.

1223
01:49:35,336 --> 01:49:37,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's really, really nice addition.

1224
01:49:37,657 --> 01:49:39,338
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I think that might give,

1225
01:49:39,799 --> 01:49:45,440
[SPEAKER_12]: the residents that freedom and that they were asking for, for privacy.

1226
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:49,781
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's one that I wanted to make sure.

1227
01:49:50,261 --> 01:50:03,343
[SPEAKER_12]: The other, I know that my, a few months back, former president Dello Russo pointed me to the mayor for the recreation commission, recreation focus group.

1228
01:50:03,843 --> 01:50:07,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm proud to say that the pilot program is,

1229
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:33,918
[SPEAKER_12]: out and for print and online for all of our residents to now, um, sign up for a summer recreation programs, which, uh, have sports and arts and adventures in space programs, Lego programs, and, uh, detailed times where now, uh, the city administration has changed, uh, where we can purchase our pool and pond passes.

1230
01:50:34,778 --> 01:50:37,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, so it's more accessible for our constituents.

1231
01:50:38,145 --> 01:50:39,846
[SPEAKER_12]: and so on and so forth.

1232
01:50:39,886 --> 01:50:42,287
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot of detail and work that was done.

1233
01:50:42,307 --> 01:50:53,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, you know, special thanks to Joe Russo, Allie Fisk from the mayor's office, did a great job for all the countless meetings for the last eight months.

1234
01:50:53,451 --> 01:51:03,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Julia Damon and Rachel Perry, who have been instrumental getting these programs in place so our residents can now register.

1235
01:51:05,018 --> 01:51:11,342
[SPEAKER_12]: We will be having meetings soon and discussion for a full-time program that the mail will present to us.

1236
01:51:12,703 --> 01:51:17,566
[SPEAKER_12]: We're now meeting talking about job descriptions and mission statements.

1237
01:51:17,626 --> 01:51:19,187
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's pretty exciting.

1238
01:51:19,387 --> 01:51:27,553
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we heard our constituents cry out and say that they really needed and wanted it.

1239
01:51:27,733 --> 01:51:31,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm glad to say that it's happening and it's right in front of us.

1240
01:51:31,275 --> 01:51:33,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So please start registering for your programs.

1241
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:40,089
[SPEAKER_12]: And send any questions or concerns our way so we can move things forward.

1242
01:51:40,309 --> 01:51:40,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1243
01:51:40,969 --> 01:51:42,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all your hard work on that.

1244
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:43,931
[SPEAKER_04]: You did an outstanding job.

1245
01:51:44,871 --> 01:51:45,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1246
01:51:45,792 --> 01:51:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1247
01:51:47,093 --> 01:51:49,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank my colleagues for indulging me this evening as well.

1248
01:51:50,774 --> 01:51:57,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Team Medford in the Office of Outreach and Substance Abuse Preventage, Mr. President, has done a great job over the past year.

1249
01:51:58,353 --> 01:52:02,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Just last year, we funded their office, and since that time, they've made great strides.

1250
01:52:03,377 --> 01:52:09,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Just last year in the city of Medford, there were 19 opiate-related overdose deaths in 02155, Mr. President.

1251
01:52:09,862 --> 01:52:21,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And through the work of Penny Funny Alley, our outreach coordinator, and through the work of Paul Spencer, one of the citizens in the city of Medford who's been helping out with her office, they're doing what's called hidden in plain sight, Mr. President.

1252
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:22,851
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a training for parents.

1253
01:52:23,945 --> 01:52:28,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And right next door to the council chambers, actually, we have what's set up, it looks like a high school kid's bedroom.

1254
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:36,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And they teach you what to look for and where to look for illicit substances in your home if you feel as though your child may be experimenting or abusing drugs.

1255
01:52:36,515 --> 01:52:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to let everyone out there know that this program will be running through the end of the week.

1256
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:45,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anyone would like to set up an appointment that they can give the Substance Abuse Office a call at 393-2408.

1257
01:52:47,712 --> 01:52:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be happy to speak with you and let you know when they're going to be meeting down there.

1258
01:52:51,294 --> 01:52:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this is a great step and a great stride, Mr. President, in helping parents identify and cope with the issue of addiction in the community.

1259
01:52:58,258 --> 01:53:02,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've done an excellent job in breaking the stigma that's associated with addiction here in Medford.

1260
01:53:03,021 --> 01:53:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to thank them for their work and really appreciate what they've done and how they're going about doing it.

1261
01:53:08,685 --> 01:53:11,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you to Penny and Paul and the rest of Team Medford.

1262
01:53:11,636 --> 01:53:15,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but this hidden in plain sights, it's really something I was in there early this evening.

1263
01:53:15,518 --> 01:53:15,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too.

1264
01:53:16,018 --> 01:53:17,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, Councilor Marks was in there.

1265
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:20,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at a very good, very, very good job.

1266
01:53:21,221 --> 01:53:21,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1267
01:53:21,582 --> 01:53:21,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1268
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:22,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Meetings.

1269
01:53:24,543 --> 01:53:26,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco.

1270
01:53:27,425 --> 01:53:28,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one more announcement.

1271
01:53:28,865 --> 01:53:34,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this Saturday night, June 3rd at the Chevalier theater is the Medford high school band fundraiser.

1272
01:53:35,549 --> 01:53:39,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the, uh, the theme is a night, a night on Broadway.

1273
01:53:40,012 --> 01:53:40,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and the, uh,

1274
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:42,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Tickets are pretty inexpensive.

1275
01:53:42,938 --> 01:53:47,159
[SPEAKER_08]: They're $15 for an adult, $10 for a student, but all the money goes to the high school band.

1276
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:55,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe they have a competition maybe coming up in Florida, and I think they're trying to raise funds, so if anyone can make it, that'd be greatly appreciated.

1277
01:53:56,141 --> 01:53:58,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it'll be a great show, so thank you.

1278
01:53:59,322 --> 01:54:00,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1279
01:54:00,562 --> 01:54:01,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox.

1280
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:11,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mr. President, this Thursday evening is senior prom night at Medford High School, and I want to wish all our seniors a safe

1281
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,841
[SPEAKER_14]: an enjoyable prom night, Mr. President.

1282
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:15,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1283
01:54:16,223 --> 01:54:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lococoon?

1284
01:54:18,224 --> 01:54:20,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunday is Medford Day, behind, I believe, the Andrews.

1285
01:54:21,065 --> 01:54:21,646
[SPEAKER_09]: One to four.

1286
01:54:21,866 --> 01:54:22,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's invited.

1287
01:54:22,866 --> 01:54:24,167
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great time last year.

1288
01:54:24,407 --> 01:54:25,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Hundreds of people.

1289
01:54:25,648 --> 01:54:27,449
[SPEAKER_09]: A number of different events for the whole family.

[SPEAKER_09]: So, hopefully people will join us.

1291
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:30,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1292
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:31,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?

1293
01:54:31,091 --> 01:54:32,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more public service?

1294
01:54:34,613 --> 01:54:36,514
[SPEAKER_02]: The record is we're past the council at night.

1295
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1296
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:40,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight finds the records in order, Mr. President.

1297
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:41,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Move for approval thereof.

1298
01:54:43,201 --> 01:54:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for an adjournment.

1299
01:54:46,262 --> 01:54:47,022
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1300
01:54:48,883 --> 01:54:48,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1301
01:54:49,684 --> 01:54:50,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.
