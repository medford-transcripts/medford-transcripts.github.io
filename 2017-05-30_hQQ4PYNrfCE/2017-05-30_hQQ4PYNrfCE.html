    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=552.293s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=554.814s">I</a>  did receive an email complaining about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=558.455s">I</a>  think the stop sign was left in the middle of the street and a resident of Medford had to move it over to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=564.758s">I</a>  did contact the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=567.278s">They</a>  said they would take care of it and <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=569.568s">I</a>  wanted to just get an update on that, because after they said they'd take care of it, I think there was just a cone on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=574.551s">So</a>  I've been noticing a lot of cones and big barrels in different places around the city, and I'm not sure if that means, I'm assuming that means we're getting to it, but obviously that stop sign needs to go up where it needs to go, or it needs to be taken off the side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=591.522s">Public</a>  safety issues, obviously, when you have things either in the middle of the street or the side of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=596.646s">So</a>  if we just could get an update with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=599.15s">when</a>  this is going to be reinstalled or removed, that would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1039.511s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1041.192s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1042.253s">Robert</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1044.994s">Through</a>  the Chair, thank you, Councilor Alango-Kern, for taking this out of order under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1051.877s">I</a>  don't want to seem, you know, selfish about Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1056.058s">coming</a>  up here again because I know there's a lot of streets and sub water and gas systems across Medford that need to be looked at, but I'm a little disheartened before this body tonight to come and speak on this matter yet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1074.143s">Through</a>  the administration's office, through the DPW, a letter came out saying that contracts would go out in May, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1084.549s">for</a>  the work that needs to be done on Evan Street that members of this body have said in the past is in the top five of worst condition streets in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1096.698s">When</a>  that letter came out, it prompted some City Councilors, when they saw it, in good faith, to tell neighbours of mine and myself that work is going to be done this spring <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1109.338s">specifically</a>  this May. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1111.259s">So</a>  a week and a half ago, one of my neighbors, Mr. Rob McGuire, knowing how often I come to the council meetings and discussions I have with the honorable members of this body, asked me point blank on Facebook, hey, well, my nickname's Booch, hey Booch, when are they gonna do the repairs on Evans Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1131.33s">So</a>  I said, I'm not sure, I only know what we were told, what you were told. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1136.313s">And</a>  then another neighbour of mine in the discussion on Facebook posted the picture of the letter that came out, and it was said that last week somebody was going to bring it up for discussion on this body, and for whatever reason, probably a good reason, it didn't come up for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1152.159s">And</a>  I was going to speak last week on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1154.059s">So</a>  the next day, last Wednesday, after work, I came right to City Hall, and I went into the engineer's office, Cassandra, and I asked point blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1163.282s">Neighbours</a>  are asking me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1164.523s">We</a>  were told. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1165.675s">that</a>  work was going to be done this spring, this May. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1169.176s">She</a>  told me, and this is no offence, but these are the slow wheels of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1175.318s">Medford</a>  has been waiting over six decades, not Medford, but Evans Street, for repairs that really need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1183.34s">We</a>  had a water pipe that burst just before Christmas, this past Christmas, on Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1189.758s">But</a>  what the engineer told me, who also I know is constrained by a lot of projects that are going on, but what she said was, I'm finalizing the contract now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1199.723s">Then</a>  it goes to the purchaser's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1201.764s">Once</a>  it gets approved there, then it goes out for bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1204.765s">Then</a>  once the bids come in, the mayor has to choose the best one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1209.227s">So</a>  I said, well, my neighbors are asking me, when is this work going to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1213.349s">Possibly</a>  July. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1215.007s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President, but with all due respect, I really don't see it happening this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1220.728s">And</a>  now you have to account for there's 26 houses, four on the corner, that's 30 houses, paying at least $1,200 in property taxes, paying God knows what in water taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1233.61s">Even</a>  the people that rent there, their rent's going up because of property taxes, the surcharges on property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1239.451s">We're</a>  paying a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1242.112s">I</a>  did a ballpark figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1244.059s">We're</a>  talking over six decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1245.76s">We're</a>  talking millions of dollars in taxes from this one street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1249.422s">Uh,</a>  I'm here tonight to tell you that I spoke to my fellow residents and, uh, I'm not even here to ask for the work to be done anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1259.787s">Mr.</a>  President, uh, a year and a half ago, this administration ran on a promised on her platform that she was going to dust off the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1270.59s">A</a>  year and a half later, Mr. President, there's another inch of dust on the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1275.715s">The</a>  citizens on Evans street are disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1278.697s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1281.76s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1282.941s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1285.083s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1285.383s">I</a>  guess I just want to speak in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1288.166s">I</a>  think a number of us Councilors have brought up Evans street and I believe it was last spring and even before that, that we started complaining about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1295.752s">And</a>  last spring when a number of residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1297.941s">came</a>  before us begging, I mean, basically begging for some relief on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1303.123s">Children,</a>  who I see in the audience today, can't even ride their bikes without, I mean, when I drove down it after I got the complaints, it's like torn up with rocks and it's unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1314.928s">And</a>  we were told it was gonna be done by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1317.409s">I</a>  did reach out to the city engineer on the 8th of May just to ask for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1322.911s">I</a>  was told that Evans is in queue for later this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1327.323s">as</a>  we need to replace the water main first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1329.624s">So</a>  that's the information I got on the 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1332.365s">I'm</a>  hoping sooner than later this year, what seems is you're getting information that it's going to be done sooner than the end of the year, which would be great if it could be done by July. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1341.768s">But</a>  how many times, you know, can we be told, just keep being pushed off and pushed off when it's, top five, I think it's one of the worst streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1351.391s">I</a>  think it might be top one or two in Medford from me just driving around and witnessing what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1357.675s">And</a>  I just think we need some definite answers, and that needs to come from the mayor's office, who's going to be footing the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1364.837s">The</a>  engineer is probably doing what she needs to do, and she's being responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1369.538s">Obviously,</a>  July is better, kind of, than the answer I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1372.538s">But</a>  what is, you know, really, when is it going to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1375.199s">When</a>  is the bid going to be accepted, and are we going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1378.6s">And</a>  I think that's something we all need to demand come a few weeks from now when we are asked for a vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1384.948s">I</a>  mean, we all need to think about a number of different things, including Evans Street, before we can vote on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1390.41s">And</a>  I think the potholes and painted striping of our streets and the sunken manholes that aren't taken care of needs to be priority number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1397.673s">It's</a>  a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1399.793s">You</a>  know?</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1401.274s">If</a>  you drive around the corner on Pinkett Street, the potholes there, you have to navigate around them to not put damage on your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1411.618s">The</a>  potholes on Evans Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1413.302s">I</a>  mean, there were baseball size rocks coming out of the, out of the gravel, out of the street.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1419.087s">I've</a>  been by there next Tuesday night at six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1422.31s">We</a>  will be having a council, the whole meeting with the city engineer on a lot of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1427.895s">And</a>  I urge you to come to that meeting at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1432.699s">There's</a>  a lot of disappointed people on Evans street and this is my name.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1435.881s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1438.023s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1438.884s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1440.984s">I</a>  was here last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1444.667s">I</a>  think it was around this same time and I was told the exact same thing about the budget and approving the budget and not approving a certain amount of money for her until she said that and we're here a year later and it's still exactly the same and I keep hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1469.625s">later</a>  on this year, later on this year, next spring, next spring, and here we are, and it's summertime, and we're hearing later on this year, and then we're hearing July, and it's been, I've lived on that street for 41 years, and that street hasn't been repaved, and I, she said it, I have an eight-year-old daughter, she can't ride her bike, I have to put a bike rack on the back of my car and drive her to the bike path for her to ride her bike, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1496.876s">In</a>  that neighborhood, because the rocks are on the sidewalk, the rocks are on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1500.56s">Pinkett</a>  Street is probably worse than Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1503.943s">I'm</a>  sorry for saying that, because I live on Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1506.245s">But</a>  Pinkett Street is pretty bad, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1507.567s">You</a>  can't ride your bike in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1509.108s">And</a>  I don't know what has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1513.773s">How</a>  do you get the street fixed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1515.674s">How</a>  do you get the street fixed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1516.876s">And</a>  everybody, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1519.658s">except</a>  for him, said that it's really bad, it's a really bad street, so everybody knows that it's really bad, aside from whoever's on C-Click Fix checking it off as repaired, because it's the furthest thing from repaired, but everybody knows that it's really bad.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1534.912s">And</a>  I... And you were promised that it was gonna be fixed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1538.375s">For</a>  a long time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1540.557s">For</a>  a long time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1541.278s">So,</a>  I don't know what else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1544.21s">to</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1544.65s">I</a>  don't think anybody, I asked my neighbors, I asked my really sweet neighbors if they wanted to come and they don't want to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1550.452s">They</a>  don't want to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1551.073s">They</a>  don't want to deal with it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1552.393s">They,</a>  they, they, they gave up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1554.514s">They,</a>  they gave up and that's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1557.795s">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1559.496s">Yeah,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1563.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1563.878s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1564.718s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1566.079s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1567.539s">And</a>  I'd like to thank Mr. Capucci and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1570.16s">Smith</a>  for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1571.961s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1573.393s">On</a>  St. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1573.693s">Patrick's</a>  Day, 3-17-17, we received a response to paper 17209 from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1579.574s">And</a>  this paper clearly said that the contract will be in place in mid-May, and construction will proceed with the schedule thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1586.375s">Now,</a>  we put this paper initially on the agenda in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1592.337s">And</a>  I'm at a loss to figure out how long it takes to get the contract in place, but this all should have been done well before the construction season started, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1600.582s">And</a>  not a week goes by now that I don't scratch my head and wonder what's going on inside that engineering office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1606.063s">I</a>  really have significant concerns about the way that that office is being managed and what's going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1611.864s">For</a>  us to have to wait 18 months for a response to a paper, for residents to have to wait six, seven, eight, nine months for a contract just to go out so that the work can be done that they said they've been scheduling for three years is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1624.386s">And</a>  I'm not one to go out on these rants, Mr. President, about the administration not doing this and not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1629.127s">That's</a>  not my style. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1630.311s">But</a>  enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1631.952s">This</a>  office has got to keep its eyes on the prize, because the engineering office is far too vital to the delivery of the requisite services that we're here to provide, to be asleep at the switch.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1646.645s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1650.148s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1651.529s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1654.897s">I</a>  just want to go on the record, too, that Parris Street was also listed as a street that was supposed to be addressed this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1662.543s">I</a>  wouldn't get into a debate about what street is worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1665.745s">I</a>  think on our side of Medford, we have a lot of very, what I call, depressed streets that haven't really been attended to, the street nor the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1677.634s">There's</a>  a hole that has been in front of my house for 46 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1682.357s">We</a>  haven't been able to, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1684.283s">kind</a>  of laughable, but it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1686.345s">It</a>  keeps getting larger and larger and larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1689.128s">Our</a>  elderly community on our street cannot walk down the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1693.792s">It's</a>  abhorrent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1695.594s">And</a>  often when we attend these dialogues and discussions about development, we hear these developers tell us that our neighbourhoods are depressed and blighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1706.207s">It</a>  really boils down to our streets not being able to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1710.55s">So</a>  I know we've got a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1713.191s">I'd</a>  ask that you consider Paris Street and maybe a few more of those surrounding streets in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1720.516s">It's</a>  been quite a while since they've been attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1725.118s">And</a>  I think it would go a long way for a number of elderly people we have, as well as mobily challenged folks in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1735.04s">You</a>  know, our area of Medford, I think the last time I checked, we have like 45% of the people who live in North and East Medford that are senior and disabled and lower income. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1747.747s">So</a>  it's harder for them to get around because not all of them do have cars and they like to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1752.49s">So</a>  again, I know you've got a meeting coming up Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1756.192s">I'd</a>  like to attend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1757.633s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to that dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1760.695s">But</a>  if you could consider our area as well, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1763.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1764.639s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1766.48s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1768.18s">And,</a>  you know, it's a shame when you have to have residents come up over and over again on the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1775.302s">And</a>  it's even more of a shame, Mr. President, when department heads tell residents that something's going to be done and then there's no follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1783.877s">You</a>  know, sometimes the schedule doesn't work according to how it was planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1788.478s">And</a>  all you need to do is reach back out to residents and say, you know what, I might have told you it was May, but now because of the RFP or whatever went through, it took us a little longer, now we're looking at July or August. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1799.841s">And</a>  I think residents would feel happy that the communication was there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1804.962s">I</a>  think what happens is the fact that there is a lack of communication, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1809.543s">The</a>  fact, Mr. President, that this council has been asking for a master plan from this mayor for the past year and a half, a master plan, Mr. President, not because we want a master plan for the sake of a master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1823.909s">It's</a>  to address issues like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1826.27s">Within</a>  a master plan, you would have someone that would go out and do a street audit and say, what are the top <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1833.053s">Dozen</a>  streets, two dozen streets, three dozen streets that need to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1837.779s">When</a>  is the last time they were repaired or resurfaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1840.643s">You</a>  heard from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1841.344s">White</a>  that mentioned she's been on the street for 41 years, four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1846.41s">That</a>  street has never been repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1849.334s">And</a>  I'm referring to Evans Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1852.509s">And</a>  I really think, Mr. President, the fact that we don't have any type of master plan, the fact is that we don't have a full assessment of our streets, we're always chasing our tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1864.685s">We</a>  can't even keep track. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1866.227s">We're</a>  talking about repaving roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1868.03s">We</a>  can't even fill potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1871.323s">Forget</a>  about repaving roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1872.684s">We</a>  can't even do the basic fundamentals of filling potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1876.406s">Our</a>  staff is so undersized in the DPW that we can't even stay on top of a basic, basic city service. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1886.25s">And</a>  then people are coming up asking about their roads, and they're very right, Mr. President, as Mr. Capucci mentioned, paying tens of thousands of dollars in property tax, and you have to look out and see your street look like Beirut, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1902.451s">You</a>  get small potholes that could be swimming pools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1908.336s">It's</a>  unacceptable, rocks that could get kicked up when a car drives over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1913.28s">It's</a>  a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1915.781s">And</a>  it's not, if it was one or two streets, I'd say, you know what, we're in pretty good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1919.524s">We're</a>  seven square miles, we're a big city, we're in good condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1923.107s">It's</a>  not one or two streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1925.709s">It's</a>  almost every street in the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1928.932s">And</a>  we have no game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1934.294s">You</a>  know, I attend events, Mr. President, and you see the mayor walking around with all her assistants. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1939.877s">Rather</a>  than have a pen and paper in their hand, taking down notes when people say, I need my street done, they have a camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1946.701s">Because</a>  all they want to do is capture the mayor with a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1950.643s">They're</a>  not looking for anything else, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1952.784s">They</a>  don't want to hear your gripes or your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1954.905s">They</a>  want to capture the mayor at events by taking her picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1958.927s">That's</a>  what we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1960.028s">We</a>  have a photo op mayor that walks around and only looking for a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1964.672s">when</a>  the real nitty gritty needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1967.975s">If</a>  we can't provide basic city services in this city, we might as well lock the door at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1974.78s">We</a>  might as well lock it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1978.343s">I'm</a>  equally as disappointed with this administration, and you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1983.127s">When</a>  a department's not doing their job, I'll call them out, and I've been doing it for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1987.31s">But</a>  as I stated before, a fish rots from the head down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=1991.568s">And</a>  if you want to look at who's not doing their job, Mr. President, and who ultimately is responsible, the chief executive officer of this community that runs the day-to-day operations, it's the mayor of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2005.895s">I'm</a>  not going to point fingers at departments that are a shell of departments that barely have enough staff to do a day's worth of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2014.239s">It</a>  comes from the top, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2017.381s">You</a>  know, and I'd ask our council liaison <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2020.883s">that</a>  the mayor appointed, but she happens not to be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2026.167s">Actually,</a>  she hasn't attended since she was appointed a year and a half now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2030.45s">The</a>  council liaison, someone that would be here to sit in the audience, go back to the mayor and say, Madam Mayor, this was brought up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2038.515s">This</a>  is the concerns at the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2040.376s">This</a>  is the concerns I heard from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2043.218s">That's</a>  why that position was made, Mr. President, to address issues like this and bring them to the mayor's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2050.461s">I</a>  realize the mayor can't be everywhere, and that's why she has assistance, Mr. President, to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2057.543s">This</a>  is what's rotten within this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2061.065s">And</a>  I'm tired of talking about we can't go on to new issues when we talk about the same old issues over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2068.2s">So</a>  I feel the residents' frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2070.301s">You</a>  know, I agree with Parrish Street and all the host of other streets, Mr. President, because I receive the phone calls and the emails, as we all do, when people say, what about my road? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2080.126s">What</a>  about my street? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2082.607s">And</a>  what do you tell them? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2084.128s">You</a>  tell them to call the mayor's office, and they laugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2087.13s">Say,</a>  I don't even get a call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2091.292s">Now,</a>  we have to be more, Mr. President, than just a sounding board, this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2095.514s">We</a>  have to be able to hold the mayor's feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2099.115s">And</a>  if people behind this reeling are going to give the mayor unconditional support all the time, that's why we're not getting anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2107.339s">That's</a>  why we're not holding the mayor's feet to the fire, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2111.941s">We</a>  have plenty of enablers behind this reel that allow this mayor to go off and do what she wants to do and then want to talk a big game after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2123.746s">Let's</a>  hold the mayor's feet to the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2125.446s">Let's</a>  hold her accountable to the job she was elected to do, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2129.98s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2130.801s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice president.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2132.762s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2134.064s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2135.265s">Um,</a>  and I also like to thank, uh, uh, Mr. Capucci for bringing this issue forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2140.589s">Um,</a>  I have been down in that neighborhood and a number, a number of times over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2144.773s">And,</a>  uh, the street is in deplorable condition and it's been like that for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2149.237s">And,</a>  uh, promises were made that this was going to be fixed and it's extremely disappointing that it seems like it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2157.253s">You</a>  know, it really might not even be on the radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2159.795s">I</a>  mean, it should be, but it seems like nothing's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2163.297s">And,</a>  you know, it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2166.139s">It</a>  needs to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2167.08s">And</a>  I, too, question why is it delayed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2170.222s">Why</a>  is it being delayed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2171.243s">What</a>  has happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2172.824s">And</a>  when is the work going to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2174.425s">And</a>  what exactly is going to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2177.187s">So</a>  if we could get an official correspondence back from the engineer's office, I'd like to see something officially from her basically telling us why it has been delayed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2186.615s">I</a>  think this will be something we'll discuss next Tuesday at the council meeting also.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2191.276s">I'm</a>  sure we will, but I want to see something in writing, something officially as to why it was delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2195.237s">And</a>  I want to find out when it's, when they plan on actually getting this kicked off and going in a process it has to go through because everyone should be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2205.299s">And</a>  you know, it was mentioned earlier communication and a lot of this comes down to communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2210.827s">And</a>  if they actually sent the memo to us saying, you know what, this was promised last year, but it's going to be delayed, at least when the calls come in, we can say, you know what, we received a communication back from the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2222.775s">This</a>  is going to be delayed because of reasons A, B, and C. But we haven't received anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2229.719s">And</a>  the neighbors haven't received any news. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2232.081s">And</a>  therefore, we're all kind of standing around looking at each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2235.343s">So</a>  a lot of it comes down to communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2239.508s">As</a>  far as this issue goes, there really hasn't been any, any communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2243.071s">So</a>  if we can get an official correspondence from the engineer's department with those details, I greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[George Rick Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2253.72s">Rec</a>  cycle 21 Ridgeway road method. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2256.602s">Uh,</a>  I wasn't going to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2258.003s">I</a>  just came down to, you know, witness the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2261.546s">Uh,</a>  but, uh, I'm going to go back a few years, just a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2267.611s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2269.565s">At</a>  one time we had a paper, it was called the Medford Mercury. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2273.528s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, every year the city would go out, like Councilor Marks would say, they'd go out and they'd gauge these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2284.214s">In</a>  other words, they prioritize what streets are going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2288.457s">For</a>  instance, not this year, not this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2291.659s">Fiscal</a>  year 2018, they knew five streets, five critical streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2299.526s">Those</a>  streets were published in the newspaper, and they were prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2306.01s">So</a>  the citizens on those streets, a year before the street was even going to be reconstructed, those citizens knew that they were going to be in for a new street, new sidewalks, whatever the construction is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2319.278s">That</a>  gave the administration plenty of time if they had to put a water line in, or they had to put a gas line in, or whatever they had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2326.282s">It</a>  seems today that the planning is like <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2330.255s">The</a>  cart is going before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2333.496s">They</a>  plan the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2334.376s">They</a>  get the street planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2335.416s">They</a>  go out and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2336.276s">And</a>  then about six months later, oh, we've got to put a water line in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2341.337s">Very</a>  frustrating, poor planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2344.558s">But</a>  I just wanted to bring up that this is the way the citizens of Medford knew where they stood with their streets, the condition of their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2354.879s">And</a>  it was a very simple thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2356.26s">I</a>  mean, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2358.532s">If</a>  I could ask the council now, do you know what the top five streets are in Medford that have to be paved? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2363.594s">Does</a>  anybody know the top five?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2365.035s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[George Rick Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2367.796s">Well,</a>  you're close. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2368.596s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2369.657s">You</a>  got the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2371.838s">I</a>  live on Ridgeway road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2372.758s">My</a>  streets, my streets in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2375.72s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2376.32s">Did</a>  you go up the top of fells F you know, fells F you know, fells F they tore that street up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2386.845s">It's</a>  washing away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2389.031s">Come</a>  down Fells Ave to Murray Hill, one hole on the left side, it's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2393.053s">It's</a>  all being washed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2394.935s">The</a>  contractor did a horrible job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2396.636s">Now</a>  where's the penalty there on these reconstructions on these streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2401.318s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2401.979s">That's</a>  another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2402.779s">I</a>  don't want to get into that, but that's something that the council maybe should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2407.902s">Maybe</a>  they should go back to the DPW, go back to the mayor's office and say, listen, when we do the budget, we want to know what streets are going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2416.591s">And</a>  we want to know not only what streets are going to be done, we want to know, number one, Evans is going to be number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2423.312s">Number</a>  two is going to be Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2424.933s">Number</a>  three, whatever, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2427.213s">That</a>  way you know, going into that budget meeting, five streets, $2 million, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2435.035s">And</a>  it gives everybody right up front what has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2438.776s">There's</a>  no going back saying, well, we're going to have to put in gas, we have to put in a water line, or whatever we have to do on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2445.225s">That</a>  also eliminates a lot of going back in and tearing up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2450.887s">It's</a>  called planning, master planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2453.288s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2454.508s">It</a>  might not include a building of a police station, but it's critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2458.25s">It's</a>  our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2461.411s">I</a>  mean, simple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2462.891s">I</a>  was just talking to the councilor tonight, go down Salem street, Fellsway to Medford, to Salem, all the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2471.174s">Not</a>  one crosswalk is striped. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2474.162s">Not</a>  one, you can't even see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2477.543s">That's</a>  our main street, highly visible, highly pedestrian areas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2485.147s">Simple</a>  little things, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2487.848s">So,</a>  I mean, I just wanna throw that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2490.429s">I</a>  don't know if you were aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2491.849s">Some</a>  of you councilors might've been aware of it, but there are things that you can do to make the citizens aware where they stand, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2500.653s">And</a>  it gives the citizens plenty of time <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2504.102s">to</a>  make any adjustments and contact the council, contact the mayor's office, the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2508.646s">It</a>  might be a street, a tree that has to be taken down or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2512.889s">It's</a>  called planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2514.21s">So</a>  that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2516.031s">I</a>  appreciate the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2517.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2520.32s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2525.524s">I</a>  just wanted to add one thought after hearing the gentleman before me speak so eloquently about planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2531.868s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2539.805s">Recognizing</a>  that budget is always a concern in this day and age and recognizing that some streets need to be put off. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2546.729s">If</a>  we could even be successful in our pothole repair, so currently what they'll do if you're fortunate enough to have a pothole filled, they'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2555.875s">They'll</a>  fill it and they'll tamp it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2558.436s">But</a>  that's not actually the right way to repair a pothole. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2561.258s">You're</a>  supposed to actually cut so many inches, a surgeon would call it the clear margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2566.841s">Cut</a>  so many inches and then you re-tamp and you fill with a square. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2571.383s">If</a>  we made those types of repairs, the roads would look less like patchwork and you'd feel potholes less because when they're patched, they'd be patched more appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2583.107s">And</a>  then the secondary and possibly more important thing we could do, and occasionally I hear it, <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2590.649s">when</a>  different developers step before you, when they fall under your purview, but what we should do overall is we should never let anybody who's opening our street open up a one-foot trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2602.732s">They</a>  need to open up a minimum width for a minimum duration so that they have the appropriate space to reset and tamp down <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2612.135s">put</a>  in the subsoil, put in the proper layers of the different products that are required depending upon where they're working at the right grade so that you don't wind up with the puddle and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2625.608s">And</a>  I can forward to all of you, some of you may be aware, but I'm happy to share with you some general links to help you get a little bit more up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2633.235s">But</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2635.317s">regardless</a>  of where we go with our repair of streets, we can do no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2641.947s">So</a>  when we open up our streets and we're working in our streets, if we require folks that are doing this work, and they know how to make those repairs because in other cities <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2650.86s">They</a>  wouldn't dare open up the street for a foot and a half for, you know, four or five feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2655.982s">They'd</a>  open it up properly and they'd, you know, reset to existing or better condition the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2664.206s">And</a>  they also wouldn't use hot top patches on the sidewalk where there's concrete, where we've had some upgrades done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2671.709s">I've</a>  noticed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2673.951s">I</a>  think it might have been NSTAR that did the gas upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2677.414s">They</a>  would cut out the street, the sidewalk, dig that hole out, and they wouldn't properly set the patch and put concrete back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2686.042s">They'd</a>  just tamp in hot top like someone was going to come later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2689.905s">And</a>  we've got some of those on Paris Street that go down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2693.328s">There's</a>  probably 30 or 40 of them at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2696.471s">Maybe</a>  even one for every single address where they tie into the different homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2700.48s">But</a>  those few measures don't really reside back with us, our budget, taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2707.448s">It</a>  resides to the projects that are being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2710.089s">And</a>  as a city, if we require those things, then our streets are gonna look better because we're requiring that people working in them maintain and return them to us in a condition that we're not gonna have to be doing repair work in two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2726.435s">So</a>  I just wanted to raise that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2727.716s">And</a>  if anyone's interested, I'm happy to share some of those links. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2730.337s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2730.597s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2731.537s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2732.598s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2734.158s">If</a>  we could just amend the paper and ask <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2736.572s">point</a>  blank to the mayor's office, will this be in this money for Evans Street and possibly Paris and Pinker, two other streets that we were promised, will this be in our next year's budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2749.098s">I</a>  think that's really just the ultimate answer that we need because I truly feel if the mayor's office wanted it done, they would have told the engineer's office to go out to bid months and months ago like we were promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2763.284s">And</a>  I think it's really unfortunate we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2765.721s">ask</a>  questions at this stage of the game, when in two weeks we're gonna be asked for a vote on a budget, and we haven't even seen any part of the budget whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2776.369s">And</a>  I think it's a little late for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hQQ4PYNrfCE&t=2777.87s">We're</a>  at the last meeting in May, and we haven't even, like you said last week, they won't even answer you.</p>
