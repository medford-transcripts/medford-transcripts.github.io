[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe before then, you can do some research and see what times the trucks are going to be delivering and unloading, just so even if we do want to extend your permit, we can

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,762
[SPEAKER_02]: assure the residents that live in those buildings that even though the hours of operations may Be 6 a.m.

00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:31,385

123
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:41,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor, and that's something we'd like to address, and that's one of the reasons we're extending through until September, so we can hear, better understand the concerns of our neighbors.

[SPEAKER_15]: You are hereby notified that the order of the Memphis City Council public hearing will be given at the Community Access Building in Memphit Heights, 489 Winthrop Street, Memphit, Mass, on Tuesday, August 15th, on a petition by Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, for permission to construct a line for such telecommunication under the public way of waste.

152
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:39,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have the representative from the petitioner have a brief synopsis

153
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,851
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

154
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:43,471
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

155
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:43,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

156
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

157
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

158
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:46,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

159
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave Llewellyn, Comcast, Woobin, Massachusetts.

160
00:09:50,553 --> 00:10:05,138
[SPEAKER_08]: This petition, Washington Street, will be starting at existing utility pole 5507, excavating in the sidewalk to place one four-inch PVC conduit 37 feet plus or minus to existing telephone manhole located in the sidewalk.

161
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

162
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this is a public hearing.

163
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone here to speak in favor of this?

164
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that be yourself?

165
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:12,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

166
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else in favor of this?

167
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:18,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the meeting closed.

168
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone that is against this?

169
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone not in favor?

170
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing closed.

171
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:30,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

172
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:32,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Del Rosso.

173
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:36,825
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could, through the chair, ask the petitioner, what is the purpose of this?

174
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a new, why do you have to do this?

175
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a new building?

176
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:51,930
[SPEAKER_08]: We're tying into the existing Verizon manhole that ties into the conduit system that we're already into to provide service to 53 Riverside Ave., which is the Middlesex Bank.

177
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

178
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

179
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:54,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Belko.

180
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,851
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

181
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:58,192
[SPEAKER_29]: Just a couple of quick questions.

182
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,128
[SPEAKER_29]: Just get a little bit more background on this.

183
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:02,448
[SPEAKER_29]: How long will this project take?

184
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:04,209
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of days.

185
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,569
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of days.

186
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:07,690
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you know when it's going to begin?

187
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,792
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as this is granted, we'll have the contractor go in and pull the street opening permit.

188
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:20,459
[SPEAKER_29]: And do you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted, just for the residents in the neighborhood to have some sort of idea as to?

189
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was maybe 37 feet.

190
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was maybe five panels, give or take a couple.

191
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:29,582
[SPEAKER_29]: And will there be any impact with regard to traffic in the neighborhood?

192
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:31,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say no.

193
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:41,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know if there's a lot of, you know, pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk there, but they can, you know, put some traffic control signs there to block the sidewalk and divert them around.

194
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:49,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, basically pretty much, you know, almost a day, two's work for the most part once they excavate it all out.

195
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:53,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the biggest part of it will be going back and replacing the, you know, the concrete.

196
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,427
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's going to take the time.

197
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,552
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President?

198
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:58,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you.

199
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,154
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's strictly sidewalk work?

200
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:00,514
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

201
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:01,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, nothing in the street.

202
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,757
[SPEAKER_21]: And what materials are used to replace the sidewalk panels?

203
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:04,378
[SPEAKER_21]: The same existing?

204
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Same, yes, it's concrete.

205
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:15,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that Echo Council night's one of the biggest concerns we've had in this council the last two years that we've been on set.

206
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:44,836
[SPEAKER_16]: that whenever there's a utility company that comes in, the way they found the street and sidewalks in a better condition than, if the same or if not better condition than it was left, because we have a huge issue with contractors coming in, representing the utilities, and then leaving sub-par work behind, and then the city is left, and the constituents are left holding the bag, so I think that it's very important that that piece is done.

207
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,919
[SPEAKER_16]: the city's engineering and making sure that it comes to fruition.

208
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

209
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:05,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President also looks here that the petitioner has agreed to remove an asphalt patch that's been put around another existing utility pole as part of mitigation to help fill those gaps of concrete to keep it consistent with the rest of the sidewalk.

210
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:08,547
[SPEAKER_21]: So I have no problem with this petition, Mr. President.

211
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:09,107
[SPEAKER_21]: I move for approval.

212
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:09,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

213
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:14,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor Knight to approval, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

214
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,710
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

215
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:15,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

216
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

217
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:17,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

218
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:27,728
[SPEAKER_15]: 17592, location of poles, attachments of fixtures in underground conduits.

219
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:32,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give us a brief synopsis of the project.

220
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:37,497
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be, let me see, Siena Engineering Group.

221
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,060
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

222
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,623
[SPEAKER_25]: With Siena Engineering Group, my name is John Kennedy.

223
00:13:44,944 --> 00:13:46,545
[SPEAKER_25]: We're at 50 Mall Road in Burlington, Mass.

224
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:57,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you in favor of this?

225
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I am in favor of this.

226
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone else in favor of this project?

227
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing none, I close that part of the hearing.

228
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone here that wishes to speak against this project?

229
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing close.

230
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:14,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Continue.

231
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,729
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so this is a conduit build.

232
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:21,011
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess we're starting on Granville Avenue.

233
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:33,619
[SPEAKER_25]: At the railroad right-of-way, we're replacing a handhold, and we're constructing 200 feet of conduit to a manhole location at the location of Winchester Street and Granville Avenue.

234
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:39,522
[SPEAKER_25]: Then we're constructing another 722 feet to another structure, a manhole structure.

235
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:46,414
[SPEAKER_25]: And then from that we'd go out to a Verizon manhole that's actually in the city of Somerville.

236
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:50,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Del Rosso.

237
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:52,244
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a lot of questions.

238
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:53,344
[SPEAKER_25]: Why?

239
00:14:55,286 --> 00:15:01,651
[SPEAKER_25]: So on Broadway, there's a bridge that crosses it over the railway.

240
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:02,292
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

241
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:11,779
[SPEAKER_25]: And in order for them to replace that bridge for the Green Line extension project, we have to relocate our cable, which is running right down the right of way.

242
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,782
[SPEAKER_25]: And the way to do that is to get it up.

243
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:24,234
[SPEAKER_25]: into the Verizon structure and then take it from the Verizon structure down Winchester, down Granville, and get it back onto the railway beyond the bridge where they're doing the construction.

244
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us about the type of conduit that you're going to be building.

245
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:31,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it a contained concrete tunnel?

246
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:40,506
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it a... It's typical construction with two four-inch conduits encased in concrete, 48 inches of depth per pound.

247
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:46,710
[SPEAKER_25]: And obviously, we're going to be looking to mitigate intersecting with anything else that might be in the roadway.

248
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,894
[SPEAKER_18]: And are you going to be digging in the road, in the sidewalks?

249
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,155
[SPEAKER_18]: All in the road.

250
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:54,516
[SPEAKER_18]: And what kind of wiring is this?

251
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:58,938
[SPEAKER_25]: So what would go back, what we're relocating is a fiber optic cable for AT&T.

252
00:15:58,978 --> 00:15:59,258
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

253
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

254
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:04,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

256
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:05,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

257
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:16,066
[SPEAKER_18]: The people on Winchester Street have had the heck beaten out of them for the past five years, and they've been shanghaied every step of the way.

258
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:31,220
[SPEAKER_18]: The businesses on Boston Avenue with relation to construction tied into the Green Line and some related developments that are going to capitalize off of the Green Line have suffered tremendously.

259
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,603
[SPEAKER_18]: On Winchester Street, on the other end from where you're digging, down towards Harvard

260
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:55,458
[SPEAKER_18]: residents were disrupted for two years with work that was done to accommodate the widening of the Harvard Street Bridge and dealing with a lot of the issues there, some of which were promised to be addressed and never were.

261
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,980
[SPEAKER_18]: I speak of drainage issues in that area.

262
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,282
[SPEAKER_18]: So beneath the Harvard Street Bridge still floods.

263
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:03,202
[SPEAKER_18]: St.

264
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:09,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Clement's School, though it's in a transition, still takes on sewage.

265
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,867
[SPEAKER_18]: an elementary school takes on sewage.

266
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:16,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I'm not saying that you're the cause of this.

267
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:35,233
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm saying is that the people who I represent are going to now be faced with another in a series of disruptive construction projects that's going to challenge their egress in and off of their properties, is going to tie up traffic in a cut-through street.

268
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:50,169
[SPEAKER_18]: that gets people between Harvard Street and Broadway and avoids using the ridiculous powerhouse circle, which has traffic patterns and timing there that is contrary to reason.

269
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,596
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you folks gonna do for the people of Medford on these streets?

270
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Who've had to put up with this?

271
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:14,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the several years and I'm not trying to put you on the spot and make you feel uncomfortable But the fact of the matter is these people are hurting Yeah, and they need to be assured and in very concrete ways on on

272
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:17,417
[SPEAKER_18]: How are they going to be treated?

273
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,718
[SPEAKER_18]: How are they going to be communicated with?

274
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Is just a silly flyer going to be stuck under their doors?

275
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:28,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they going to have a normal person who's going to talk to them and listen to them?

276
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:34,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Or are they just going to be besieged with emails that get put into their spam box?

277
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,132
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I will definitely have a representative on site while we're doing this dig.

278
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:45,416
[SPEAKER_25]: To speak to those other items, this is not a project that's not even on that kind of scale.

279
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:49,959
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a simple two, four-inch conduit duct rework.

280
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:58,043
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's a typical trench that you might see in the roadway happening for gas, for instance, or anybody else.

281
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:02,506
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not going to be impacting in that that way.

282
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:18,558
[SPEAKER_25]: We definitely will impact traffic We have traffic plans that we submit to your engineering department and we will look to make it work with both the police department and Setting up traffic plans appropriately and obviously we'll listen to your constituency in the area while we're working

283
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:28,226
[SPEAKER_18]: So will there be someone on site who's going to be available and consistent to just help these people who really feel beat up at this point?

284
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:29,087
[SPEAKER_25]: Absolutely.

285
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:33,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Siena will definitely have somebody on site while the contractor is working.

286
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,392
[SPEAKER_25]: And who is Siena?

287
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:37,795
[SPEAKER_25]: Siena is an engineering firm and we're representing AT&T.

288
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:42,059
[SPEAKER_25]: So basically we will work with a contractor that will be on site.

289
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:42,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

290
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

291
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:45,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

292
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:46,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

293
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:47,462
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

294
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:49,844
[SPEAKER_29]: And some of the similar questions, I guess.

295
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:56,047
[SPEAKER_29]: But, you know, as far as the length of time this project is going to take, when do you think this will begin?

296
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,589
[SPEAKER_29]: Just so if anyone here was watching at home tonight.

297
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,450
[SPEAKER_25]: So what we're trying to do is get this done before the

298
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,353
[SPEAKER_25]: December is our goal for the moratorium.

299
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:07,213
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd like to get it done.

300
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:20,302
[SPEAKER_25]: We're still working out this grant allocation as well in Somerville And as soon as we get that we're going to get underway, so we're in the process of putting all the pieces together We'd like to get started as soon as possible, and we're looking at

301
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:27,106
[SPEAKER_25]: depending on how things go and what the impact is in terms of traffic, it would be four to six weeks, I would think.

302
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:30,028
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's the outside.

303
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:41,974
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't say exactly, it depends on how long it takes us to get underway and if we run into issues in terms of traffic or if you have special events or any of those things that might be impacted.

304
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:47,757
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if there are road races scheduled for the next couple of weeks, when we could get out there and get it done.

305
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:52,123
[SPEAKER_29]: And as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5?

306
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,465
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it would be.

307
00:20:53,946 --> 00:21:01,477
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, if we were going to do anything, or if we were looking to get some relief on that, we would obviously come to the city and ask if we could do that.

308
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:08,966
[SPEAKER_29]: And as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways?

309
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,927
[SPEAKER_29]: What will be the impact and how will they be notified?

310
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:13,528
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would be minimal.

311
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:21,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Obviously, where we're working, it may take a day for us to get out of the way of a driveway, for instance, but we'll be looking to keep

312
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:30,577
[SPEAKER_25]: pedestrian traffic moving at all times, keep roadways open as much as we can, and keep driveways open as much as possible.

313
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:34,619
[SPEAKER_29]: So will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors?

314
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,742
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates?

315
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,843
[SPEAKER_25]: We certainly could do something like that if we needed to.

316
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:50,470
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project's going to happen.

317
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,132
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, just so they're informed.

318
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:57,877
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, because I think the worst thing is, is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing.

319
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:00,159
[SPEAKER_29]: That, you know, I knew nothing about this.

320
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:07,146
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project or they might have minimal information.

321
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,947
[SPEAKER_29]: then all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers.

322
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:19,270
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that I would recommend.

323
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,772
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and I believe we did send out a listing and mailing already.

324
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:25,153
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, good.

325
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:27,454
[SPEAKER_25]: But once we get started, we can do that again.

326
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,995
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know one of the stipulations was that we get together and sit down.

327
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:35,819
[SPEAKER_25]: Before we get started, we will have a schedule at that time.

328
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,702
[SPEAKER_25]: We can tell you what we think it's going to take us to get it done.

329
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:39,763
[SPEAKER_29]: Great, thank you.

330
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:43,126
[SPEAKER_29]: And as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?

331
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:47,350
[SPEAKER_25]: The way that we have our traffic plan set up right now, there are no road closures.

332
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,594
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're not, we don't anticipate that there would be actual road closures.

333
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:57,806
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm just concerned because I think if I'm reading this map correctly, this leads out to Broadway, right?

334
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:58,787
[SPEAKER_24]: It does, yes.

335
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:03,035
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm just concerned that if you're closing a road in Somerville and

336
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:07,066
[SPEAKER_29]: The residents in Medford don't know anything about it.

337
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:24,087
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.

338
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:32,936
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, absolutely, if you look at the traffic plan, I don't think we're, we're not planning on closing any roads, and we obviously would like to try to keep traffic moving in all directions.

339
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:42,967
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, setting up the proper traffic plan and also getting some help from both police departments to make sure that we can keep traffic moving, that's the goal.

340
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,348
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, thank you very much.

341
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:45,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

342
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think my questions have been asked and answered.

343
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:49,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

344
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:55,054
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what it looks like, what, 948 feet of trench work that you want to do?

345
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:57,437
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's about almost 1,100 feet.

346
00:23:57,457 --> 00:23:57,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Almost 1,100 feet.

347
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:58,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

348
00:23:58,218 --> 00:24:01,602
[SPEAKER_21]: And you said something at the beginning of your presentation.

349
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:04,667
[SPEAKER_21]: You said this is going to be common trench work like you see all around the city.

350
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:10,112
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've had a big problem in this city about trench work that's being performed by public utilities in the community.

351
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:18,361
[SPEAKER_21]: Just last month, we had a committee of the whole meeting with the city engineer, and we asked a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could place a moratorium on trench work.

352
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:23,506
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the big problems isn't necessarily you guys getting in there and doing the work that you need to do, because you need to get the work done.

353
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:27,609
[SPEAKER_21]: never coming back and fixing it to the standard that we want to see it fixed.

354
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,411
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's become a very big problem in our community.

355
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:35,755
[SPEAKER_21]: We're seeing a number of streets in residential neighborhoods and in main roads alike that are getting torn up and torn apart.

356
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:41,659
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, if you look at tonight's agenda, for example, you know, if you have 1,100 feet, we've got 115 feet coming up after that.

357
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we're looking at 2,000 feet of trench work that we're going to be putting through the city.

358
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,303
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I mean?

359
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,564
[SPEAKER_21]: There's applications for 2,000 feet of trench work in the city.

360
00:24:49,105 --> 00:24:51,607
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have some questions that are pending right now before our

361
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:57,869
[SPEAKER_21]: City solicitor that I think I'd feel a little bit more comfortable getting an answer to before I move forward in supporting this paper.

362
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,310
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, 1,000 feet is a lot of stretch of land.

363
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,450
[SPEAKER_21]: It's 10 football fields.

364
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor DelaRusso is absolutely right.

365
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:15,555
[SPEAKER_21]: That neighborhood has been beat on for the last three, four years between, you know, the reversals of Winchester Street and the direction that it's going in, the impact that the expansions of the Harvard Street Bridge have had.

366
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:24,719
[SPEAKER_21]: the discussion about eminent domain land takings coming up in the near future to, again, accommodate the extension of the Greenland, which I think is going to be a benefit to our community.

367
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't get me wrong.

368
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:27,780
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the Greenland extension is a good thing for us here in Medford.

369
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:33,623
[SPEAKER_21]: But in the meantime, we have residents that really need to maintain a strong quality of life, and that hasn't happened in that neighborhood.

370
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:39,486
[SPEAKER_21]: So this evening, I'm having a very difficult time supporting this paper, Mr. President, if we don't have the answers that are going to come back from the city solicitor.

371
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:42,207
[SPEAKER_21]: based on the committee of the whole that we had.

372
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:59,654
[SPEAKER_21]: And the committee of the whole meeting that we had was exclusively focused on trench management and the issuing of permits to public utilities and what they do to our streets, and whether or not they come back, and whether or not there's a schedule for them to come back, and whether or not we can limit the number of permits that are issued in a quarter or a year, so that we can better manage the job and better oversee the job that's being done.

373
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:06,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I think that the focus is more on the next special permit than it is on coming back and completing the work from the last special permit that you got.

374
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:12,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I haven't had the opportunity of working with Siena, and I'm not sure what Siena's reputation is or anything like that.

375
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,279
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure you guys are great.

376
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,980
[SPEAKER_21]: You're working for AT&T, which is a multinational company, you know, a $20 company.

377
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,241
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm sure you guys do a great job.

378
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:24,763
[SPEAKER_21]: But we need to do some housekeeping here, in my opinion, before I feel comfortable supporting this paper.

379
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:31,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not going to be able to support it this evening, Mr. President, for the reasons that we've asked a series of questions to our city solicitor through the administration.

380
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:52,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Asking for some input and some feedback as to what we can do to better manage The trench work that's being done in our community because it's killing our streets It's killing our neighborhoods and and the residents are speaking to go out against it in this particular street in this particular neighborhood they have been under the thumb of construction for the better part of three years and It is in the work needs to get done.

381
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:00,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, unfortunately We're in that we're on a schedule here with where we're getting forced to relocate because we're in the way of that the apartment That's gonna go and go in

382
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:07,535
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is the way to get around that so that they can do that construction work.

383
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:10,837
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what's pushing us to get the work done.

384
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:14,519
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand that it's a cause and effect situation, I guess you'd call it.

385
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, we're on the right of way and we happen to be on the right of way in the wrong spot.

386
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:24,644
[SPEAKER_25]: We're at the abutment where the bridge needs to be replaced and this is the way to get around that so that

387
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:27,245
[SPEAKER_25]: They can move forward with their construction in December.

388
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:33,208
[SPEAKER_21]: In this alternative here that's being presented, I would assume would be the least costly alternative to the provider, right?

389
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:38,530
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it would be the least costly, but it certainly is.

390
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there another way you can do it where you don't have to dig 1,000 feet in one of our city streets, I guess is the question.

391
00:27:43,312 --> 00:27:45,993
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think that there is another way that we could do that.

392
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:49,194
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know that we could get our cable out of the way of the construction.

393
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:52,055
[SPEAKER_25]: You might be able to speak to that a little bit better than I could, but.

394
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:57,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Derek Anderson with ARUP, design professional representing MBTA, 16 Myrtle Street in Medford.

395
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:01,478
[SPEAKER_24]: So I understand some of the trenching problems on a personal level.

396
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:05,320
[SPEAKER_24]: But to why I'm here, yeah, we have the,

397
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,704
[SPEAKER_24]: Design team has looked at multiple different ways to keep the relocation of this particular duct bank within the MBTA right away under the bridge.

398
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:25,089
[SPEAKER_24]: There is not a way that we have seen where we're able to avoid any disruption to the public streets in the area, the Boston Ave or Winchester.

399
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:29,091
[SPEAKER_24]: Winchester seems to be the best possible alignment for getting in and out quickly.

400
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,334
[SPEAKER_24]: And, yeah, we've looked at those.

401
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:37,659
[SPEAKER_24]: To give some sense, Broadway Bridge, there's abutments coming down on either side, a new track.

402
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,462
[SPEAKER_24]: There's just no space between the abutments and the track to put that in.

403
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,783
[SPEAKER_21]: There's barely any space between U.S.

404
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:46,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Travel World and, you know, from what they've done over there, it's about this far away from the building, so I understand we don't have a gap.

405
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:53,555
[SPEAKER_24]: We have absolutely looked to try to avoid disruption in this area, and there isn't another way without getting into the roads.

406
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:55,736
[SPEAKER_21]: into our roads?

407
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Or can you go underneath the rail bed?

408
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:01,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you go through some of them?

409
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,820
[SPEAKER_24]: One way or another, it's got to come up onto the roads.

410
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,702
[SPEAKER_21]: And really Winchester is... And what do these conduits service?

411
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Are they home telephones?

412
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Are they internet IP?

413
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:13,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Bandwidth?

414
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:14,764
[SPEAKER_21]: What do they provide?

415
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:21,287
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's AT&T's core network and it's carrying all kinds of traffic.

416
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:29,470
[SPEAKER_25]: that is not only local, but it goes all over the place.

417
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,511
[SPEAKER_25]: This particular cable has quite a bit of traffic on it that can't be rerouted, unfortunately.

418
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:45,975
[SPEAKER_25]: The right-of-way was a place where they traditionally put a lot of network as a way to mitigate getting into town and city streets.

419
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:53,013
[SPEAKER_25]: And unfortunately, where it is right now, we don't have the ability to get it out of his way while he builds the bridge.

420
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:56,157
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is a way to work it out.

421
00:29:56,177 --> 00:30:02,686
[SPEAKER_25]: And we are taking advantage of some structures that are already there and going through, coming out of the horizon.

422
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,009
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you for answering my questions.

423
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:14,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think my positions move much off of Mr. President, although the answer is from the solicitors office.

424
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:15,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

425
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate coming out tonight.

426
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:21,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's one of the biggest things that we've talked about in this council.

427
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:27,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry that you have a representative of this feedback, but until we make a stand,

428
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:44,746
[SPEAKER_16]: and really get the feedback back from the city solicitor and all of the utility companies that have been using our streets as trenches and then walking away and leaving our streets a mess.

429
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:48,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that with that and

430
00:30:49,050 --> 00:31:10,520
[SPEAKER_16]: plan in place for those neighbors because those neighbors again, I echo the remarks of my colleagues that they've been impacted so negatively and They're just daily daily Lifestyles and to compound that with more construction road work without a comprehensive plan that they are familiar with from beginning to end I think would be

431
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:30,034
[SPEAKER_16]: would be negligent and my part as a city council representing those people to not make sure that those concerns are not just supported by yourself, but a plan that would show us and what we can do.

432
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:40,583
[SPEAKER_16]: So I too would like to table this until we get more information from our city solicitor and what we've asked for in the past for our utilities.

433
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:48,071
[SPEAKER_16]: to make sure that what's being done on our roads, that utilities are being held accountable for what they're leaving there.

434
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:56,621
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we'd certainly work with you guys on whatever you needed to be, you know, comfortable with our construction practice.

435
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,906
[SPEAKER_25]: And anything we'd need to do to help

436
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:22,839
[SPEAKER_16]: communicate with a neighbor so we would you know all the people that are impacted we'd certainly be willing to do that and again I apologize that you know you could be the one situation where it would leave the street impeccable but when you have two foot swaths being cut and then you see them dip and nobody comes back to fix them and then

437
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:28,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, someone comes in and builds a four-foot swap path, and then nobody comes back.

438
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:32,092
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is what we're hearing over and over again.

439
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:33,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I understand.

440
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:35,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is where it's been very frustrating for us.

441
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:38,919
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for your time.

442
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,040
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

443
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

444
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:51,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some of the frustration you're hearing is regarding the number of projects that this city has gone through over the last couple of years.

445
00:32:52,587 --> 00:33:04,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Eversource right now will be trenching two miles of some of our major thoroughfares in the next several months, which is going to be a big disruption to traffic and residents in this community.

446
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:17,723
[SPEAKER_10]: My question to you is, we hear all too often when we ask when a trench is dug, and we all know after, even with best intentions, it usually sinks after a period of time.

447
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:31,769
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've asked the city solicitor why we can't request that when you're digging a trench, that you not only just pave the trench, but you do a curb-to-curb restoration.

448
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:34,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're being told that we can't request that.

449
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it has something to do with state law.

450
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:38,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

451
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:42,099
[SPEAKER_10]: But we can't request a curb-to-curb repaving.

452
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:50,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my opinion, if I allowed you to dig up some of my driveway, to put something under my driveway, I wouldn't request that you just patch a little piece of my driveway.

453
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know what's going to happen in six months from now.

454
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,651
[SPEAKER_10]: My driveway's going to be a mess.

455
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same thing applies to our streets.

456
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,696
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the first thing I think we have to look at, why we can't request a curb-to-curb.

457
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:05,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Was a curb-to-curb requested in this particular case?

458
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,300
[SPEAKER_25]: It was not requested in this particular case.

459
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:15,887
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, if we had something that was wrong with our patch, for instance, we certainly would want to try to restore the patch.

460
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So if the city did request a curb-to-curb, would you

461
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:26,743
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's something that I would have to bring back to see if that's something that would be an option.

462
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:30,344
[SPEAKER_25]: That would certainly be quite a big impact to the project.

463
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:35,125
[SPEAKER_25]: But maybe, I don't know if it's something that we could do.

464
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,705
[SPEAKER_25]: I couldn't answer that question tonight.

465
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:45,071
[SPEAKER_25]: It would be a bigger impact overall to the neighbourhood as well.

466
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:54,059
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand that if we did have to do a full restoration for the entire trench, the trench line, that we would be looking at a pretty big impact.

467
00:34:55,415 --> 00:35:12,563
[SPEAKER_10]: impact regarding what for the neighbors and everybody the construction project would be bigger than it would be sure sure residents who call us up in six months from now saying every truck that goes by their house shakes their house because it's such a dip

468
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,464
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we hear it over and over again.

469
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:15,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

470
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I can appreciate the fact that... No, I understand.

471
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:30,297
[SPEAKER_25]: The roads are all over, you know, all over the state there's construction work going on and it's frustrating for everybody at times and patches do resettle and there's no question about it that that happens.

472
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:39,621
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know that I can say that I'd be able to do a full restoration this evening, but I could certainly inquire about it.

473
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,242
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't meet again until September.

474
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:43,343
[SPEAKER_25]: Third week of September.

475
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:48,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and my concern is that if we don't... We're not going to meet until the third week in September.

476
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:59,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right, and that's my concern is that, you know, with the project, with the goals that they have for the bridge, that we're running out of time to get this project done.

477
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:03,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I as one member of the council, I'd hate to hold up this project.

478
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that you're doing the project based on what work needs to be done.

479
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:07,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

480
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:14,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have no problem if you would be able to give us a commitment tonight about curb-to-curb restoration.

481
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:26,371
[SPEAKER_10]: That way I think it would be an easier sell to the neighborhood knowing that this work is taking place, but the ultimate outcome will be a brand new area, a street from the whole length.

482
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:30,133
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we go through projects like the

483
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:35,155
[SPEAKER_10]: The Eversource project I mentioned two miles, it has zero benefit to this community.

484
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:36,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Zero.

485
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize we all have to live together as good neighbors with other communities.

486
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It has zero benefit to our community.

487
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:45,820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to have a thousand percent disruption to our community.

488
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the type of things I think we're struggling with.

489
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,282
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I understand.

490
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:56,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be supportive tonight if you would give a commitment, if you can get on your phone and give a commitment for curb-to-curb restoration.

491
00:36:57,046 --> 00:37:00,868
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that something that I could come back in, if I could get a few minutes to see what I can do?

492
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,488
[SPEAKER_10]: If the members feel the same, I feel that way.

493
00:37:03,029 --> 00:37:08,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be a win for our community if we were able to repave the entire area.

494
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:11,003
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

495
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:12,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Del Rosso.

496
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:19,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that.

497
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:20,908
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd certainly invite it.

498
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:27,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in.

499
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:38,377
[SPEAKER_18]: I know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for

500
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:45,000
[SPEAKER_18]: 12 years, 14 years, something like that.

501
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done.

502
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:52,222
[SPEAKER_18]: People want to see it done.

503
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:58,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction.

504
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:04,109
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again.

505
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:26,285
[SPEAKER_18]: And certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station, the rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving

506
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:37,507
[SPEAKER_18]: what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars.

507
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:41,609
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that being said, I don't know.

508
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:54,426
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people.

509
00:38:54,546 --> 00:39:05,028
[SPEAKER_18]: But my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication and a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met.

510
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:13,290
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to

511
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:23,137
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see need to table this tonight nor do I see a need to withhold it and hold.

512
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:26,739
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to move on it decisively tonight.

513
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:44,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Based upon your plans and construction guidelines and so forth, do you see a need to do any more underground work on Winchester or Granville before the completion of the Green Line extension?

515
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:51,891
[SPEAKER_24]: As part of this project, we're not anticipating utility work on Winchester or Granville.

516
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:56,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Because part of the concern would be if we did go curve to curve, then that would put in effect a moratorium for digging.

517
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,798
[SPEAKER_21]: So we require to go curve to curve.

518
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,940
[SPEAKER_21]: and pave the whole entire street, then we could say that they can't dig for five years.

519
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,283
[SPEAKER_25]: Are there other plans for other utilities to work through that area?

520
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,904
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know the answer to that question.

521
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:09,865
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I was betting for the D, the new I think.

522
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:10,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I see if that's what it was.

523
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:12,187
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, if we could do it.

524
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,828
[SPEAKER_18]: They did the water and gas, that was two years ago, three years ago.

525
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:18,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Member Kern.

526
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

527
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:28,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I see everybody's frustration, and we've had a number of Committee of the Whole meetings to try to remedy it, and we are awaiting answers.

528
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:43,627
[SPEAKER_02]: curb to curb will be great, but for me, what I keep bringing up in the last several years that this has been a real problem is the fact that we don't have anybody from the city to review the trench work six months from now, a year from now.

529
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:47,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'd be amenable as long as we have a condition on there that

530
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:57,852
[SPEAKER_02]: our engineer or somebody from the administration does a walk-through with somebody from your company nine months from now or a year from now, and if there is sinkage, that it be fixed.

531
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that might be another option.

532
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,095
[SPEAKER_16]: I think everybody touched some great points.

533
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:14,841
[SPEAKER_16]: the more detailed agenda for our constituents and those neighbors that are going to be affected.

534
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:17,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would have to be something that's necessary.

535
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:20,244
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we definitely are interested in that.

536
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:27,810
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I did talk to the city engineer and that was one of the points that she brought up is that we did have to meet before we got started.

537
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,453
[SPEAKER_25]: We were going to have a construction kickoff and I think we could address some of those concerns with the neighborhood.

538
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:37,895
[SPEAKER_25]: and I've actually been given the okay to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like us to do the curb-to-curb, so.

539
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:46,479
[SPEAKER_15]: In the petition it says AT&T shall provide a full-time resident engineer approved by the city who will monitor the work on the city's behalf.

540
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:52,642
[SPEAKER_15]: AT&T will provide detailed scheduled weekly updates, so it is in our contract somewhat.

541
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:53,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight.

542
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:56,824
[SPEAKER_20]: So you just said that you've gotten the authority to do curb-to-curb?

543
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:59,826
[SPEAKER_25]: I have, I've gotten the approval to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like to do it.

544
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:02,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I elaborate on my response?

545
00:42:02,907 --> 00:42:03,427
[SPEAKER_24]: Please.

546
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:17,874
[SPEAKER_24]: As you know, this is a design build, so when I say that we're not anticipating any work there, I can't say that there won't be any work, because I don't know what the design build is that was proposed, but we're not anticipating work there.

547
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,015
[SPEAKER_21]: I anticipate it.

548
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,536
[SPEAKER_21]: The other question I have was, would

549
00:42:23,538 --> 00:42:25,861
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a pre-construction meeting, obviously, with our engineering department.

550
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:26,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

551
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:27,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

552
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:33,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you be willing to have a pre-construction meeting at maybe the South Metro Fire Station with the same people that are the abutters that are on your abutter list?

553
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:34,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, absolutely.

554
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Why not?

555
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,953
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we certainly want to keep everybody happy.

556
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:41,457
[SPEAKER_25]: We're interested in having good neighbors and keeping everybody as happy as we can.

557
00:42:41,498 --> 00:42:42,799
[SPEAKER_25]: We are going to be constructing.

558
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,281
[SPEAKER_25]: We are going to be impacting traffic.

559
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:45,222
[SPEAKER_25]: That's unavoidable.

560
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:51,423
[SPEAKER_25]: but we're interested in getting the project done as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption.

561
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:51,883
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all.

562
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:54,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I think we're making good progress tonight.

563
00:42:54,564 --> 00:43:02,345
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, a curb-to-curb solution is something that... So it's just my agreement that you are going to do a curb-to-curb?

564
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:03,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're in agreement.

565
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,706
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, could we have that as a condition?

566
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:08,487
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could put that as a condition, Mr. President.

567
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:12,747
[SPEAKER_21]: And just another condition that there's a meeting that's held pre-construction with the residents that are at Butters.

568
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:15,128
[SPEAKER_21]: At Butters, upper Butters.

569
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

570
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:24,936
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, as amended.

571
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:26,857
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

572
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:27,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

573
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

574
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:31,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scott Pelli has requested a roll call.

575
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:40,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

576
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:44,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Del Rosso?

577
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:44,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

578
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:45,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

579
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:46,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

580
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:47,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

581
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:47,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

582
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:48,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor McClary?

583
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:48,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

584
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President March?

585
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:50,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

586
00:43:51,372 --> 00:43:52,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

587
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:52,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

588
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,895
[SPEAKER_15]: President Caviello?

589
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:54,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

590
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Second the affirmative, none in the negative.

591
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:57,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

592
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

593
00:43:59,001 --> 00:43:59,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

594
00:43:59,342 --> 00:43:59,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

595
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:01,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you guys.

596
00:44:07,426 --> 00:44:12,228
[SPEAKER_15]: 17, 593, location of poles, attachment of fictions, and underground conduits.

597
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:17,790
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the project.

598
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to say it.

599
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,431
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Comcast again.

600
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

601
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Dave Pauline, Comcast, Woobin, Massachusetts.

602
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:28,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And you are here in favor of this project?

603
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I am.

604
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone else here in favor of that project?

605
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing.

606
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:37,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone here against this project?

607
00:44:38,773 --> 00:44:41,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that section of the hearing.

608
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:51,986
[SPEAKER_08]: High Street, placing a new 4x4 manhole over the existing Comcast conduit at the intersection of High Street and Hillside Avenue.

609
00:44:52,987 --> 00:45:03,935
[SPEAKER_08]: From the newly placed manhole, excavating to place a 4-inch PVC conduit 115 feet plus or minus, and continuing into 92 High Street, Medford, which is the Armory building.

610
00:45:05,066 --> 00:45:08,470
[SPEAKER_08]: They've requested our service, and this is the plan to provide service to them.

611
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

612
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:11,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

613
00:45:12,495 --> 00:45:12,916
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

614
00:45:12,956 --> 00:45:13,937
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

615
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:20,786
[SPEAKER_29]: Similar to a lot of the questions I asked previously regarding the previous project, when will the work take place, and how long will this project last?

616
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:28,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Once approved, if approved, we're still waiting for an MWRA permit.

617
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:32,058
[SPEAKER_08]: We have received the permit.

618
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:33,279
[SPEAKER_08]: We have signed off on it.

619
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We've reviewed it.

620
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We've agreed to it.

621
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's back with the MWRA.

622
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:40,569
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a new process now where we sign off on the permit first.

623
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,732
[SPEAKER_08]: then we send it back to them and it basically goes through their board again, takes two weeks to get it signed.

624
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:50,974
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was hoping to get this work done if approved before Labor Day, before school started.

625
00:45:51,494 --> 00:45:56,376
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it looks like it's gonna be sometime after Labor Day before we get that MWRA permit from them.

626
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:04,280
[SPEAKER_08]: The work should take, depending upon the digging, it is only 115 feet and a four by four manhole.

627
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say probably a week, depending upon the digging, weather permitting.

628
00:46:10,828 --> 00:46:16,495
[SPEAKER_08]: two weeks, maybe tops, it's kind of hard to say, not knowing exactly what's in there and what they're going to run into as far as the digging.

629
00:46:17,497 --> 00:46:18,838
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's on High Street, right?

630
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:19,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

631
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:26,809
[SPEAKER_29]: So I assume the road's going to be open, but I would imagine it's going to be quite tough to pass at times, I would think.

632
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:35,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did see I printed the agenda this morning and I did look at this and I did see that the chief engineer requested a traffic management plan.

633
00:46:35,157 --> 00:46:38,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I did also request that today from our traffic management people.

634
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:50,652
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping to get that and you know, shortly after Labor Day, I'll be able to, you know, bring that into the chief engineer and we can talk about if approved, moving forward with the with the work.

635
00:46:50,672 --> 00:46:51,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

636
00:46:53,454 --> 00:47:13,521
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a chance that on Hillside Avenue, the existing conduit may be damaged, so I thought that I should put this in here and make you aware of that, just in case we do have to do some additional excavating on that road, so there would be no surprises if this project does extend a little bit longer than anticipated.

637
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:16,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we can get through that conduit, but we think it may be damaged.

638
00:47:16,922 --> 00:47:18,642
[SPEAKER_15]: What information, Councilor Scarpelli?

639
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,723
[SPEAKER_16]: How many more feet would that be if there was damage?

640
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have to look at the plan here.

641
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:32,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if he called that out.

642
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:32,956
[SPEAKER_08]: 180 feet.

643
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:34,817
[SPEAKER_08]: An additional 180 or 180 total?

644
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:35,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional 180.

645
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:41,860
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, so with that additional 180 feet, I mean, so how long that work would take if you have to

646
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:52,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it depends upon the digging.

647
00:47:52,419 --> 00:48:01,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's kind of off the, you know, not as busy a street as High Street, but, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of traffic that goes up and down to that area, and I believe, is it the library that's right there also?

648
00:48:01,527 --> 00:48:07,373
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the library exits from there, and there's a couple of streets that are up in that area.

649
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:11,577
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I mean, those neighbors, those residents will be impacted, it sounds like, if there

650
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:13,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping we can get through it.

651
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:20,448
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll send a crew out there before we stop this, before we start the digging out on the main run, to see if we can get a rod through it.

652
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:26,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Best case scenario, maybe it's just damaged in a couple of spots and we have to, you know, pothole it and dig it up and repair it.

653
00:48:27,676 --> 00:48:29,018
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the best case scenario.

654
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

655
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Nutty.

656
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:35,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Sir, were you here when we just did the last permit?

657
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:35,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

658
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:43,598
[SPEAKER_21]: And can we have some of your feelings concerning a curb-to-curb pay upon this project as opposed to a trench and patch and a grounded inlet?

659
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:44,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

660
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:53,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I did see that in the comments from the chief engineer, and it did call that out, trench to pay from the trench to the curb.

661
00:48:54,905 --> 00:49:17,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also I would need to go back if this was approved I would go back and just make them aware of that that that would be the requirement of the permit and Therefore it would be a business decision on our end if we were to move forward and then physically go apply for the permit so if it was approved tonight and We agreed it was agreed to you know grant the location

662
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:31,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if I go back and the powers to be decide that this is cost prohibitive to do the paving to the curb, then therefore we would not apply for the street opening permit and not provide service to 92 High Street.

663
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the chair, President Carviello, so 92 High Street doesn't have Comcast service at all?

664
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:40,844
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't.

665
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's requesting it?

666
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:43,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole building?

667
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the name.

668
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:47,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the name of the customer.

669
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:49,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just tasked with getting the permits to get to the building.

670
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:54,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once it's there, X number of tenants within that building could request the service.

671
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:56,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's at least one.

672
00:49:59,561 --> 00:49:59,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

673
00:50:00,382 --> 00:50:01,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Council, Vice President Mox.

674
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:06,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, and I stand to be corrected, it may be a new dental group that's moving in here that's requesting this.

675
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:16,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would hate for Comcast to go back and then decide it was not cost effective to provide service.

676
00:50:16,615 --> 00:50:24,501
[SPEAKER_10]: This new business is just opening and actually reached out to me as one member of the council seeing when it was going to be on our agenda.

677
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:29,206
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they're really interested in getting the service to get their business up and running.

678
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:39,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So, at this point, I would, as one member of the council, just support the current work that's going on and then we can have other discussions regarding curve to curve and so forth.

679
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:50,930
[SPEAKER_16]: I echo the same issues that I've had.

680
00:50:51,451 --> 00:51:02,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this is a little different because it does affect constituents that need to move forward, but if approved, the same stipulation

681
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:21,066
[SPEAKER_16]: would the residents, would you require that, would you input a plan that our residents would hear, would understand the total agenda from beginning to end, so they understand the complexities of the project and any issues and concerns that might come up?

682
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:28,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying having someone on site, or are you just having a point of contact for the project?

683
00:51:28,907 --> 00:51:30,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we've had just point of contact.

684
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:42,993
[SPEAKER_16]: reaching out to the residents and same thing, holding a meeting or getting a detailed agenda for them, scheduled for them so they understand what might happen.

685
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:43,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Schedule of work.

686
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:43,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

687
00:51:44,093 --> 00:51:53,098
[SPEAKER_16]: That they would, you know, at least the abutters to this project understand the complexity of the job, so.

688
00:51:53,858 --> 00:51:54,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we could do that.

689
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:13,808
[SPEAKER_21]: The location that you're requesting to dig, and I'm sure you're from Woburn, I'm around the Woburn area, so I'm sure you're familiar with the area, but right at that particular location, there are points and times where there are two MBTA buses that are driving down the street and they can't even get by each other.

690
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:22,178
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we have a gentleman from the square who owns a business down there, a restaurant, that's getting killed by construction on the other side of the square.

691
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,432
[SPEAKER_21]: right up the street on the other side.

692
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:38,974
[SPEAKER_21]: So two points of entrance to certain businesses are going to be blocked or hampered or impeded for a period of time.

693
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:43,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I know you're only going to be out there for one or two weeks tops, as you said, on High Street.

694
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:48,637
[SPEAKER_21]: And then if any residual effects happen, I'm assuming that the rest of the repair work would go up Hillsdale Road if it's damaged?

695
00:52:48,657 --> 00:52:48,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

696
00:52:49,337 --> 00:52:49,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

697
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:51,237
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's not a major act, I don't think.

698
00:52:51,277 --> 00:52:52,038
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a neighborhood.

699
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:57,084
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not something I'm so worried about right now, because you guys don't know what's underground over there.

700
00:52:57,104 --> 00:52:58,464
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't know if there is a problem over there.

701
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,965
[SPEAKER_21]: But the concern that I do have is with flow and with the trench repair work.

702
00:53:02,025 --> 00:53:05,766
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not going to give the same 25-minute thing that I just did at the last one.

703
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:10,408
[SPEAKER_21]: But ultimately, you know, we have a problem in the community with the way that our trenches are managed and our trenches are overseen.

704
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:13,109
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think we're doing a very good job at it.

705
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:15,009
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to do a better job at it.

706
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:17,770
[SPEAKER_21]: So in order for me to be comfortable with this, I need some insurances.

707
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can say that I'm familiar with the process.

708
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:24,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if you're familiar with this process.

709
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:26,034
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have an inspection process.

710
00:53:26,054 --> 00:53:29,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if we've done a whole lot of work in the city over the past couple of years.

711
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,539
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first hearing that I've been to in Medford.

712
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So the person who had the time before had since retired.

713
00:53:35,202 --> 00:53:37,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what work took place before then.

714
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:37,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry?

715
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:38,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Did he retire because of us?

716
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:39,366
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

717
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:51,937
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe it was back in the 90s, somewhere along the 90s, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy came out with something called DTE 9822, which is an inspection process.

718
00:53:52,718 --> 00:54:01,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have our project coordinators who are assigned to this job go out and inspect the jobs 30, 60, and I believe it's either 90 or one year.

719
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:03,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a report that goes to the state every year.

720
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:10,578
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a task that when we do new trenches that our project coordinators are tasked with doing.

721
00:54:11,078 --> 00:54:19,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I don't know if there's been a whole lot of trenching in Medford, so I can't really speak to that, but that is one of our processes, and we can, you know, it would be certainly part of this.

722
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,440
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been plenty, but not the conquest.

723
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot of trenching in Medford.

724
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:24,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Member Kern.

725
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:27,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the Chair, thank you, President Carviello.

726
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:39,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I think since you need a permit from the MWRA, I'm just throwing it out there that we table it and get a response back from Comcast for our next meeting of whether or not you'll do curb-to-curb.

727
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:40,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have an issue.

728
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:45,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I said in the last petition that I just don't want the trenches to keep sinking.

729
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not right for a contractor to leave a piece of property like that, a street or a sidewalk sinking.

730
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:57,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a problem with requiring curb-to-curb in the last one.

731
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:20,700
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of swaying from that here, so I would like, I'm not, I think it should be, if we're gonna, we need to have a meeting, probably a committee of the whole meeting, and get some answers from you of whether you do the curb to curb, because that's a main thoroughfare, we definitely don't want any sinkage on High Street, and if we're gonna mandate some curb to curb, I think we need to figure out some consistency in how we're gonna do that.

732
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:27,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the business needs, wants Comcast, we fought loud and clear years and years ago that there'd be competition,

733
00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:39,388
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't feel that the business should have it, but we just need to figure out amongst ourselves some way to keep this consistent and uniform and figure out how to do that prior to probably our next meeting.

734
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:41,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I could.

735
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Marks.

736
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:51,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Typically what happens is it's the city engineer that requires, when they meet with the city engineer, whether it's going to be curb to curb or not.

737
00:55:52,713 --> 00:55:56,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should leave that up to the druthers of the city engineer.

738
00:55:57,138 --> 00:56:01,183
[SPEAKER_10]: On this particular case, as I mentioned, this particular business has a hardship.

739
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:04,544
[SPEAKER_10]: And they need this Comcast to run their business.

740
00:56:05,325 --> 00:56:08,246
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I don't feel comfortable waiting three weeks.

741
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:14,269
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens on the last petitioner that there was someone in the room that had the authority to grant the curb-to-curb.

742
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,770
[SPEAKER_10]: This gentleman clearly does not have that authority.

743
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:26,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And because of the hardship of that particular business that's going into 92 High Street, I don't feel comfortable, Mr. President, leaving this for another three weeks.

744
00:56:26,874 --> 00:56:28,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will support this tonight.

745
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:40,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And moving forward, I think some of our questions should be directed to our own city engineer and our own inspectional services on why work is not being put back in the manner that we see fit.

746
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:45,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will support this petition tonight based on that, Mr. President.

747
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:46,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Council Member Kern.

748
00:56:46,834 --> 00:57:01,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the Chair, I know you said you wouldn't be able to start until sometime after Labor Day anyway, so I think that would only be almost a week postponement if we take this up with some answers from Comcast on September 19th, and I think we need to, again, we just need to be consistent.

749
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:07,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask my colleagues how they feel about tabling it for three weeks.

750
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Second the motion.

751
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:12,877
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm ready to vote on it in approval, Mr. President.

752
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:18,844
[SPEAKER_18]: The money that Comcast gets out of me every month, I'm sure they'll be able to

753
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:28,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Pape High Street from Arlington to Malden with no sweat.

754
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:29,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to table.

755
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:31,908
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a motion by Councilor Knight to table.

756
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a second?

757
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the second.

758
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:38,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor Longo to table it.

759
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

760
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:41,212
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

761
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:42,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

762
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:43,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been requested.

763
00:57:46,526 --> 00:57:46,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk.

764
00:57:46,726 --> 00:57:47,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

765
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:48,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor De La Russa.

766
00:57:48,689 --> 00:57:49,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Negative.

767
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

768
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:50,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

769
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:51,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Night.

770
00:57:52,212 --> 00:57:52,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

771
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:54,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Kern.

772
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:54,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

773
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:55,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks.

774
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:56,157
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

775
00:57:56,758 --> 00:57:57,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Kelly.

776
00:57:57,578 --> 00:57:57,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

777
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,561
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caprio.

778
00:57:59,601 --> 00:57:59,781
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

779
00:58:01,283 --> 00:58:03,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in the affirmative.

780
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:05,628
[SPEAKER_15]: There's four to three at the table.

781
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:11,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get us that, do you mind, through the chair, get us that answer of whether or not you could do curb to curb?

782
00:58:12,045 --> 00:58:12,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry?

783
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:16,046
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could get us those answers before the next meeting.

784
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:16,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

785
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:16,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

786
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:18,107
[SPEAKER_08]: When will that next meeting be?

787
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:18,827
[SPEAKER_08]: September 19th.

788
00:58:18,847 --> 00:58:19,467
[SPEAKER_08]: September 19th.

789
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:20,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

790
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:25,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are we going to meet September 19th?

791
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:31,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll be determined this week once we have the construction schedule.

792
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,512
[SPEAKER_15]: 17594, that's the location.

793
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:41,085
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the application.

794
00:58:41,386 --> 00:58:42,226
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we have someone here?

795
00:58:42,246 --> 00:58:47,790
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address of the record, please.

796
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:52,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Matthew Carmody from National Grid, 170 Medford Street, Multnomah.

797
00:58:52,394 --> 00:58:53,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I speak in favor of this?

798
00:58:53,635 --> 00:58:53,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

799
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:56,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone else speak in favor of this project?

800
00:58:58,238 --> 00:59:00,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing.

801
00:59:01,201 --> 00:59:03,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone here that is speaking against this?

802
00:59:06,355 --> 00:59:09,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that portion of the hearing.

803
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:10,619
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

804
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,284
[SPEAKER_22]: This petition is installing a traffic control box to operate and monitor our existing gas regulation station.

805
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:26,914
[SPEAKER_22]: This is replacing outdated equipment to make sure we can monitor for safety and reliability purposes and communicate to our pit itself to monitor the gas system throughout the year.

806
00:59:27,854 --> 00:59:28,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

807
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:29,879
[SPEAKER_29]: Counselor Falco.

808
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:30,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

809
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:39,417
[SPEAKER_29]: If you could just tell us a little bit about the project, how long it's going to take, the hours you're going to be working, how many sidewalk panels you're going to be pulling out.

810
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the sidewalk panels were already excavated.

811
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,701
[SPEAKER_22]: They're in temporary asphalt at the moment from our previous project on Wyman at Woburn.

812
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,782
[SPEAKER_22]: So about six to seven asphalt concrete patches.

813
00:59:49,802 --> 00:59:52,183
[SPEAKER_22]: It should take a few days, regular work hours.

814
00:59:52,563 --> 00:59:55,944
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been pre-construction job walk has been performed with the engineering.

815
00:59:55,964 --> 00:59:58,985
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's generally supposed to take three to four days I'd say at most.

816
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:05,307
[SPEAKER_22]: And all panels will be fully put in ADA compliancy and make sure it's reviewed afterwards with the city engineering department.

817
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:07,007
[SPEAKER_29]: Will they be replaced with concrete?

818
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:07,508
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

819
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:10,649
[SPEAKER_29]: Even the ones that are temporarily been replaced with asphalt?

820
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:15,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, so we temporarily repair them, so our concrete subcontractor come in, make sure it's AD compliant, stamped, and so forth.

821
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:22,592
[SPEAKER_22]: It's also in asphalt because we knew this work would be oncoming, so it's only for about two to three weeks that they certainly have been in asphalt.

822
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:28,054
[SPEAKER_22]: So as soon as this work is performed, our subcontractor will come in, perform the restoration with concrete.

823
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,258
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is sidewalk work, so you don't anticipate any road closures?

824
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:33,900
[SPEAKER_22]: There shouldn't be any road closures.

825
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,882
[SPEAKER_22]: If there is, it would be for one day max.

826
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:37,443
[SPEAKER_22]: If so, it would be communicated with the city.

827
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:40,286
[SPEAKER_22]: This work will be fully communicated with the neighborhood.

828
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:43,830
[SPEAKER_22]: My cell phone number is on a letter that's hand-delivered to every resident.

829
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,893
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a butter that was given in the petition.

830
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:51,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, we do mail out three separate letters, one with two YouTube videos.

831
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:57,081
[SPEAKER_22]: to explain exactly what to expect during our work, also frequently ask questions and so forth.

832
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:04,846
[SPEAKER_22]: But again, we do hand deliver every single letter with my cell phone number to personally contact me to make sure no one's inconvenienced and we work with them hand in hand.

833
01:01:05,086 --> 01:01:05,387
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

834
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:15,233
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's key that you actually have included your cell phone number because it's always good that we have a point of contact and that the residents have a point of contact, especially

835
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:25,477
[SPEAKER_29]: No, like you said, to supply a YouTube video, which I don't think you hear that too often, but it's always nice that the residents can actually see what's going on or, you know, get more information as to what's going on in front of their homes.

836
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:27,017
[SPEAKER_29]: So, thank you very much.

837
01:01:27,037 --> 01:01:27,457

[SPEAKER_21]: He's been here a number of times before.

843
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,700

844
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,461

845
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:42,323
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll certainly support this evening, and I look forward to the next permit to come back for some street trench works.

846
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:44,944

847
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:46,465

848
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Thankfully, I'm in the sidewalk this time.

849
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:50,187

921
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:54,480

922
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:02,225

929
01:07:18,607 --> 01:07:26,891
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning, I was issued a citation for restricted parking in grass and dirt for $50.

930
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:28,252
[SPEAKER_05]: What street is it in?

931
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:29,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Brooks Park.

932
01:07:29,393 --> 01:07:29,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Brooks Park?

933
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:30,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

934
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:32,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Which there were no signs.

935
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: posted.

936
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not parked on the grass.

937
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:39,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's hot top that's missing.

938
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:44,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm in the dirt and it's kind of congested there.

939
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:50,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went up and filed for a hearing, which I never heard until today.

940
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:55,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I call them and they said they were going to dismiss and just give me a warning.

941
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: But the parking stuff there and there's no signs.

942
01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:01,332
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no curbing around the park.

943
01:08:02,195 --> 01:08:03,376
[SPEAKER_05]: except for one little section.

944
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they come by, there's commercial vehicles parked at night, which they go right by, they don't tag them.

945
01:08:11,643 --> 01:08:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a truck there, the dump truck that's parked constantly, either on Hancock Street, Brooks Park, or Main Street, with junk on it, and it sits there sometimes for a couple of days.

946
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:30,321
[SPEAKER_05]: He takes up two or three spots when he parks on Brooks Park, and I've told him many a times, you know, he doesn't live there.

947
01:08:30,921 --> 01:08:34,725
[SPEAKER_05]: He lives on Sylvan Street, two streets over his girlfriend.

948
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:38,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's becoming an issue, parking there.

949
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,091
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's no signs posted.

950
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:44,756
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they got to post something, put some curbing, you know, to warn people, you know.

951
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:47,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

952
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

953
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,181
[SPEAKER_05]: But your ticket was dismissed, correct?

954
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It was dismissed.

955
01:08:51,822 --> 01:08:54,304
[SPEAKER_05]: They were sending me something in the mail saying it was dismissed.

956
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:55,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I called them because I hadn't heard anything.

957
01:08:55,845 --> 01:09:08,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And the girl in the office, Brenda, said that it's the police department that's enforcing this, telling them to write the tickets, which I had talked to somebody in traffic, and he says we have nothing to do with it.

958
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:10,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says there's nothing posted there.

959
01:09:10,956 --> 01:09:12,618
[SPEAKER_05]: He says they have to post something.

960
01:09:12,638 --> 01:09:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: People have been parking there for 50 years, and they get a note.

961
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,001
[SPEAKER_05]: put a sign and warn them.

962
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

963
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:19,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

964
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:20,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President.

965
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:23,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got a couple of questions for the gentleman.

966
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:25,303
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, sir.

967
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:27,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Counselor Knight has a couple of questions for you.

968
01:09:27,723 --> 01:09:42,708
[SPEAKER_21]: It's somewhat unrelated to the topic that you brought up, but we've had a number of resolutions that have gone forward from this council concerning Brooks Park and some illicit and what we call unsavory behavior going on down there, maybe behind the new apartment buildings and so on.

969
01:09:43,468 --> 01:09:49,093
[SPEAKER_21]: The council's passed a number of resolutions and I might follow it up a little bit, but I'd like to hear from you as to what impact you've seen.

970
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:53,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you seen an improvement down there in the illicit activity that's going on in Brooks Park?

971
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:54,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

972
01:09:55,478 --> 01:09:58,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, something's got to be done around that park.

973
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:00,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Put up curbing or something.

974
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:04,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Put up signs because a lot of the people, they've been parking there for years.

975
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:07,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it up and you know.

976
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:10,049
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of the bad element that's been in the neighborhood?

977
01:10:10,089 --> 01:10:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: The bad element?

978
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't see much of that.

979
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:14,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see it.

980
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So aside from this... There were people down in that parking lot that were talking about dealing drugs.

981
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:24,445
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard they were ordering pizzas to their cars, staying in the parking lot and hanging out all night.

982
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:24,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

983
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:26,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the things I heard from residents.

984
01:10:26,747 --> 01:10:27,948
[SPEAKER_21]: But I haven't seen that lately.

985
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:31,332
[SPEAKER_21]: So aside from the uptick in the enforcement in the parking over there and some of the

986
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:35,689
[SPEAKER_21]: communication issues that are going on and everything in the neighborhood seems to be going well.

987
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:36,610
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems to be all right.

988
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

989
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:37,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

990
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Mr. President.

991
01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:41,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

992
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:52,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I want to point out that this council on two occasions in the past four years has requested that the administration install curbing in the area of Brooks Park.

993
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:54,742
[SPEAKER_15]: There was curbing there at one time and it was never replaced.

994
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:58,125
[SPEAKER_17]: It was removed, it was never replaced, and the late, great

995
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:05,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Sammy Petrella was a long-time advocate for that improvement.

996
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:06,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

997
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:08,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, sir.

998
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:08,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

999
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:09,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

1000
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:17,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1001
01:11:17,338 --> 01:11:18,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1002
01:11:18,919 --> 01:11:19,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1003
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:22,600
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Claudio Iacono, former Medford.

1004
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I live now in Reddick.

1005
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:29,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an HVAC technician, so I travel to the city of Medford doing service calls or whatever.

1006
01:11:31,724 --> 01:11:38,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a little while back, I pulled up Selma Street, right in the intersection of Spring Street.

1007
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:44,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I parked under a sign that says, 30 minutes free parking.

1008
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:48,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to drop off a key to the real estate office across the street.

1009
01:11:49,508 --> 01:11:51,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I just saw I came back and said, take it on my cap.

1010
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:53,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1011
01:11:54,251 --> 01:11:57,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Two weeks later, I had to do the same thing, practice the same thing.

1012
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:58,714
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, I'm smart.

1013
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to the chaos machine, broken.

1014
01:12:02,296 --> 01:12:04,477
[SPEAKER_11]: They said, go to the next chaos machine.

1015
01:12:04,497 --> 01:12:08,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So I walked by the modern hardware, which is chaos machine.

1016
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:10,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I went there, that's broken.

1017
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:16,583
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I'm gonna move my car to my friend's building across the way, around the corner.

1018
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:19,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Come back there, there's a ticket on my car.

1019
01:12:20,727 --> 01:12:26,872
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so I went up to the main street, which I used to live right up the street from there many years ago.

1020
01:12:28,293 --> 01:12:31,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked the attendant, I says, I wanna appeal these tickets.

1021
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:34,939
[SPEAKER_11]: She says, okay, it'll cost you $25 to appeal the ticket.

1022
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:36,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So I give her $25 in cash.

1023
01:12:37,848 --> 01:12:38,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I got an application.

1024
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:40,290
[SPEAKER_11]: They filled it all out.

1025
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:42,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard anything from them.

1026
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:44,814
[SPEAKER_11]: But three weeks later, I got a notice.

1027
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:49,097
[SPEAKER_11]: You read a pay within seven days or we suspend your license or your registration.

1028
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:50,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went back.

1029
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:56,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I said to the lady there, can I have my $25 back if I pay both tickets?

1030
01:12:56,563 --> 01:12:57,164
[SPEAKER_11]: She says, no.

1031
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:02,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, you mean to tell me you took $25 from me for an appeal?

1032
01:13:03,902 --> 01:13:06,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, you're not giving me a piano, you're giving me my money back.

1033
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:07,687
[SPEAKER_11]: She says, no.

1034
01:13:08,128 --> 01:13:10,731
[SPEAKER_11]: She says, unless you pay a debt, we're going to suspend your license.

1035
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, where's your manager?

1036
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So she gave me her phone number.

1037
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:15,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I called her for a week.

1038
01:13:15,778 --> 01:13:16,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

1039
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:20,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So I finally, you know, I said to myself, forget, give up.

1040
01:13:20,736 --> 01:13:26,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my friend there, a gentleman, we happened to have coffee, so he happened to mention about this.

1041
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:27,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And there I am.

1042
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,241
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I work in Method a lot, quite a bit.

1043
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:34,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very, very difficult.

1044
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:39,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a commercial vehicle that I do a service call, which in like five minutes, 10 minutes.

1045
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:41,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I had pictures.

1046
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:43,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I showed this gentleman at the,

1047
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,781
[SPEAKER_11]: what they call the parking place there, where it says, 30 minutes free parking.

1048
01:13:50,321 --> 01:14:09,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what that means, because then I got smart, so I parked my car in my friend's parking lot, you know, in the rear there on Salem Street, and I sat at Dunkin' Donuts and watched a guy, a lady, a poor little old lady with a cane, from her car,

1049
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,239
[SPEAKER_11]: to the chaos machine.

1050
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,223
[SPEAKER_11]: He bought a ticket before she had the chance to put the money into the chaos machine.

1051
01:14:17,884 --> 01:14:18,724
[SPEAKER_11]: That's disgusting.

1052
01:14:19,645 --> 01:14:21,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody should do something about it.

1053
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:22,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1054
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:23,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1055
01:14:23,809 --> 01:14:24,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1056
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:24,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

1057
01:14:24,809 --> 01:14:25,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good night.

1058
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight, before you leave, sir.

1059
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:28,372
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple questions.

1060
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:32,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you leave, Councilor Knight has some questions for you.

1061
01:14:32,356 --> 01:14:34,838
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just wondering if you had the dates as to when these tickets were issued.

1062
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,259
[SPEAKER_11]: couple months ago.

1063
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:40,601
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can get you a date on the next meeting.

1064
01:14:41,301 --> 01:14:42,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all the paperwork.

1065
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:43,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Show me an email.

1066
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:44,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to be interested.

1067
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:45,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a look.

1068
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, in fact, it was a surprise.

1069
01:14:48,686 --> 01:14:51,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I can take a look at those.

1070
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:52,388
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd appreciate it.

1071
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:52,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1072
01:14:53,008 --> 01:14:53,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Scott.

1073
01:14:53,609 --> 01:14:53,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy.

1074
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:54,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, don't go away.

1075
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:55,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't go away.

1076
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:55,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh,

1077
01:14:58,378 --> 01:15:04,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I should have never left Metro.

1078
01:15:05,059 --> 01:15:11,781
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that a lot of us have received some phone calls with these simple issues that are very big.

1079
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:22,082
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that this council has asked for meetings, and we've had meetings with the Republic Park, or have they changed their names again?

1080
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:23,162
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's the Republic Park.

1081
01:15:23,202 --> 01:15:23,523
[SPEAKER_16]: So good.

1082
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:39,966
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate you coming up and talking about it, because we've had a lot of concerns with, you know, I've had a person call that they got a ticket of 201 for blocking the sidewalk as they parked in the driveway.

1083
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:41,446
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something that simple.

1084
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:46,009
[SPEAKER_16]: So the understanding that our residents don't know what

1085
01:15:47,029 --> 01:16:00,815
[SPEAKER_16]: what's going on and when it's going on is very important that we meet again and really start pounding and putting some — you saw what just happened when this council works together and putting restrictions in, things happen.

1086
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:04,257
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate you coming out and sharing that, because I think we need to do the same.

1087
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:05,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much.

1088
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:14,602
[SPEAKER_02]: On that same point, Councilor Schapiro is right, and I think it was probably four months back where we were inundated with complaints.

1089
01:16:15,049 --> 01:16:20,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did sit down with Republic Park, and maybe this was around the same time that you were getting the tickets, about four or five months ago.

1090
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:26,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a whole new changeover in staff that wasn't trained properly.

1091
01:16:26,156 --> 01:16:31,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did meet with the head of the company that's in charge of this area, and he did reassure us.

1092
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And we cracked the whip, and we asked the mayor to do the same.

1093
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:40,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then, the complaints that I've received have slowed down tremendously.

1094
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:44,207
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a time frame, a couple months span, where we were getting

1095
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:46,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a couple complaints a day, it seemed like.

1096
01:16:46,987 --> 01:16:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just that the draft was not trained properly, which.

1097
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to get a handle on if they have another turnover.

1098
01:16:53,003 --> 01:16:55,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just letting you know, we did meet with the company.

1099
01:16:55,864 --> 01:17:16,972
[SPEAKER_11]: The only comments I have about this is if the machine is broken, two machines are broken, and you have a picture of them, because these iPhones, the best thing in the world, and you go up to the, someone in the office should say, okay, we made it happen, what happened, I'm going to send someone to fix it.

1100
01:17:17,812 --> 01:17:24,035
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you walk into that office two or three times, I have nothing to do with this.

1101
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:27,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you here if you have nothing to do with this?

1102
01:17:27,577 --> 01:17:28,697
[SPEAKER_11]: See the city councilor.

1103
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:29,437
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm here.

1104
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:30,598
[SPEAKER_11]: See the mayor.

1105
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:33,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the mayor is busy.

1106
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,200
[SPEAKER_11]: She has a lot to do.

1107
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,821
[SPEAKER_11]: City councilor is busy.

1108
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:40,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone should be in that office that can answer these questions.

1109
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,383
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go after it now.

1110
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:45,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Mox.

1111
01:17:45,772 --> 01:17:47,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a quick question so I understand.

1112
01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:50,617
[SPEAKER_10]: You paid the $25 to have a hearing.

1113
01:17:50,918 --> 01:17:51,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1114
01:17:51,178 --> 01:17:54,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you decided to pay the tickets and you didn't want the hearing.

1115
01:17:54,682 --> 01:17:55,683
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

1116
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:56,604
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wrong.

1117
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:58,046
[SPEAKER_15]: He was denied.

1118
01:17:58,146 --> 01:17:59,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I was denied.

1119
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Not denied.

1120
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:00,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I was never denied.

1121
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:12,314
[SPEAKER_11]: never notified, but my next notification was, if I don't pay $45 within seven days, I would have my license pulled away and my registration pulled away.

1122
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,814
[SPEAKER_11]: But you never had a hearing.

1123
01:18:14,214 --> 01:18:15,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And they never gave me the money back.

1124
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:24,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, we should also request, Mr. President, that this gentleman get his money back, first of all.

1125
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,390
[SPEAKER_10]: The $25 is for a hearing, if he never had a hearing.

1126
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:30,191
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can get me the information, I would be happy to.

1127
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:30,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I will.

1128
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:31,851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my counsel's will.

1129
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:32,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I will, absolutely.

1130
01:18:32,991 --> 01:18:34,872
[SPEAKER_15]: If you give it to Ray, Ray will give it to me.

1131
01:18:35,072 --> 01:18:36,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I will, I will.

1132
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:39,513
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding, Mr. President, when these kiosks are not working,

1133
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:47,500
[SPEAKER_10]: that they get an electronic message to their main office, so they know when these machines aren't working.

1134
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not even a matter of them going out or having a resident say they're not working.

1135
01:18:51,644 --> 01:19:03,595
[SPEAKER_10]: They know when they're malfunctioning, and they should be out there immediately servicing these machines so residents don't have to walk 30, 40, 50 yards to get another kiosk, which is unacceptable in my opinion.

1136
01:19:04,135 --> 01:19:06,678
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if we can make that part of the report, too, Mr. President.

1137
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:12,065
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the turnaround once they get notified of a kiosk that's malfunctioning?

1138
01:19:12,987 --> 01:19:15,310
[SPEAKER_20]: And please give that to Ray and let Ray give it to me.

1139
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,394
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it, Mr. President.

1140
01:19:18,594 --> 01:19:20,496
[SPEAKER_20]: It almost sounds like the gentleman received two tickets, right?

1141
01:19:22,538 --> 01:19:23,579
[SPEAKER_20]: You received two tickets and you paid $25.

1142
01:19:23,619 --> 01:19:26,621
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one was almost on purpose.

1143
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:27,021
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one?

1144
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:28,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to see what.

1145
01:19:28,402 --> 01:19:30,624
[SPEAKER_21]: So you came in there and you went and paid 25 bucks.

1146
01:19:30,704 --> 01:19:31,984
[SPEAKER_11]: I paid for both tickets.

1147
01:19:32,004 --> 01:19:32,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you paid for both tickets.

1148
01:19:32,825 --> 01:19:33,765
[SPEAKER_21]: I paid for both tickets.

1149
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:34,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, all right.

1150
01:19:34,806 --> 01:19:37,308
[SPEAKER_21]: It's sad because it almost sounded like you paid for one but not the other.

1151
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:37,708
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

1152
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:39,909
[SPEAKER_21]: When you went in there, you appealed one and paid for one.

1153
01:19:39,929 --> 01:19:39,969
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1154
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus I paid $25 for the appeal and I got the money back.

1155
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:46,113
[SPEAKER_11]: All set?

1156
01:19:46,594 --> 01:19:46,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1157
01:19:47,194 --> 01:19:47,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1158
01:19:47,555 --> 01:19:48,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good night.

1159
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:49,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1160
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:49,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

1161
01:19:49,977 --> 01:19:50,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1162
01:19:50,437 --> 01:19:53,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

1163
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Scaffo has not completed his.

1164
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:57,804
[SPEAKER_15]: He has one more thing to read.

1165
01:19:57,864 --> 01:19:58,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Real quick.

1166
01:19:58,805 --> 01:19:59,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Real quick.

1167
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:05,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Brianna, I'm going to blow your meeting out of the water that you had with Republicans.

1168
01:20:06,071 --> 01:20:11,376
[SPEAKER_03]: July 15th, a resident at Yale Street

1169
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: He purchased a vehicle, no he didn't purchase a vehicle, he changed his plates from one state to our state.

1170
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:22,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Got his plates that day, put them on.

1171
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:29,305
[SPEAKER_03]: At night, he got a ticket for an expired inspection sticker.

1172
01:20:29,786 --> 01:20:36,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when you have new plates going on in your vehicle, you have seven days to get your vehicle inspected.

1173
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:51,031
[SPEAKER_03]: For what reason that they give these tickets out without knowing or I don't know if they have a program that they can reach into the registry to be able to see what the situation is.

1174
01:20:51,091 --> 01:21:02,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they shouldn't be just going and giving a ticket for an inspection sticker unless they know for sure that there's a valid reason to give that inspection sticker, a ticket.

1175
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what happened is that he, like I say, he purchased the new plates.

1176
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:15,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That evening, that same evening, he got a ticket for an inspection that wasn't valid.

1177
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I say, he has 10 days to get that sticker.

1178
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, that cost him, I'm not even sure what the amount was, $25.

1179
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he appeal?

1180
01:21:25,063 --> 01:21:26,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he appeal the ticket?

1181
01:21:26,644 --> 01:21:30,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Because obviously it was issued in violation of law.

1182
01:21:30,045 --> 01:21:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he has appealed the ticket, but he hasn't gotten a hearing.

1183
01:21:36,327 --> 01:21:49,830
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is that if they're going to be tagging for inspection stickers and stuff like that, they should be able to be in their computer, that they should be able to get to the registry to see if they can actually do this.

1184
01:21:49,930 --> 01:22:01,892
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could get me a copy of that one also, along with that other gentleman's, it would be appreciated and we'll bring it to the attention of park managers.

1185
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:02,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have it with you?

1186
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,553
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'll have to get it to you.

1187
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:07,374
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can get it and give it to me, I'd appreciate it.

1188
01:22:07,394 --> 01:22:13,015
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think maybe it's time that we schedule another hearing, a meeting with the parking benefit people.

1189
01:22:13,035 --> 01:22:13,596
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my closing.

1190
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:24,819
[SPEAKER_03]: My closing, if you don't mind, I'm requesting that the council have a public meeting and to have a representative of public parking to discuss these inconsistencies.

1191
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be a good idea to get the citizens involved in this.

1192
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're really going to see how inconsistent this is.

1193
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:42,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we've had a public meeting with them before, and as Councilor Longo said, tickets slowed down dramatically and a lot of things did get corrected.

1194
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:45,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that was about six months ago?

1195
01:22:45,887 --> 01:22:46,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Less.

1196
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:46,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Four months ago?

1197
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:47,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Less than that.

1198
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so maybe it's time we have another hearing with them.

1199
01:22:50,453 --> 01:22:56,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, it is a public hearing and we can bring some other things to their attention.

1200
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I think every meeting that we have is a public meeting.

1201
01:22:59,382 --> 01:23:02,866
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, every meeting that the council has when we convene is a public meeting.

1202
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:06,950
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think also that it's important to point out that, you know,

1203
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:23,689
[SPEAKER_21]: oversight and the implementation of the traffic regulations falls under the jurisdiction and purview of the Traffic Commission and Republican come all they want, but if the Traffic Commission is not on board as the oversight agency, then we could be talking to a deaf ear as we're talking to the wall.

1204
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:25,932
[SPEAKER_21]: This is under the purview of the Traffic Commission.

1205
01:23:26,312 --> 01:23:28,053
[SPEAKER_21]: This is something the Traffic Commission establishes.

1206
01:23:28,093 --> 01:23:38,301
[SPEAKER_21]: They've contracted out with an entity for parking management purposes and the purposes of the contract is to enforce the existing parking ordinances that are constructed through the Traffic and Parking Commission.

1207
01:23:38,341 --> 01:23:41,964
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I think that if we're going to do anything, that it should be important that they're involved as well, Mr. President.

1208
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:47,027
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can totally understand, however, you know, also looking at this thing on a

1209
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:50,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Citywide basis there are there there are inconsistencies.

1210
01:23:50,771 --> 01:24:13,019
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no question about it, but I Think that we need to come up with a better solution Then you know I have this ticket happened on this day at this place this guy did this at this place You know that that approach doesn't really bring us to a solution mr. President, and I think we need to come up with some solutions as to what it is that we need to do and some of these things that are going on in the community have been what I would call a

1211
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:17,182
[SPEAKER_21]: laughable in moments, and you know what I mean, just wrong in others.

1212
01:24:17,662 --> 01:24:23,187
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've had good luck in speaking with Mr. Stackhouse and explaining the situations that are going on in the community.

1213
01:24:23,227 --> 01:24:37,958
[SPEAKER_21]: But part of the issue that I have, Mr. President, is that when we said, let's bring parking into Medford, let's bring parking enforcement into Medford, that the focus was on freeing up spots in our central business districts to prevent people from other communities coming in here and taking up spots in our downtowns.

1214
01:24:38,518 --> 01:24:40,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's expanded upon that.

1215
01:24:40,519 --> 01:24:57,825
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was a little bit more comfortable when the focus was on our business districts, not in our neighborhoods, not on streets that are dead ends, not on streets that, you know, have had families living on these streets for 30 and 40 years, like Sylvia Road, where they have individuals that have a system of how they park because they've all lived together and they're good neighbors and they know what's going on.

1216
01:24:57,885 --> 01:25:01,426
[SPEAKER_21]: So, they might block a driveway or they might park with two tires up on the curb.

1217
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,048
[SPEAKER_21]: so that cars can get by.

1218
01:25:03,068 --> 01:25:08,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, the gentleman on Brookings Street, Brooks Parker, spoke about a commercial vehicle where the guy lives on Sylvia Road.

1219
01:25:08,574 --> 01:25:10,416
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that vehicle's off of Sylvia Road.

1220
01:25:10,456 --> 01:25:11,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Why was it off of Sylvia Road?

1221
01:25:11,437 --> 01:25:13,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the neighbors went to him and said, you can't park your car here.

1222
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:14,640
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a commercial plate.

1223
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,982
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't get up and down the street.

1224
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:17,003
[SPEAKER_21]: And they policed themselves.

1225
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:19,245
[SPEAKER_21]: And they've been able to do that successfully for a number of years.

1226
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:20,967
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're coming into a situation now where

1227
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:26,308
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Park Medford's focus is leaving the business districts and coming more towards the residential neighborhoods.

1228
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:33,110
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to really realign and refocus the direction that they're going in, because I don't think it's making the residents' quality of life any better.

1229
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:37,531
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't think that it's really meeting the objective and goal that was stated when they first came up.

1230
01:25:37,551 --> 01:25:41,872
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate you taking the time to come up here, Mr. Scott, for all the work you're putting into doing it and investigating.

1231
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:42,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1232
01:25:42,812 --> 01:25:43,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1233
01:25:49,252 --> 01:25:50,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1234
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:53,334
[SPEAKER_04]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1235
01:25:53,874 --> 01:25:57,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to touch base a little bit on this one situation.

1236
01:25:58,996 --> 01:26:09,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I have traveled just about every business district in Medford, as well as a lot of the residents, and I think that this is, I actually agree with Adam Knight that this is a systemic problem.

1237
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,102
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a singular problem in specific areas of the city.

1238
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by systemic is that I really firmly believe that it's time to take Republican, kind of put their feet to the coals at this point and decide what it is that we want to do with this program.

1239
01:26:26,068 --> 01:26:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not behoove the city to not have somebody that's working with this program that doesn't have a vested interest in the city.

1240
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:34,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what's happening.

1241
01:26:34,492 --> 01:26:39,135
[SPEAKER_04]: On a customer service level, I think what we've done is unfortunately we've made a lot of people unhappy.

1242
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:43,799
[SPEAKER_04]: whether they're traveling from downtown to downtown or even some of the businesses.

1243
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I beg to differ in one area in the respect of talking to the business owners.

1244
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:55,090
[SPEAKER_04]: If you talk to a lot of the business owners, a lot of them will blame their current business status on the parking.

1245
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And perceptions are realities.

1246
01:26:56,931 --> 01:27:01,075
[SPEAKER_04]: When someone's perception is that, you know, their business is down, that's their reality.

1247
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:03,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have to take that into consideration.

1248
01:27:04,317 --> 01:27:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, what we've also done in creating this situation, again, going back to Adam's, Councilor Knight's point, is that we've actually forced, yes, there are extra parking spaces in the downtowns, but we've forced those commuters into the neighborhoods, even further in, deeper in.

1249
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really hasn't helped it's actually hurt tremendously.

1250
01:27:24,332 --> 01:27:42,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's either we put Republic on notice And let them know that this contract is not a contract that we're all excited about anymore that we need to kind of put their feet to the fire and make something happen for the for the downtown communities for the for the citizens and allow them to be able to go in and out of their downtowns feeling good and

1251
01:27:43,061 --> 01:27:44,622
[SPEAKER_04]: about what they want to accomplish.

1252
01:27:44,662 --> 01:27:48,603
[SPEAKER_04]: The kiosks, my personal opinion, do not work in downtowns.

1253
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:49,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't work.

1254
01:27:49,683 --> 01:27:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: They're better in parking lots and garages, but they're certainly not good on downtown streets.

1255
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:57,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my opinion, and I think it's time.

1256
01:27:57,225 --> 01:28:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually feel bad that the city council has to address all of these issues when it actually should be an in-house program for the city, created by the city, controlled by the city, not another outside entity.

1257
01:28:09,488 --> 01:28:09,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1258
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:15,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1259
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:15,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1260
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:19,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1261
01:28:19,805 --> 01:28:26,110
[SPEAKER_06]: When Republic Parking first came in, I did a videotape to bring it to the attention of the public, and it never got on TV.

1262
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:32,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, an elected official allegedly is parked in a fire lane, so I told Roy Belson,

1263
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:39,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if our elected officials are going to flagrantly violate the rules, why should the citizens pay for parking?

1264
01:28:40,513 --> 01:28:43,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sin, it's a shame, and that individual should not be re-elected.

1265
01:28:44,336 --> 01:28:44,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1266
01:28:46,397 --> 01:28:51,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to receive and place on file, seconded by...

1267
01:28:53,522 --> 01:28:55,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco, all in favor?

1268
01:28:55,843 --> 01:28:56,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1269
01:28:56,323 --> 01:28:58,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1270
01:28:58,403 --> 01:29:09,125
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-606, petition for a sign denial reversal by Pastor Exeter Febrea for Evangelical Haitians Church of Somerville, 400 High Street, Medford.

1271
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:11,046
[SPEAKER_15]: OCD number 2017-4.

1272
01:29:11,086 --> 01:29:13,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Sign exceeds allowable face.

1273
01:29:14,146 --> 01:29:15,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Allowable face size.

1274
01:29:26,617 --> 01:29:33,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the petitioner here?

1275
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:40,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1276
01:29:41,328 --> 01:29:41,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1277
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:44,491
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening, everybody.

1278
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:50,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Marie Wolverson, representing Pastor Fabio.

1279
01:29:51,036 --> 01:29:54,699
[SPEAKER_28]: He is not here, and my colleague here, Mr. Ulrich German.

1280
01:29:57,303 --> 01:29:59,505
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to first apologize.

1281
01:29:59,705 --> 01:30:07,430
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe that I was supposed to attend a meeting, the last meeting that you guys have, and I was overseas.

1282
01:30:08,211 --> 01:30:17,177
[SPEAKER_28]: And I came back and found the voicemail, and I wasn't even able to alert Pastor Fabio of the meeting because my phone was off.

1283
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:20,980
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I apologize if I have wasted anybody's time.

1284
01:30:24,937 --> 01:30:43,147
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe that you guys met on the old denial sign as well, which I wasn't supposed to be on the table anymore, because I was told to sign.

1285
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:58,822
[SPEAKER_28]: get started, start over on a new size, new pedestal, because the size of the sign was too big and the pedestal was too high the last time we met.

1286
01:30:59,936 --> 01:31:10,525
[SPEAKER_28]: So I went right back downstairs and talked to John Bavuzzo, and we fill out a brand-new application and start it over.

1287
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:14,207
[SPEAKER_28]: So I was waiting to hear from John.

1288
01:31:15,628 --> 01:31:21,151
[SPEAKER_28]: the city on either an approval or denial of that second application.

1289
01:31:21,251 --> 01:31:27,433
[SPEAKER_28]: So I haven't heard from any, I didn't hear from anyone, so we were just waiting to hear.

1290
01:31:27,573 --> 01:31:33,456
[SPEAKER_28]: So when I came back from vacation, I went back downstairs and find out, well, we had a denial the whole time.

1291
01:31:33,476 --> 01:31:36,357
[SPEAKER_28]: They just never told us, told the church about it.

1292
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:37,918
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's the second.

1293
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:43,403
[SPEAKER_28]: application that you guys have right now, the second denial that you guys have on the second size.

1294
01:31:43,923 --> 01:31:49,228
[SPEAKER_28]: As you can see, the pedestal of the new site is way down to the floor.

1295
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:55,734
[SPEAKER_28]: It comes from 3.6 inches to way down to one inch, and I believe that was one of the concerns.

1296
01:31:56,175 --> 01:31:59,518
[SPEAKER_28]: The size went up, went down from 5 by 8 to 4 by 8.

1297
01:32:00,839 --> 01:32:04,721
[SPEAKER_16]: The point of information, if I can, the big issue was it was 11 feet.

1298
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1299
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:07,462
[SPEAKER_16]: If you remember, it wasn't in inches.

1300
01:32:08,142 --> 01:32:13,024
[SPEAKER_16]: The sign was 5 by 8, which I think wasn't something that we had questioned about.

1301
01:32:13,044 --> 01:32:14,945
[SPEAKER_16]: The question we had that it rose to 11 feet.

1302
01:32:14,985 --> 01:32:15,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1303
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,886
[SPEAKER_16]: So now it's back down to the ground 5 by 8.

1304
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:17,286
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1305
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:25,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1306
01:32:26,106 --> 01:32:27,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have anything else to state?

1307
01:32:28,088 --> 01:32:28,468
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

1308
01:32:28,828 --> 01:32:29,989
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, was I talking too much?

1309
01:32:30,069 --> 01:32:31,270
[SPEAKER_28]: No, no, no.

1310
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:33,831
[SPEAKER_28]: We're here to listen.

1311
01:32:33,991 --> 01:32:35,132
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, no, I'm done.

1312
01:32:35,192 --> 01:32:36,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Knight.

1313
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:39,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you very much for your patience going through the process.

1314
01:32:39,575 --> 01:32:43,698
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it can be a confusing and daunting task sometimes to get involved in government when you're not familiar with it.

1315
01:32:45,145 --> 01:32:48,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, ultimately the sign was 11 feet tall when it was brought forward.

1316
01:32:48,027 --> 01:32:54,810
[SPEAKER_21]: They had a rendering of a gentleman that said it was six feet tall, and next to the guy there was a sign that went way over his head, so we all had a number of concerns about that.

1317
01:32:55,911 --> 01:33:05,096
[SPEAKER_21]: It's at the location of the church right next to the book school, so there was some concerns about sight lines and visibility and whether or not it was gonna impact pedestrians and cars driving up the street and so forth.

1318
01:33:05,756 --> 01:33:12,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I think in our discussions, we said that we're not really opposed to the sign being five by eight, but based upon the rendering that we have here,

1319
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,822
[SPEAKER_21]: confirmation and some assurances that, you know what I mean, it's going to be a little different.

1320
01:33:16,922 --> 01:33:23,125
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is something that I've been waiting to hear at the council floor since you came in for your first application.

1321
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:26,866
[SPEAKER_21]: We went through the subcommittee process and the subcommittee did a great job on it.

1322
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:31,208
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, and I certainly don't have a problem supporting the sign this evening and I'll move for approval, Mr. President.

1323
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:32,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I second that.

1324
01:33:32,549 --> 01:33:33,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion on the floor for approval?

1325
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:35,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1326
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:41,853
[SPEAKER_10]: By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor, motion by Councilor Scapelli, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1327
01:33:42,233 --> 01:33:45,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have one question, this is not internally illuminated?

1328
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:47,295
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not illuminated, right?

1329
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:48,595
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not illuminated, sorry.

1330
01:33:49,155 --> 01:33:50,796
[SPEAKER_28]: It is illuminated?

1331
01:33:50,816 --> 01:33:51,696
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it always has been.

1332
01:33:52,857 --> 01:33:53,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I retract that.

1333
01:33:53,817 --> 01:33:59,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I don't recall, I don't see it in the bonds, logos, right now.

1334
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,080
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't state it in the.

1335
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,281
[SPEAKER_28]: It is if you look in the application.

1336
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because what you gave to us doesn't state that it's illuminated.

1337
01:34:09,192 --> 01:34:13,615
[SPEAKER_10]: So the application doesn't come before us.

1338
01:34:13,935 --> 01:34:14,555
[SPEAKER_10]: That was denied.

1339
01:34:14,575 --> 01:34:16,156
[SPEAKER_10]: PVC and internal lighting.

1340
01:34:16,296 --> 01:34:16,556
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

1341
01:34:20,799 --> 01:34:24,061
[SPEAKER_16]: The original didn't have that.

1342
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:27,583
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep, the first one was and the second one is as well.

1343
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,220
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not being denied because of lighting.

1344
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,481
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't.

1345
01:34:33,621 --> 01:34:37,781
[SPEAKER_28]: It was always size and height.

1346
01:34:37,921 --> 01:34:38,722
[SPEAKER_10]: It was always height.

1347
01:34:38,902 --> 01:34:48,143
[SPEAKER_10]: But this council has been on record for many of the previous signs, in particular freestanding signs against the elimination.

1348
01:34:48,363 --> 01:34:50,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially hours of operation.

1349
01:34:50,063 --> 01:34:53,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a recommendation with elimination?

1350
01:34:53,284 --> 01:34:53,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a question.

1351
01:34:54,304 --> 01:34:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilwoman O'Connor.

1352
01:34:55,384 --> 01:34:58,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the chair, when will the elimination take place?

1353
01:34:59,757 --> 01:35:05,522
[SPEAKER_02]: 24, is it during the dark 24-7, or will it be shut off at 10 p.m.?

1354
01:35:05,642 --> 01:35:16,431
[SPEAKER_28]: No, just during daylight, just during, because we, a pastor is going to be during, during church, during 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning.

1355
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:22,155
[SPEAKER_28]: until 6 o'clock at night, we're off, we're done.

1356
01:35:22,636 --> 01:35:28,421
[SPEAKER_28]: Because it's only for message during the day, and during service hours, and then it's off again.

1357
01:35:28,581 --> 01:35:30,602
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's not going to be on at night at all.

1358
01:35:30,923 --> 01:35:32,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so it will be in service.

1359
01:35:32,244 --> 01:35:32,924
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely.

1360
01:35:33,084 --> 01:35:34,285
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just message during service.

1361
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:35,647
[SPEAKER_28]: What pastor wants to do

1362
01:35:36,287 --> 01:35:43,572
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't want – we want to kind of offer a message to the community during service hours and during day.

1363
01:35:43,932 --> 01:35:46,954
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't want this to be like just solely a Haitian church.

1364
01:35:47,014 --> 01:35:52,718
[SPEAKER_28]: We just want to have services, second service, an English service, offering

1365
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:54,299
[SPEAKER_28]: the community to come in.

1366
01:35:54,400 --> 01:36:01,607
[SPEAKER_28]: We just want to put a message out there that they can come in for services during service hours, during Sundays.

1367
01:36:02,648 --> 01:36:04,510
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't want this to be solely Haitian church.

1368
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:04,930
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

1369
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:08,434
[SPEAKER_28]: We do not want this to be all night because that's electricity.

1370
01:36:08,774 --> 01:36:11,317
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you know my pastor, it ain't going to happen.

1371
01:36:11,457 --> 01:36:14,500
[SPEAKER_28]: It will not have that electricity going in at night.

1372
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,561
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not going to happen.

1373
01:36:16,342 --> 01:36:17,743
[SPEAKER_28]: Councillor Del Rosso.

1374
01:36:17,823 --> 01:36:31,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman, both chairman of this meeting and all of the side committee, I offer a motion of approval for this Lux Chalorum.

1375
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:32,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1376
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:40,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I could make the condition, a portion of the sign is for messaging.

1377
01:36:40,873 --> 01:36:41,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1378
01:36:41,993 --> 01:36:45,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So so you anticipate to have what a rotation of

1379
01:36:46,424 --> 01:36:48,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, messaging is coming for Sunday service.

1380
01:36:48,806 --> 01:36:52,969
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a message that's going to come in on Sunday.

1381
01:36:53,049 --> 01:36:57,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Please come in on Sunday for service at this hour, 9 o'clock service.

1382
01:36:57,513 --> 01:36:58,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Sunday school starts.

1383
01:36:59,094 --> 01:37:02,797
[SPEAKER_28]: Just general message for people to come in on our Sunday school service.

1384
01:37:03,418 --> 01:37:10,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you aware of the current sign ordinance that regulates how often you can change a sign, the messaging on a sign?

1385
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:19,558
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, we don't, but my pastor is kind of not very technical savvy, so somebody's going to have to help him with that.

1386
01:37:20,018 --> 01:37:23,559
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm pretty sure that, you know, one of us is going to have to help him.

1387
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:26,340
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's probably not going to be... It's probably going to be...

1388
01:37:27,515 --> 01:37:31,458
[SPEAKER_28]: It's probably going to be on a rotation basis, whatever message that we put in.

1389
01:37:32,139 --> 01:37:33,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Councilwoman Gilker.

1390
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to clear it up, it's not going to be a scrolling message.

1391
01:37:36,342 --> 01:37:40,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like one week it will say the X, the next week it will say something different.

1392
01:37:40,846 --> 01:37:42,527
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's going to be something every 10 seconds.

1393
01:37:42,908 --> 01:37:43,188
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1394
01:37:43,688 --> 01:37:47,652
[SPEAKER_28]: It's basically just really kind of like the message of Sunday.

1395
01:37:48,192 --> 01:37:53,875
[SPEAKER_28]: Sunday school mostly, like Sunday school date of events mostly.

1396
01:37:53,935 --> 01:37:56,296
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, we had an event in September.

1397
01:37:56,676 --> 01:37:59,057
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't had an event again since September.

1398
01:37:59,197 --> 01:38:03,499
[SPEAKER_28]: So basically, there wouldn't be anything to announce again until like every Sunday.

1399
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:06,241
[SPEAKER_28]: Sunday school, this is the schedule for Sunday.

1400
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,502
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a service once on Sunday.

1401
01:38:09,522 --> 01:38:15,165
[SPEAKER_28]: So if we do decide to go with the English language service, so it's going to be 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock.

1402
01:38:15,265 --> 01:38:16,666
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the two services that we have.

1403
01:38:17,126 --> 01:38:19,126
[SPEAKER_28]: And this is the messages that's going to be happening.

1404
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:21,387
[SPEAKER_28]: So, that's probably what we're going to be announcing.

1405
01:38:21,427 --> 01:38:31,929
[SPEAKER_28]: So, it's not going to be — it's not a business, so I don't see the need to have tons of messages every single day going on on this thing.

1406
01:38:32,249 --> 01:38:39,831
[SPEAKER_28]: So, on the week that we have revivals, which we have three times a year, revivals, we probably will have

1407
01:38:40,251 --> 01:38:45,934
[SPEAKER_28]: a message, say, this is what the message is going to be tonight, and tomorrow there's going to be another message.

1408
01:38:46,034 --> 01:38:49,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Every night there's going to be service for revival, seven days.

1409
01:38:49,676 --> 01:38:54,158
[SPEAKER_28]: So every day there's going to be a message for what the message is going to be tomorrow for revival.

1410
01:38:54,538 --> 01:38:55,598
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's that type of stuff.

1411
01:38:55,698 --> 01:38:57,319
[SPEAKER_16]: So Councilor Scott Pelley.

1412
01:38:57,439 --> 01:38:58,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I think this is why.

1413
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,742
[SPEAKER_16]: having that subcommittee.

1414
01:39:00,982 --> 01:39:02,184
[SPEAKER_16]: That meeting is so important.

1415
01:39:02,244 --> 01:39:02,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1416
01:39:03,185 --> 01:39:04,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm spinning right now.

1417
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:05,248
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be honest with you.

1418
01:39:05,348 --> 01:39:06,870
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to gauge.

1419
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:13,899
[SPEAKER_16]: So, the conversation would have been understanding what the ordinance is so you understood.

1420
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:14,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1421
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:16,723
[SPEAKER_16]: The more in-depth conversation would

1422
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:20,385
[SPEAKER_16]: would have been the acceptance of the size of the sign.

1423
01:39:20,805 --> 01:39:23,067
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's illuminated, would we accept it?

1424
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:23,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know.

1425
01:39:23,967 --> 01:39:31,132
[SPEAKER_16]: I look for guidance from my senior colleague on this committee.

1426
01:39:32,053 --> 01:39:33,393
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Falco has a question.

1427
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:41,391
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that the actual section that has the message piece?

1428
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:44,672
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, so the top part is going to be the logo of the church.

1429
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:46,932
[SPEAKER_28]: That's not going to be illuminated at all.

1430
01:39:47,052 --> 01:39:50,313
[SPEAKER_28]: That would cost the church way too much money.

1431
01:39:50,513 --> 01:39:52,613
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just literally down in the bottom.

1432
01:39:52,713 --> 01:39:53,833
[SPEAKER_28]: Just that revival piece.

1433
01:39:54,513 --> 01:39:55,454
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1434
01:39:55,774 --> 01:39:57,334
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm just trying to look at the sketch here.

1435
01:39:57,634 --> 01:39:59,454
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that three feet?

1436
01:40:04,185 --> 01:40:06,127
[SPEAKER_29]: It says you have one here and then four.

1437
01:40:06,147 --> 01:40:07,188
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that three feet of?

1438
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:12,042
[SPEAKER_29]: This here, is that?

1439
01:40:12,143 --> 01:40:13,803
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably two feet worth of.

1440
01:40:13,823 --> 01:40:14,424
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it two feet?

1441
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,865
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that's about like maybe.

1442
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Three feet of messaging?

1443
01:40:17,205 --> 01:40:17,445
[SPEAKER_28]: Two feet?

1444
01:40:17,926 --> 01:40:18,826
[SPEAKER_28]: That's about two feet.

1445
01:40:19,006 --> 01:40:20,187
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's about two feet of messaging?

1446
01:40:20,267 --> 01:40:21,448
[SPEAKER_28]: That's a lot less.

1447
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:26,451
[SPEAKER_29]: It looks like that's a foot there, so two, three, four, that's three feet of messaging.

1448
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:28,632
[SPEAKER_28]: This one is the pedestal.

1449
01:40:28,672 --> 01:40:29,472
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the pedestal.

1450
01:40:29,752 --> 01:40:30,913
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, so that takes you a foot out.

1451
01:40:31,373 --> 01:40:33,154
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, that's the pedestal.

1452
01:40:33,174 --> 01:40:34,715
[SPEAKER_29]: So one to four.

1453
01:40:35,876 --> 01:40:37,477
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, the whole width is four.

1454
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:39,052
[SPEAKER_28]: All the way to the top is four.

1455
01:40:39,072 --> 01:40:40,033
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, the whole thing is four.

1456
01:40:40,053 --> 01:40:41,394
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's half of it, it's two feet.

1457
01:40:41,414 --> 01:40:43,155
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, okay, so that's two feet, okay, okay.

1458
01:40:43,175 --> 01:40:45,037
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought there was a line there, I'm sorry, that's my mistake.

1459
01:40:45,057 --> 01:40:46,659
[SPEAKER_28]: So two feet is going to be.

1460
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:49,821
[SPEAKER_29]: So two feet, so it'll become almost like a mini movie screen almost?

1461
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:51,243
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, that's it, yeah.

1462
01:40:51,683 --> 01:40:51,883
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

1463
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:56,367
[SPEAKER_29]: No, because if you, that's actually, that's graphics.

1464
01:40:56,387 --> 01:40:56,748
[SPEAKER_29]: It's four.

1465
01:40:56,868 --> 01:40:58,149
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1466
01:40:58,169 --> 01:41:04,435
[SPEAKER_28]: The top part of it is going to be the logo, and then it's going to be the Evangelical Haitian Church, so that's just basically paper.

1467
01:41:05,222 --> 01:41:06,843
[SPEAKER_28]: That's not going to be illuminated.

1468
01:41:07,023 --> 01:41:08,864
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just the bottom part of it.

1469
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:09,325
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

1470
01:41:09,485 --> 01:41:11,286
[SPEAKER_28]: That's going to have to be the message of the day.

1471
01:41:12,007 --> 01:41:16,850
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Councilman, I might have a resolution, but I think that maybe that's what I'm looking for.

1472
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,510
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilman?

1473
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:25,576
[SPEAKER_21]: I personally, Mr. President, have lived next to churches and across from churches with my address on High Street where I have two churches that are right next to me.

1474
01:41:26,822 --> 01:41:29,166
[SPEAKER_21]: One church has a sign and one church doesn't.

1475
01:41:29,607 --> 01:41:36,118
[SPEAKER_21]: The church that has a sign that's in non-conformity with our sign ordinance always has message posted on it.

1476
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:38,422
[SPEAKER_21]: The church that doesn't have a sign,

1477
01:41:39,492 --> 01:41:42,075
[SPEAKER_21]: instead puts two stakes out there and puts a banner out there.

1478
01:41:42,155 --> 01:41:44,518
[SPEAKER_21]: And they change the banner from time to time and it looks awful.

1479
01:41:44,858 --> 01:41:45,899
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks absolutely terrible.

1480
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,762
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an eyesore to the neighborhood, really.

1481
01:41:48,362 --> 01:41:53,428
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that, you know, this isn't going to be harmful, provided that we can put some restrictions on it.

1482
01:41:54,129 --> 01:41:55,410
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a special permit request.

1483
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:59,635
[SPEAKER_21]: They're asking us to issue a special permit and we have some concerns about internal illumination.

1484
01:42:00,456 --> 01:42:16,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Assuming that the concerns of my council is have about internal illumination are that they don't want it lighting up the sky at night So we can put restrictions on it eight o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock Whatever it is that we feel comfortable And we could also put restrictions on it if we approve the sign to say that they won't put any hang any banners or any other

1485
01:42:16,946 --> 01:42:20,228
[SPEAKER_21]: type of materials in the front lawn, so ultimately we'll have a clean, crisp look.

1486
01:42:20,488 --> 01:42:36,738
[SPEAKER_21]: It may be a little bit bigger than we're used to, but at least we're still protecting the quality of life in the neighborhood, because I think a big sign that's lit up that's controlled in the certain hours that it's controlled to be litting up is much better for the neighborhood than two posts that are stuck up there with an old sign that's hanging down the middle, and then it gets changed every three days, and it flaps in the wind, and it looks terrible.

1487
01:42:37,419 --> 01:42:41,745
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm inclined this evening, Mr. President, to support the petition as filed.

1488
01:42:41,805 --> 01:42:47,453
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I know that my colleagues have concerns and I want to be a part of coming up with a solution that we can all have by putting our heads together.

1489
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:53,381
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that putting restrictions on the application would probably be a solution that could kind of satisfy everybody behind the rail.

1490
01:42:54,198 --> 01:43:05,423
[SPEAKER_10]: My recommendation as chairman of the committee would be because it's a freestanding sign, because it's internally illuminated, because it involves movement, I think it merits a subcommittee meeting.

1491
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:09,845
[SPEAKER_10]: We can get one within the next week and a half, two weeks, very soon.

1492
01:43:10,765 --> 01:43:13,406
[SPEAKER_10]: We had one already that I know you were out of town and couldn't attend.

1493
01:43:13,426 --> 01:43:21,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my recommendation to this body that we meet in subcommittee just to iron out and put forward the best proposal.

1494
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:31,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I too, I wouldn't, I just think, I concur with Councilor Knight putting some restrictions, but I think that has to be done in subcommittee.

1495
01:43:31,515 --> 01:43:37,718
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I support the subcommittee, moving this to subcommittee and doing it relatively soon.

1496
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:43,326
[SPEAKER_16]: which we can move pretty quickly, but I think we need that.

1497
01:43:43,766 --> 01:43:44,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1498
01:43:44,527 --> 01:43:44,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1499
01:43:44,747 --> 01:43:54,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I withdraw my motion for approval and second the motion that this be sent to the subcommittee on signs, et cetera.

1500
01:43:57,499 --> 01:43:58,460
[SPEAKER_21]: I no longer have a second.

1501
01:43:59,120 --> 01:43:59,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Second.

1502
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,621
[SPEAKER_21]: I no longer have a second.

1503
01:44:00,641 --> 01:44:02,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Pelly.

1504
01:44:02,382 --> 01:44:03,022
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor?

1505
01:44:03,242 --> 01:44:03,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

1506
01:44:03,582 --> 01:44:05,864
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, please mark me in opposition.

1507
01:44:06,464 --> 01:44:07,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you still chairing?

1508
01:44:08,105 --> 01:44:09,966
[SPEAKER_20]: He is still chairing.

1509
01:44:09,986 --> 01:44:11,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark Councilor Knight in opposition.

1510
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:19,091
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be sent to the subcommittee on signs, economic development and signs, within the next week or so.

1511
01:44:19,111 --> 01:44:20,692
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get notice from the city clerk.

1512
01:44:22,093 --> 01:44:23,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your patience.

1513
01:44:23,413 --> 01:44:24,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1514
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:29,900
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can, I don't know if we're still in suspension of the rules.

1515
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,341
[SPEAKER_16]: We are still in suspension of the rules.

1516
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:38,327
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can go to a paper in the committee to have friends from Wegmans

1517
01:44:41,682 --> 01:44:42,022
[SPEAKER_16]: if we can.

1518
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:44,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Marks is the chairman of that committee?

1519
01:44:59,099 --> 01:44:59,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

1520
01:44:59,379 --> 01:45:02,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I sat as chair in that subcommittee prior to our meeting.

1521
01:45:02,401 --> 01:45:04,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we can, point me in the right direction.

1522
01:45:25,887 --> 01:45:28,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize.

1523
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:30,609
[SPEAKER_16]: It was tabled.

1524
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:35,651
[SPEAKER_16]: We took up the sign.

1525
01:45:36,212 --> 01:45:44,715
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue was for the liquor, wine, and beer sign that was tabled and moved to subcommittee.

1526
01:45:46,096 --> 01:45:50,738
[SPEAKER_16]: We voted in two in favor to move that paper forward in approval.

1527
01:45:50,838 --> 01:45:54,960
[SPEAKER_16]: So we now bring it to the floor.

1528
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:55,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that.

1529
01:45:57,742 --> 01:46:00,084
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to accept the committee report.

1530
01:46:00,124 --> 01:46:04,388
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been accepted by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

1531
01:46:04,408 --> 01:46:05,148
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1532

[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_15]: Is the paper on the committee?

1535
01:46:09,532 --> 01:46:11,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Has the paper come off the floor?

1536
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:14,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Has the paper come off the floor to approve it?

1537
01:46:14,456 --> 01:46:15,597
[SPEAKER_14]: We just adopted it.

1538
01:46:15,617 --> 01:46:16,418
[SPEAKER_14]: We just adopted it?

01:46:16,438 --> 01:46:16,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_15]: We are also presented with an itemized breakdown Of how the monies will be spent be a further resolve that we will be That we be provided with the information at least one week prior to the city council meeting rather than in the night before Being told it's an emergency.

1557
01:48:24,569 --> 01:48:25,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo, Kern.

1558
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:30,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thank you President Carviello this sparked off of our july meeting.

1559
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:31,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe

1560
01:48:31,883 --> 01:48:39,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We were here about 5-ish in the evening and our meeting went until about 12, 12.30 in the morning.

1561
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:45,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the last agenda items was an expenditure of $4.5 million.

1562
01:48:47,985 --> 01:48:52,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to, you know, we did vote for it, but I woke up the next morning.

1563
01:48:52,507 --> 01:49:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I voiced my frustration with regards to a lack of a breakdown of that money, and then I woke up the next morning, and I, you know, was a little frustrated.

1564
01:49:03,471 --> 01:49:04,611
[SPEAKER_02]: My frustration continued.

1565
01:49:05,192 --> 01:49:14,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did email finance department, treasurer's department with all my additional questions, and I did eventually get the answers I wanted.

1566
01:49:15,092 --> 01:49:23,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a project that obviously needs to be done, but I just wanted to make a point to put it on the agenda to let people know that I was frustrated.

1567
01:49:23,714 --> 01:49:26,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We were given, again, $4.5 million.

1568
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:28,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We were given an explanation.

1569
01:49:28,975 --> 01:49:39,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, you know, a couple of lines in our agenda, we were given a four or five page explanation of the project broken down by individual streets.

1570
01:49:40,447 --> 01:49:41,388
[SPEAKER_02]: the night of our meeting.

1571
01:49:41,928 --> 01:49:47,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we notice it, it all depends on when we read additional information that's on our desk.

1572
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:52,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I was paying attention to the meeting and I didn't see it until it was actually before us.

1573
01:49:53,235 --> 01:50:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrambling to read it the night of a meeting at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night, it's difficult.

1574
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:08,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights were beaming on us and we were tired and it's some information that I would expect to receive at least

1575
01:50:09,117 --> 01:50:11,999
[SPEAKER_02]: a week prior to a vote of such magnitude.

1576
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to get a vote by the council.

1577
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:20,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And to continue with that, the explanation didn't have a breakdown of the money.

1578
01:50:21,346 --> 01:50:27,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It was broken down two different ways how we were going to get the money, but it wasn't broken down by street.

1579
01:50:28,031 --> 01:50:36,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, I got it the next day, but I would just like to request that the administration provides us

1580
01:50:37,515 --> 01:50:39,897
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we always talk about transparency.

1581
01:50:40,197 --> 01:50:45,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I just would like that we be provided information on expenditures a week prior to the meeting.

1582
01:50:46,122 --> 01:50:56,110
[SPEAKER_02]: That it be something, you know, we stuck strong tonight and we obviously hopefully will create some change going down the line on trench work and road work within our city.

1583
01:50:56,911 --> 01:50:59,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We stuck strong and had parking enforcement.

1584
01:51:00,932 --> 01:51:03,434
[SPEAKER_02]: a few months ago, and we made significant changes.

1585
01:51:03,855 --> 01:51:12,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to stick together as a body and say to our administration, we need information before it is presented on our council agenda.

1586
01:51:12,522 --> 01:51:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We should not be given information on a project, on an expenditure, on a bond request, the night of our meeting, at 7 o'clock at night.

1587
01:51:20,849 --> 01:51:24,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be weeks, if not days, before our meeting.

1588
01:51:24,832 --> 01:51:27,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And that expenditure should be broken down in detail.

1589
01:51:27,993 --> 01:51:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that wasn't done for us.

1590
01:51:29,494 --> 01:51:32,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something we're, as a body, not mandating.

1591
01:51:33,095 --> 01:51:41,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'd like to take a vote tonight that we request and mandate that we be given an explanation and a

1592
01:51:42,172 --> 01:51:54,958
[SPEAKER_02]: expenditure breakdown seven days prior to our meeting and make a change, and all stick together and try to be able to—I mean, it's very frustrating when you know, oh, the next day somebody's going to be asking you questions about it, and you don't have it.

1593
01:51:55,038 --> 01:51:59,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the information of how much money is going to go to Parris Street, how much money is going to go to Evans Street.

1594
01:51:59,861 --> 01:52:00,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know that.

1595
01:52:01,041 --> 01:52:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: We voted for it.

1596
01:52:01,922 --> 01:52:02,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very late.

1597
01:52:04,483 --> 01:52:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way it happened.

1598
01:52:05,824 --> 01:52:13,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think going forward, we owe it to the taxpayers of this community to get information prior to taking such serious votes.

1599
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:15,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd ask for a roll call vote on this.

1600
01:52:16,651 --> 01:52:20,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we can stick together and make a stand.

1601
01:52:21,635 --> 01:52:21,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1602
01:52:21,955 --> 01:52:23,556
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern.

1603
01:52:23,576 --> 01:52:25,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you want to speak?

1604
01:52:28,093 --> 01:52:29,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1605
01:52:29,274 --> 01:52:30,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1606
01:52:31,355 --> 01:52:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1607
01:52:33,877 --> 01:52:34,958
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a fraud.

1608
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:44,384
[SPEAKER_07]: This kind of pertains to what Councilor Brianna Longo Kern is talking about, but I had to leave that meeting that night.

1609
01:52:44,464 --> 01:52:53,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, with the breakdown of that money, can I ask, was Evans Street a part of that?

1610
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:54,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo Kern?

1611
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll forward you the breakdown.

1612
01:52:58,892 --> 01:53:00,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a page or two.

1613
01:53:00,313 --> 01:53:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe it was.

1614
01:53:03,275 --> 01:53:13,983
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I heard, what happened was after being told the street was going to be fixed this year, it's not this year.

1615
01:53:14,023 --> 01:53:14,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1616
01:53:14,603 --> 01:53:15,924
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

1617
01:53:15,964 --> 01:53:17,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I think you may be correct.

1618
01:53:17,846 --> 01:53:24,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Evan Street was not included in that expenditure request that came forward as being funded through another process.

1619
01:53:24,491 --> 01:53:26,012
[SPEAKER_21]: And from what I understand,

1620
01:53:26,993 --> 01:53:29,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I'm pretty frustrated about the 7th Street thing, too.

1621
01:53:30,215 --> 01:53:32,798
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we're looking at this 24, maybe 36 months now.

1622
01:53:33,158 --> 01:53:33,899
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been going on.

1623
01:53:34,499 --> 01:53:35,420
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's going out to bid.

1624
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,501
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be out to bid in May.

1625
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:38,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the bid never got awarded in May.

1626
01:53:39,484 --> 01:53:41,706
[SPEAKER_21]: Then, you know, work's going to start, you know, May, June.

1627
01:53:41,846 --> 01:53:42,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, now it's August.

1628
01:53:42,727 --> 01:53:43,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Work still hasn't started.

1629
01:53:44,248 --> 01:53:46,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm a little frustrated with the situation as well.

1630
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:48,992
[SPEAKER_21]: But the answer to your question, no, it wasn't included in that.

1631
01:53:49,052 --> 01:53:50,914
[SPEAKER_21]: It's being funded through a different mechanism and a different paper.

1632
01:53:51,499 --> 01:53:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have it in front of me.

1633
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:58,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to go through the list, Grove Street and Linden Street, new water mains, $830,000.

1634
01:53:58,221 --> 01:54:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Parris Street and Pinkert Street, new water mains, $790,000.

1635
01:54:00,582 --> 01:54:01,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydraulic models citywide, $30,000.

1636
01:54:01,402 --> 01:54:01,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Water meters, $150,000.

1637
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:02,162
[SPEAKER_02]: MTUs, $75,000.

1638
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:02,162
$225,000.

1639
01:54:02,222 --> 01:54:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Project is $350,000.

1640
01:54:02,542 --> 01:54:03,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the $125,000 in enterprise budget.

1641
01:54:04,143 --> 01:54:05,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Private lead service replacement was $200,000.

1642
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:36,288
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes into more detail, and then it says the contract is broken down as follows, year one, $1,298,445.09, water service and water main replacement as followed, and then Evans Street is listed under water main replacement.

1643
01:54:36,888 --> 01:54:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no construction of the road within this, but Evans Street, they do plan on.

1644
01:54:41,693 --> 01:54:43,415
[SPEAKER_07]: This year?

1645
01:54:44,993 --> 01:54:51,079
[SPEAKER_02]: year one of the contract, so I think that would be 2017, beginning of 2018, if I can recall.

1646
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:54,041
[SPEAKER_07]: So how are they going to do that work in the winter?

1647
01:54:55,763 --> 01:54:56,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1648
01:54:56,484 --> 01:55:03,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And how can you say that they're going to do water main repair without, I mean, to get to the water main, you have to dig up the street, so obviously.

1649
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:08,174
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why they haven't resurfaced the street, because they want to dig it up to make a water main surface.

1650
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:10,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That was always the plan, we're just hoping it would be repaved by now.

1651
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:22,533
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened was the contract got awarded to Mr. Capucci and then when the engineering department said that this is your construction schedule and your construction criteria, they said we can't meet those criteria, so you have to re-bid the construction.

1652
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:25,516
[SPEAKER_21]: So they backed out of the deal after they were awarded the contract.

1653
01:55:26,758 --> 01:55:29,020
[SPEAKER_21]: But from what I understand, they weren't one of the

1654
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:32,142
[SPEAKER_21]: preferred vendors that the city uses anyhow.

1655
01:55:32,222 --> 01:55:37,785
[SPEAKER_21]: So the product that they put out isn't necessarily one of the better ones, but based upon the public bid laws, that's who we were stuck with.

1656
01:55:38,945 --> 01:55:45,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Although it's been taking a long time, the delay may be a blessing, because from what I understand, the workmanship of that entity isn't necessarily the best of the best.

1657
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:50,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about it being a blessing, Councillor Knight.

1658
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: The residents on my street, knowing that I come to a lot of the city council meetings, they have been asking me for months now,

1659
01:55:59,174 --> 01:56:04,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Capucci, I'm in full agreement with the residents in your street that know that I come to a lot of city council meetings too, call me and say the same thing.

1660
01:56:04,957 --> 01:56:15,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I do not hold this council accountable for the street and road repair on Memphis Street pertaining to this year.

1661
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:19,764
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been decades since the street has been serviced.

1662
01:56:20,285 --> 01:56:28,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I speak tonight in favor of Councilor Longo Kern's resolution to have the specificities on future

1663
01:56:29,589 --> 01:56:52,556
[SPEAKER_07]: appropriations outlined because The Administration put out you know a letter that in good faith these counselors looked at and then notified the residents on my street who for years have been wanting heaven Street to be fixed and I think it was appropriate for you to do so, but then the along the

1664
01:56:53,616 --> 01:57:02,466
[SPEAKER_07]: chain of departments that it has to go through, the engineer's office, the purchaser's office, then out for bids, then back to the mayor to choose the bids.

1665
01:57:05,749 --> 01:57:07,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a serious ball dropped.

1666
01:57:07,772 --> 01:57:12,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish the residents on my street weren't told that it was going to be done in May.

1667
01:57:15,207 --> 01:57:31,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you stand resolved to hold whatever administration is in power to, you know, doing simple things like street and road repair, especially when it's gone for decades neglected

1668
01:57:32,080 --> 01:58:00,372
[SPEAKER_07]: In a city that, through different accounts, I mean, I sat through all the subcommittee meetings on the budget, and I see how expenditures not paid get thrown back into the general fund, to where it's now ballooned into tens of millions of dollars, and to tell any resident, the people that came up before, on brookings or curbs, or go up Adam Street on the hillside, go on any street up in the heights, for this city to be sitting on so much money,

1669
01:58:00,952 --> 01:58:03,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And simple things like road repairs aren't being done.

1670
01:58:07,557 --> 01:58:09,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little disheartening, for lack of a better term.

1671
01:58:09,799 --> 01:58:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you all vote in the affirmative on Councilor Brianna Longo's current excellent resolution.

1672
01:58:16,063 --> 01:58:16,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1673
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:16,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1674
01:58:20,554 --> 01:58:21,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1675
01:58:22,454 --> 01:58:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1676
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:33,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this just goes back to a testament of having a yearly comprehensive strategic plan in place for these processes.

1677
01:58:34,337 --> 01:58:42,259
[SPEAKER_04]: To actually sit down and actually have to vote on something at midnight on something that needs to be acted on relatively quick is absurd.

1678
01:58:42,379 --> 01:58:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes no sense for a city to work that way.

1679
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: When you want to sit down and come up with a comprehensive plan for the following year, that discussion should have already taken place in the month of August.

1680
01:58:53,246 --> 01:59:01,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It should already be ready for the following year as to what we are going to do as a city and what actions we are going to take and what monies we need to do that.

1681
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:03,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a proactive plan.

1682
01:59:03,293 --> 01:59:04,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know,

1683
01:59:05,554 --> 01:59:19,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Council of Cohen's suggestion to at least have seven days is admirable But I think it really has to be something that the council should really come together on Team spirit wise and say hey from this point on we will not accept anything.

1684
01:59:19,798 --> 01:59:34,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That isn't a comprehensive plan that gives the city And the budget enough time to plan for this and move forward And feel comfortable that it can be done and can be done on a timely basis So the citizen citizens can feel good about the projects that are in front of them

1685
01:59:34,922 --> 01:59:35,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1686
01:59:35,462 --> 01:59:35,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1687
01:59:35,742 --> 01:59:36,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1688
01:59:37,763 --> 01:59:39,303
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Loco-Curran.

1689
01:59:39,323 --> 01:59:44,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the Chair, just my last vote, my last point, I do ask for the support on this.

1690
01:59:44,924 --> 01:59:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Having been frustrated and emailed the administration the next day, I received a detailed breakdown by, I think it was 1.05 p.m.

1691
01:59:54,865 --> 02:00:02,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason why we shouldn't be provided a breakdown of expenditures prior to our meeting.

1692
02:00:03,978 --> 02:00:07,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lack of respect, and I think that needs to change.

1693
02:00:07,699 --> 02:00:08,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1694
02:00:08,199 --> 02:00:09,799
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Lockern.

1695
02:00:09,999 --> 02:00:10,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if I could.

1696
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

1697
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:13,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1698
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:19,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel my council colleagues' frustration because this is something that's not new.

1699
02:00:19,822 --> 02:00:25,263
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been happening for years, that either this administration or the previous administration

1700
02:00:26,623 --> 02:00:32,928
[SPEAKER_10]: present expenditures to us with no supporting documentation and either the council may or may not support it.

1701
02:00:33,709 --> 02:00:39,493
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my opinion, I know what you're trying to get at through this resolution, but all it is is a request.

1702
02:00:40,254 --> 02:00:45,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, will you please give us supporting documentation when you ask for expenditure?

1703
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:47,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Now she could say, okay, I'll take that under advisement.

1704
02:00:48,511 --> 02:00:53,198
[SPEAKER_10]: The bigger issue that we have as a council is our council rules.

1705
02:00:53,879 --> 02:01:02,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a council rule that states any request of expenditure only needs one member of the city council to stand up and say, you know what?

1706
02:01:03,891 --> 02:01:04,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I want this tabled.

1707
02:01:05,512 --> 02:01:06,913
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need a vote of the Council.

1708
02:01:07,233 --> 02:01:12,958
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one member of the City Council saying, I need this tabled, and it gets tabled automatically.

1709
02:01:13,658 --> 02:01:15,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's our check and balance.

1710
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:20,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So when something's presented to us and you feel there's not enough information, you evoke the Council rule.

1711
02:01:21,633 --> 02:01:24,397
[SPEAKER_10]: that would request that it be laid on the table.

1712
02:01:24,657 --> 02:01:25,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no vote on it.

1713
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:26,480
[SPEAKER_10]: It's automatic.

1714
02:01:26,881 --> 02:01:30,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would state that, you know, we do have options out there.

1715
02:01:31,327 --> 02:01:33,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And a request to the mayor now is great.

1716
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:36,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the mayor starts adhering to that, super.

1717
02:01:36,675 --> 02:01:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket.

1718
02:01:38,957 --> 02:01:44,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we as a council have to use the remedies that we have, and one of them is our own council rules.

1719
02:01:45,344 --> 02:02:00,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would highly recommend to my council colleagues that if there is expenditure and you feel that there's not an appropriate amount of time or information, that that rule be evoked and automatically gets laid at least for one week so we can get additional documentation.

1720
02:02:00,879 --> 02:02:05,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I will support the paper tonight in principle, but I really don't think it has any teeth.

1721
02:02:06,122 --> 02:02:07,522
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll support it in principle.

1722
02:02:07,842 --> 02:02:08,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1723
02:02:09,683 --> 02:02:10,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Del Rosso.

1724
02:02:10,544 --> 02:02:12,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with Councilor Marks on the matter.

1725
02:02:12,404 --> 02:02:17,167
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, with the way the resolution is written, I don't even know who it's addressed for to.

1726
02:02:19,448 --> 02:02:21,449
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you, Mr. President.

1727
02:02:21,609 --> 02:02:23,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1728
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:23,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Layton.

1729
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:26,312
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Councilor Marks is on the right track, Mr. President.

1730
02:02:26,532 --> 02:02:33,896
[SPEAKER_21]: I think our council rules can dictate whether or not this is something that we can handle ourselves without having to make a request to the mayor.

1731
02:02:33,976 --> 02:02:44,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, if we look in our council rules, it says every ordinance and every order for a bond issue shall before its passage be referred to the solicitor who shall forthwith examine its legality and respond back to the council in writing thereof.

1732
02:02:45,622 --> 02:02:45,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule 22.

1733
02:02:47,663 --> 02:02:55,811
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, there are a couple of remedies in there for us to take, and I think that we should just do them ourselves as opposed to kicking it across the hallway.

1734
02:02:56,552 --> 02:02:57,513
[SPEAKER_21]: We've voted on this in the past.

1735
02:02:57,553 --> 02:02:59,495
[SPEAKER_21]: I've supported this measure in the past, Mr. President.

1736
02:03:00,376 --> 02:03:02,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the frustrations that my counselors share.

1737
02:03:03,519 --> 02:03:07,900
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see as much of a, I have a strong working relationship with the administration, past and present.

1738
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:11,001
[SPEAKER_21]: I pick up the phone when I get my agenda and I talk about issues that I have questions on.

1739
02:03:12,021 --> 02:03:15,482
[SPEAKER_21]: But maybe some people don't have that type of access, I don't know.

1740
02:03:16,382 --> 02:03:18,883
[SPEAKER_21]: I do the best I can to get the information and be prepared for the meeting.

1741
02:03:19,443 --> 02:03:25,084
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think that our council rules could really dictate what direction that we can go in and how we can police this ourselves as opposed to relying on someone else to do it.

1742
02:03:25,624 --> 02:03:29,045
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's something I've supported in the past, I certainly have, but this evening I won't be.

1743
02:03:29,748 --> 02:03:31,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Naito.

1744
02:03:32,232 --> 02:03:36,158
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrick, it's getting late.

1745
02:03:36,278 --> 02:03:39,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

1746
02:03:43,086 --> 02:03:44,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1747
02:03:44,546 --> 02:03:46,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1748
02:03:46,987 --> 02:03:47,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Just really brief.

1749
02:03:48,228 --> 02:04:06,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely understand what Councilor Marks is saying, but on the flip side, what Councilor Longo Kern is saying is the presentation of these appropriations coming in as dire and needed and at the last minute to invoke that

1750
02:04:08,894 --> 02:04:12,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's almost it's almost like sets up the council to look bad.

1751
02:04:13,377 --> 02:04:15,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's I think it's quite frankly the

1752
02:04:21,147 --> 02:04:23,749
[SPEAKER_21]: item doesn't have to make the agenda if we don't have the information that we need.

1753
02:04:24,970 --> 02:04:28,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because the mayor sends a paper and says, put this on the agenda, it doesn't have to happen the next week.

1754
02:04:28,693 --> 02:04:29,614
[SPEAKER_21]: We control our own agenda.

1755
02:04:29,654 --> 02:04:31,135
[SPEAKER_21]: We control when the items and matters come up.

1756
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:37,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we get a paper that says, put this on the agenda, we say, well, let's talk about the council, but when do we want to put this on the agenda?

1757
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:45,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we have six papers that are coming up for bonds, and let's talk about bonding for a whole meeting and have a universal picture of what's going on in the city of Medford in terms of bonding instead of doing it

1758
02:04:46,768 --> 02:04:47,588
[SPEAKER_21]: Play and connect the dots.

1759
02:04:47,868 --> 02:04:51,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, there's different ways that we can handle the question, right?

1760
02:04:51,749 --> 02:05:01,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that council of council a night, but when they do come up at the midnight hour I I don't think that this resolution lacks teeth.

1761
02:05:01,972 --> 02:05:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what council Lungo current is doing astutely is Sending a message not only to the mayor but a separate message to the the people that you guys represent that we are gonna do something about

1762
02:05:16,915 --> 02:05:18,116
[SPEAKER_07]: your taxpayer dollars.

1763
02:05:18,156 --> 02:05:18,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1764
02:05:19,236 --> 02:05:24,178
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by DelaRusso, a roll call vote has been requested.

1765
02:05:24,879 --> 02:05:26,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1766
02:05:26,359 --> 02:05:27,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor DelaRusso?

1767
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:27,460
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1768
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:29,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco?

1769
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:29,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1770
02:05:30,681 --> 02:05:31,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Naik?

1771
02:05:31,281 --> 02:05:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1772
02:05:32,622 --> 02:05:33,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo-Curran?

1773
02:05:33,362 --> 02:05:33,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1774
02:05:34,903 --> 02:05:35,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks?

1775
02:05:35,783 --> 02:05:36,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1776
02:05:37,044 --> 02:05:37,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scott Peli?

1777
02:05:38,024 --> 02:05:38,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1778
02:05:39,064 --> 02:05:39,765
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caviello?

1779
02:05:39,785 --> 02:05:39,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1780
02:05:42,207 --> 02:05:45,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

1781
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:46,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back to 17-595.

1782
02:05:47,152 --> 02:05:47,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1783
02:05:53,017 --> 02:05:53,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Stone and Skillet.

1784
02:05:55,540 --> 02:05:59,904
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Stone and Skillet, Mr. President, is located on the corner of West and Winthrop.

1785
02:05:59,944 --> 02:06:08,452
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a bakery wholesaler that over the past several months has not been the greatest of neighbors, Mr. President.

1786
02:06:08,672 --> 02:06:14,498
[SPEAKER_21]: I've received a number of complaints from area residents concerning their hours of operation and the cleanliness of the facility.

1787
02:06:15,839 --> 02:06:17,381
[SPEAKER_21]: and some parking concerns that they have.

1788
02:06:17,481 --> 02:06:23,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultimately, this bakery wholesaler has operated in excess of our hours of operation.

1789
02:06:23,806 --> 02:06:26,289
[SPEAKER_21]: They're permitted to operate from 7 a.m.

1790
02:06:26,549 --> 02:06:27,330
[SPEAKER_21]: to 11 p.m.

1791
02:06:28,151 --> 02:06:38,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Between May 1st and June 22nd, I personally reported 16 violations of operation after hours.

1792
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:54,847
[SPEAKER_21]: This coupled with the fact that there's a dedicated parking spot beside the building for 30 minute parking which has turned into stone and skillets personal loading zone for their renter car, renter truck, 18 wheeler that sits there for 7 to 8 to 9 to 10 hours a day without moving.

1793
02:06:55,968 --> 02:07:01,190
[SPEAKER_21]: The facility and the grounds around it are in deplorable condition, Mr. President.

1794
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:10,698
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm asking for these materials so that we can move forward and investigate whether or not there's anything that we can do to designate them as a public nuisance and move them out of the neighborhood.

1795
02:07:11,619 --> 02:07:23,189
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it's been brought to my attention in recent weeks since I filed this resolution that a gigantic for rent sign has been placed on the side of the building, which would lead me to believe that Stone and Skillet is on their way out of the community.

1796
02:07:24,490 --> 02:07:28,995
[SPEAKER_21]: The bakery wholesaler does not fall under the jurisdiction by state law of our local Board of Health.

1797
02:07:29,055 --> 02:07:30,777
[SPEAKER_21]: They're controlled by the state Board of Health.

1798
02:07:30,857 --> 02:07:38,024
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have very limited recourse concerning our concerns about the cleanliness of the facility and what's going on around it.

1799
02:07:39,826 --> 02:07:49,933
[SPEAKER_21]: With this good news coming forward that they are putting the place up for rent, I'd still ask the paper to move forward and for us to be prepared, because they said they were going to move last year, they said they were going to move the year before that, and they haven't, Mr. President.

1800
02:07:49,973 --> 02:07:55,957
[SPEAKER_21]: They've certainly outgrown this facility, and I think it's time that they find a new location.

1801
02:07:56,317 --> 02:08:00,381
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether that location is in the city of Medford or somewhere else is to be determined, Mr. President.

1802
02:08:00,441 --> 02:08:09,849
[SPEAKER_21]: But right now, I think that these residents have been subjected to enough quality of life issues down there that the benefits that Stone and Skill are bringing to the community are lacking.

1803
02:08:10,209 --> 02:08:13,552
[SPEAKER_21]: And the impact on the quality of life that they have is major.

1804
02:08:13,912 --> 02:08:17,816
[SPEAKER_21]: And for that reason, I bring this resolution forward and ask my council colleagues to support it.

1805
02:08:18,296 --> 02:08:18,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1806
02:08:19,137 --> 02:08:22,479
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Nays, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

1807
02:08:23,528 --> 02:08:24,269
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1808
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1809
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:27,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1810
02:08:27,332 --> 02:08:39,423
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-597, offered by Councilor Locario, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th or the 26th of September to discuss and review a potential new ordinance

1811
02:08:40,687 --> 02:08:44,549
[SPEAKER_15]: to help remedy Level 3 gas leaks within Medford.

1812
02:08:44,589 --> 02:08:45,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo, if you're current.

1813
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:47,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1814
02:08:47,211 --> 02:09:09,563
[SPEAKER_02]: A few months ago, well, not even, I don't think, probably June, I brought up a City of Boston ordinance that was regarding gas leaks, Level 3 gas leaks, and the City of Boston is taking measures to hold the utility companies accountable and to remedy those gas leaks.

1815
02:09:10,478 --> 02:09:11,359
[SPEAKER_02]: in-depth ordinance.

1816
02:09:11,559 --> 02:09:16,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I did forward it to the city clerk, who I then saw forwarded it to the rest of my colleagues.

1817
02:09:16,662 --> 02:09:21,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is almost just a reminder to maybe hopefully take a read and we can do something about it.

1818
02:09:21,925 --> 02:09:26,007
[SPEAKER_02]: This issue was brought to me by a citizen who probably is going to speak on it, Mr. Tudin.

1819
02:09:26,827 --> 02:09:38,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was led in Boston by a group of moms who are trying to prevent gas leaks because of all the damage they do to the gas bill, number one.

1820
02:09:38,074 --> 02:09:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a safety issue.

1821
02:09:41,059 --> 02:09:43,841
[SPEAKER_02]: wildlife and the environment.

1822
02:09:43,901 --> 02:10:01,751
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a good thing and we'd like to see what they're doing, read about it and hopefully craft our own ordinance to accommodate our needs and hopefully get the city engineer on board and give her a tool to make sure that when a street is dug up, gas leaks are looked into and fixed.

1823
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:08,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would hope that we can review and come up with an ordinance sometime in September so we can move approval on this.

1824
02:10:09,247 --> 02:10:10,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor De La Rosa.

1825
02:10:10,388 --> 02:10:36,690
[SPEAKER_18]: President, we have a paper from the mayor tonight that I think addresses part of this issue, Mr. President, that is being taken up by the state house to address it on a state level by creating an act relative to protecting consumers of gas and electricity from paying for leaks on unaccounted gas, which will of course force

1826
02:10:39,032 --> 02:10:45,975
[SPEAKER_18]: the gas company to deal with leaks because it gets them where it counts, in their pocketbooks, because that's what it's all about.

1827
02:10:46,895 --> 02:10:50,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I don't know if this has to go to Committee of the Whole.

1828
02:10:50,737 --> 02:10:55,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I would think that procedurally the best thing to do would be to send this to the Committee on Ordinances.

1829
02:10:56,499 --> 02:11:12,754
[SPEAKER_18]: to review the draft of the Bardston ordinance to ask the city solicitor to be in attendance at that meeting to add his expert legal advice and then report it out as is often outlined by the proper procedure by Councillor Knight.

1830
02:11:13,054 --> 02:11:16,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Langlois-Carrion, would you prefer this go to the subcommittee and audiences?

1831
02:11:17,595 --> 02:11:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good ordinance the way Boston has it written.

1832
02:11:20,336 --> 02:11:27,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just requires a review, and the city solicitors sit with us as an entire body, which is going to end up in Committee of the Whole anyway.

1833
02:11:28,179 --> 02:11:31,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it has to be redrafted in much a way.

1834
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:38,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Committee of the Whole meeting would be preferable to move it forward quicker rather than take months and months to

1835
02:11:39,881 --> 02:11:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: get two meetings set up.

1836
02:11:40,682 --> 02:11:41,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can do it in one meeting.

1837
02:11:41,623 --> 02:11:49,790
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Luebker to have a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th and 26th of September, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1838
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:50,510
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1839
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:50,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1840
02:11:51,331 --> 02:11:51,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed?

1841
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:52,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passed.

1842
02:11:53,833 --> 02:11:56,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Mock Councilor Del Rosso in opposition.

1843
02:11:56,515 --> 02:11:57,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Also Mr. President.

1844
02:11:58,056 --> 02:11:58,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry?

1845
02:11:58,236 --> 02:11:59,618
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to be mocked in opposition.

1846
02:11:59,698 --> 02:12:00,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And also Councilor Knight.

1847
02:12:03,581 --> 02:12:04,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll do my best.

1848
02:12:04,221 --> 02:12:05,943
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see what's on the calendar for the 19th and 26th.

1849
02:12:05,963 --> 02:12:08,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think somebody might want to speak on it.

1850
02:12:09,133 --> 02:12:11,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I've been disposed of.

1851
02:12:13,126 --> 02:12:16,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Curtis Student, 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1852
02:12:16,529 --> 02:12:27,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to invite the council to a meeting on August 22nd, which is of the 350 Massachusetts Mystic Valley organization that has been dedicated to looking at this gas leak issue.

1853
02:12:27,576 --> 02:12:40,205
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a meeting specifically about level 3 gas leaks in Medford, so if any counselor or any resident of Medford doesn't want to wait until September to learn more about it, they're welcome to come to a meeting here at Medford High School, 7 o'clock, and you'll

1854
02:12:40,625 --> 02:12:42,012
[SPEAKER_00]: learn everything you need to know about the issue.

1855
02:12:42,032 --> 02:12:43,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make sure people were aware of that meeting.

1856
02:12:43,981 --> 02:12:44,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1857
02:12:44,282 --> 02:12:45,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that information.

1858
02:12:46,567 --> 02:13:10,457
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-598, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City of Bedford Council with an update on the implementation of the Wage Theft Ordinance, and be it further resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City, provide the Council with a list of all vendors awarded contracts for fiscal year 2017 and 2018.

1859
02:13:10,877 --> 02:13:11,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1860
02:13:11,837 --> 02:13:13,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1861
02:13:14,098 --> 02:13:27,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Back a few months ago this council passed a wage theft ordinance, and a wage theft ordinance is designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars that are being paid to public contractors are then passed on to their employees pursuant to the public wage laws.

1862
02:13:27,726 --> 02:13:38,553
[SPEAKER_21]: What happens a lot of times in these instances is an individual that works for a private contractor that lays pipe, for example, with all these groups that we had this evening, that's working on a public works project laying pipe.

1863
02:13:39,093 --> 02:13:44,076
[SPEAKER_21]: is going to have to be compensated at the prevailing wage rates established by the Department of Industry.

1864
02:13:44,817 --> 02:13:54,643
[SPEAKER_21]: And a lot of times what happens is when a private contractor gets a public contract, they continue to pay their clients, their employees at a rate that's far less than the prevailing wage rate, and then they pocket the difference.

1865
02:13:55,403 --> 02:13:58,424
[SPEAKER_21]: And the laws are clear in what they call for.

1866
02:13:58,464 --> 02:14:02,685
[SPEAKER_21]: They call for individuals working on a public work project to be compensated at the prevailing wage rate.

1867
02:14:03,185 --> 02:14:07,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Taxpayer dollars are being funneled away from workers and being funneled into the pockets of profiteers.

1868
02:14:08,386 --> 02:14:10,567
[SPEAKER_21]: So we passed the wage theft ordinance, Mr. President.

1869
02:14:10,627 --> 02:14:23,570
[SPEAKER_21]: Part of the wage theft ordinance called for the city to examine whether or not any of the existing contracts have been included on the disbarment list at the Attorney General's office or found in violation of any wage and hour laws that are established at the state and federal levels.

1870
02:14:26,011 --> 02:14:47,248
[SPEAKER_21]: ordinance is now up and running and in effect, Mr. President, I'd just like to get a report back from the administration as to what steps they're taking to implement and whether or not any of the contractors that we've awarded contracts to have actually been found in violation of any of the state of federal wage laws or have been included on the state disbarment list so that they're exempt and precluded from bidding on future public works projects, Mr. President.

1871
02:14:47,568 --> 02:14:48,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1872
02:14:52,244 --> 02:14:53,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1873
02:14:53,666 --> 02:14:55,287
[SPEAKER_04]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1874
02:14:55,327 --> 02:15:05,798
[SPEAKER_04]: My question to Councilor Knight is, does this also include in the initial part of it when they actually put the bid out, they usually put in a labor amount.

1875
02:15:06,159 --> 02:15:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: That labor amount could be ballooned.

1876
02:15:09,742 --> 02:15:28,114
[SPEAKER_04]: In the respect of an hourly versus an hourly wage, so in I'm not sure if a contractor city contract is the same But in general contracts when contractors come out and they do work The labor amount is based off of what they're charging for a labor amount some some places could charge 45 some places could charge 75 Some places could charge $80 per hour.

1877
02:15:28,515 --> 02:15:33,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's irrelevant to actually what they're paying the employees Does that also encompass that?

1878
02:15:33,797 --> 02:15:38,080
[SPEAKER_21]: The Wage Theft Act just ensures compliance with the existing wage and hour laws.

1879
02:15:38,761 --> 02:16:02,598
[SPEAKER_21]: And it requires the applicant for the public bid to make certain disclosures to the community so that if in fact they are found in violation, then they have to take certain steps to ensure that if a complaint is brought forward to them, that they have bonded funds that are available to cover the payroll if in fact they have funneled or diverted this money from the worker and into the corpus of the business.

1880
02:16:02,918 --> 02:16:07,099
[SPEAKER_21]: So it doesn't really necessarily speak to the actual total amount of the bid.

1881
02:16:07,139 --> 02:16:17,701
[SPEAKER_21]: What it does is say if you have seven people that are designated as a municipal street sweeper, you need to pay the municipal street sweeper rate of $37 an hour for the hours that they work on the contract.

1882
02:16:17,821 --> 02:16:21,341
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're gonna work the contract for this many hours, so that's the rate that you have to pay them.

1883
02:16:21,821 --> 02:16:26,702
[SPEAKER_21]: And the rate's established by state law, by the Department of Labor and Industry.

1884
02:16:26,722 --> 02:16:28,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So that protects the actual employee.

1885
02:16:28,582 --> 02:16:29,983
[SPEAKER_04]: That protects the employee from having to wait.

1886
02:16:30,043 --> 02:16:32,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not protect the city from a ballooned rate.

1887
02:16:32,644 --> 02:16:35,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the rates are established through the Department of Labor and Industries based upon the creation that you rent.

1888
02:16:35,846 --> 02:16:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: For the employees.

1889
02:16:36,527 --> 02:16:36,847
[SPEAKER_04]: For the workers.

1890
02:16:36,887 --> 02:16:38,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the actual bid itself.

1891
02:16:38,688 --> 02:16:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing in there that would actually help.

1892
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:51,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, the public bid laws are relatively specific, and the city's ability to go and put restrictions in that would exceed the requirements that are established by state or federal law is not available to us.

1893
02:16:51,137 --> 02:16:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's what I understand.

1894
02:16:52,498 --> 02:16:59,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, we couldn't come in and say, you cannot go any further than 15% above the actual rate that you're paying per employee.

1895
02:17:00,825 --> 02:17:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically that's where the companies would actually take the additional amounts and funds as opposed to that area.

1896
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:19,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Or say you work a 40 hour work week, but you really worked a 60 hour work week and they paid you 40 hours at straight time and then the 20 hours under the table.

1897
02:17:19,399 --> 02:17:28,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Or say that you worked a 40 hour work week, a straight 40 hour work week and they only paid you at your previous rate from the job that you were working on a public work project and that rate is

1898
02:17:29,531 --> 02:17:32,474
[SPEAKER_21]: 50% less than what you should be making when you're working on the public work project.

1899
02:17:33,555 --> 02:17:42,464
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that that's some of the, it's really an effort and attempt to get some of these unsavory contractors that do business in municipalities out.

1900
02:17:42,524 --> 02:17:44,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the reason why I make that point is because if they're being

1901
02:17:45,707 --> 02:18:01,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Enforced which is great, and it's it's it's an absolute important point Then the the contractor themselves will find their way to make their money anyway And that's kind of where they're gonna find their way is the labor ballooning actually in the The thing that they like to say in the industry which would be called the change order.

1902
02:18:01,514 --> 02:18:02,314
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe they call it.

1903
02:18:02,374 --> 02:18:07,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a Code for more money Thank you

1904
02:18:08,953 --> 02:18:09,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1905
02:18:09,694 --> 02:18:13,237
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1906
02:18:13,277 --> 02:18:13,958
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1907
02:18:14,118 --> 02:18:14,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1908
02:18:14,218 --> 02:18:15,279
[SPEAKER_15]: Suspension of the rules.

1909
02:18:15,719 --> 02:18:18,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Suspension of the rules by Councilor Alango-Kern.

1910
02:18:18,121 --> 02:18:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to allow a citizen to speak.

1911
02:18:19,683 --> 02:18:23,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Opposed, Mr. President?

1912
02:18:24,607 --> 02:18:24,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

1913
02:18:26,209 --> 02:18:26,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Do noted.

1914
02:18:28,090 --> 02:18:29,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1915
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:42,863
[SPEAKER_26]: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.

1916
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:47,149
[SPEAKER_26]: But I did want to address the councils.

1917
02:18:49,011 --> 02:19:06,058
[SPEAKER_26]: On Friday, August 11th, the incumbents and the candidates for the Memphis City Council were invited to present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12th.

1918
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:17,103
[SPEAKER_26]: While we were all together, all candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the city council to the attention of President Carviello to place our request on tonight's agenda.

1919
02:19:18,282 --> 02:19:23,683
[SPEAKER_26]: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.

1920
02:19:24,403 --> 02:19:36,686
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.

1921
02:19:37,466 --> 02:19:41,207
[SPEAKER_26]: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.

1922
02:19:42,067 --> 02:19:49,729
[SPEAKER_26]: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?

1923
02:19:50,689 --> 02:19:54,249
[SPEAKER_26]: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.

1924
02:19:54,589 --> 02:20:00,951
[SPEAKER_26]: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.

1925
02:20:01,531 --> 02:20:06,612
[SPEAKER_26]: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize

1926
02:20:07,781 --> 02:20:15,686
[SPEAKER_26]: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.

1927
02:20:16,387 --> 02:20:31,077
[SPEAKER_26]: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Memphis City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Memphis City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.

1928
02:20:33,498 --> 02:20:35,120
[SPEAKER_26]: I do have the letter.

1929
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:37,061
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure if you are all aware.

1930
02:20:38,323 --> 02:20:45,546
[SPEAKER_26]: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.

1931
02:20:46,966 --> 02:20:48,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they all have it.

1932
02:20:48,807 --> 02:20:49,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you all have a copy of this?

1933
02:20:50,147 --> 02:20:52,128
[SPEAKER_15]: It should have been in the packet this week.

1934
02:20:52,208 --> 02:20:55,930
[SPEAKER_26]: It should have been.

1935
02:20:55,970 --> 02:20:56,150
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

1936
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:56,930
[SPEAKER_26]: Here you go.

1937
02:20:56,970 --> 02:20:57,610
[SPEAKER_26]: This should be there.

1938
02:20:58,050 --> 02:20:58,911
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, if I may?

1939
02:21:00,611 --> 02:21:02,532
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess the question that I have, Mr. President, is

1940
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:10,371
[SPEAKER_20]: This letter that's been signed, do all eight candidates still stand in support of it?

1941
02:21:12,672 --> 02:21:15,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I can answer that.

1942
02:21:15,872 --> 02:21:22,334
[SPEAKER_15]: I put the motion on with the agreement that all eight candidates support it.

1943
02:21:23,034 --> 02:21:32,636
[SPEAKER_15]: One candidate notified me on Saturday that they did not want to continue on it, and it prompted me to withdraw the motion.

1944
02:21:34,977 --> 02:21:37,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you be willing to disclose, Mr. President, which candidates?

1945
02:21:37,278 --> 02:21:37,718
[SPEAKER_20]: I will not.

1946
02:21:38,658 --> 02:21:40,499
[SPEAKER_20]: We know it wasn't Ms.

1947
02:21:40,539 --> 02:21:40,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Conyo.

1948
02:21:40,779 --> 02:21:41,859
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I think people changed their mind.

1949
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:42,159
[SPEAKER_26]: It wasn't Ms.

1950
02:21:42,179 --> 02:21:42,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Conyo, no.

1951
02:21:42,839 --> 02:21:46,960
[SPEAKER_26]: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.

1952
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:59,044
[SPEAKER_26]: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.

1953
02:21:59,384 --> 02:22:03,865
[SPEAKER_26]: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.

1954
02:22:04,705 --> 02:22:06,847
[SPEAKER_26]: that the decision was not made by them.

1955
02:22:07,487 --> 02:22:14,132
[SPEAKER_26]: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.

1956
02:22:14,252 --> 02:22:25,060
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.

1957
02:22:28,285 --> 02:22:34,796
[SPEAKER_26]: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided, or we never changed our minds.

1958
02:22:36,118 --> 02:22:37,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of order, Mr. President.

1959
02:22:38,161 --> 02:22:39,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of order, Councilor Del Rosso.

1960
02:22:45,356 --> 02:22:47,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Cuno, the matter has been disposed of.

1961
02:22:47,998 --> 02:22:58,264
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.

1962
02:22:58,684 --> 02:23:00,566
[SPEAKER_26]: We were not the part of that decision.

1963
02:23:01,526 --> 02:23:02,967
[SPEAKER_26]: It had never been discussed with us.

1964
02:23:03,347 --> 02:23:05,709
[SPEAKER_26]: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.

1965
02:23:06,109 --> 02:23:12,373
[SPEAKER_26]: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear

1966
02:23:12,913 --> 02:23:15,855
[SPEAKER_26]: and on record that I was not for a primary.

1967
02:23:31,609 --> 02:23:32,889
[SPEAKER_21]: It can make sense, it makes sense.

1968
02:23:33,950 --> 02:23:38,731
[SPEAKER_21]: It certainly makes sense to save money, but then we also have to think philosophically about the way government works.

1969
02:23:39,611 --> 02:23:43,593
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to think a little bit more about what dictates why a primary election is supposed to occur.

1970
02:23:44,653 --> 02:23:53,436
[SPEAKER_21]: I, for one, came forward and stood with several of my colleagues against a home rule petition to change our charter.

1971
02:23:54,276 --> 02:23:58,197
[SPEAKER_21]: I stood with my colleagues and I said, I think that this is something the voters should address.

1972
02:23:58,357 --> 02:24:00,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now we have a charter that dictates the way our election should work.

1973
02:24:01,329 --> 02:24:09,456
[SPEAKER_21]: If we're going to change that document, that that document should be done by the initiative petition process and should be done from the ground up based upon the will of the voters.

1974
02:24:10,417 --> 02:24:18,765
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd have a very difficult time this evening supporting a paper that would waive the requirements of a primary election because the primary election is dictated and outlined.

1975
02:24:19,345 --> 02:24:25,588
[SPEAKER_21]: in the charter of our community, the document, the blueprint, the constitution of how we're supposed to run our government.

1976
02:24:25,608 --> 02:24:27,409
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd have a very difficult time waiving the primary.

1977
02:24:28,309 --> 02:24:34,652
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess it's a moot point at this point because Councilor Caviello has withdrawn the paper and there's no paper that's before the council this evening addressing that issue.

1978
02:24:35,752 --> 02:24:42,335
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I can certainly see the benefits of it and the financial aspect to it.

1979
02:24:42,515 --> 02:24:47,718
[SPEAKER_21]: However, the question comes as to what's more important, process or

1980
02:24:49,315 --> 02:24:49,695
[SPEAKER_21]: the funds.

1981
02:24:50,376 --> 02:24:55,200
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would have a very difficult time if this paper was still on the ground today to vote to win the primary election, Mr. President.

1982
02:24:55,861 --> 02:24:56,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1983
02:24:56,181 --> 02:24:58,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

1984
02:24:59,404 --> 02:25:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1985
02:25:00,425 --> 02:25:02,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1986
02:25:03,908 --> 02:25:13,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter

1987
02:25:14,457 --> 02:25:16,098
[SPEAKER_07]: that was just hastily written.

1988
02:25:16,538 --> 02:25:17,579
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't notarized.

1989
02:25:17,919 --> 02:25:22,782
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't written under perjury or penalty, going back on it.

1990
02:25:23,842 --> 02:25:33,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Considering the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected.

1991
02:25:33,168 --> 02:25:39,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not.

1992
02:25:40,092 --> 02:25:42,173
[SPEAKER_07]: The money essentially is already gone.

1993
02:25:43,153 --> 02:25:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, it's already gone.

1994
02:25:44,673 --> 02:25:47,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered.

1995
02:25:47,614 --> 02:25:53,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we did... I was only notified by one person.

1996
02:25:54,216 --> 02:25:54,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1997
02:25:54,956 --> 02:25:56,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who else has bowed out.

1998
02:25:56,777 --> 02:25:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President.

1999
02:26:01,378 --> 02:26:08,380
[SPEAKER_07]: After discussion from some of the candidates, it wasn't hidden from other people who signed.

2000
02:26:09,861 --> 02:26:11,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It was presented that way.

2001
02:26:11,781 --> 02:26:18,203
[SPEAKER_07]: But with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed.

2002
02:26:18,223 --> 02:26:19,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2003
02:26:20,284 --> 02:26:20,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2004
02:26:21,505 --> 02:26:29,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done.

2005
02:26:31,108 --> 02:26:42,512
[SPEAKER_07]: In considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know,

2006
02:26:44,053 --> 02:26:45,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that weighed heavy on my mind.

2007
02:26:45,977 --> 02:26:48,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself.

2008
02:26:49,705 --> 02:26:55,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not obligated to to have to disclose reasons

2009
02:26:56,778 --> 02:26:57,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Why I reconsidered?

2010
02:26:58,618 --> 02:26:59,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Two people.

2011
02:26:59,799 --> 02:27:02,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm 47 years old.

2012
02:27:02,459 --> 02:27:03,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an adult.

2013
02:27:03,139 --> 02:27:04,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I can make my own decisions.

2014
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:10,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact.

2015
02:27:10,521 --> 02:27:12,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And I won't mention any names.

2016
02:27:13,081 --> 02:27:24,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just say that it made better sense, and it was better judgment, and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide.

2017
02:27:26,824 --> 02:27:31,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Full disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board.

2018
02:27:32,327 --> 02:27:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a simple thing.

2019
02:27:34,228 --> 02:27:41,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I greatly respect you for bringing that home rule petition.

2020
02:27:41,471 --> 02:27:45,753
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I explained to everybody on Friday what signing that meant.

2021
02:27:46,474 --> 02:27:46,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2022
02:27:47,934 --> 02:27:52,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that, but things happen and people change their mind.

2023
02:27:52,577 --> 02:27:52,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Things happen.

2024
02:27:52,897 --> 02:27:53,817
[SPEAKER_07]: People change their mind all the time.

2025
02:27:56,118 --> 02:27:56,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2026
02:27:56,398 --> 02:27:59,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Your mind changed as well at times.

2027
02:27:59,883 --> 02:28:04,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary.

2028
02:28:04,529 --> 02:28:05,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And there will be no denying of anybody.

2029
02:28:06,571 --> 02:28:07,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2030
02:28:11,998 --> 02:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

2031
02:28:16,388 --> 02:28:22,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to bring the timeline in to everybody that was notified back and forth.

2032
02:28:23,653 --> 02:28:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was the person that brought forward to all the other seven candidates about not having a primary.

2033
02:28:30,338 --> 02:28:42,487
[SPEAKER_03]: With the direction of the Council President Rick Caviello, I contacted all of the seven candidates on the matter, on the cost to eliminate one candidate for a primary election.

2034
02:28:43,666 --> 02:28:52,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of that thought process, all candidates agreed to sign a statement on Friday, August 11th, to not have a primary.

2035
02:28:54,012 --> 02:29:04,297
[SPEAKER_03]: On Saturday, August 12th, President Caviello called me and said he spoke to one of the new candidates who reconsidered his position wanting to have a primary.

2036
02:29:05,478 --> 02:29:12,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of that conversation, President Caviello told me he was withdrawing the home rule petition to cancel the city council primary.

2037
02:29:13,747 --> 02:29:20,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I then proceeded to text all the new candidates about President Caviello's to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition.

2038
02:29:22,049 --> 02:29:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: On Monday morning, President Caviello informed me at the coffee shop he was not going to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition.

2039
02:29:32,232 --> 02:29:41,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I then proceeded to inform again all seven candidates that Council President changed his mind and not to withdraw the Home Rule petition.

2040
02:29:43,049 --> 02:29:43,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting confusing?

2041
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:54,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked all candidates if they would be willing to sign a document saying they wish to have a primary and to respond to me as soon as possible.

2042
02:29:56,334 --> 02:30:11,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself, having given considerable thought and receiving feedback from other candidates, along with some citizens, feel that the citizens have the right to have an election and to follow the process.

2043
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:21,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Councilor Knight said, as I remember two years ago, there was an issue on a charter review.

2044
02:30:21,796 --> 02:30:32,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And certain councilor, Councilor Knight, made a statement that the citizens that wanted a charter review should follow the process and not send it to the state legislatures.

2045
02:30:34,006 --> 02:30:37,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, who am I to stop that process on challenging a primary?

2046
02:30:39,513 --> 02:30:44,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There were men and women who have served and died to give us that right to a fair election.

2047
02:30:45,055 --> 02:30:50,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cousin who died at the Battle of the Bulge, and an uncle who received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in World War II.

2048
02:30:51,677 --> 02:30:53,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And me, who served seven years in the military.

2049
02:30:54,998 --> 02:31:03,240
[SPEAKER_03]: After listening to fellow veterans along with concerned citizens, I don't want to see that right given away and demean their memory.

2050
02:31:04,224 --> 02:31:09,586
[SPEAKER_03]: We also discussed the cost of our last primary two years ago for city council to eliminate one candidate.

2051
02:31:10,527 --> 02:31:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That process of election went forward.

2052
02:31:15,089 --> 02:31:17,950
[SPEAKER_03]: This year's cost, would it really be a savings?

2053
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:25,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be just to move the money to the general fund or the free cash account spent elsewhere.

2054
02:31:25,073 --> 02:31:26,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't gonna be earmarked for anywhere.

2055
02:31:26,854 --> 02:31:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They could spend it anywhere they wanted to.

2056
02:31:30,802 --> 02:31:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally I would not like to see the primary canceled.

2057
02:31:34,686 --> 02:31:46,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in the right to have a fair election That was given to us by the men and women that fought for us And I do have four names signed on a

2058
02:31:48,768 --> 02:31:58,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a move point, but we do have four names that did agree to change their mind.

2059
02:31:58,655 --> 02:32:02,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it need be, I can give it to the council.

2060
02:32:02,197 --> 02:32:04,579
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we don't need them.

2061
02:32:04,599 --> 02:32:04,939
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2062
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:05,920
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter has been disposed of.

2063
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:08,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make the record straight.

2064
02:32:08,402 --> 02:32:09,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2065
02:32:09,243 --> 02:32:09,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

2066
02:32:10,564 --> 02:32:10,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2067
02:32:11,585 --> 02:32:12,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

2068
02:32:13,226 --> 02:32:29,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Just if I could Mr. President, because there's been a lot of discussion around this issue and I can tell you first hand that in my opinion when we talk about conflicts of interest, about having a vested interest in something and how we as a legislative body

2069
02:32:32,753 --> 02:32:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: problem with elected officials canceling elections.

2070
02:32:36,716 --> 02:32:37,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a real problem with that.

2071
02:32:38,357 --> 02:32:45,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's probably one of the most unethical things that an elected official can do, Mr. President, to be quite honest with you.

2072
02:32:46,443 --> 02:32:51,187
[SPEAKER_10]: And to also do it in the name of savings, to me, is just a smokescreen.

2073
02:32:51,707 --> 02:32:53,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, first of all, there is no savings.

2074
02:32:54,109 --> 02:33:01,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And secondly, Mr. President, when you look at the budget, and if you want to make a savings, the tax pays and the rate pays in this community

2075
02:33:02,096 --> 02:33:05,719
[SPEAKER_10]: have been paying for peg access, which they haven't had for four years.

2076
02:33:06,259 --> 02:33:07,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

2077
02:33:08,301 --> 02:33:18,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the outcry of that saved the rate payers of Comcast and Verizon this money that the city's been stealing from them, Mr. President?

2078
02:33:18,669 --> 02:33:26,055
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to look at savings, canceling an election is not the way you save in a $160 million budget.

2079
02:33:26,836 --> 02:33:28,477
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my opinion, Mr. President,

2080
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:34,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We're everyone even non incumbents and incumbents have a vested interest in the process.

2081
02:33:34,523 --> 02:33:44,329
[SPEAKER_10]: We shouldn't be involved whether or not Election is canceled and our city charter dictates what should happen double the office plus one you have a primary

2082
02:33:46,072 --> 02:33:49,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're trying to circumvent the process, no matter how you cut it up.

2083
02:33:50,356 --> 02:33:55,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to circumvent the process of allowing residents of this community to get out and vote.

2084
02:33:56,042 --> 02:34:00,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I realize a primary election from previous elections, probably 10 to 12% turnout.

2085
02:34:02,047 --> 02:34:04,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that's probably around 4,000 voters.

2086
02:34:04,668 --> 02:34:05,769
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is a lower turnout.

2087
02:34:06,089 --> 02:34:12,031
[SPEAKER_10]: But how do you say to 4,000 voters, sorry, we don't believe that this primary is important enough.

2088
02:34:12,612 --> 02:34:15,813
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't believe your right to get out and vote is important enough.

2089
02:34:17,014 --> 02:34:18,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand that, Mr. President.

2090
02:34:18,794 --> 02:34:19,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I really can't fathom that.

2091
02:34:20,335 --> 02:34:24,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, year after year you hear, why are the city turnouts so low?

2092
02:34:24,986 --> 02:34:25,467
[SPEAKER_10]: You know why?

2093
02:34:25,827 --> 02:34:37,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of these things, these type of things, Mr. President, when we have low turnout and we want to gather interest in the community, and the quickest way to put a fizzle on that is to do away with elections.

2094
02:34:38,144 --> 02:34:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.

2095
02:34:39,482 --> 02:34:41,443
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to build up elections in this community.

2096
02:34:41,704 --> 02:34:48,989
[SPEAKER_10]: This council is asked to promote elections by putting banners out and A-frame signs and other social media to get elections out.

2097
02:34:49,369 --> 02:34:51,671
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we are saying, that's canceled the election.

2098
02:34:52,272 --> 02:34:54,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President.

2099
02:34:55,254 --> 02:34:56,274
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a savings.

2100
02:34:57,055 --> 02:34:58,176
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a red herring.

2101
02:34:59,156 --> 02:35:04,900
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all about, Mr. President, about affording the right to people in this community to get out and vote.

2102
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:10,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if it's just one person that wants to get out, Mr. President, I'm going to support their right to get out and vote.

2103
02:35:10,683 --> 02:35:12,244
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no motion on the floor, Mr. Vice President.

2104
02:35:12,264 --> 02:35:17,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's not, but there's been a lot of discussion around this, and I want to let people know where I stand on this, Mr. President.

2105
02:35:18,087 --> 02:35:18,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2106
02:35:19,351 --> 02:35:20,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

2107
02:35:20,793 --> 02:35:22,615
[SPEAKER_26]: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.

2108
02:35:23,516 --> 02:35:26,440
[SPEAKER_26]: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.

2109
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:30,805
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.

2110
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:35,683
[SPEAKER_26]: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.

2111
02:35:36,464 --> 02:35:42,509
[SPEAKER_26]: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.

2112
02:35:43,049 --> 02:35:49,675
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.

2113
02:35:50,395 --> 02:35:52,657
[SPEAKER_26]: I, on the record, have not received a text message.

2114
02:35:53,098 --> 02:35:54,219
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my phone with me.

2115
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:56,020
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't receive a text message.

2116
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,882
[SPEAKER_26]: The only reason I was coming up

2117
02:35:58,422 --> 02:36:14,605
[SPEAKER_26]: was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday and I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.

2118
02:36:15,065 --> 02:36:16,445
[SPEAKER_26]: But that is for them to say.

2119
02:36:16,465 --> 02:36:19,226
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not trying to eliminate the due process.

2120
02:36:19,526 --> 02:36:22,046
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not trying to take anyone's rights away.

2121
02:36:22,386 --> 02:36:26,887
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just trying to be, you know, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.

2122
02:36:28,152 --> 02:36:34,739
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just saying I was not informed of it, so I did not want other people to make a decision for me.

2123
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:35,720
[SPEAKER_26]: That was it.

2124
02:36:38,521 --> 02:36:39,802
[SPEAKER_15]: There was nothing to be informed of.

2125
02:36:39,982 --> 02:36:40,463
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I don't know.

2126
02:36:40,503 --> 02:36:43,245
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and phoned everybody.

2127
02:36:43,265 --> 02:36:44,527
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going by what people said.

2128
02:36:44,567 --> 02:36:46,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Move the end of the question, please.

2129
02:36:46,709 --> 02:36:48,050
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. President.

2130
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:49,351
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. President.

2131
02:36:49,891 --> 02:36:53,194
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing to be informed of because there was nothing official.

2132
02:36:53,575 --> 02:36:56,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So, again, that was an agreement amongst the eight candidates.

2133
02:36:57,378 --> 02:36:58,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So it had nothing to do with the city of Medford.

2134
02:36:59,618 --> 02:37:02,899
[SPEAKER_26]: You're absolutely right, but there are other people up here that said that I didn't receive things.

2135
02:37:02,919 --> 02:37:05,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, point of parliamentary procedure?

2136
02:37:06,020 --> 02:37:08,861
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to make a call for the orders of the day, Mr. President.

2137
02:37:09,201 --> 02:37:14,242
[SPEAKER_21]: The paper that's, the discussion that's being held before us is attached to a paper that's been disposed of already by the council.

2138
02:37:14,262 --> 02:37:14,983
[SPEAKER_15]: The paper has been disposed of.

2139
02:37:15,003 --> 02:37:16,063
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to continue this discussion.

2140
02:37:16,103 --> 02:37:19,544
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do it during the public presentation of the meeting, but we do have some agenda.

2141
02:37:19,564 --> 02:37:21,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Move the revert.

2142
02:37:21,464 --> 02:37:22,645
[SPEAKER_23]: Move the revert back to order.

2143
02:37:22,665 --> 02:37:23,245
[SPEAKER_23]: One more person.

2144
02:37:23,605 --> 02:37:24,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

2145
02:37:24,445 --> 02:37:25,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't speak at all.

2146
02:37:25,306 --> 02:37:26,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone else spoke twice.

2147
02:37:27,337 --> 02:37:28,137
[SPEAKER_20]: They were allowed to do that.

2148
02:37:28,778 --> 02:37:30,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2149
02:37:32,279 --> 02:37:36,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently the game is afoot, but I hope that this is the last thing that we're gonna have.

2150
02:37:36,821 --> 02:37:40,202
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion has been disposed of, so there is no other discussion on it.

2151
02:37:40,302 --> 02:37:42,003
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not on this side of the table.

2152
02:37:42,503 --> 02:37:44,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Let her finish, let her just.

2153
02:37:45,465 --> 02:37:46,705
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be faster, yeah.

2154
02:37:47,245 --> 02:37:55,569
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just wanna say that when I was approached about not holding a primary and then about holding a primary, I insisted that all candidates be notified.

2155
02:37:56,289 --> 02:38:02,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't notified about a paper that was signed for people coming here tonight that didn't want to have a primary.

2156
02:38:03,011 --> 02:38:10,494
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just caution everyone that all the candidates, we should be working together, because theoretically, we all want what's best for the city.

2157
02:38:10,894 --> 02:38:13,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope that there isn't any backroom deals.

2158
02:38:13,695 --> 02:38:15,856
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was approached by candidates, I did speak to them.

2159
02:38:15,876 --> 02:38:16,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Point of information.

2160
02:38:16,836 --> 02:38:17,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information.

2161
02:38:17,496 --> 02:38:19,897
[SPEAKER_21]: So for the record, do you want to waive the primary?

2162
02:38:21,735 --> 02:38:23,416
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't have strong feelings about it either way.

2163
02:38:23,456 --> 02:38:27,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, because I'm looking at the letter and your name's on it, and I just wanted to figure if that was... Okay.

2164
02:38:27,899 --> 02:38:28,659
[SPEAKER_21]: That was all, Mr. President.

2165
02:38:28,679 --> 02:38:28,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2166
02:38:28,979 --> 02:38:33,902
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I thought that everybody put forth solid arguments about it, and we're going to have a primary, so that's fine.

2167
02:38:33,922 --> 02:38:36,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that was an agreement amongst your eight candidates.

2168
02:38:36,944 --> 02:38:37,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

2169
02:38:37,424 --> 02:38:37,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2170
02:38:42,507 --> 02:38:46,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, a motion to revert back to the regular... Motion by Counselor Knight to revert back to regular business.

2171
02:38:47,650 --> 02:38:48,431
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2172
02:38:48,531 --> 02:38:49,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Please be waiting, Mr. President.

2173
02:38:51,841 --> 02:39:00,667
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it this far.

2174
02:39:01,648 --> 02:39:02,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

2175
02:39:03,509 --> 02:39:07,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Andrew Paul Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, Meffitt, Massachusetts.

2176
02:39:07,932 --> 02:39:09,914
[SPEAKER_09]: My phone number is 781396-TIPS, T-I-P-S.

2177
02:39:15,945 --> 02:39:23,170
[SPEAKER_27]: If I may try to put this in proper perspective for if there's ever a viewing public of this meeting in the future.

2178
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:26,312
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe the formula is, because it is confusing.

2179
02:39:26,352 --> 02:39:28,793
[SPEAKER_15]: This meeting is being taped live, is live.

2180
02:39:29,094 --> 02:39:29,414
[SPEAKER_15]: It's live.

2181
02:39:29,474 --> 02:39:30,454
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on television right now.

2182
02:39:30,474 --> 02:39:32,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, thank you.

2183
02:39:32,396 --> 02:39:33,196
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse my appearance.

2184
02:39:33,236 --> 02:39:36,478
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a bad injury at the bike path that doesn't exist in the Mystic River.

2185
02:39:40,107 --> 02:39:48,651
[SPEAKER_27]: The formula for a primary, I believe, is seven positions for the city council, which you all hold, times two is 14, add one is 15.

2186
02:39:48,871 --> 02:40:00,956
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's 15 or more candidates running, and there are, I believe, triggers a primary according to the city ordinance or charter.

2187
02:40:01,616 --> 02:40:02,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that accurate?

2188
02:40:02,377 --> 02:40:02,957
[SPEAKER_27]: That is correct.

2189
02:40:03,237 --> 02:40:03,717
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, sir.

2190
02:40:09,264 --> 02:40:33,825
[SPEAKER_27]: I, when Mr. City Clerk Finn had the drawing for the post positions, I did sign as a council candidate for this election a so-called document, I believe all eight of us signed it, of the challenges, I should say.

2191
02:40:35,969 --> 02:40:39,511
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the only document I ever signed to that nature.

2192
02:40:39,972 --> 02:40:51,319
[SPEAKER_27]: And the document was stating, I believe, to let's waive the primary and save the taxpayers $30,000, $45,000, I hear sometimes $70,000.

2193
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,621
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what the actual figure is.

2194
02:40:56,243 --> 02:40:59,465
[SPEAKER_27]: So I said, sure, it makes sense to me, common sense.

2195
02:41:00,702 --> 02:41:06,745
[SPEAKER_27]: that why spend 30 to 45,000 to eliminate one out of the 15?

2196
02:41:08,026 --> 02:41:14,850
[SPEAKER_27]: And God forbid someone gets eliminated, if there is a primary, that person's not gonna feel very happy, I presume.

2197
02:41:17,171 --> 02:41:20,593
[SPEAKER_27]: It seems like a lot of big chunk of cash to eliminate one person.

2198
02:41:22,154 --> 02:41:27,757
[SPEAKER_27]: However, if you put it in perspective, as Councilor Marks was alluding to,

2199
02:41:30,804 --> 02:41:47,319
[SPEAKER_27]: 45,000, when this city spent, first of all, they collected from our pockets, the taxpayers, a billion dollars, over a billion dollars, not including the bonds they borrowed and extended our debt, the public debt.

2200
02:41:48,179 --> 02:41:53,244
[SPEAKER_27]: And from real perspective, I believe the 45,000,

2201
02:41:55,851 --> 02:42:04,653
[SPEAKER_27]: is 2 hundredths of 1% of this year's $167 million budget.

2202
02:42:06,233 --> 02:42:12,814
[SPEAKER_27]: Furthermore, bottom line, this might be the best $45,000 this city has ever spent in 55 years.

2203
02:42:14,595 --> 02:42:16,975
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to open up some conversation, I would think.

2204
02:42:17,335 --> 02:42:17,655
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2205
02:42:18,115 --> 02:42:18,716
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

2206
02:42:18,796 --> 02:42:19,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not finished.

2207
02:42:22,236 --> 02:42:24,817
[SPEAKER_27]: And maybe we can get some leadership

2208
02:42:25,721 --> 02:42:36,927
[SPEAKER_27]: that can improve our situation in the city and lower our real estate taxes, et cetera, et cetera, and improve the quality of life.

2209
02:42:37,807 --> 02:42:45,751
[SPEAKER_27]: So frankly, Charlotte, have the primary, don't have the primary, it might be a good thing to spend that $45,000 after all.

2210
02:42:45,791 --> 02:42:46,151
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2211
02:42:46,531 --> 02:42:47,372
[SPEAKER_27]: You're quite welcome, sir.

2212
02:42:48,890 --> 02:42:50,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

2213
02:42:50,911 --> 02:42:51,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2214
02:42:51,131 --> 02:43:02,895
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-599, offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern, be it resolved that the Energy and Environment Office provide the City of Memphis City Council with an update on test borrowings behind the Andrews School and Clippership Park.

2215
02:43:03,295 --> 02:43:04,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

2216
02:43:04,436 --> 02:43:05,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

2217
02:43:06,076 --> 02:43:11,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to reach out and hopefully get a written response from Energy and Environment, Ms.

2218
02:43:11,919 --> 02:43:12,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt.

2219
02:43:12,799 --> 02:43:15,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I know she was working hard on this project, and it was

2220
02:43:16,473 --> 02:43:20,296
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunate what was discovered on Clippership Park.

2221
02:43:20,976 --> 02:43:25,420
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, as a council, asked that there be test pourings done at the Andrews School.

2222
02:43:26,621 --> 02:43:29,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make sure, that's one of my two reasons.

2223
02:43:29,383 --> 02:43:39,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously we want an update, but I want to make sure that those test pourings were done behind the Andrews School where hundreds of children play during school hours and play soccer on the weekends.

2224
02:43:40,151 --> 02:43:42,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make sure that that soil is not contaminated.

2225
02:43:43,616 --> 02:43:46,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So I move approval on this and ask for a written response.

2226
02:43:46,637 --> 02:43:47,117
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

2227
02:43:47,557 --> 02:43:50,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I think this is a good resolution and I second the recommendation.

2228
02:43:51,938 --> 02:44:03,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultimately, we just this morning, I should say this morning, it feels like this morning, but a little earlier in the evening, we had a presentation by the Massachusetts Area Planning Council and our Office of Community Development concerning the master plan for Medford Square.

2229
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:07,981
[SPEAKER_21]: And that plan focused a lot on the Clippership Connector.

2230
02:44:08,941 --> 02:44:15,962
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think it's very important moving forward since we have this draft plan for the Medford Square that they're looking at that we understand what's going on over there environmentally.

2231
02:44:16,602 --> 02:44:22,828
[SPEAKER_21]: on the Clippership Connector, because that seemed to be a major part of connectivity between the square and other parts of the city.

2232
02:44:23,849 --> 02:44:24,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2233
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:28,233
[SPEAKER_15]: On to motion by Councillor Lungo-Kearns, seconded by Councillor Knight.

2234
02:44:28,834 --> 02:44:29,394
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favour?

2235
02:44:29,554 --> 02:44:29,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2236
02:44:30,015 --> 02:44:31,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2237
02:44:31,997 --> 02:44:33,558
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-600, offered by Councillor Knight.

2238
02:44:33,578 --> 02:44:37,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the DPW repair the pothole in front of 12 Golden Avenue.

2239
02:44:37,982 --> 02:44:38,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Knight.

2240
02:44:39,043 --> 02:44:42,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Steve Tanaglia, Brian Cairns, and the members of the Medford DPW.

2241
02:44:43,767 --> 02:44:52,175
[SPEAKER_21]: I placed a phone call and put this matter on the resolution on the council agenda, but because we're meeting sporadically over the summer, the issue was taken care of in 24 hours.

2242
02:44:52,675 --> 02:44:58,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution, and I thank the DPW for their prompt and quick response.

2243
02:44:58,601 --> 02:45:00,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Councilor Knight to withdraw 17-600.

2244
02:45:03,833 --> 02:45:19,125
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-601 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern be it resolved that the final fiscal year 18 budget be posted online in detail and that any candidate for office be allowed to review and receive such a copy of such.

2245
02:45:19,445 --> 02:45:20,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

2246
02:45:20,546 --> 02:45:21,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

2247
02:45:22,227 --> 02:45:28,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned about a week ago that there was a candidate for office who couldn't get the budget book for fiscal year 2018.

2248
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:36,343
[SPEAKER_02]: which was passed and approved the end of June, and I was surprised.

2249
02:45:36,463 --> 02:45:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure that any candidate, anybody, any person who lives in this city who wants to review the budget can do so online, or go to the city clerk's office and read a hard copy, and any candidate should be able to, or the mayor's office, wherever that may be, to be able to review the budget in detail.

2250
02:45:54,072 --> 02:45:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's essential to,

2251
02:45:57,505 --> 02:46:02,769
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency, obviously, but it's just essential to know what is in that budget, where the money is spent.

2252
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:13,277
[SPEAKER_02]: We just spoke about $160-plus million budget, and I really feel that every candidate and resident in the city should have access to it.

2253
02:46:13,297 --> 02:46:14,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2254
02:46:19,141 --> 02:46:34,231
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm under the impression that it is posted and that there are especially the devotees of the budget process, the citizen participants who are often there year after year to participate in the budget.

2255
02:46:36,959 --> 02:46:38,580
[SPEAKER_18]: receive one, just as we do.

2256
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:41,383
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a hard copy available now, if I'm not mistaken.

2257
02:46:41,563 --> 02:46:42,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we got a hard copy this week.

2258
02:46:42,544 --> 02:46:43,865
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know when it was made available.

2259
02:46:45,046 --> 02:46:46,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

2260
02:46:46,327 --> 02:46:51,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I do believe, Mr. President, the public records law would dictate the provision of public documents to individuals in the community.

2261
02:46:51,911 --> 02:46:52,672
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the state law.

2262
02:46:53,172 --> 02:47:04,482
[SPEAKER_21]: I find it nonsensical for the council to think that they can move forward and put more stringent requirements on something that's already been established by a higher governmental jurisdiction.

2263
02:47:05,363 --> 02:47:16,506
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, through the chair, I believe the detailed budget that we were given in June with specific information, very detailed information, not all of that is online.

2264
02:47:16,906 --> 02:47:18,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that should be open to the public.

2265
02:47:18,667 --> 02:47:21,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

2266
02:47:22,471 --> 02:47:24,272
[SPEAKER_04]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

2267
02:47:24,872 --> 02:47:31,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to speak on this point because I was the one who was actually trying to get my hands on a budget.

2268
02:47:31,955 --> 02:47:45,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I did go in two consecutive weeks in a row to try and get my hands on a budget towards the end of July and was met with a little confusion as to why it wasn't available throughout the actual city hall itself.

2269
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:51,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the city clerk tried really hard to try and figure out how I could get my hands on one.

2270
02:47:51,261 --> 02:47:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: The city assessor did put a little effort into it and was reverted back to the mayor's office to find a copy not available.

2271
02:47:59,204 --> 02:48:00,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I did ask if I could get it online.

2272
02:48:03,605 --> 02:48:07,427
[SPEAKER_04]: the young lady that actually tried to help me with I don't know anything about that.

2273
02:48:07,507 --> 02:48:09,968
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is that the budget is out to print.

2274
02:48:10,329 --> 02:48:13,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in my impression, you want to talk about transparency.

2275
02:48:14,051 --> 02:48:27,558
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have passed a budget and that budget is enacted the first week of July, every single citizen, not just candidates, every single citizen should be able to get it at any point immediately because if you're working with a budget and that budget is operating,

2276
02:48:27,978 --> 02:48:29,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That means it should be in our hands period.

2277
02:48:30,119 --> 02:48:31,499
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not transparency.

2278
02:48:31,799 --> 02:48:40,682
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not what this administration is showing in the regards of one of the most simplest documents for that reason.

2279
02:48:41,002 --> 02:48:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So I strongly suggest that this time next year when a budget is being presented and passed, it is ready to go July 1st because everyone should have it in their hands.

2280
02:48:52,025 --> 02:48:52,285
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2281
02:48:52,685 --> 02:48:53,046
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2282
02:48:53,086 --> 02:48:53,566
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

2283
02:48:54,927 --> 02:48:56,007
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2284
02:48:56,208 --> 02:49:04,695
[SPEAKER_29]: And I mean, I too, I mean, I feel that the budget, I mean, what we do in passing the budget, reviewing the budget is one of our biggest responsibilities.

2285
02:49:05,356 --> 02:49:07,978
[SPEAKER_29]: And transparency is key when it comes to the budget.

2286
02:49:08,138 --> 02:49:09,480
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, everyone should be

2287
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:11,821
[SPEAKER_29]: have access to the budget.

2288
02:49:11,841 --> 02:49:13,041
[SPEAKER_29]: I've always felt that way.

2289
02:49:13,722 --> 02:49:20,024
[SPEAKER_29]: I think especially when you think about it, there's so much money, and everything that runs, runs through the budget.

2290
02:49:20,604 --> 02:49:25,046
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, we should be encouraging people to get involved with the budget process and actually taking a look at the budget.

2291
02:49:25,707 --> 02:49:33,650
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, one of the biggest, to me, a big initiative that we passed this year, and everyone's still behind, was the legislative software.

2292
02:49:34,570 --> 02:49:37,472
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a motion that I brought forward in the spring.

2293
02:49:38,052 --> 02:49:40,414
[SPEAKER_29]: And this council stood before it, and it's in the budget.

2294
02:49:40,634 --> 02:49:44,496
[SPEAKER_29]: And that is actually to make sure that the materials that we receive

2295
02:49:46,081 --> 02:49:50,904
[SPEAKER_29]: With legislative software, all those materials should be in that software package.

2296
02:49:50,944 --> 02:49:54,186
[SPEAKER_29]: So, everything we get, you'll be able to see in the general public.

2297
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:59,530
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all public information, but it's going to be easily accessible with legislative software.

2298
02:50:00,670 --> 02:50:01,191
[SPEAKER_29]: We have that.

2299
02:50:01,251 --> 02:50:01,771
[SPEAKER_29]: That's passed.

2300
02:50:01,791 --> 02:50:02,611
[SPEAKER_29]: That's in the budget.

2301
02:50:03,932 --> 02:50:10,096
[SPEAKER_29]: It hasn't gone live yet, but to me, in my opinion, I mean, the draft budget, at least, should be part.

2302
02:50:10,416 --> 02:50:13,018
[SPEAKER_29]: It should be actually online for people to look at.

2303
02:50:13,468 --> 02:50:19,553
[SPEAKER_29]: So, if they come to the meeting, they can be, you know, they can look at it in advance and say, okay, this is how much we're spending here.

2304
02:50:19,573 --> 02:50:20,934
[SPEAKER_29]: They can ask good questions.

2305
02:50:20,954 --> 02:50:22,355
[SPEAKER_29]: They can be prepared at meetings.

2306
02:50:22,875 --> 02:50:26,998
[SPEAKER_29]: And it also, you know, it helps us prepare ourselves, too, when all this stuff is at our fingertips.

2307
02:50:27,038 --> 02:50:34,584
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, I do, I've always been a big fan of making sure that, you know, the budget, it's transparent, people can see it, and people can access it.

2308
02:50:34,664 --> 02:50:40,228
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I just wanted to go and just give my thoughts on this process.

2309
02:50:40,268 --> 02:50:40,929
[SPEAKER_29]: So, thank you.

2310
02:50:43,072 --> 02:50:46,194
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor?

2311
02:50:46,274 --> 02:50:46,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2312
02:50:47,695 --> 02:50:49,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2313
02:50:49,777 --> 02:50:51,218
[SPEAKER_15]: 17602 offered by Councilor Longo-Curran.

2314
02:50:51,238 --> 02:51:02,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that a State Delegation be contacted to reach out to MassDOT in regards to the way they are handling the Gratic Bridge cleanup and the lack of handicap accessibility.

2315
02:51:02,946 --> 02:51:04,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo-Curran.

2316
02:51:04,527 --> 02:51:06,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Carviello.

2317
02:51:06,529 --> 02:51:10,552
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't met in a few weeks, so last week I was

2318
02:51:11,538 --> 02:51:28,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I received a number of complaints with regards to the cleanup and the splash of almost cement on the business owner's facade and a number of issues with regards to potential handicap accessibility issues down in that area.

2319
02:51:28,907 --> 02:51:30,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very concerning.

2320
02:51:31,049 --> 02:51:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I did reach out to the mayor's office.

2321
02:51:32,970 --> 02:51:39,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a number of us have been making calls and trying to get in touch with MassDOT.

2322
02:51:39,773 --> 02:51:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people have been calling Representative Donato, but as a council, I would like to take a vote that we ask that this cleanup be done in a better way.

2323
02:51:54,357 --> 02:52:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever businesses are down there, they should be able to operate with a clean, friendly environment where a wheelchair can pass through or a mother with a stroller to get into a restaurant.

2324
02:52:06,246 --> 02:52:11,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the pitches I've saw, I'm extremely concerned.

2325
02:52:11,350 --> 02:52:17,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, unfortunately, really nobody from the administration has been down there often.

2326
02:52:17,595 --> 02:52:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, our new

2327
02:52:19,536 --> 02:52:25,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new diversity director did go down this week.

2328
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure he found anything not in compliance, but there was a few days last week where I saw the ruler to the door, and it just

2329
02:52:35,864 --> 02:52:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very concerning, so I would ask that we, as a body, take a roll call vote to ask our state delegation to get involved.

2330
02:52:42,346 --> 02:52:51,469
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can interject, I have spoken with Representative Leader Donato, and he is in the process of arranging a meeting with the state delegation.

2331
02:52:51,889 --> 02:52:52,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, great.

2332
02:52:52,570 --> 02:52:57,951
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to send them an official letter, but he was notified, and he is in the process of doing that.

2333
02:52:58,312 --> 02:53:02,253
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could just vote to support his endeavors in trying to help that location.

2334
02:53:02,892 --> 02:53:06,173
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Longo Kern and seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2335
02:53:07,233 --> 02:53:07,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

2336
02:53:07,893 --> 02:53:12,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, I too got the same phone calls that the Councilor refers to.

2337
02:53:12,934 --> 02:53:20,136
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've had conversations with the project manager, Mike Winnick, as well as Dan Fields, the DOT contact and liaison.

2338
02:53:20,736 --> 02:53:26,857
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's been brought to my attention that probably the start of September, all the work's going to transfer to the other side of the bridge.

2339
02:53:27,738 --> 02:53:29,599
[SPEAKER_21]: All the public utilities are going to be able to be moved.

2340
02:53:29,619 --> 02:53:33,182
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the side of the bridge that had the most significant amount of public utilities underneath it.

2341
02:53:33,802 --> 02:53:43,710
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the side of the bridge that was going to be posing the most trouble and complications during their what seems like once in a while construction that they do.

2342
02:53:44,311 --> 02:53:56,440
[SPEAKER_21]: And come September 1st, it was my understanding that they would be moving to the other side of the street and all the work done in front of Carol's restaurant and the Zamperrelli building and so forth would be complete.

2343
02:53:57,116 --> 02:54:02,061
[SPEAKER_15]: So it looks like the sidewalks are pretty much all done, they're all poured today, over the last couple of days.

2344
02:54:02,662 --> 02:54:12,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, but if I may, I think that maybe in terms of the direction we're going in, calling the state delegation and telling them to do something, why don't we have the state delegation tell us what they're doing and see if that's something we want to support.

2345
02:54:13,513 --> 02:54:21,620
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe it might be nice for us to have a conversation with the representative and the representative share with us what efforts that they're taking to see if that satisfies us as opposed to standing in line.

2346
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:29,126
[SPEAKER_15]: He is in the process of setting up a meeting with the delegation and he said he would have an answer to me probably in the next week or so.

2347
02:54:29,266 --> 02:54:31,268
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe and we'll get a meeting.

2348
02:54:31,308 --> 02:54:33,930
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't we just ask to be invited to the meeting that he's setting up.

2349
02:54:34,570 --> 02:54:37,092
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be at that meeting.

2350
02:54:38,993 --> 02:54:39,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

2351
02:54:40,514 --> 02:54:41,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2352
02:54:42,395 --> 02:54:58,344
[SPEAKER_10]: The meeting was a meeting that this council voted on and requested, and it was my resolution to ask that the state delegation be present, and also that the primary conversation be surrounded by not really what's taking place over there, but mitigation.

2353
02:54:58,384 --> 02:54:59,965
[SPEAKER_15]: I informed the representative about that.

2354
02:55:00,205 --> 02:55:00,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

2355
02:55:01,166 --> 02:55:05,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Mitigation and the impact it's had financially on these businesses.

2356
02:55:05,690 --> 02:55:12,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize the area is in disarray and some of those businesses have been going through this for two years now.

2357
02:55:12,976 --> 02:55:17,159
[SPEAKER_10]: But what is the state going to do regarding the business loss?

2358
02:55:18,821 --> 02:55:20,903
[SPEAKER_10]: When it's lost business, you can't bring it back.

2359
02:55:21,463 --> 02:55:30,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, the state needs to step forward, and we, as a city, need to step forward on behalf of our businesses that have been impacted by this.

2360
02:55:30,787 --> 02:55:31,868
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a state bridge.

2361
02:55:32,888 --> 02:55:35,069
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the city of Meffitt, but it's a state bridge.

2362
02:55:35,430 --> 02:55:46,355
[SPEAKER_10]: We hear all too often, oh, we can't do this on a state road, or we can't do anything regarding tree trimming or sidewalk repair or street repair on state roads.

2363
02:55:46,695 --> 02:55:50,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we have a state bridge, Mr. President, and we have no say in what's going on.

2364
02:55:51,157 --> 02:55:55,839
[SPEAKER_10]: in a bridge in the heart of our city, which makes absolutely no sense to me at all.

2365
02:55:55,899 --> 02:56:00,522
[SPEAKER_10]: But that meeting that we have is to discuss mitigation.

2366
02:56:00,582 --> 02:56:01,082
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

2367
02:56:01,102 --> 02:56:01,642
[SPEAKER_10]: That is what I told him.

2368
02:56:01,662 --> 02:56:08,066
[SPEAKER_10]: To discuss how we're going to make these businesses that have been impacted financially for the last two years whole again, Mr. President.

2369
02:56:08,166 --> 02:56:09,746
[SPEAKER_15]: You are 100 percent correct.

2370
02:56:10,647 --> 02:56:18,971
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is when I had an official meeting with him, I did tell him that your motion was for mitigation.

2371
02:56:19,731 --> 02:56:20,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And he understood that.

2372
02:56:23,125 --> 02:56:26,848
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern, seconded by Councilor Mox.

2373
02:56:27,068 --> 02:56:33,514
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2374
02:56:33,534 --> 02:56:33,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2375
02:56:33,794 --> 02:56:34,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2376
02:56:34,135 --> 02:56:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2377
02:56:34,695 --> 02:56:34,835
[SPEAKER_02]: 17-603.

2378
02:56:36,837 --> 02:56:38,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2379
02:56:38,778 --> 02:56:49,588
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-603, offered by Councilor Nye, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Amanda and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.

2380
02:56:51,804 --> 02:56:55,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and a lot can happen in 18 months.

2381
02:56:55,907 --> 02:57:10,516
[SPEAKER_21]: As the corner office transitions to a new administration, we saw former Mayor McGlynn reach his 50th wedding anniversary, and we also have seen his daughter bring another grandchild into the world for him.

2382
02:57:10,556 --> 02:57:14,899
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Amanda and Patrick on the birth of their first child.

2383
02:57:15,059 --> 02:57:16,660
[SPEAKER_21]: They've just purchased their first home as well.

2384
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:24,249
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's a great momentous occasion to see a family that's five generations in Medford continuing to stay in the family and hopefully have a sixth.

2385
02:57:24,630 --> 02:57:32,499
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, I just hope my council colleagues would join me in congratulating Amanda McGlynn Collins and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.

2386
02:57:34,822 --> 02:57:36,243
[SPEAKER_15]: seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2387
02:57:36,263 --> 02:57:36,864
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2388
02:57:37,204 --> 02:57:37,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2389
02:57:37,905 --> 02:57:39,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2390
02:57:39,846 --> 02:57:52,276
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-604 be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its extended Stephenson's Day congratulations to Patricia and David Downey on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary.

2391
02:57:52,356 --> 02:57:53,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

2392
02:57:53,317 --> 02:57:54,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2393
02:57:54,938 --> 02:57:55,799
[SPEAKER_21]: If anybody remembers

2394
02:57:56,940 --> 02:58:02,987
[SPEAKER_21]: their time at the Brooks Harb School or at Medford High School, they'll remember Mrs. Downey standing in the front door saying, how can I help you, lovey?

2395
02:58:03,528 --> 02:58:05,730
[SPEAKER_21]: And she did that for a good 35 years.

2396
02:58:06,331 --> 02:58:09,654
[SPEAKER_21]: And her son, David, is my closest friend.

2397
02:58:09,694 --> 02:58:12,037
[SPEAKER_21]: I met him the first day of school in kindergarten at the Brooks School.

2398
02:58:12,097 --> 02:58:16,142
[SPEAKER_21]: And we keep in touch today, even though he's moved overseas across the country about 20 years ago.

2399
02:58:16,782 --> 02:58:30,656
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, it's with great happiness and great pride that I stand here today and I congratulate my friends, Pat and David Downey, on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary, especially on this night, because this is a very night that's, this night's very special to me.

2400
02:58:31,197 --> 02:58:38,844
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. and Mrs. Downey a very happy 50th wedding anniversary and wishing them another 50 more.

2401
02:58:40,199 --> 02:58:43,681
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2402
02:58:43,821 --> 02:58:44,441
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2403
02:58:44,521 --> 02:58:44,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2404
02:58:44,961 --> 02:58:45,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2405
02:58:46,262 --> 02:58:50,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Petitions, presentations, similar matters.

2406
02:58:50,124 --> 02:58:58,168
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-607, petition by Andrew P. Cassane, 23 Cushman Street, Medford, to address the Council on new growth and real estate taxes.

2407
02:58:58,808 --> 02:58:59,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Castagnetti.

2408
02:59:13,516 --> 02:59:14,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Counselor, President.

2409
02:59:16,878 --> 02:59:25,704
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of my appearance, I had a bad bicycle injury on Mystic River last Wednesday, right where the Clippership connected path is supposed to be.

2410
02:59:26,785 --> 02:59:28,025
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, it's not there.

2411
02:59:28,085 --> 02:59:29,246
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a couple of sinkholes.

2412
02:59:30,287 --> 02:59:31,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Not quite a path yet.

2413
02:59:31,107 --> 02:59:31,668
[SPEAKER_15]: It's boring.

2414
02:59:31,888 --> 02:59:32,668
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I noticed.

2415
02:59:32,708 --> 02:59:33,909
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been through a thousand times.

2416
02:59:33,949 --> 02:59:36,511
[SPEAKER_27]: I get distracted, and it costs me dearly.

2417
02:59:37,111 --> 02:59:39,073
[SPEAKER_27]: Head injuries and broken bones.

2418
02:59:41,820 --> 02:59:47,623
[SPEAKER_27]: If I had some power in this, I would be the first on the agenda that I would take care of.

2419
02:59:47,663 --> 02:59:49,243
[SPEAKER_27]: It's public safety, not just that.

2420
02:59:49,883 --> 02:59:53,885
[SPEAKER_27]: Mystic Avenue, cars that should not be parked there when five lanes becomes two lanes.

2421
02:59:53,905 --> 02:59:55,466
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm talking about new roads, Mystic Avenue.

2422
02:59:56,046 --> 02:59:56,686
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we are.

2423
03:00:01,768 --> 03:00:07,311
[SPEAKER_27]: In a nutshell, Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushion Street, 781396.

2424
03:00:10,776 --> 03:00:12,197
[SPEAKER_27]: TIPS, T-I-P-S.

2425
03:00:14,259 --> 03:00:21,705
[SPEAKER_27]: This new growth, we've had this for many, many years, probably every year since pre-my birth.

2426
03:00:22,646 --> 03:00:35,216
[SPEAKER_27]: However, I don't understand why we don't use this new growth, which basically is real estate tax that never existed before from a development.

2427
03:00:36,791 --> 03:00:41,495
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't they use that new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases?

2428
03:00:43,896 --> 03:00:49,040
[SPEAKER_27]: Directly, it should be directly applied to Prop 2.5 increases.

2429
03:00:50,301 --> 03:00:51,282
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't understand why.

2430
03:00:52,323 --> 03:00:56,786
[SPEAKER_27]: Two years ago, I did the math, my real estate tax bill went up $400.

2431
03:00:59,241 --> 03:01:11,383
[SPEAKER_27]: if they apply the $1.5 million of new growth, brand new real estate taxes against the 2.5%, which was $2.5 million, it would have went up $80 instead of $400.

2432
03:01:12,003 --> 03:01:17,644
[SPEAKER_27]: And this has been going on since before I was born.

2433
03:01:19,825 --> 03:01:26,326
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, I believe this new growth, it should not be encouraged the way it is.

2434
03:01:27,507 --> 03:01:32,088
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm for smart growth, great economic growth.

2435
03:01:32,828 --> 03:01:45,971
[SPEAKER_27]: However, if you don't use that new real estate tax to offset two and a half increases, not only does it hurt us, it hurts us five fold.

2436
03:01:47,771 --> 03:01:55,413
[SPEAKER_27]: First of all, you need more fire, police, school teachers, buildings, vehicles.

2437
03:01:57,237 --> 03:01:58,598
[SPEAKER_27]: and infrastructure improvements.

2438
03:02:00,298 --> 03:02:01,539
[SPEAKER_27]: It doesn't make sense to me.

2439
03:02:02,359 --> 03:02:24,170
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm asking if you could formally ask the mayor for an answer, a formal answer, because I've tried on my own with the head of the city assessor's office, and I have not received a straight answer, although I was told

2440
03:02:25,175 --> 03:02:27,576
[SPEAKER_27]: he would mail me something that was three months ago.

2441
03:02:28,196 --> 03:02:29,957
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand I'm not tech savvy.

2442
03:02:30,698 --> 03:02:34,800
[SPEAKER_27]: Snail mail can take time, but it's been three months.

2443
03:02:35,540 --> 03:02:49,166
[SPEAKER_27]: Could you please, can one councilor make a formal request to ask the mayor why aren't we using new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases?

2444
03:02:52,188 --> 03:02:52,388
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure.

2445
03:02:53,609 --> 03:02:53,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2446
03:02:54,109 --> 03:02:54,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Please.

2447
03:02:54,729 --> 03:02:54,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2448
03:02:55,830 --> 03:02:56,250
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2449
03:02:57,010 --> 03:02:57,931
[SPEAKER_27]: Who will make that?

2450
03:02:58,251 --> 03:02:58,591
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us.

2451
03:02:58,631 --> 03:02:58,831
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2452
03:03:01,832 --> 03:03:02,572
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

2453
03:03:02,592 --> 03:03:06,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have approval?

2454
03:03:06,634 --> 03:03:07,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to receive and place of file.

2455
03:03:08,274 --> 03:03:09,995
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to ask the Mayor's.

2456
03:03:10,155 --> 03:03:11,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask the Mayor to make a motion.

2457
03:03:11,556 --> 03:03:12,596
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to make a?

2458
03:03:12,636 --> 03:03:14,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Formal request of the Mayor.

2459
03:03:16,442 --> 03:03:23,086
[SPEAKER_15]: A motion by Councilor Langevin to request.

2460
03:03:23,166 --> 03:03:32,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Amended by Councilor Langevin that the mayor give an answer why the new growth money is not applied to the taxes.

2461
03:03:32,392 --> 03:03:34,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct, Mr. Guese?

2462
03:03:34,273 --> 03:03:36,475
[SPEAKER_15]: To the two and a half taxes.

2463
03:03:36,535 --> 03:03:37,355
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2464
03:03:37,415 --> 03:03:38,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2465
03:03:45,182 --> 03:03:46,867
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion.

2466
03:03:47,910 --> 03:03:48,451
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

2467
03:03:48,892 --> 03:03:48,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2468
03:03:49,554 --> 03:03:51,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

2469
03:03:51,579 --> 03:03:53,324
[SPEAKER_15]: 17-609, communications from the mayor.

2470
03:03:55,008 --> 03:04:16,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body consider the attached resolution in support of House Bill 2683 and Senate Bill 1845, unrepaired gas leaks not only emit dangerous gases into the air we breathe, but the cost of this gas, this lost gas, is passed on to the consumer.

2471
03:04:16,419 --> 03:04:18,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Please support this measure on behalf of

2472
03:04:20,219 --> 03:04:21,820
[SPEAKER_15]: The citizens of Medford.

2473
03:04:22,881 --> 03:04:24,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And- Citizens.

2474
03:04:24,462 --> 03:04:29,805
[SPEAKER_17]: President, I think we discussed this in substance earlier.

2475
03:04:29,825 --> 03:04:30,506
[SPEAKER_17]: We did?

2476
03:04:31,386 --> 03:04:32,707
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little different.

2477
03:04:32,747 --> 03:04:40,673
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little different than what, this is actually, as the gas and electric company do, not charge us for

2478
03:04:42,343 --> 03:04:43,503
[SPEAKER_20]: the energy use.

2479
03:04:43,563 --> 03:04:43,924
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President.

2480
03:04:45,044 --> 03:04:45,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Counselor Knight.

2481
03:04:46,425 --> 03:04:48,606
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to amend the paper to be added as a co-sponsor.

2482
03:04:49,907 --> 03:04:52,069
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you could add, Mr. Clayton, if you could add.

2483
03:04:52,089 --> 03:04:53,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that make me be the one that has to read it?

2484
03:04:54,550 --> 03:04:54,750
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry?

2485
03:04:54,770 --> 03:04:56,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that make me be the one that has to read it?

2486
03:04:56,311 --> 03:04:56,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's a long one.

2487
03:04:56,792 --> 03:04:57,492
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want me to read it?

2488
03:04:58,633 --> 03:04:59,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to waive the reading?

2489
03:05:00,394 --> 03:05:02,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can waive the reading and give a re-synopsis.

2490
03:05:02,515 --> 03:05:04,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Waive the reading.

2491
03:05:04,797 --> 03:05:06,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you please add Counselor Knight as a co-sponsor?

2492
03:05:10,743 --> 03:05:12,163
[SPEAKER_15]: to the bill that the mayor has proposed.

2493
03:05:13,023 --> 03:05:13,964
[SPEAKER_15]: What are we all adding?

2494
03:05:14,244 --> 03:05:14,884
[SPEAKER_15]: A resolution.

2495
03:05:15,104 --> 03:05:16,324
[SPEAKER_15]: We all should be co-sponsors.

2496
03:05:16,364 --> 03:05:18,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you add the whole city council?

2497
03:05:18,044 --> 03:05:19,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, add the whole city council.

2498
03:05:19,785 --> 03:05:21,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Add the whole city council.

2499
03:05:22,925 --> 03:05:26,366
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all co-sponsors.

2500
03:05:28,367 --> 03:05:30,587
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole council supports it.

2501
03:05:30,767 --> 03:05:33,127
[SPEAKER_15]: She's asking for the whole council's support.

2502
03:05:33,808 --> 03:05:35,468
[SPEAKER_15]: So the whole council hopefully will support it.

2503
03:05:36,963 --> 03:05:38,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor, Vice President Mox.

2504
03:05:38,884 --> 03:05:53,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is worthy, although I'll be quite frank with you, I haven't read both bills, but my only question I had was regarding if we're going to require them not to charge the

2505
03:05:55,259 --> 03:05:58,041
[SPEAKER_10]: the homeowner, which I think is a novel concept.

2506
03:05:58,982 --> 03:06:05,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And I assume that would require them to then, on their end, start fixing these leaks.

2507
03:06:06,308 --> 03:06:08,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultimately, who's going to end up paying for this?

2508
03:06:09,887 --> 03:06:22,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and I'd like to hear from someone, uh, you know, stating, I don't know, maybe Mr. Tudin can answer that, but, uh, ultimately, I would assume they're going to pass that off to ... The consumer.

2509
03:06:22,569 --> 03:06:22,829
[SPEAKER_15]: The consumer.

2510
03:06:22,849 --> 03:06:23,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

2511
03:06:23,570 --> 03:06:25,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Um ... So we pay one way or another.

2512
03:06:25,370 --> 03:06:25,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

2513
03:06:25,550 --> 03:06:32,571
[SPEAKER_10]: So secondly, Mr. President, and it's good, uh, you know, we have, uh, level three leagues, which, uh, they don't even look at level three leagues.

2514
03:06:32,931 --> 03:06:35,792
[SPEAKER_10]: They only look at level one and two leagues, uh, in our community.

2515
03:06:36,752 --> 03:06:40,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also ask, Mr. President, an issue that I've been talking about for years.

2516
03:06:40,793 --> 03:06:49,196
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor supports looking at unaccounted for gas and making a savings to the gas payers so they're not paying for that.

2517
03:06:49,696 --> 03:06:54,198
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would ask the mayor respectfully, why doesn't she look at unaccounted for water

2518
03:06:54,980 --> 03:07:00,305
[SPEAKER_10]: which every single ratepayer in this community has been paying through the nose for years.

2519
03:07:00,885 --> 03:07:02,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's roughly 20 percent.

2520
03:07:02,787 --> 03:07:08,251
[SPEAKER_10]: It's millions of dollars, Mr. President, of unaccounted-for water that we're all paying for.

2521
03:07:08,732 --> 03:07:14,136
[SPEAKER_10]: So I realize the mayor is hip on this and wants to see the people have a savings.

2522
03:07:14,536 --> 03:07:16,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I would hope she'd also like to see

2523
03:07:16,678 --> 03:07:23,660
[SPEAKER_10]: The people have a savings on unaccounted-for water, which has been a real major concern for many, many years in this community.

2524
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:26,960
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost and the rate pay is millions of dollars, Mr. President.

2525
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:41,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like for that to accompany this paper in asking her what her thoughts are on unaccounted-for water, because there's ways, as a community, we have over $7 million in the Water and Sewer Enterprise account that we can address unaccounted-for water.

2526
03:07:41,703 --> 03:07:45,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are ways, Mr. President, that we can

2527
03:07:47,117 --> 03:07:50,298
[SPEAKER_10]: look out for the ratepayer in this community regarding water.

2528
03:07:50,858 --> 03:07:51,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2529
03:07:52,819 --> 03:07:55,540
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended.

2530
03:07:57,520 --> 03:08:02,081
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion that we as amended by Councilor Mox.

2531
03:08:02,101 --> 03:08:02,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to sever.

2532
03:08:04,922 --> 03:08:07,863

2533
03:08:08,343 --> 03:08:09,424

2615
03:10:47,767 --> 03:10:48,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Under suspension.

2616
03:10:52,127 --> 03:11:03,615
[SPEAKER_15]: 17612, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Annette and Michelle on her recent passing.

2617
03:11:03,715 --> 03:11:04,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight.

2618
03:11:04,776 --> 03:11:05,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2619
03:11:06,217 --> 03:11:09,119
[SPEAKER_20]: It's with deep sadness that I put this resolution forward.

2620
03:11:09,299 --> 03:11:13,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Annette was awake last evening and was given her burial today.

2621
03:11:13,382 --> 03:11:14,503
[SPEAKER_21]: She's a good friend.

2622
03:11:14,543 --> 03:11:16,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Her son John and I grew up together.

2623
03:11:16,024 --> 03:11:17,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Her son Tommy and I grew up together.

2624
03:11:17,905 --> 03:11:19,786
[SPEAKER_21]: And very sad to see her go.

2625
03:11:20,167 --> 03:11:25,550
[SPEAKER_21]: She struggled for a very long time with multiple sclerosis and was also bravely battling cancer towards the end.

2626
03:11:26,210 --> 03:11:33,195
[SPEAKER_21]: And the illness got the better of her body, but didn't get the betterment of her heart and soul, Mr. President, through the whole time that she was ill.

2627
03:11:34,035 --> 03:11:38,438
[SPEAKER_21]: She was a constant fighter, and it's just a tragic, tragic situation to see it happen.

2628
03:11:39,519 --> 03:11:42,821
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to just offer my deep, insincere condolences to the family.

2629
03:11:43,521 --> 03:11:52,303
[SPEAKER_21]: You know for those of us that remember Annette, we'd always see her down in Mario's Classic Barrel working down there for Mario or over at the liquor store, clerking at the liquor store on Mr. Gabb.

2630
03:11:52,343 --> 03:11:55,324
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, she's a face that's been in the community for a long time.

2631
03:11:55,784 --> 03:12:00,466
[SPEAKER_21]: She raised two great kids here in the city of Medford and she's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

2632
03:12:00,586 --> 03:12:01,946
[SPEAKER_15]: She was also an election official.

2633
03:12:02,246 --> 03:12:02,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, she was.

2634
03:12:02,886 --> 03:12:03,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that.

2635
03:12:04,026 --> 03:12:05,647
[SPEAKER_15]: And we get please stand for a moment of silence.

2636
03:12:17,333 --> 03:12:18,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it just affect it also?

2637
03:12:19,382 --> 03:12:20,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Mox.

2638
03:12:20,923 --> 03:12:26,425
[SPEAKER_10]: On Annette, Annette was a staple in the Wellington area with her and her sons.

2639
03:12:27,666 --> 03:12:39,691
[SPEAKER_10]: As was mentioned, she was always a friendly face at WAD 7 Precinct 2, and she was a terrific mother, a friend, and she will be sorely missed.

2640
03:12:39,751 --> 03:12:40,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2641
03:12:40,312 --> 03:12:42,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, we're on suspension.

2642
03:12:42,333 --> 03:12:43,433
[SPEAKER_20]: Paper 17575 off the table, please. 1775.

2643
03:12:54,484 --> 03:12:57,747
[SPEAKER_15]: 17, what was that?

2644
03:12:59,448 --> 03:13:01,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Community Preservation Act Homework Petition.

2645
03:13:01,049 --> 03:13:01,029
17575.

2646
03:13:01,470 --> 03:13:05,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight, motion to receive and place on file.

2647
03:13:06,413 --> 03:13:07,994
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but the petitioner's not here.

2648
03:13:08,014 --> 03:13:09,436
[SPEAKER_20]: The petitioner is not here, Councilor Knight.

2649
03:13:09,756 --> 03:13:11,717
[SPEAKER_20]: I say that the paper's out of order, Mr. President.

2650
03:13:11,737 --> 03:13:14,259
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not really a petition because it's not a use of the petition process.

2651
03:13:14,299 --> 03:13:16,281
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really something that should be referred to public anticipation.

2652
03:13:16,801 --> 03:13:17,322
[SPEAKER_20]: You are correct.

2653
03:13:18,182 --> 03:13:18,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2654
03:13:18,442 --> 03:13:18,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Move to questions.

2655
03:13:20,944 --> 03:13:21,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Let it open.

2656
03:13:22,227 --> 03:13:23,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what is the question?

2657
03:13:23,208 --> 03:13:23,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you want to move?

2658
03:13:24,048 --> 03:13:24,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Receive and place a file.

2659
03:13:25,029 --> 03:13:25,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Receive and place a file.

2660
03:13:26,770 --> 03:13:28,231
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Naita, receive.

2661
03:13:28,251 --> 03:13:28,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

2662
03:13:29,112 --> 03:13:29,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2663
03:13:29,672 --> 03:13:30,713
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could, Mr. President.

2664
03:13:31,354 --> 03:13:35,557
[SPEAKER_10]: The petitioner was here at our last meeting in July.

2665
03:13:36,257 --> 03:13:37,318
[SPEAKER_10]: The hour grew late.

2666
03:13:37,338 --> 03:13:37,738
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

2667
03:13:38,178 --> 03:13:40,400
[SPEAKER_10]: He asked that it respectfully be laid on the table.

2668
03:13:41,141 --> 03:13:51,348
[SPEAKER_10]: The petitioner had a death in his family, Mr. President, and he would respectfully ask that it continue to be laid on the table, Mr. President, so he can come up and speak on it.

2669
03:13:52,683 --> 03:13:52,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2670
03:13:54,404 --> 03:13:56,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, Mr. President, it's more of a procedural issue than anything else.

2671
03:13:56,646 --> 03:13:59,529
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel as though it's something that should be done in the public participation process of the meeting.

2672
03:14:00,189 --> 03:14:05,174
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not something that can be filed at the beginning of the next meeting and be put on the next meeting.

2673
03:14:05,194 --> 03:14:07,435
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't have to be something that sits on the table for the entire period.

2674
03:14:07,515 --> 03:14:15,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, like I said, it did go to the last meeting at a very late hour, and they did ask that we move it over to the next meeting.

2675
03:14:15,943 --> 03:14:21,027
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have a little bit of a concern, Mr. President, about the way that the petition process is being used and not necessarily

2676
03:14:21,527 --> 03:14:23,868
[SPEAKER_21]: maybe in the right way or in the right frame.

2677
03:14:24,068 --> 03:14:35,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the petition process is starting to become overly politicized and a lot of these items that are being brought up through petitions should really be done during the public participation process.

2678
03:14:35,671 --> 03:14:38,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Where it is already on the agenda, I feel that we should just keep it there.

2679
03:14:38,852 --> 03:14:40,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I withdraw my motion, Mr. President.

2680
03:14:40,193 --> 03:14:41,593
[SPEAKER_15]: We currently don't have the support.

2681
03:14:41,613 --> 03:14:44,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we have one last one offered by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2682
03:14:45,714 --> 03:14:47,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the City Council

2683
03:14:48,422 --> 03:14:53,085
[SPEAKER_15]: congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Adam Knight on celebrating the eighth wedding anniversary.

2684
03:14:53,145 --> 03:14:54,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel Scott Pelley.

2685
03:14:54,265 --> 03:14:55,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you, Mr. President.

2686
03:14:56,426 --> 03:15:13,136
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Adam prides himself on wishing everybody every luck in the world, so I know that the person that deserves it more than anyone is his wife, and so we just congratulate them in making eight years.

2687
03:15:13,936 --> 03:15:16,438
[SPEAKER_16]: I said nine, but he corrected me.

2688
03:15:17,478 --> 03:15:18,960
[SPEAKER_16]: The rumor has it you might be nine now.

2689
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:19,881
[SPEAKER_16]: You better ask your wife.

2690
03:15:20,402 --> 03:15:20,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2691
03:15:21,463 --> 03:15:22,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

2692
03:15:22,325 --> 03:15:23,486
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 years all together.

2693
03:15:23,526 --> 03:15:24,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2694
03:15:25,048 --> 03:15:26,530
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll pat my own wife on the back.

2695
03:15:27,011 --> 03:15:29,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week will be 41 years for me.

2696
03:15:29,514 --> 03:15:29,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2697
03:15:30,996 --> 03:15:31,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2698
03:15:31,617 --> 03:15:32,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine how lucky my wife is.

2699
03:15:34,608 --> 03:15:35,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Does she know?

2700
03:15:35,549 --> 03:15:37,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations to my wife.

2701
03:15:37,551 --> 03:15:39,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Does she know the records?

2702
03:15:39,232 --> 03:15:39,893
[SPEAKER_23]: The records.

2703
03:15:40,594 --> 03:15:42,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I moved to table the records of last week.

2704
03:15:43,136 --> 03:15:49,062
[SPEAKER_15]: The records were passed at Council Night will be tabled to the next meeting.

2705
03:15:50,363 --> 03:15:52,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn by Council Night.

2706
03:15:52,345 --> 03:15:54,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Scarapelli.

2707
03:15:55,288 --> 03:15:56,809
[SPEAKER_15]: All in favor, aye.

2708
03:15:57,049 --> 03:15:57,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.
