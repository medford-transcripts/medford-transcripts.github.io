10
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:20,632
Clodion, I'm going to unmute you. Clodion, if we could please have your name and address for the record. My name is Clodion. I'm 94 First Street, Peabody, Massachusetts, 01960. OK, thank you, Clodion. I see that everything is in order. I know that you are moving in.

12
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:20,993
The hours of operations have to be adjusted, just so you know. Can you put this down? I'm trying to get him to turn it on. If I may for one minute, we're trying to work on some technical issues. So I'm going to try to see if we can get the volume turned up here in the chambers. So if you could please allow us just two quick minutes.

13
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:52,921
So if I may, I talked to Patrick, it's because he's on the phone and that's why it's coming through so light. So.

14
00:05:54,845 --> 00:06:24,308
Okay, so the license goes until 11 o'clock. The license goes until 11 o'clock. So you would have to petition to extend that. I just want to make sure you knew that. To extend that. I have to petition to extend that? You're not allowed to open after 11. You're not allowed to open after 11. After 11 AM? PM.

15
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:52,287
Without a special permit, correct? Without a special permit, correct. Right now it's operating after 11, so. Right, that license goes with that business. That license goes with that business. Okay, so. If you can't contact, just contact the clerk. If you can't contact, just contact the clerk. Tomorrow and he can fill you in. Okay, so what do I have to do after? Tomorrow and he can fill you in. This is terrible.

16
00:06:53,401 --> 00:07:21,970
OK, but I see everything is in order. I see everything is in order. So I move approval after my colleagues have questions. I move approval after my colleagues have questions. Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly. Thank you. On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Vice President Caviello. Mr. President, if I may? Any questions? Oh, yes, Councilor Wright. Can the petitioner please, Mr. President, describe how many employees he's going to have working for him?

17
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:55,045
How many employees? Well, I don't know right now. I'm taking it over probably two or three in the beginning. Two maybe. I don't know. You'll have to carry insurance if you're going to be having employees. And I find it hard to believe you wouldn't have any employees if you were going to be open 15 hours a day. I know, but I don't know. I'm taking it over. So I will take insurance, of course. I missed that.

18
00:07:55,923 --> 00:08:21,708
Did you say you're going to be taking out insurance? The question was, are you going to be taking out insurance? Are you going to be taking out insurance? Yes, I will take insurance, of course. It's required, and if he doesn't, he's going to be subject to fine.

19
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:53,737
Any other questions? Okay, the motion to consult Scott Pelly, seconded by Vice President Caviello. Clerk Bernabez, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Councilor Knight? No, on the grounds he doesn't have insurance, Mr. President.

20
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:24,922
Thank you. Councilor Marks. Yes. I didn't hear Councilor Marks. Yes. He said yes. Thank you. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Falco. Yes. Six in the affirmative, one in the negative. The motion passes. Congratulations. Good luck and please contact the city clerk for additional information regarding hours of operation.

21
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:42,370
Thank you. Motion to revert back to the regular. While we're under suspension, 20-597. And that is under.

22
00:09:45,745 --> 00:10:14,821
0597. Offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide an update on the status of the fiscal year 2021 state budget and its impact on city revenue. Councilor Beers. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Knight. The city and school budget are still, I would say, in crisis. We don't know yet

23
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:33,620
what the impact of state and federal funding is going to be. It seems that there's a stalemate at the federal level, and it now seems like there's not clarity at the state level regarding the state budget. I know that there was a commitment to maintain Chapter 70 funding and unrestricted general government aid.

24
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:49,988
But again, it seems like the state is unsure of where things are going to go. So I was hoping to get an update from the city administration on their view on the state budget talks and what they think the impact could be on city revenues. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Councilor Knight.

25
00:10:50,039 --> 00:11:19,621
Yes, Mr. President, I do believe it was three or four weeks ago that this council passed a resolution. And that resolution was to request that the Director of Finance appear before this body to meet with us to talk about the first quarter and what our revenues look like and future projections, Mr. President. And these papers are of similar matter in content and subject matter, and I was wondering if the Finance Director was available with us this evening. She is not, but what I can do is I can set up, would you like to committee the whole? No.

26
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:48,697
I'd like you to appear before the council to talk to us about the projections and the revenue forecasts and where we are in terms of this time last year and what our financial picture looks like, Mr. President. This was something we talked about where we requested that you appear before us quarterly back when the budget was going on. That was a part of the budget papers. When we discussed and deliberated the budget, we requested that we get quarterly updates on the revenue projections. The first quarter has ended and it's time. You are correct. Okay, thank you Councilor Knight.

27
00:11:49,574 --> 00:12:18,278
Would anybody else like to speak on this issue? Okay. Seeing and hearing none, on the motion of, let's see, no one has a hand raised, okay. On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Night. Clerk Coonerty, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Kerrio. Yes.

28
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:47,877
Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. 70 affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes. Motion to revert back to the regular order of business. On the motion of Council Beers to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Morrell. Clerk Hertoghies, please call the roll. Councilor Beers? Yes.

29
00:12:48,181 --> 00:13:13,730
Vice President Carabiello. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Fevella. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative. We will now revert to the regular order of business. Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-476. Mr. President, motion to waive the reading for a brief synopsis. This matter has been on the agenda now for three consecutive weeks.

30
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:41,135
Okay. Second. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs for a brief synopsis. Councilor Knight, would you like to give that brief synopsis? Certainly, Mr. President. The paper before us this evening- We can vote on it. Okay. On that motion, Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Kerrio? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes.

31
00:13:41,506 --> 00:14:07,072
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falcone? Yes. 70 affirmative, 0 negative. The motion passes. Council Light? Yes, Mr. President. This is a companion paper to the zoning amendment that the council just passed recently. What it is is it's a paper that would establish a selection committee for applicants for marijuana licenses in the city of Medford as required by state law and by the will of the voters here in the community. This document would allow by right

32
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:28,874
marijuana establishments to be located in commercial to or industrially zoned districts by way of a special permit, Mr. President. It outlines a selection committee that's chaired by the chief of police and has five members which would rank and interview the applicants and make recommendations to the mayor who would have the power to enter into a host community agreement to issue a license to

33
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:57,595
one of the applicants, Mr. President. So this is a paper that has been before us for a number of years, about five years, half a decade. I'm glad to see that it's finally come to the finish line, Mr. President, and I would move for approval. There was some discussion and some concern about the 3% local option tax that would be included in this paper, and at the advice of our city solicitor, Kimberly Scanlon, she has provided us with the legal opinion that we can do that by way of adopting a local option. I'd ask that that local option be placed on the agenda next week, Mr. President.

34
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:22,807
so that we can vote on that. It doesn't have to be done this evening according to what our legal counsel tells us. I'm very glad that we asked Solicitor Scanlon this question because we were waiting for Kopelman and Page to give us an answer now for at least five weeks on it, and we didn't get that. So I'd like to thank Solicitor Scanlon personally for the work that she's done in allowing us to bring this as far as we have. So with that being said, Mr. President, that's the brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and I'd move for approval of the paper.

35
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:49,655
Second. Thank you, Councilor Night. On the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Any questions, comments from the council? Anyone online here? Okay, no one has a hand up. Okay, on that motion, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll. Mr. President, a brief question. Yes. Is this for first reading or for approval? This is for first reading. For the first reading, yes. Okay, here comes the roll call.

36
00:15:51,697 --> 00:16:20,992
Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Falco? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes and it passes its first reading. Thank you, Councilor Night for that brief synopsis.

37
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:39,166
2-0-590 offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the representatives from Amazon.com distribution branch appear before the Medford City Council to discuss the practices of its drivers in the city of Medford. Councilor Knight.

38
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:58,454
Mr. President, thank you very much. I am a self-identifying amazon.com addict. I have boxes delivered to my house constantly. And as we go through the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, I think we've all become far more reliant on delivery services like this.

39
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:17,675
But with that being said, Mr. President, while Amazon does provide a great value and a great service to those of us in this community, the driving practices of their delivery drivers aren't exactly up to par. I don't think Mr. Jotis or Mr. Bruno gave them a training course on how to drive here in Medford.

40
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:31,276
A lot of times what we'll see, Mr. President, is an Amazon truck that's making a delivery, drive down, say, a small side street like Billings Avenue in South Medford. And they come up to the house and they say, this is a good spot to stop.

41
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:59,795
right in the middle of the street. And they park their car, and they get out, and they make a delivery, Mr. President. It's creating safety issues. It's creating quality of life issues. It's creating traffic issues in the community. I know that amazon.com is a good neighbor, a good creator of jobs here in the community, with good paying jobs. And we appreciate the work they do. And I know that if we have the opportunity to speak with them, I think that they'll be willing to work with us in assuming a partnership that allows us to address this issue. So with that being said, I rest my case.

42
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:25,765
Move the floor to my council colleague and co-sponsor of the resolution, Councilor Scott Peli. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Councilor Scott Peli. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Knight, for your synopsis. I think that with that, if I could, can I amend the paper? I know that once our constituents read the agenda, if we could amend it and ask for a representative for both Uber and Lyft.

43
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:41,830
That for their same practices, we know that they're very important to our community. But at the same time, their practices are stopping wherever they want and causing dangerous issues with

44
00:18:41,830 --> 00:19:06,012
possible road rage issues, I think that's one of the constituents that I talked to this week, is making sure understanding what is the reasoning for stopping in the middle of the street and with no regards to other vehicles or pedestrians or bike riders. So if we can make that amendment, thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:30,987
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to my colleagues for putting this resolution on the agenda. I'm happy to see the amendment, including Uber and Lyft. I think what we've seen is that these app-driven companies are looking at non-traditional, I guess might be the best word to use, methods of delivery.

46
00:19:31,730 --> 00:20:00,890
And, you know, I'm hopeful. I'm glad this is on. I hope we can come to a good agreement. But I am a little concerned. I just found out the other week that Amazon's guidelines actually set and requested all of the delivery companies that they use have their vans a certain size. And that size is about one inch smaller than would require federal regulation. So, you know, they're really leaning into some less than credible business practices in order to, you know,

47
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:25,561
to be replaced with an Amazon distribution center. So I think this problem will only grow over

48
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:50,519
Thank you, Councilor Peers. Vice President Caviello. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my fellow councilors putting this out there with Amazon and Uber and Lyft, but it isn't just them. It's really, it's FedEx, it's UPS, it's GrubHub, it's, I mean, everybody's getting everything delivered to their house via some kind of vehicle. So it's really very vast now.

49
00:20:50,519 --> 00:21:01,572
who's delivering, who's not delivering. And I see them, people just park the car and get out and leave it in the middle of the street and don't really care. So I think it's.

50
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:23,425
How do we get the message to all of them? I don't know. But I think we do need to clamp down on this subway line, because everybody's on the timetable, and everyone's just rushing around, speeding around the streets, and disregarding our laws also. So that's part of the problem too.

51
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:48,198
I don't know how we get the message out to everybody, all these different groups. Maybe it's up to the chief to figure out, maybe there's some network to get them out to. But the Amazon guys, as I said, they're everywhere now. And like Councilor Beall said, they're opening two spots up in Revere. I mean, hundreds more trucks hitting the streets. Again, I thank my councilors for putting this on tonight.

52
00:21:48,468 --> 00:22:11,857
Okay, thank you, Vice President Caviello. On the motion of Councilors Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Behrs. Clerk Hurnaby, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caviello?

53
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:41,118
Councilor Layton. Yes. Councilor Barks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Fevella. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. 20-591 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion on the following question. Does a meeting posted for a certain date that extends past midnight and into a different date create the potential for an open meeting law violation? Councilor Knight.

54
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:57,925
Yes, Mr. President, it's becoming quite frequent that the parties' meetings start at 5.30 and end after midnight. And that raises the question as to if a meeting is posted for Tuesday evening between 7 and 10 p.m. and it's going to be broadcast on Zoom and it goes

55
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:25,702
past the posted hours, and then further on into the next day, whether or not that would create the potential for an open meeting law violation. I know there are many concerned citizens in Medford that have raised some issues about open meeting law in the past. So as we move forward and work towards full and total compliance with the open meeting law and do our best to do such, I ask the question to the city solicitor, Mr. President. So I move for approval and ask my council colleagues in support to pay it up. Thank you, Councilor Knight. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Pierce.

56
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:55,891
It's not an amendment or anything. I would just add, it might be worth us taking a look at the summer schedule. I'm not sure if these long meetings have been impacted by the summer schedule of the council or not, but I obviously support the measure and getting the opinion. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Anybody else want to speak on that? No? Okay. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Carter, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes.

57
00:23:56,414 --> 00:24:22,132
Vice President Kerrio. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Marks. Yes. Councilor Morrell. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. President Fevella. Yes. Seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes. 2-0-592 offered by Councilor Knight. Be it resolved that the hours of Park Method's Main Street office be reviewed to ensure that it is open later than 2 p.m.

58
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:42,854
at least one day per week. Councilor Wright. Mr. President, thank you very much. Park Medford's opening at, I guess we'd call, modified hours at this point in time, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily, and it creates a little bit of a hardship for individuals in this community that work, that might want to pick up the phone and call over there to ask some questions, to appeal a ticket over the phone.

59
00:24:42,854 --> 00:25:10,597
So I'm asking that the administration take a look at the negotiation that they did with Park Medford and the contract that they have in place to allow them to modify their hours and see if we can have one night a week with their open late, maybe the same night, like Wednesday nights that coincides with city halls late. But just the night so that people know that they can take care of city business and all city offices are going to be open and available. Thank you, Councilor Knight. Any questions, comments from the council? No questions online. On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by? Second.

60
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:29,564
Vice President Caraballo, Clark-Cunningham, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs? Yes. Vice President Caraballo? Yes. Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor Marks? Yes. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes.

61
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:53,307
President Fevella. Yes, setting the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. 20-593 offered by Councilor Morrell. Be it resolved that the City Council request from the administration a current list of non-ADA compliant sidewalks in the city and to the extent that it exists, plans to update and bring into compliance said sidewalks. Councilor Morrell.

62
00:25:53,797 --> 00:26:15,987
Thank you, Mr. President. I raised this at this time, make this request based on a number of things we've been talking about recently. And I do want to point out the fact that I know our engineering department and DPW does great work on updating our sidewalks and bringing them into compliance as intersections and sidewalks are updated, projects happen. But we've been having a lot of discussions. I know Councilor Behr has introduced

63
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:44,607
and resolution last week, looking at our snow removal ordinance. And Councilor Knight brought up a number of salient points as far as the massive amount of work that our DPW has already and really could be doing to improve accessibility in our community. And we've also had a number of discussions with a fine point on equity in the past several months. So I think when we're looking at all of these things, we have to consider our streets and our sidewalks and accessibility issues and whether or not they're actually accessible and equitable to everyone in our community.

64
00:26:44,607 --> 00:27:11,219
I know the ADA is essentially an unfunded mandate, so it's really challenging for cities to do the amount of work that needs to be done to make sure our streets and our sidewalks are accessible to everyone. But I think it's really important as we come around the calendar and start looking at another budget time to understand where we stand as a city as far as accessibility with our sidewalks and what work there is, also possibly what grants we've already pursued and plans to update as far as

65
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:36,211
complete updates that sidewalks will be brought into compliance because it's a massive project, but also looking at those sidewalks individually. So I'm just really trying to gather information so we can make the best decisions come budget time and making sure we're supporting work that really needs to be done in the city. So I move approval. Okay. On the motion of Council Morales, seconded by Vice President Caviello, Council Knight.

66
00:27:36,312 --> 00:28:03,177
Mr. President, I support this paper wholeheartedly, and I'd like to add a amendment or a B paper. Just several weeks ago, I believe we talked about accessibility, and there's one aspect of accessibility, which is design and construction. And there's another aspect of accessibility, which is government-created accessibility issues through permitting. And I know a number of us behind this rail spoke about some concerns that they had with Snappy Patty's location in the sidewalk there, and we had requested an update from our

67
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:25,317
ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity. And I don't believe that paper has been forthcoming, Mr. President. So I'd like to, again, reiterate that request. Okay. Councilor Morrell, is that okay if that's an amendment? That works. Okay, perfect. Any other questions or comments from the council? Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Caballero, as amended by Councilor Knight. Clerk Cunabes, please call the roll.

68
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:39,897
Yes. Yes. Yes.

69
00:28:40,488 --> 00:29:05,952
President Fevella. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 20-594 offered by Councilor Morrell. Be it resolved that the City Council receive an update from Medford's Massport Community Advisory Committee representatives, Peter Houck and Luke Prasner in response to the recent FAA rejection of dispersion concepts to mitigate airplane traffic and the resulting noise and pollution over Medford. Councilor Morrell.

70
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:22,827
Thank you, Mr. President. And I do want to point out, I know Councilor Marks introduced a similar paper back in June, but since then, so I think the last time we had a visit by Peter and Luke was actually, I believe, in October. I can't be positive, but I believe that was the last time we got the update as far as the number of

71
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:41,744
different approaches that were going to be presented to the FAA as far as dispersion and mitigation of the onslaught of air traffic over Medford. And in the middle of August, August 15th, a decision came down from the FAA and they rejected all of the concepts that were presented. I know the mayor has expressed her dismay and

72
00:29:41,744 --> 00:30:11,647
I think it would be really helpful to get an update directly from Peter and Luke as far as where do we go from here. It's my understanding from some outreach we've gotten that this isn't good, but we're not without hope. So I think it'd be really effective for the council to know what are our options after this rejection from the FAA. Thank you. Councilor Morrell. Councilor Behrs. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Morrell, for putting this on. And Councilor Marks for bringing it up previously.

73
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:37,718
This plane noise thing has been an issue for a long time, but it's gotten a lot worse recently. And I just want to applaud everybody. I know there are a lot of people in Medford, in addition to Peter and Luke, who are really working on this. I want to applaud their efforts. I think another point where we can be hopeful is hopefully a new federal administration will help to move this along in a better way, and hopefully we'll be there soon.

74
00:30:38,697 --> 00:31:04,904
But I just really want to thank everyone for the work they're doing and also encourage people to continue sending complaints about airplane noise to Massport and the FAA. I think that's an essential piece of this. And if we can keep documenting and providing the data of the impacts, this is making making backyards unlivable, waking people up at 545 in the morning. I think we just need to keep pushing that. And I thank everyone who's been doing that.

75
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:32,090
Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Any other questions, comments? Vice President Caviello. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, maybe we should be notifying our federal delegation about this. They may not be aware of the decision that's happened. Congresswoman Clark has been very helpful over the past couple of years with this. Maybe we should bring them and notify them of this decision also, Mr. President. Okay.

76
00:31:33,305 --> 00:32:01,098
Are you amending the paper? Okay. If we amend it to notify our federal delegation of this, especially Congresswoman Clark, where she's been our point person over the last few years in this. Okay. Thank you, Vice President Caviello. Any other questions, comments from the council? Any questions here on Zoom? Nope. Okay. On the motion of Council Morrell,

77
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:25,735
I seconded by second vice president. Cabrillo is amended by vice president. Cabrillo quicker to be, please call the roll. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

78
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:45,682
Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Fevella? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. 20-595 offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express its support of H5018, an act to guarantee housing stability during the COVID-19 emergency and recovery.

79
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:58,118
Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker, Councilor Behrs.

80
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:22,874
Thank you, Mr. President. The state's eviction and foreclosure moratorium for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, well, it was supposed to be for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it expires on Saturday, the 17th of October. Governor Baker has the authority to extend it, but is indicating that he will not. He's introduced a package of some assistance that could help people, but

81
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:50,988
Essentially, unless a law is passed by the State House and State Senate, the eviction and foreclosure moratorium will abate. It will no longer be in effect. We have an eviction and foreclosure crisis coming very soon. If this moratorium is not extended, courts, in fact, the Massachusetts courts are hiring back retired judges just to handle the additional influx of cases that they're expecting.

82
00:33:51,427 --> 00:34:20,924
The Act to Guarantee Housing Stability is legislation with broad support in the House to fix this, and also to help not only tenants and homeowners, but also landlords, in addition to extending the moratorium. It also provides significant legal resources to all people involved in housing to help us get through this crisis. And I want to thank Senator Jalen, Representative Donato, Representative Garbally, and Representative Barber, who are all co-sponsors of this bill.

83
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:46,102
And I think we should send a message as the city of Medford that we need to get this done It's great that our legislative delegation is on top of it But you know I think it's important to show that municipalities are very concerned about it that we're concerned about making sure that people have housing stability here in Medford and Hopefully, you know our nudge is combined with the nudges of a lot of other advocates and and local officials in in

84
00:34:46,102 --> 00:35:15,329
ensuring that we have real housing stability during this pandemic. And especially during this winter where, you know, in some parts of Boston, we're already seeing people set up tents in parks because they have been either kicked out of housing or didn't know their rights relative to the moratorium. So this is going to get serious. And I think it's important that we try to do our part to get some legislation passed at the state level to address it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Behrs. Councilor Morales.

85
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:46,126
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this forth and really echo what he said, where, um, not only we're in crisis right now and there's an even larger crisis looming. So I really appreciate that our state delegation, um, is leading on this. And I think it's, it's clear where this entire pandemic we've been trying to figure out where help is coming from different levels. And I think it's very clear that it's not coming from the federal level. So I think what we can do at the state level to, um, protect residents, uh, in Medford is really important. So, um, this of course has my support. Thank you.

86
00:35:47,273 --> 00:36:17,142
Thank you, Councilor Morrell. Any other questions, comments from the council? Okay. Anyone? No one has a hand up. Zoom. On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Vice President Caviello. Clerk Carter, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes. Vice President Caviello. Yes. Councilor Night. He is locked the room. Okay. Councilor Marks.

87
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:38,877
No. Is that a no? No. That is a no. Councilor Morrell? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? No. President Fevella? Yes. 4 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, 1 absent. The motion passes.

88
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:54,554
20-596, offered by Councilor Beers. Be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the City Clerk provide a brief update on preparations for the November 3rd general election. Councilor Beers.

89
00:36:55,988 --> 00:37:16,981
Thank you, Mr. President. I know that our city election staff, the clerk and folks in the registrar's office have been working incredibly hard to meet this moment of, you know, an election that nobody expected during a pandemic that nobody expected. There's obviously a huge influx of mail ballot requests, just like there was for the September primary.

90
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:30,953
And I just want to commend, first commend the city election staff on their work on the mail ballots. I think that's really gone very well this time. And also commend all the folks who stepped up to join the team and work with the city election staff.

91
00:37:31,949 --> 00:38:01,683
early voting starts this next week as well. So that's another option that people have in addition to the mail ballots, and of course, election day voting on November 3rd. And I was hoping we could hear a little bit more from the clerk about what they've been doing around election preparation for the November 3rd general election. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Piz. Clerk Bernabez, would you be able to give us an update? Absolutely. One quick point. Early voting actually starts on Saturday at nine o'clock at City Hall.

92
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:32,733
It's from nine to three on Saturday, nine to three on Sunday. And then it goes for the following, it goes during the week, during normal city hall business hours. So it'll be two Saturdays and two Sundays of early voting from nine to three. And then two weeks of early voting at city hall during normal city hall business hours. And voters can choose to return their mail ballots, they can choose to early vote in person, or they can choose to vote in person on election day. So they have three options to vote.

93
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:37,357
to give a little perspective for the.

94
00:38:40,259 --> 00:39:06,010
September primary, we processed a little over 12,000 requests, I believe, for mail-in and absentee ballots. As of today at three o'clock, we have received 14,200 requests for absentee and early voting ballots. As of three o'clock today, we have mailed out 13,528 early voting or absentee ballots, which is 96% compliance, according to the Secretary of State's office.

95
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:35,930
There are also about 250 overseas absentee ballots out there with roughly 100 of them have come back already. So we are in full swing for the November election. We are ahead of where we were in September, and we're getting more ballots out every day. We're also getting more requests in every day, but the request number has tripled down with the number of postcards that have come back. Thank you, Clerk Arnabes. Any other questions, comments? Counselor Knight.

96
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:47,152
Yes, Mr. President, I have a couple of questions concerning the applications for vote by mail. It's my understanding that this whole process was handled in-house, is that correct?

97
00:39:49,818 --> 00:40:07,823
That is correct, Councilor. Last Tuesday night, when we were here at the meeting, I had to use the restroom and I went out and I heard the postage machine going. And I went in there and one of our representatives of our building department was running ballots through the postage machine. And that got me to thinking, why is it that we're mailing these

98
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:36,224
with a first class stamp on them, if we could send it to a mail house and do an enhanced carrier route line of travel, we'd probably be able to cut down the cost of the actual mailing for the applications to vote by mail. So I didn't know if there was some sort of requirement that these had to be mailed by first class, or if we could have done an enhanced carrier route line of travel bulk mailing to deliver these ballots and save some money. Council, that's an excellent question. The reason we're mailing these out first class is because

99
00:40:37,540 --> 00:41:06,194
We have Cindy Gale, our election coordinator, has been working with the post office. And if we mail these out as first class mail in Medford, these ballots will stay in Medford. If they are bulk mailed, they go to Boston, and then they come back to Medford, and they take significantly longer to reach residents. So they get out of the building faster, and they stay in Medford, and they're delivered to residents faster if they're mailed first class right from Medford. So that's why it's going that way.

100
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:33,633
And do we know what the cost difference is? I mean, it's $0.55 for a first class letter. I mean, I think you can get it down to $0.13 per piece. I could find out for you, Councilor. I don't know the difference in the prices right now, but I would find out for you. And then I know that you've done a great job, Adam, and I'm not being critical. We have had some fair share of problems with ballots going to the wrong district. Is that correct?

101
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:39,185
Yeah, that was a problem in September. It's much less of a problem now.

102
00:41:43,792 --> 00:42:13,137
And that's why I make the recommendation that it might be better that we handle this through a mail house, where the mail house can put together the mailing labels, where they're supposed to go, the district, so on and so forth. People that do this for a living, that just have the expertise. So we'd have less margin of error, and then we'd also have the cost savings capability. If it takes a couple more days, it takes a couple more days. We'll just have to start earlier, I guess. But that would be my suggestion and recommendation going forward. But I would not offer that in the form of an amendment or a motion, Mr. President. I can bring that up at the registrar's meeting, the next registrar's meeting.

103
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:36,509
Okay, thank you, Councilor Knight. Councilor Morrell. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, just two questions for Adam. I know we had a resolution a few weeks ago as far as staffing in the elections office. And I was curious if there's an update on that. I know the mayor had also said that there is funding for part-time staffing. So I was just curious if you have an update on staffing from now until election day or however it might pan out.

104
00:42:37,673 --> 00:42:55,358
We are continuing to pay part-time workers to help with this effort, and we are continuing to pay our election coordinator, who's a part-time employee, through our elections budget. So there is some funding available for part-time election

105
00:42:57,873 --> 00:43:18,427
And we're using that funding. As far as I know, the issue with a full-time election person has not been resolved yet. But we obviously have no choice in this matter. We have to get these ballots out, and we have to prepare for this election. So we are continuing to bring in some temporary workers to help with mailing out of the ballots. And our election coordinator, who is a part-time employee, continues to be paid out of the election budget.

106
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:39,706
Okay. Thank you. And then, um, do you have an update as far as, um, poll workers is, um, I guess need more. And then if people are still interested, are you still accepting people who want to help out? Um, and what's the best way for them to go through that process? Um, right now, it looks like we're actually gonna be gonna be fully staffed for election day. That

107
00:43:41,984 --> 00:44:04,748
changes on a dime, however we do have some last minute cancellations in every election. Right now we have, right now it looks like all of our election day staffing is set, all of our early voting staffing is set, and we have another hundred or so people in reserve who are available if there are last minute cancellations. We do encourage people, if they want to apply to be poll workers, applying so we continue to work on and vet that list.

108
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:34,448
Okay, thank you. And I think you cut out for a second. If they, if they want to be poll workers, what's the best way for them to apply or reach out about that? They can email me or they can call the clerk's office directly and we can, we can, uh, we can work on that with them. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Councilor. Councilor Marks. Uh, thank you. Just a quick question to the clerk. Uh, Mr. Clerk, isn't it true that all, uh, political mail, uh, goes out automatically first class through the post office?

109
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:57,280
Well, I can tell you that all the envelopes that we get from the state are marked as first class envelopes. Okay, so if that's the case, then maybe in line with Councilor Knight's stating, wouldn't it be better off if we did send these out knowing that they're going to go out first class anyways and not pay for the first class postage?

110
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:28,364
You know what, that's a good question. Let me look into the difference in the price and see if that's something we can do. I don't know the answer to that. The reason they're going out, I can tell you that one of the reasons they're going out first class right now is so that they don't get bulk mailed to Boston and then mailed back to Medford, because the bulk mail delays it by a week to 10 days. So we were concerned about the timing of being so close to the election. But let me look into the difference in price and see if that is something we can accommodate.

111
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:50,858
Thank you, and I just want to say with all this confusion and the new process that's going on and the number of ballots increasing that we're mailing out now, I just want to say that your staff in the office of, I can't even think of the office's name now.

112
00:45:50,858 --> 00:46:13,370
Registrar voters office is doing a tremendous job in aligning everything that needs to be aligned and getting everything out. And I just want to give a personal thanks to them. The staff are doing such a tremendous job. Thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that council. I will pass that on to them. I also want, you know, obviously it's a complete, it's a total team effort.

113
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:39,138
The entire team in the registrar's office does a terrific job. That includes our election coordinator and the three full-time staff members, but also the team in the clerk's office does a great job year round. And they're also involved in the in-person absentee voting as well. So they're heavily involved in all of our election prep as well. So I will pass that on to everyone. Thank you.

114
00:46:42,428 --> 00:47:10,897
Clerk Herbies, I just want to say thank you to you and your staff. It's amazing the sheer amount of volume with regard to ballots that is being mailed out and it seems like everything's going very smooth.

So thank you for your hard work on the motion of Councilor Beers. Seconded by? Councilor Morrell. Clerk Herbies, please call the roll.

This was a request for our animal control officer to review our existing ordinances to provide us with any recommended updates or best practices that we could implement so that we could strengthen and improve the animal control ordinances that we have here in the community.

136
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:33,813
I'd ask that my council colleagues approve the paper and ask that the paper be forwarded to the city solicitor once the animal control officer provides us with his recommendations for drafting.

158
01:05:42,773 --> 01:06:12,102
If I could, Giuseppe Nick Mascarelli just recently passed away, a longtime Method resident. He was the owner of Nick Construction Company for, I think, almost close to four decades within this community. He loved spending time with family and friends, those who knew him. He was an avid wine connoisseur, and during wine season, he'd be growing the grapes in his backyard and sharing his homemade wine.

159
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:39,187
And he will solely be missed, Mr. President. So I would ask that this meeting be adjourned and named after Giuseppe Nick Mascarelli on his recent passing. Thank you, Councilor Marks.

162
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:56,761
Thank you. Mr. President, too, while we're under suspension. Back in June during the budget period, I asked Alicia Hunt to give us an update on municipal aggregation. I believe it was in the form of a committee of the whole where we can sit down. We have yet to get any formal response from the city administration, and it's been well over a year with municipal aggregation, and I think it's only

163
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:16,218
fitting that where that was an automatic opt-in program where every resident was opted into the energy aggregation in the community that we receive an update on where we stand on behalf of the residents of this community. So I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole

164
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:42,020
Pretty quickly, it's been several months now, and I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole with Alicia Hunt to get an update on the program. I can reach out to her and I will schedule that. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Marks. Mr. President, we're under suspension. Councilor Knight. Motion to adjourn. We're under suspension. Second. On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Councilor Behrs. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Behrs. Yes.

165
01:08:46,508 --> 01:09:05,375
Yes. That's a yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Good night. Be safe.
