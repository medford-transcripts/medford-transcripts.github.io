00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:57,792
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,571

At this point, I recognize the chairperson of licensing, Councilor Schakopiela.

52
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,413
Thank you, Council President.

53
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:51,714
Is the petitioner available?

54
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,254
I believe he is, yes.

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,053
Clodion, I'm going to unmute you.

56
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:04,318
Clodion, if we could please have your name and address for the record.

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,803
My name is Clodion.

58
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:15,608
I'm 94 First Street, Peabody, Massachusetts, 01960.

59
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,589
OK, thank you, Clodion.

60
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,931
I see that everything is in order.

61
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,152
I know that you are moving in.

62
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,689
to the old Jumbo Pizzeria on Boston Ave?

63
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:30,793
Jumbo Pizzeria on Boston Ave.

64
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:30,953
Yes.

65
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,875
Do you have your hours of operations?

66
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,696
Do you have your hours of operations?

67
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:40,080
Yeah, it will be from 11 AM till 3 AM.

68
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:50,129
OK, I think that the hours of operations has to come in front of our board, too, just so you know that.

69
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,468
The hours of operations have to be adjusted, just so you know.

70
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:01,608
Can you put this down?

71
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:08,270
I'm trying to get him to turn it on.

72
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,211
If I may for one minute, we're trying to work on some technical issues.

73
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,952
So I'm going to try to see if we can get the volume turned up here in the chambers.

74
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,693
So if you could please allow us just two quick minutes.

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:41,871
So if I may, I talked to Patrick, it's because he's on the phone and that's why it's coming through so light.

76
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:42,451
So.

77
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:58,768
Okay, so the license goes until 11 o'clock.

78
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,790
The license goes until 11 o'clock.

79
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:06,634
So you would have to petition to extend that.

80
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:07,795
I just want to make sure you knew that.

81
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,677
To extend that.

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,961
I have to petition to extend that?

83
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:18,043
You're not allowed to open after 11.

84
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:22,226
You're not allowed to open after 11.

85
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:22,867
After 11 AM?

86
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:23,708
PM.

87
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,819
Without a special permit, correct?

88
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,500
Without a special permit, correct.

89
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,201
Right now it's operating after 11, so.

90
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:37,602
Right, that license goes with that business.

91
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:40,863
That license goes with that business.

92
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,524
Okay, so.

93
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,785
If you can't contact, just contact the clerk.

94
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,785
If you can't contact, just contact the clerk.

95
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,026
Tomorrow and he can fill you in.

96
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,046
Okay, so what do I have to do after?

97
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,386
Tomorrow and he can fill you in.

98
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:51,887
This is terrible.

99
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,622
OK, but I see everything is in order.

100
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:57,502
I see everything is in order.

101
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:00,463
So I move approval after my colleagues have questions.

102
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:03,604
I move approval after my colleagues have questions.

103
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,745
Thank you, Councilor Scott Kelly.

104
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:05,365
Thank you.

105
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:08,986
On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Vice President Caviello.

106
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,167
Mr. President, if I may?

107
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:14,228
Any questions?

108
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,608
Oh, yes, Councilor Wright.

109
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:21,550
Can the petitioner please, Mr. President, describe how many employees he's going to have working for him?

110
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,878
How many employees?

111
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,459
Well, I don't know right now.

112
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm taking it over probably two or three in the beginning.

113
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,741
Two maybe.

114
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:38,001
I don't know.

115
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,382
You'll have to carry insurance if you're going to be having employees.

116
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:45,303
And I find it hard to believe you wouldn't have any employees if you were going to be open 15 hours a day.

117
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:48,463
I know, but I don't know.

118
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:49,584
I'm taking it over.

119
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,684
So I will take insurance, of course.

120
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:54,905
I missed that.

121
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:03,124
Did you say you're going to be taking out insurance?

122
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:12,646
The question was, are you going to be taking out insurance?

123
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:15,387
Are you going to be taking out insurance?

124
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:16,987
Yes, I will take insurance, of course.

125
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,228
It's required, and if he doesn't, he's going to be subject to fine.

126
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:26,585
Any other questions?

127
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:32,748
Okay, the motion to consult Scott Pelly, seconded by Vice President Caviello.

128
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,609
Clerk Bernabez, please call the roll.

129
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:44,573
Councilor Behrs?

130
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:45,333
Yes.

131
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,254
Vice President Caviello?

132
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:47,995
Yes.

133
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,535
Councilor Knight?

134
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:53,297
No, on the grounds he doesn't have insurance, Mr. President.

135
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,948
Thank you.

136
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:58,488
Councilor Marks.

137
00:08:59,089 --> 00:08:59,329
Yes.

138
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:04,671
I didn't hear Councilor Marks.

139
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:05,372
Yes.

140
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:06,452
He said yes.

141
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:06,873
Thank you.

142
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:08,273
Councilor Morrell.

143
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:09,294
Yes.

144
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:11,375
Councilor Scarpelli.

145
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:11,975
Yes.

146
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,096
President Falco.

147
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:14,917
Yes.

148
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,098
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

149
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:18,058
The motion passes.

150
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:19,319
Congratulations.

151
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,542
Good luck and please contact the city clerk for additional information regarding hours of operation.

152
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,530
Thank you.

153
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,637
Motion to revert back to the regular.

154
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,523
While we're under suspension, 20-597.

155
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,966
And that is under.

156
00:09:45,965 --> 00:10:00,653
0597.

157
00:09:46,065 --> 00:10:00,653
Offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide an update on the status of the fiscal year 2021 state budget and its impact on city revenue.

158
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:03,535
Councilor Beers.

159
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:04,655
Thank you, Mr. President.

160
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,056
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

161
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:11,899
The city and school budget are still, I would say, in crisis.

162
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,961
We don't know yet

163
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:18,505
what the impact of state and federal funding is going to be.

164
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:24,731
It seems that there's a stalemate at the federal level, and it now seems like there's not clarity at the state level regarding the state budget.

165
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:32,559
I know that there was a commitment to maintain Chapter 70 funding and unrestricted general government aid.

166
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,494
But again, it seems like the state is unsure of where things are going to go.

167
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:46,164
So I was hoping to get an update from the city administration on their view on the state budget talks and what they think the impact could be on city revenues.

168
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,167
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

169
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:49,708
Councilor Knight.

170
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,742
Yes, Mr. President, I do believe it was three or four weeks ago that this council passed a resolution.

171
00:10:55,483 --> 00:11:06,591
And that resolution was to request that the Director of Finance appear before this body to meet with us to talk about the first quarter and what our revenues look like and future projections, Mr. President.

172
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:12,796
And these papers are of similar matter in content and subject matter, and I was wondering if the Finance Director was available with us this evening.

173
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:18,780
She is not, but what I can do is I can set up, would you like to committee the whole?

174
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:19,221
No.

175
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:30,272
I'd like you to appear before the council to talk to us about the projections and the revenue forecasts and where we are in terms of this time last year and what our financial picture looks like, Mr. President.

176
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:35,553
This was something we talked about where we requested that you appear before us quarterly back when the budget was going on.

177
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,054
That was a part of the budget papers.

178
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:42,015
When we discussed and deliberated the budget, we requested that we get quarterly updates on the revenue projections.

179
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,336
The first quarter has ended and it's time.

180
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,536
You are correct.

181
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,357
Okay, thank you Councilor Knight.

182
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:51,055
Would anybody else like to speak on this issue?

183
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:55,279
Okay.

184
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:01,024
Seeing and hearing none, on the motion of, let's see, no one has a hand raised, okay.

185
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,766
On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Night.

201
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,686

Yes.

207
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,041
Vice President Carabiello.

208
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:49,461
Yes.

209
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:50,782
Councilor Knight.

210
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,483
Yes.

211
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,103
Councilor Marks.

212
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:53,983
Yes.

213
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,404
Councilor Morrell.

214
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:57,004
Yes.

215
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:58,705
Councilor Scarpelli.

216
00:12:58,785 --> 00:12:59,045
Yes.

217
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,505
President Fevella.

218
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,966
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

219
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,727
We will now revert to the regular order of business.

220
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,168
Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-476.

221
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,569
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading for a brief synopsis.

222
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,310
This matter has been on the agenda now for three consecutive weeks.

223
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:14,588
Okay.

224
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:15,768
Second.

225
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,810
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs for a brief synopsis.

226
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,851
Councilor Knight, would you like to give that brief synopsis?

227
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,551
Certainly, Mr. President.

228
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,192
The paper before us this evening- We can vote on it.

229
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:28,452
Okay.

230
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,752
On that motion, Clerk Hertoghese, please call the roll.

231
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:32,373
Councilor Behrs?

232
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:33,053
Yes.

233
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:34,593
Vice President Kerrio?

234
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:34,913
Yes.

235
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:36,314
Councilor Knight?

236
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:36,674
Yes.

237
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,074
Councilor Marks?

238
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:38,934
Yes.

239
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:40,255
Councilor Morrell?

240
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:40,715
Yes.

241
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:42,326
Councilor Scarpelli?

242
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:42,726
Yes.

243
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,107
President Falcone?

244
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:44,707
Yes.

245
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,107
70 affirmative, 0 negative.

246
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:46,947
The motion passes.

247
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:47,988
Council Light?

248
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:50,748
Yes, Mr. President.

249
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:53,889
This is a companion paper to the zoning amendment that the council just passed recently.

250
00:13:54,609 --> 00:14:03,791
What it is is it's a paper that would establish a selection committee for applicants for marijuana licenses in the city of Medford as required by state law and by the will of the voters here in the community.

251
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,412
This document would allow by right

252
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:14,259
marijuana establishments to be located in commercial to or industrially zoned districts by way of a special permit, Mr. President.

253
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:28,614
It outlines a selection committee that's chaired by the chief of police and has five members which would rank and interview the applicants and make recommendations to the mayor who would have the power to enter into a host community agreement to issue a license to

254
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:30,515
one of the applicants, Mr. President.

255
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:34,578
So this is a paper that has been before us for a number of years, about five years, half a decade.

256
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,882
I'm glad to see that it's finally come to the finish line, Mr. President, and I would move for approval.

257
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:53,832
There was some discussion and some concern about the 3% local option tax that would be included in this paper, and at the advice of our city solicitor, Kimberly Scanlon, she has provided us with the legal opinion that we can do that by way of adopting a local option.

258
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,435
I'd ask that that local option be placed on the agenda next week, Mr. President.

259
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:58,936
so that we can vote on that.

260
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,957
It doesn't have to be done this evening according to what our legal counsel tells us.

261
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:11,262
I'm very glad that we asked Solicitor Scanlon this question because we were waiting for Kopelman and Page to give us an answer now for at least five weeks on it, and we didn't get that.

262
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:17,044
So I'd like to thank Solicitor Scanlon personally for the work that she's done in allowing us to bring this as far as we have.

263
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:22,487
So with that being said, Mr. President, that's the brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and I'd move for approval of the paper.

264
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:23,532
Second.

265
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:24,412
Thank you, Councilor Night.

266
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,795
On the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

267
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,857
Any questions, comments from the council?

268
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:32,239
Anyone online here?

269
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,201
Okay, no one has a hand up.

270
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:36,763
Okay, on that motion, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

271
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:38,725
Mr. President, a brief question.

272
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:39,186
Yes.

273
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,568
Is this for first reading or for approval?

274
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:42,909
This is for first reading.

275
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,692
For the first reading, yes.

276
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,395
Okay, here comes the roll call.

277
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,377
Councilor Behrs?

278
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:52,918
Yes.

279
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:54,699
Vice President Caraballo?

280
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,259
Yes.

281
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:56,559
Councilor Night?

282
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:56,940
Yes.

283
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,260
Councilor Marks?

284
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,661
Yes.

285
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,021
Councilor Morrell?

286
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:00,562
Yes.

287
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:02,062
Councilor Scarpelli?

288
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:02,563
Yes.

289
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:04,243
President Falco?

290
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:04,884
Yes.

291
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,245
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

292
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:10,567
The motion passes and it passes its first reading.

293
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,472
Thank you, Councilor Night for that brief synopsis.

294
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:37,985
2-0-590 offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the representatives from Amazon.com distribution branch appear before the Medford City Council to discuss the practices of its drivers in the city of Medford.

295
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:38,906
Councilor Knight.

296
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,907
Mr. President, thank you very much.

297
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:45,929
I am a self-identifying amazon.com addict.

298
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,950
I have boxes delivered to my house constantly.

299
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:57,874
And as we go through the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, I think we've all become far more reliant on delivery services like this.

300
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:09,746
But with that being said, Mr. President, while Amazon does provide a great value and a great service to those of us in this community, the driving practices of their delivery drivers aren't exactly up to par.

301
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:15,653
I don't think Mr. Jotis or Mr. Bruno gave them a training course on how to drive here in Medford.

302
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:26,469
A lot of times what we'll see, Mr. President, is an Amazon truck that's making a delivery, drive down, say, a small side street like Billings Avenue in South Medford.

303
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,655
And they come up to the house and they say, this is a good spot to stop.

304
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,493
right in the middle of the street.

305
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:35,495
And they park their car, and they get out, and they make a delivery, Mr. President.

306
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:36,396
It's creating safety issues.

307
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,577
It's creating quality of life issues.

308
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,938
It's creating traffic issues in the community.

309
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:47,405
I know that amazon.com is a good neighbor, a good creator of jobs here in the community, with good paying jobs.

310
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49,387
And we appreciate the work they do.

311
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:57,173
And I know that if we have the opportunity to speak with them, I think that they'll be willing to work with us in assuming a partnership that allows us to address this issue.

312
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,074
So with that being said, I rest my case.

313
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,316
Move the floor to my council colleague and co-sponsor of the resolution, Councilor Scott Peli.

314
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,577
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

315
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:05,797
Councilor Scott Peli.

316
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:06,598
Thank you, Mr. President.

317
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:09,639
Thank you, Councilor Knight, for your synopsis.

318
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:13,860
I think that with that, if I could, can I amend the paper?

319
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:25,025
I know that once our constituents read the agenda, if we could amend it and ask for a representative for both Uber and Lyft.

320
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:32,921
That for their same practices, we know that they're very important to our community.

321
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:40,048
But at the same time, their practices are stopping wherever they want and causing dangerous issues with

322
00:18:42,891 --> 00:19:01,588
possible road rage issues, I think that's one of the constituents that I talked to this week, is making sure understanding what is the reasoning for stopping in the middle of the street and with no regards to other vehicles or pedestrians or bike riders.

323
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:05,832
So if we can make that amendment, thank you, Mr. President.

324
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:07,494
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

325
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,194
Councilor Behrs.

326
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:09,495
Thank you, Mr. President.

327
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,176
Thank you to my colleagues for putting this resolution on the agenda.

328
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:17,339
I'm happy to see the amendment, including Uber and Lyft.

329
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:29,746
I think what we've seen is that these app-driven companies are looking at non-traditional, I guess might be the best word to use, methods of delivery.

330
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,371
And, you know, I'm hopeful.

331
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:34,292
I'm glad this is on.

332
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,733
I hope we can come to a good agreement.

333
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,214
But I am a little concerned.

334
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:48,221
I just found out the other week that Amazon's guidelines actually set and requested all of the delivery companies that they use have their vans a certain size.

335
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:52,504
And that size is about one inch smaller than would require federal regulation.

336
00:19:52,764 --> 00:20:00,810
So, you know, they're really leaning into some less than credible business practices in order to, you know,

337
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:03,041
to be replaced with an Amazon distribution center.

338
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,382
So I think this problem will only grow over

339
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:26,637
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

340
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:27,798
Vice President Caviello.

341
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:28,679
Thank you, Mr. President.

342
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:36,146
I appreciate my fellow councilors putting this out there with Amazon and Uber and Lyft, but it isn't just them.

343
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:45,755
It's really, it's FedEx, it's UPS, it's GrubHub, it's, I mean, everybody's getting everything delivered to their house via some kind of vehicle.

344
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,818
So it's really very vast now.

345
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,882
who's delivering, who's not delivering.

346
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:58,909
And I see them, people just park the car and get out and leave it in the middle of the street and don't really care.

347
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,491
So I think it's.

348
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:04,556
How do we get the message to all of them?

349
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:05,777
I don't know.

350
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:20,063
But I think we do need to clamp down on this subway line, because everybody's on the timetable, and everyone's just rushing around, speeding around the streets, and disregarding our laws also.

351
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:21,544
So that's part of the problem too.

352
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:27,467
I don't know how we get the message out to everybody, all these different groups.

353
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:33,110
Maybe it's up to the chief to figure out, maybe there's some network to get them out to.

354
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,292
But the Amazon guys, as I said, they're everywhere now.

355
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:41,915
And like Councilor Beall said, they're opening two spots up in Revere.

356
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,596
I mean, hundreds more trucks hitting the streets.

357
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:47,938
Again, I thank my councilors for putting this on tonight.

358
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,069
Okay, thank you, Vice President Caviello.

359
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:58,072
On the motion of Councilors Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Behrs.

360
00:21:58,612 --> 00:21:59,692
Clerk Hurnaby, please call the roll.

361
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:09,416
Councilor Behrs?

362
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:10,036
Yes.

363
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:11,637
Vice President Caviello?

364
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:15,492
Councilor Layton.

365
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:15,592
Yes.

366
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:16,193
Councilor Barks.

367
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:16,273
Yes.

368
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:17,913
Councilor Morrell.

369
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:18,413
Yes.

370
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:20,033
Councilor Scarpelli.

371
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:20,574
Yes.

372
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:21,874
President Fevella.

373
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:24,754
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

374
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:31,496
20-591 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion on the following question.

375
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:40,218
Does a meeting posted for a certain date that extends past midnight and into a different date create the potential for an open meeting law violation?

376
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:40,738
Councilor Knight.

377
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:47,496
Yes, Mr. President, it's becoming quite frequent that the parties' meetings start at 5.30 and end after midnight.

378
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:54,322
And that raises the question as to if a meeting is posted for Tuesday evening between 7 and 10 p.m.

379
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,044
and it's going to be broadcast on Zoom and it goes

380
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:05,207
past the posted hours, and then further on into the next day, whether or not that would create the potential for an open meeting law violation.

381
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:10,711
I know there are many concerned citizens in Medford that have raised some issues about open meeting law in the past.

382
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:18,137
So as we move forward and work towards full and total compliance with the open meeting law and do our best to do such, I ask the question to the city solicitor, Mr. President.

383
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:20,438
So I move for approval and ask my council colleagues in support to pay it up.

384
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:21,439
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

385
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,482
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Pierce.

386
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:28,163
It's not an amendment or anything.

387
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:31,804
I would just add, it might be worth us taking a look at the summer schedule.

388
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:40,866
I'm not sure if these long meetings have been impacted by the summer schedule of the council or not, but I obviously support the measure and getting the opinion.

389
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:41,427
Thank you.

390
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:42,827
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

391
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,308
Anybody else want to speak on that?

392
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,608
No?

393
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:47,548
Okay.

394
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:52,470
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Carter, please call the roll.

395
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,031
Councilor Behrs.

396
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:55,551
Yes.

397
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:57,295
Vice President Kerrio.

398
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:57,835
Yes.

399
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,096
Councilor Knight.

400
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:00,417
Yes.

401
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:02,078
Councilor Marks.

402
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:02,618
Yes.

403
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:03,999
Councilor Morrell.

404
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:04,500
Yes.

405
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,581
Councilor Scarpelli.

406
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,101
Yes.

407
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:08,382
President Fevella.

408
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:08,903
Yes.

409
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:11,204
Seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes.

410
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:14,587
2-0-592 offered by Councilor Knight.

411
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:21,351
Be it resolved that the hours of Park Method's Main Street office be reviewed to ensure that it is open later than 2 p.m.

412
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:24,007
at least one day per week.

413
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:24,888
Councilor Wright.

414
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:26,368
Mr. President, thank you very much.

415
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:33,071
Park Medford's opening at, I guess we'd call, modified hours at this point in time, 9 a.m.

416
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:33,791
to 2 p.m.

417
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:42,634
daily, and it creates a little bit of a hardship for individuals in this community that work, that might want to pick up the phone and call over there to ask some questions, to appeal a ticket over the phone.

418
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:55,725
So I'm asking that the administration take a look at the negotiation that they did with Park Medford and the contract that they have in place to allow them to modify their hours and see if we can have one night a week with their open late, maybe the same night, like Wednesday nights that coincides with city halls late.

419
00:24:56,225 --> 00:25:00,489
But just the night so that people know that they can take care of city business and all city offices are going to be open and available.

420
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,410
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

421
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,812
Any questions, comments from the council?

422
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:07,174
No questions online.

423
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,156
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

424
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:10,157
Second.

425
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,784
Vice President Caraballo, Clark-Cunningham, please call the roll.

426
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,031
Councilor Behrs?

427
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:19,592
Yes.

428
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,274
Vice President Caraballo?

429
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:21,634
Yes.

430
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:22,936
Councilor Night?

431
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:23,336
Yes.

432
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:24,738
Councilor Marks?

433
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,539
Yes.

434
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,881
Councilor Morrell?

435
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:27,361
Yes.

436
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:28,943
Councilor Scarpelli?

437
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:29,184
Yes.

438
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:32,707
President Fevella.

439
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:35,649
Yes, setting the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

440
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:38,893
20-593 offered by Councilor Morrell.

441
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:52,206
Be it resolved that the City Council request from the administration a current list of non-ADA compliant sidewalks in the city and to the extent that it exists, plans to update and bring into compliance said sidewalks.

442
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:52,987
Councilor Morrell.

443
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:54,717
Thank you, Mr. President.

444
00:25:54,737 --> 00:26:00,800
I raised this at this time, make this request based on a number of things we've been talking about recently.

445
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:11,325
And I do want to point out the fact that I know our engineering department and DPW does great work on updating our sidewalks and bringing them into compliance as intersections and sidewalks are updated, projects happen.

446
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:13,446
But we've been having a lot of discussions.

447
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:15,007
I know Councilor Behr has introduced

448
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,729
and resolution last week, looking at our snow removal ordinance.

449
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:29,556
And Councilor Knight brought up a number of salient points as far as the massive amount of work that our DPW has already and really could be doing to improve accessibility in our community.

450
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:34,240
And we've also had a number of discussions with a fine point on equity in the past several months.

451
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:44,347
So I think when we're looking at all of these things, we have to consider our streets and our sidewalks and accessibility issues and whether or not they're actually accessible and equitable to everyone in our community.

452
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:54,952
I know the ADA is essentially an unfunded mandate, so it's really challenging for cities to do the amount of work that needs to be done to make sure our streets and our sidewalks are accessible to everyone.

453
00:26:55,032 --> 00:27:10,519
But I think it's really important as we come around the calendar and start looking at another budget time to understand where we stand as a city as far as accessibility with our sidewalks and what work there is, also possibly what grants we've already pursued and plans to update as far as

454
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,343
complete updates that sidewalks will be brought into compliance because it's a massive project, but also looking at those sidewalks individually.

455
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:27,847
So I'm just really trying to gather information so we can make the best decisions come budget time and making sure we're supporting work that really needs to be done in the city.

456
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:28,968
So I move approval.

457
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:31,349
Okay.

458
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:35,991
On the motion of Council Morales, seconded by Vice President Caviello, Council Knight.

459
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:40,693
Mr. President, I support this paper wholeheartedly, and I'd like to add a amendment or a B paper.

460
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:48,794
Just several weeks ago, I believe we talked about accessibility, and there's one aspect of accessibility, which is design and construction.

461
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:54,015
And there's another aspect of accessibility, which is government-created accessibility issues through permitting.

462
00:27:54,495 --> 00:28:02,257
And I know a number of us behind this rail spoke about some concerns that they had with Snappy Patty's location in the sidewalk there, and we had requested an update from our

463
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,519
ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity.

464
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,861
And I don't believe that paper has been forthcoming, Mr. President.

465
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,403
So I'd like to, again, reiterate that request.

466
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,424
Okay.

467
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:13,106
Councilor Morrell, is that okay if that's an amendment?

468
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:13,967
That works.

469
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,168
Okay, perfect.

470
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,670
Any other questions or comments from the council?

471
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:23,736
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Caballero, as amended by Councilor Knight.

472
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:24,937
Clerk Cunabes, please call the roll.

473
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:28,503
Yes.

474
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:28,824
Yes.

475
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:29,184
Yes.

476
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:41,049
President Fevella.

477
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:42,830
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

478
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,631
The motion passes.

479
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,754
20-594 offered by Councilor Morrell.

480
00:28:47,234 --> 00:29:05,071
Be it resolved that the City Council receive an update from Medford's Massport Community Advisory Committee representatives, Peter Houck and Luke Prasner in response to the recent FAA rejection of dispersion concepts to mitigate airplane traffic and the resulting noise and pollution over Medford.

481
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:05,652
Councilor Morrell.

482
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:06,948
Thank you, Mr. President.

483
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:17,421
And I do want to point out, I know Councilor Marks introduced a similar paper back in June, but since then, so I think the last time we had a visit by Peter and Luke was actually, I believe, in October.

484
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:22,467
I can't be positive, but I believe that was the last time we got the update as far as the number of

485
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:29,853
different approaches that were going to be presented to the FAA as far as dispersion and mitigation of the onslaught of air traffic over Medford.

486
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:38,041
And in the middle of August, August 15th, a decision came down from the FAA and they rejected all of the concepts that were presented.

487
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,763
I know the mayor has expressed her dismay and

488
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:47,488
I think it would be really helpful to get an update directly from Peter and Luke as far as where do we go from here.

489
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:53,593
It's my understanding from some outreach we've gotten that this isn't good, but we're not without hope.

490
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:59,478
So I think it'd be really effective for the council to know what are our options after this rejection from the FAA.

491
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,319
Thank you.

492
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:01,980
Councilor Morrell.

493
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Councilor Behrs.

494
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,102
Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,224
Thank you, Councilor Morrell, for putting this on.

496
00:30:07,244 --> 00:30:09,906
And Councilor Marks for bringing it up previously.

497
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,331
This plane noise thing has been an issue for a long time, but it's gotten a lot worse recently.

498
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:19,432
And I just want to applaud everybody.

499
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:24,534
I know there are a lot of people in Medford, in addition to Peter and Luke, who are really working on this.

500
00:30:24,694 --> 00:30:25,934
I want to applaud their efforts.

501
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:36,398
I think another point where we can be hopeful is hopefully a new federal administration will help to move this along in a better way, and hopefully we'll be there soon.

502
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:49,200
But I just really want to thank everyone for the work they're doing and also encourage people to continue sending complaints about airplane noise to Massport and the FAA.

503
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,821
I think that's an essential piece of this.

504
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:59,563
And if we can keep documenting and providing the data of the impacts, this is making making backyards unlivable, waking people up at 545 in the morning.

505
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:02,463
I think we just need to keep pushing that.

506
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,564
And I thank everyone who's been doing that.

507
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,400
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

508
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:09,001
Any other questions, comments?

509
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,482
Vice President Caviello.

510
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:11,202
Thank you, Mr. President.

511
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:16,124
Mr. President, maybe we should be notifying our federal delegation about this.

512
00:31:17,364 --> 00:31:20,806
They may not be aware of the decision that's happened.

513
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:25,768
Congresswoman Clark has been very helpful over the past couple of years with this.

514
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:31,250
Maybe we should bring them and notify them of this decision also, Mr. President.

515
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:31,870
Okay.

516
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:34,826
Are you amending the paper?

517
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,147
Okay.

518
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:49,072
If we amend it to notify our federal delegation of this, especially Congresswoman Clark, where she's been our point person over the last few years in this.

519
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:49,653
Okay.

520
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:51,213
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

521
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:53,875
Any other questions, comments from the council?

522
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,696
Any questions here on Zoom?

523
00:31:57,736 --> 00:31:57,876
Nope.

524
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:58,637
Okay.

525
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,538
On the motion of Council Morrell,

526
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:05,064
I seconded by second vice president.

527
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,585
Cabrillo is amended by vice president.

528
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,246
Cabrillo quicker to be, please call the roll.

529
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:13,328
Yes.

530
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:13,468
Yes.

531
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:13,609
Yes.

532
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:13,689
Yes.

533
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,084
Councilor Scarpelli?

534
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:27,484
Yes.

535
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:28,805
President Fevella?

536
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:29,206
Yes.

537
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:30,847
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

538
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:31,888
The motion passes.

539
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:45,182
20-595 offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express its support of H5018, an act to guarantee housing stability during the COVID-19 emergency and recovery.

540
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:57,798
Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker, Councilor Behrs.

541
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,683
Thank you, Mr. President.

542
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:12,529
The state's eviction and foreclosure moratorium for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, well, it was supposed to be for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it expires on Saturday, the 17th of October.

543
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,771
Governor Baker has the authority to extend it, but is indicating that he will not.

544
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:21,974
He's introduced a package of some assistance that could help people, but

545
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:30,959
Essentially, unless a law is passed by the State House and State Senate, the eviction and foreclosure moratorium will abate.

546
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:32,639
It will no longer be in effect.

547
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,522
We have an eviction and foreclosure crisis coming very soon.

548
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:50,168
If this moratorium is not extended, courts, in fact, the Massachusetts courts are hiring back retired judges just to handle the additional influx of cases that they're expecting.

549
00:33:51,467 --> 00:34:03,434
The Act to Guarantee Housing Stability is legislation with broad support in the House to fix this, and also to help not only tenants and homeowners, but also landlords, in addition to extending the moratorium.

550
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:11,879
It also provides significant legal resources to all people involved in housing to help us get through this crisis.

551
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:20,324
And I want to thank Senator Jalen, Representative Donato, Representative Garbally, and Representative Barber, who are all co-sponsors of this bill.

552
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:45,442
And I think we should send a message as the city of Medford that we need to get this done It's great that our legislative delegation is on top of it But you know I think it's important to show that municipalities are very concerned about it that we're concerned about making sure that people have housing stability here in Medford and Hopefully, you know our nudge is combined with the nudges of a lot of other advocates and and local officials in in

553
00:34:46,302 --> 00:34:49,223
ensuring that we have real housing stability during this pandemic.

554
00:34:49,263 --> 00:35:03,066
And especially during this winter where, you know, in some parts of Boston, we're already seeing people set up tents in parks because they have been either kicked out of housing or didn't know their rights relative to the moratorium.

555
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,247
So this is going to get serious.

556
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:10,928
And I think it's important that we try to do our part to get some legislation passed at the state level to address it.

557
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,068
Thank you.

558
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:13,609
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

559
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,049
Councilor Morales.

560
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:17,034
Thank you, Mr. President.

561
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:24,998
I want to thank my council colleague for bringing this forth and really echo what he said, where, um, not only we're in crisis right now and there's an even larger crisis looming.

562
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:29,099
So I really appreciate that our state delegation, um, is leading on this.

563
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:35,202
And I think it's, it's clear where this entire pandemic we've been trying to figure out where help is coming from different levels.

564
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:37,903
And I think it's very clear that it's not coming from the federal level.

565
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:43,525
So I think what we can do at the state level to, um, protect residents, uh, in Medford is really important.

566
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,506
So, um, this of course has my support.

567
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:46,046
Thank you.

568
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:48,193
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

569
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,774
Any other questions, comments from the council?

570
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:51,294
Okay.

571
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:52,555
Anyone?

572
00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:54,195
No one has a hand up.

573
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:55,515
Zoom.

574
00:35:56,156 --> 00:36:00,537
On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Vice President Caviello.

575
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:02,598
Clerk Carter, please call the roll.

576
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,020
Councilor Behrs.

577
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,620
Yes.

578
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,500
Vice President Caviello.

579
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,900
Yes.

580
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:13,261
Councilor Night.

581
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:15,221
He is locked the room.

582
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:16,222
Okay.

583
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:16,962
Councilor Marks.

584
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:17,990
No.

585
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,571
Is that a no?

586
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:21,231
No.

587
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,071
That is a no.

588
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:26,793
Councilor Morrell?

589
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:27,633
Yes.

590
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:29,594
Councilor Scarpelli?

591
00:36:29,674 --> 00:36:30,034
No.

592
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:34,696
President Fevella?

593
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:35,296
Yes.

594
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:37,837
4 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, 1 absent.

595
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:38,557
The motion passes.

596
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:45,148
20-596, offered by Councilor Beers.

597
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:52,873
Be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the City Clerk provide a brief update on preparations for the November 3rd general election.

598
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:54,134
Councilor Beers.

599
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:56,949
Thank you, Mr. President.

600
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:11,197
I know that our city election staff, the clerk and folks in the registrar's office have been working incredibly hard to meet this moment of, you know, an election that nobody expected during a pandemic that nobody expected.

601
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:16,841
There's obviously a huge influx of mail ballot requests, just like there was for the September primary.

602
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:22,506
And I just want to commend, first commend the city election staff on their work on the mail ballots.

603
00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:25,328
I think that's really gone very well this time.

604
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:30,553
And also commend all the folks who stepped up to join the team and work with the city election staff.

605
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,471
early voting starts this next week as well.

606
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:42,954
So that's another option that people have in addition to the mail ballots, and of course, election day voting on November 3rd.

607
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:50,638
And I was hoping we could hear a little bit more from the clerk about what they've been doing around election preparation for the November 3rd general election.

608
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:51,238
Thank you.

609
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:52,659
Thank you, Councilor Piz.

610
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:55,080
Clerk Bernabez, would you be able to give us an update?

611
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,861
Absolutely.

612
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:57,661
One quick point.

613
00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:01,403
Early voting actually starts on Saturday at nine o'clock at City Hall.

614
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,154
It's from nine to three on Saturday, nine to three on Sunday.

615
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:10,617
And then it goes for the following, it goes during the week, during normal city hall business hours.

616
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:13,899
So it'll be two Saturdays and two Sundays of early voting from nine to three.

617
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,043
And then two weeks of early voting at city hall during normal city hall business hours.

618
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:29,371
And voters can choose to return their mail ballots, they can choose to early vote in person, or they can choose to vote in person on election day.

619
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:31,812
So they have three options to vote.

620
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,426
to give a little perspective for the.

621
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:46,962
September primary, we processed a little over 12,000 requests, I believe, for mail-in and absentee ballots.

622
00:38:47,522 --> 00:38:54,805
As of today at three o'clock, we have received 14,200 requests for absentee and early voting ballots.

623
00:38:55,245 --> 00:39:01,768
As of three o'clock today, we have mailed out 13,528 early voting or absentee ballots, which is 96% compliance, according to the Secretary of State's office.

624
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,795
There are also about 250 overseas absentee ballots out there with roughly 100 of them have come back already.

625
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:17,598
So we are in full swing for the November election.

626
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:22,481
We are ahead of where we were in September, and we're getting more ballots out every day.

627
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:27,825
We're also getting more requests in every day, but the request number has tripled down with the number of postcards that have come back.

628
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:31,407
Thank you, Clerk Arnabes.

629
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:34,189
Any other questions, comments?

630
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:35,570
Counselor Knight.

631
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:43,070
Yes, Mr. President, I have a couple of questions concerning the applications for vote by mail.

632
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,032
It's my understanding that this whole process was handled in-house, is that correct?

633
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,518
That is correct, Councilor.

634
00:39:51,538 --> 00:39:57,420
Last Tuesday night, when we were here at the meeting, I had to use the restroom and I went out and I heard the postage machine going.

635
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,002
And I went in there and one of our representatives of our building department was running ballots through the postage machine.

636
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:07,183
And that got me to thinking, why is it that we're mailing these

637
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:17,790
with a first class stamp on them, if we could send it to a mail house and do an enhanced carrier route line of travel, we'd probably be able to cut down the cost of the actual mailing for the applications to vote by mail.

638
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:27,938
So I didn't know if there was some sort of requirement that these had to be mailed by first class, or if we could have done an enhanced carrier route line of travel bulk mailing to deliver these ballots and save some money.

639
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:31,601
Council, that's an excellent question.

640
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:35,804
The reason we're mailing these out first class is because

641
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,742
We have Cindy Gale, our election coordinator, has been working with the post office.

642
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:49,406
And if we mail these out as first class mail in Medford, these ballots will stay in Medford.

643
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:55,949
If they are bulk mailed, they go to Boston, and then they come back to Medford, and they take significantly longer to reach residents.

644
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:04,633
So they get out of the building faster, and they stay in Medford, and they're delivered to residents faster if they're mailed first class right from Medford.

645
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:06,034
So that's why it's going that way.

646
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:09,197
And do we know what the cost difference is?

647
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:11,959
I mean, it's $0.55 for a first class letter.

648
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,121
I mean, I think you can get it down to $0.13 per piece.

649
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,142
I could find out for you, Councilor.

650
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:21,966
I don't know the difference in the prices right now, but I would find out for you.

651
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:25,768
And then I know that you've done a great job, Adam, and I'm not being critical.

652
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:32,052
We have had some fair share of problems with ballots going to the wrong district.

653
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:33,293
Is that correct?

654
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,436
Yeah, that was a problem in September.

655
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,863
It's much less of a problem now.

656
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:53,154
And that's why I make the recommendation that it might be better that we handle this through a mail house, where the mail house can put together the mailing labels, where they're supposed to go, the district, so on and so forth.

657
00:41:53,254 --> 00:41:55,314
People that do this for a living, that just have the expertise.

658
00:41:56,294 --> 00:42:00,275
So we'd have less margin of error, and then we'd also have the cost savings capability.

659
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:02,835
If it takes a couple more days, it takes a couple more days.

660
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,055
We'll just have to start earlier, I guess.

661
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:06,816
But that would be my suggestion and recommendation going forward.

662
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:10,537
But I would not offer that in the form of an amendment or a motion, Mr. President.

663
00:42:10,557 --> 00:42:13,097
I can bring that up at the registrar's meeting, the next registrar's meeting.

664
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,773
Okay, thank you, Councilor Knight.

665
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:15,874
Councilor Morrell.

666
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:17,735
Thank you, Mr. President.

667
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,316
Yeah, just two questions for Adam.

668
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:24,720
I know we had a resolution a few weeks ago as far as staffing in the elections office.

669
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,201
And I was curious if there's an update on that.

670
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:29,704
I know the mayor had also said that there is funding for part-time staffing.

671
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:36,229
So I was just curious if you have an update on staffing from now until election day or however it might pan out.

672
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:49,556
We are continuing to pay part-time workers to help with this effort, and we are continuing to pay our election coordinator, who's a part-time employee, through our elections budget.

673
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:55,038
So there is some funding available for part-time election

674
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:58,974
And we're using that funding.

675
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:04,017
As far as I know, the issue with a full-time election person has not been resolved yet.

676
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,520
But we obviously have no choice in this matter.

677
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,241
We have to get these ballots out, and we have to prepare for this election.

678
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:14,504
So we are continuing to bring in some temporary workers to help with mailing out of the ballots.

679
00:43:14,664 --> 00:43:18,287
And our election coordinator, who is a part-time employee, continues to be paid out of the election budget.

680
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:19,975
Okay.

681
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:20,495
Thank you.

682
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:26,299
And then, um, do you have an update as far as, um, poll workers is, um, I guess need more.

683
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:29,781
And then if people are still interested, are you still accepting people who want to help out?

684
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:33,743
Um, and what's the best way for them to go through that process?

685
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:39,066
Um, right now, it looks like we're actually gonna be gonna be fully staffed for election day.

686
00:43:39,086 --> 00:43:39,206
That

687
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:45,768
changes on a dime, however we do have some last minute cancellations in every election.

688
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:56,820
Right now we have, right now it looks like all of our election day staffing is set, all of our early voting staffing is set, and we have another hundred or so people in reserve who are available if there are last minute cancellations.

689
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:04,488
We do encourage people, if they want to apply to be poll workers, applying so we continue to work on and vet that list.

690
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:06,275
Okay, thank you.

691
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:07,736
And I think you cut out for a second.

692
00:44:07,796 --> 00:44:12,138
If they, if they want to be poll workers, what's the best way for them to apply or reach out about that?

693
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:18,181
They can email me or they can call the clerk's office directly and we can, we can, uh, we can work on that with them.

694
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:18,541
Okay, great.

695
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:19,121
Thank you.

696
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:20,202
Thanks.

697
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:21,482
Thank you.

698
00:44:21,502 --> 00:44:22,102
Councilor.

699
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:23,083
Councilor Marks.

700
00:44:23,563 --> 00:44:24,243
Uh, thank you.

701
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:25,744
Just a quick question to the clerk.

702
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:34,108
Uh, Mr. Clerk, isn't it true that all, uh, political mail, uh, goes out automatically first class through the post office?

703
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:40,088
Well, I can tell you that all the envelopes that we get from the state are marked as first class envelopes.

704
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:57,020
Okay, so if that's the case, then maybe in line with Councilor Knight's stating, wouldn't it be better off if we did send these out knowing that they're going to go out first class anyways and not pay for the first class postage?

705
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:00,905
You know what, that's a good question.

706
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:04,027
Let me look into the difference in the price and see if that's something we can do.

707
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:06,809
I don't know the answer to that.

708
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:19,718
The reason they're going out, I can tell you that one of the reasons they're going out first class right now is so that they don't get bulk mailed to Boston and then mailed back to Medford, because the bulk mail delays it by a week to 10 days.

709
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,080
So we were concerned about the timing of being so close to the election.

710
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,603
But let me look into the difference in price and see if that is something we can accommodate.

711
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:49,196
Thank you, and I just want to say with all this confusion and the new process that's going on and the number of ballots increasing that we're mailing out now, I just want to say that your staff in the office of, I can't even think of the office's name now.

712
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:59,623
Registrar voters office is doing a tremendous job in aligning everything that needs to be aligned and getting everything out.

713
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:02,004
And I just want to give a personal thanks to them.

714
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:05,006
The staff are doing such a tremendous job.

715
00:46:06,106 --> 00:46:06,426
Thank you.

716
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:07,147
I appreciate that.

717
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,527
I appreciate that council.

718
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:09,608
I will pass that on to them.

719
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:13,170
I also want, you know, obviously it's a complete, it's a total team effort.

720
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:18,126
The entire team in the registrar's office does a terrific job.

721
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:27,791
That includes our election coordinator and the three full-time staff members, but also the team in the clerk's office does a great job year round.

722
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:31,654
And they're also involved in the in-person absentee voting as well.

723
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:34,735
So they're heavily involved in all of our election prep as well.

724
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:35,876
So I will pass that on to everyone.

725
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:36,256
Thank you.

726
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:45,369
Clerk Herbies, I just want to say thank you to you and your staff.

727
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:53,211
It's amazing the sheer amount of volume with regard to ballots that is being mailed out and it seems like everything's going very smooth.

728
00:46:53,271 --> 00:47:01,494
So thank you to you and your staff for all that hard work and your dedication and effort and energy with regard to the upcoming election.

729
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:05,195

70 farmers here in the negative.

820
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:28,794

954
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:12,397

01:05:03,193 --> 01:05:03,253
Yes.

1173
01:05:04,974 --> 01:05:05,535
Councilor Marks?

1174
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:06,195
Yes.

1175
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:08,417
Councilor Morrell?

1176
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:08,957
Yes.

1177
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:10,979
Councilor Scarpelli?

1178
01:05:11,019 --> 01:05:11,219
Yes.

1179
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,429
Senator Fevella, call.

1180
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:15,550
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1181
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,350
The motion passes.

1182
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:20,573
At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1183
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:36,662
Mr. President.

1184
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:36,982
Thank you.

1185
01:05:37,262 --> 01:05:37,923
We're off to the marks.

1186
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:39,083
While we're under suspension.

1187
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:40,044
Yes, please.

1188
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:41,465
I have a condolence as well.

1189
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:50,435
If I could, Giuseppe Nick Mascarelli just recently passed away, a longtime Method resident.

1190
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:57,417
He was the owner of Nick Construction Company for, I think, almost close to four decades within this community.

1191
01:05:58,078 --> 01:06:01,679
He loved spending time with family and friends, those who knew him.

1192
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:11,602
He was an avid wine connoisseur, and during wine season, he'd be growing the grapes in his backyard and sharing his homemade wine.

1193
01:06:12,342 --> 01:06:14,943
And he will solely be missed, Mr. President.

1194
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:24,784
So I would ask that this meeting be adjourned and named after Giuseppe Nick Mascarelli on his recent passing.

1195
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:26,065
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1196
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:30,745
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caballero, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

1197
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:38,067
Councilor Kuehne-Harris?

1198
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:38,947
Yes.

1199
01:06:42,683 --> 01:06:43,063
Thank you.

1200
01:06:43,884 --> 01:06:43,984
Yes.

1201
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:44,304
Council night.

1202
01:06:44,324 --> 01:06:44,804
Council marks.

1203
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:45,084
Yes.

1204
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:45,164
Yes.

1205
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:49,726
Yes.

1206
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:49,846
Yes.

1207
01:07:06,612 --> 01:07:08,415
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1208
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:09,437
The motion passes.

1209
01:07:09,477 --> 01:07:12,902
At this point in time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1210
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:30,769
Thank you.

1211
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:32,950
Mr. President, too, while we're under suspension.

1212
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:41,794
Back in June during the budget period, I asked Alicia Hunt to give us an update on municipal aggregation.

1213
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:47,217
I believe it was in the form of a committee of the whole where we can sit down.

1214
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:56,001
We have yet to get any formal response from the city administration, and it's been well over a year with municipal aggregation, and I think it's only

1215
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:12,914
fitting that where that was an automatic opt-in program where every resident was opted into the energy aggregation in the community that we receive an update on where we stand on behalf of the residents of this community.

1216
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:15,798
So I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole

1217
01:08:16,879 --> 01:08:24,686
Pretty quickly, it's been several months now, and I would ask that we set up a committee of the whole with Alicia Hunt to get an update on the program.

1218
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:26,527
I can reach out to her and I will schedule that.

1219
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:26,907
Thank you.

1220
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:28,168
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1221
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,269
Mr. President, we're under suspension.

1222
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,270
Councilor Knight.

1223
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:31,131
Motion to adjourn.

1224
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:32,572
We're under suspension.

1225
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:33,073
Second.

1226
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:37,156
On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1227
01:08:37,676 --> 01:08:38,497
Clerk, please call the roll.

1228
01:08:38,557 --> 01:08:41,259
Councilor Behrs.

1229
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:41,700
Yes.

1230
01:08:46,528 --> 01:08:46,828
Yes.

1231
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:48,329
That's a yes.

1232
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:48,549
Yes.

1233
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:48,669
Yes.

1234
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:48,809
Yes.

1235
01:08:48,869 --> 01:08:48,929
Yes.

1236
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:49,149
Yes.

1237
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:49,729
Yes.

1238
01:08:50,469 --> 01:08:50,650
Yes.

1239
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:55,611
The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

1240
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:55,851
Thank you.

1241
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:56,112
Good night.

1242
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:56,652
Be safe.
