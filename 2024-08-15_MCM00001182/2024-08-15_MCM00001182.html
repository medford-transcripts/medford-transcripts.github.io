    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=987.998">I</a>  don't think there's much changes as far as, you know, election is concerned in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=997.187">We've</a>  been voting at the same location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1000.55">The</a>  only time we've seen a change was when we come up with what, 6-2A. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1008.678">and</a>  what seven to eight and some of the people get displaced but that's been about something like three cycle of election I'm sure they have it additionally one of the thing we're trying we're working with the communication director is to send a message <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1025.035">to</a>  the community, telling them where to vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1028.678">On</a>  top of it, if they have an issue, call the election department.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1032.12">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1033.101">That's</a>  a great idea, if we can get like a robo-call to those residents to say, don't forget your new location, or, to a lot of people, it's funny, because conversations I had, we have a big state, State Representative Donato has a big, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1048.251">big</a>  race coming up in September, September 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1051.353">And</a>  a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1056.796">So</a>  that's where the questions arose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1059.537">And</a>  I appreciate that, if we can get that word out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1062.559">And</a>  I think the other thing was, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1064.785">that</a>  with that race, is it district, Middlesex district? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1070.568">35,</a>  what is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1074.57">We</a>  really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1081.534">There</a>  is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1086.056">There</a>  will be.</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1086.576">No,</a>  to the chair, the one in September is a state primary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1094.28">see</a>  you referring to the 35th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1097.403">The</a>  other sex has three people on the ballot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1102.407">So</a>  it's going to be reduced to two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1105.229">And</a>  the two will be in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1106.57">So</a>  the two will go in November.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1108.872">Now</a>  that's confusing because we were told that</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1113.395">the</a>  three candidates running on the democratic ticket that the winner that comes out of that race is the winner there's a partisan primary and there's a partisan primary there's a democratic primary there's three candidates yeah yeah</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1128.557">You</a>  have, that's what you have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1130.398">The</a>  first one, because what it is, you can only have at the general, two people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1134.62">Well,</a>  that's for Municipal Henry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1137.761">In</a>  this case, it'll be one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1138.882">It</a>  will be, that one will be the only person, just like you see for 23rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1145.685">Right</a>  now, we have Gavile, who's not unopposed, only his name, but he's still sure on the primary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1152.508">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1153.608">Right,</a>  no, I understand that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1155.089">But</a>  I think people think that let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1161.934">In</a>  November, there'll be no race. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1163.915">There'll</a>  be the candidate that came out of the primary.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1167.577">I</a>  think we should generally avoid going down this road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1170.84">But</a>  yes, there will be one candidate on the ballot in November for the Democratic Party. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1175.303">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1176.103">And</a>  there's no candidate running, I believe, for the Republican nomination.</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1180.806">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1182.227">so</a>  that's that's where the confusion because if they're the same party whoever wins is the one that move forward all right so and that's why i think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no republican uh <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1202.65">party</a>  running in this race. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1204.491">So</a>  in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1210.354">So</a>  we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1214.156">So</a>  it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1226.042">share</a>  a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected that they understand that November is really just ceremonial. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1235.752">It's</a>  not the actual election for that race is the third of September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1241.699">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1244.922">I</a>  don't know that we can <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1248.193">We</a>  could do a V-paper to communicate to the public that there's an election coming up and that they can contact the elections department, 781-393-2491. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1257.963">Or</a>  they can go online wheredoivotema.com to find out who their representative, what district they're in, their polling location.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1271.197">If</a>  I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1277.543">I</a>  think it's very political. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1281.107">Well,</a>  it's for all three candidates, not political. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1283.81">It's</a>  to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1287.353">that</a>  you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates, and they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1296.138">But</a>  the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1299.44">We</a>  just saw that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1305.764">And</a>  I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other, I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1315.39">and</a>  the effort by this body to ask if we can do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1319.192">Now,</a>  again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, it'd be very simple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1322.314">We'd</a>  say, let's make reference to city solicitor, let's do that, let's send it off as a B paper, and we'll get to that when we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1329.938">But</a>  having it stop right now, I think it's not right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1333.88">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1334.6">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1335.34">Yeah,</a>  it's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1336.321">I'm</a>  just, what's the text of the B paper?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1339.818">We</a>  would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, sorry, District 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1353.026">The</a>  35th Middlesex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1354.767">35th</a>  Middlesex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1356.148">the</a>  state representative, we have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1373.542">Does</a>  that make sense, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1376.665">I</a>  know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes, so.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1389.516">I'm</a>  going to read this back, Councilor Scarpelli, because I'm still... Sure, I know, but... <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1399.313">The</a>  fee paper is to ask the elections department and the mayor's office to do a robocall and whatever other means possible regarding the 35th Middlesex- Quiet, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1408.48">I'm</a>  sorry, I can't hear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1410.041">Regarding</a>  the possible 35th Middlesex District to educate these voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that election.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1420.569">The</a>  September 3rd race. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1422.21">The</a>  September 3rd race. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1424.432">The</a>  September primary being the- Yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1427.254">Right,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1427.834">Good,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1430.899">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1432.5">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1434.821">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1437.262">As</a>  a similar alternative, I know that the Election Commission is working pretty much year-round to publicize upcoming elections and not just make sure that people know the dates on the calendars and where to go, but to do things like motor drives. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1450.887">I</a>  would offer at the point that we're asking the Elections Commission to add another layer to redouble their existing efforts to make sure that people know when to get out and vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1459.836">I</a>  would say, you know, there's a primary on September 3rd, not just on the 35 Middlesex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1466.122">You</a>  know, I'd ask maybe we can just extend that to incorporate all voters within the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1470.886">I</a>  think everybody <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1473.549">more</a>  people, you know, that we would think can always use a reminder about when to vote and that goes for everybody within the city for September 3rd as well as for the November election this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1481.793">So</a>  I'd offer as an alternative, you know, I would certainly support any efforts to make sure that people know and have that date circled on their calendar and, you know, not just one district, but citywide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1491.339">So</a>  if we could, if you consider an amendment to have that just be a citywide effort at the point that we're going through the effort of a robocall at all, I'm sure that many voters across the community would benefit from it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1503.515">Vice</a>  President Collins, if I could, just for our clarity, you requested to amend the paper that this be a citywide robocall to remind, and other outreach to remind people of where to vote when the election is occurring?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1518.407">Yes,</a>  for the September 3rd.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1519.768">For</a>  the September 3rd state primary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1521.67">Through</a>  the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1523.511">One</a>  second, Henry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1525.253">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1525.833">I</a>  was just gonna ask, is that an amendment or a B paper?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1528.735">This</a>  is already a B paper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1529.556">This</a>  is an amendment to the B paper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1530.657">Amendment</a>  to, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1531.598">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1532.827">We</a>  thought prior to September 3rd, we have to realize that we have the early voting that takes place from the 24th to the 30th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1543.938">So</a>  that is coming out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1545.82">It's</a>  not listed on any of the papers in front of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1550.825">In</a>  addition to that, we also have <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1553.691">listed</a>  last day to register. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1556.893">If</a>  you don't register on time, you cannot vote on state primaries on the 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1563.077">We</a>  have that coming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1564.618">It's</a>  not on the paper in front of you, because this is not what we're here for tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1569.601">We</a>  also have the last day to request a vote by mail ballot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1576.365">So</a>  all this information coming down the pipe <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1581.048">to</a>  inform citizens of the city when they can vote prior to September 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1585.93">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1586.571">And</a>  on September 3rd.</p>

    <p>[Henry Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1619.053">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1621.674">An</a>  unenrolled have the ability to choose a time of voting which party to vote for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1628.077">That's</a>  the only one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1629.558">Because</a>  they're not affiliated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1631.759">They</a>  can come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1632.959">If</a>  they're voting for the three parties, they can say, who are you voting for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1637.141">How</a>  do you want to vote today?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1638.922">They</a>  say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1642.183">So</a>  that's important that people that don't have a candidate <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1645.885">in</a>  this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1659.594">That's</a>  a technical question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1661.255">Yeah,</a>  so that's something if we can ask to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1662.816">That's</a>  something I can explore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=1664.097">That</a>  was a question that was brought up to us by.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2014.177">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2015.958">I</a>  know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2024.038">Past</a>  week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for rodent infestation, considering we live in a ledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2035.702">And</a>  you don't have, you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2042.585">But</a>  we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2054.187">stymie</a>  the road infestation issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2056.788">We've</a>  even moved to put in ordinances that allow us to go onto private property if we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2070.735">I</a>  know that I've had a few phone calls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2072.896">I</a>  know that the curbside composting is a great initiative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2076.818">But</a>  you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2084.267">So</a>  there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2091.956">You</a>  see neighborhood communities <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2096.4">put</a>  together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or slow this process down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2113.968">I</a>  think that, I know that my motion would be Mr. President, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2118.891">is</a>  that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2130.903">I</a>  know Boston's calling it the rodent czar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2135.167">I</a>  think that Medford has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2149.178">And</a>  I think that what we're seeing is the different <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2157.61">different</a>  forms of control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2160.792">I</a>  think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2169.458">It</a>  wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2178.644">So</a>  there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2184.56">which,</a>  by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator to come out to put bait boxes down and leave, it's not working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2197.01">So</a>  my recommendation is that we move forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2199.312">I</a>  know that it's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2205.317">the</a>  community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2210.562">I</a>  think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community, and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2223.252">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2224.393">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2225.374">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2227.008">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Scarpelli as well as President Bears for bringing this forward and for being so responsive to, you know, really just the latest wave of resident outreach about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2236.073">And</a>  I think Councilor Scarpelli is exactly right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2238.174">You</a>  know, I think that the city has been working hard with the available tools to try to stem the tide of increasing rat populations over the past several years, but it's always seemed to me that our approach is, you know, fundamentally reactive and everybody can see with their eyes, you know, that that isn't doing enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2258.245">I</a>  think that the idea of a task force is potentially a great idea because there have been so many disparate approaches either tried already in the city or things that have been floated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2269.017">I</a>  think it'd be great to collect some of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2272.66">topics</a>  of discussion from the Solid Waste Task Force, which I was a member of a couple of years ago, and talking about how can we make sure that our evolving trash and compost receptacles are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, which is something that they are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, but it's important to share that information with the community whenever we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2290.724">I</a>  know that there's a lot of pioneering rodent innovations going on in neighboring cities that we hear about time to time from residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2300.006">One,</a>  because they seem more effective than just <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2302.787">sending</a>  somebody out when we get that latest call about where it's getting especially bad, and because we do want to mitigate the effects on other members of the ecosystem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2309.994">And</a>  I think that we're all aware that, you know, just putting out a lot of rat poison is really harmful to the other animals that we do treasure in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2318.782">So</a>  everything takes resources, you know, investing in the right tools and the right systems to really attack this, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2326.508">It's</a>  not going to get better without these major institutions pitching in to help us have a more systemic approach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2330.771">So</a>  I would absolutely support this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2333.652">I</a>  thank my fellow councilors for bringing it forward.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2335.293">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2337.834">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2339.311">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2340.452">I</a>  wanted to thank both Councilor Scarpelli and President Bears for the resolutions on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2347.257">I</a>  think we all know that this is a really important issue for public health, for quality of living here in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2354.582">It's,</a>  as Councilor Scarpelli said, it's not just Fulton Heights. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2358.665">But</a>  this happening in Fulton Heights is particularly concerning because it's not a place that's used to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2365.607">South</a>  Medford and Wellington have been particularly hit hard by the rodent infestation over the last few years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2373.13">Now,</a>  anecdotally talking to neighbors, some of the methods we have employed seem to have been working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2379.692">There</a>  is a slight decrease anecdotally talking to my neighbors about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2384.914">However,</a>  rodents are still there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2387.735">I</a>  think it's really important to note that we did hold a Committee of the Whole on this a few months ago, where we had a long conversation with the Director of the Board of Health about methods that we could employ to combat this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2403.724">this</a>  problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2405.205">Now,</a>  Councilor Collins has alluded to the public education piece, which really has to be a very, very big part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2412.47">That</a>  message was reinforced over and over again at that meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2416.173">It</a>  would be lovely to get this resolution passed, to sit down with the Director of the Board of Health and other stakeholders to get an update on those strategies, to see how we're doing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2427.942">are</a>  there, what are the metrics that we're using to measure and how are we doing on those metrics? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2432.948">I</a>  think it's also really important to note that the council has been working really hard on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2437.593">We</a>  have a resolution coming to our, an ordinance coming to our next meeting about wildlife feeding, reduce, basically, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2447.845">regulating</a>  that so that we're discouraging rodent behavior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2453.432">Past</a>  councils have also passed ordinances tackling rodent infestations as well, which city staff have reported back with metrics showing that they have been useful.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2465.455">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2465.775">Any</a>  further comment by members of the council? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2468.739">I'll</a>  go and then we can go to members of the public, but I just wanted to note specifically around the Malden Hospital site. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2474.626">I</a>  want to thank David Tedisco, who sent around a number of emails, has been organizing his neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2480.994">communicating</a>  around this issue with the City of Medford and the City of Malden. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2485.155">Tufts</a>  Medicine at the former Malden Hospital site is responsible for rodent mitigation, and it is on Malden land, and so they have been very responsive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2495.177">Tufts</a>  Medicine has made it clear they know they need to do more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2498.918">Mayor</a>  Christensen as well, and also Director O'Connor, Mayor Lungo-Koehn have been involved in some of those discussions as well to bring whatever resources we can to bear from the Medford side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2508.681">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng for noting the rodent control ordinance that we passed, the solid waste ordinance, which really is going to help focus on reducing rodent populations in the commercial areas with the combined <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2523.502">dumpster,</a>  for lack of a better word, in the private hauler program, which should really significantly improve both the efficiency and the requirements on the business districts and the businesses in those districts to keep their trash and waste away from rodents and to also centralize removal of it, which hopefully will help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2542.836">on</a>  a cost basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2544.337">Um,</a>  I think the point is we're really well taken around funding and staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2547.358">We've</a>  heard time and time again from our animal control health department, um, from every member of this council that there's not enough people, there's not enough money in the health department budget to effectively address this problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2558.483">That's</a>  because the city does not have enough money to address almost any of our problems, and that is something that we're working on extensively. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2565.789">So</a>  we need more funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2567.15">We</a>  need more staff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2567.87">We</a>  know we can't get by with one animal control officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2570.853">We</a>  know we can't get by with only two sanitarians. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2573.955">And</a>  that problem has been raised time and time again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2575.917">You</a>  know, we're not even, I think, hitting a six-figure-a-year budget for rodent control right now, even though everyone in the city and everyone in this room acknowledges that we need to be spending significantly more on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2587.966">We</a>  do the best with what we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2589.568">What</a>  we have is too little, and we need more funding for the city to effectively provide services such as road control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2596.595">With</a>  that, I will go to the podium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2598.917">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2600.699">And</a>  you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2604.146">I'm</a>  Paulette Vartabedian, 27th Central Ave., Medford, Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2607.591">Just</a>  want to commend Vice President Collins on bringing up the environmental impact of the road in control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2614.602">And</a>  I know that it's a huge problem everywhere, and I'm not <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2620.508">dismissing</a>  that, but I do hope that we as a city will look to other alternatives other than rodenticides, which are the worst, worst thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2632.475">It</a>  actually is counterproductive to rodent control because many of the wildlife and wild birds that use rats, mice, things like that as their meals are getting killed, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2645.522">due</a>  to secondary rodenticide poisoning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2648.224">It</a>  also affects foxes, coyotes, other things that will feed on rodents, so it's really counterproductive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2655.287">You're</a>  killing the things that will kill the rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2658.649">I</a>  did read that there is some population control drugs they're trying to use, and I just read that it's a fairly new process, I believe, that some of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2672.278">participants</a>  are saying that they're seeing more rats now than ever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2676.119">That</a>  just may be a small percentage that we're seeing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2681.6">It</a>  may not be the whole picture as of yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2683.661">But</a>  again, it's a multifaceted problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2687.341">Education,</a>  as Councilor Hang said, is I think the most important thing, is to have people, businesses, et cetera, take care of their garbage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2697.564">No</a>  food, no rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2699.264">No</a>  food, no coyotes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2700.706">That's</a>  just common sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2702.448">So</a>  please, as a whole, please try to avoid using rodenticides foremost amongst everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2709.238">And</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2710.419">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2711.323">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2711.784">And</a>  I just wanted to note on that point, the new solid waste contract and the solid waste councils are can correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2719.712">But</a>  I believe the new solid waste contract, because of how we can structured it with the State Department of Environmental Protection, we are receiving some funds specifically around an educational program around the solid waste. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2730.684">So</a>  there should be more information going out to residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2733.267">through</a>  that education program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2734.428">Now</a>  that is just limited to the trash, the recycling, the composting, funding for other stuff like the wildlife feeding, et cetera, would have to come from somewhere else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2744.421">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2745.362">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2746.68">Hi,</a>  Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2749.782">I</a>  live in the hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2757.646">I</a>  personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2764.629">I</a>  think accountability has to come in play. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2767.01">I</a>  think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2775.154">So</a>  people think, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2776.8">and</a>  they live near food sources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2778.761">So</a>  gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2783.362">So</a>  they're gonna live near those things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2786.342">My</a>  question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2800.466">Like</a>  go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2805.867">fire</a>  station, have a meeting there, go with to the community and educate them in that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2811.729">It</a>  has to be hands on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2813.39">And</a>  if you really communicate to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2820.332">I</a>  think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2826.778">and</a>  you really see the people that you are representing face-to-face and that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2836.541">They'll</a>  talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2842.983">And</a>  that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2846.805">And</a>  that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2854.727">If</a>  you're elderly, get some help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2857.167">right</a>  but don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats that's one thing so the community piece the other piece is um wakling court is scheduled for demolition is there <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2873.488">a</a>  plan in place for the hillside area on rodents? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2878.655">Is</a>  that part of that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2880.057">How</a>  much money is allocated to that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2882.46">What</a>  are we doing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2883.301">What</a>  are we planning? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2884.202">Because</a>  I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2888.848">I</a>  know they'll reach out to the media community about <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2891.912">like</a>  400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2896.696">We</a>  need notification and we need notification about what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens, because everybody who's talking about it are worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and a rat this big walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2915.75">I</a>  won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2919.633">It's</a>  pretty bad when it's still sunny <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2922.25">and</a>  they're walking in front of me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2923.955">So</a>  I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2934.796">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2935.696">My</a>  time must be up.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2936.837">Apparently,</a>  I didn't realize it was going to play you off like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2942.879">Zoom's</a>  getting a little snotty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2947.24">On</a>  the Waffling Court thing, there is a pest mitigation plan that is part of the Waffling Court project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2952.842">The</a>  road and control ordinance that we passed, as well as some of the building code stuff that we've done, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2957.424">And</a>  maybe zoning requires all major project construction to have integrated pest management plans as part of the ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2964.332">And</a>  Director O'Connor can talk more about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2967.055">It'd</a>  be on file with the Board of Health in her office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2970.158">And</a>  then I can also talk to Director Driscoll about trying to communicate out better that there is a plan to the residents.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2975.664">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2975.965">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2976.665">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2981.519">Please,</a>  you have three minutes and I'm going to try to shut off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2983.78">Thank</a>  you for the time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2984.78">My</a>  name is Gavin Murphy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2985.88">I'm</a>  actually a Malden resident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2987.321">I'm</a>  here because I'm a contractor for the city of Medford with the Iraq problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2991.962">I'm</a>  the guy that the health department calls when there's an issue in the neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=2995.423">I</a>  saw this on the agenda and I thought maybe I could pop in tonight and take a beating like a man if it's necessary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3004.445">I</a>  would like to let you know that next week, the New England Pest Management Association is putting on a training program for health inspectors, and the city of Medford is sending three people to that training program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3015.791">I</a>  know when they go through their sanitation training, they do not get any specific rodent control or rodent identification training, so we're gonna try and correct that issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3026.697">I</a>  do have seats available, although very few, if any city councilors wanna come over <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3033.0">see</a>  what rats look like up close and personal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3035.584">So</a>  I open that invitation up to each of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3038.409">If</a>  you want to come, please just give me a call and I'll make a seat for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3041.974">As</a>  far as what's going on in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3044.881">with</a>  rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3047.322">I</a>  made a prediction two years ago at the National Pest Management Association Conference, it happened to be in Boston, and I was up speaking, and I do speak at different national level programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3058.165">I</a>  made a prediction, and nobody's gonna like this prediction, that within the next five to 10 years, rats are gonna become as common as squirrels, we're gonna accept them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3067.027">I</a>  just don't see us changing our habits as people that's gonna bring these rats under control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3074.469">Last</a>  moment said walking down the street, there's rats in front of her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3077.432">I</a>  think it's gonna pretty much stay that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3079.755">It's</a>  not a rodent problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3081.497">It's</a>  a people problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3083.299">I</a>  see it in this very city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3084.64">I</a>  see it in every community in eastern Massachusetts that I walk in on a regular basis, that I walk into people's backyards and the garbage and the trash is just piled up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3094.055">and</a>  you can't get people to clean it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3096.236">The</a>  conducive conditions are there, and I'm sure each of you have heard enough about this, and how do we get people to respond to that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3105.001">I</a>  watch my health inspectors go out there, and they work tirelessly to try and correct these issues, and I see them just get pushed back by people constantly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3114.187">I'm</a>  working on them doing this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3116.028">I</a>  know one site that I've been at for the last two years, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3119.59">and</a>  your health inspectors try and be cooperative and work with people and educate and we're still dealing with rats at the same house and it's just not getting corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3129.477">Other</a>  neighborhoods we go into and people work with your health inspectors and they work with us because <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3134.818">Your</a>  health department will pay me to go on their property and dispatch the animals using carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide directly right into the burrows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3142.923">And</a>  it works great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3144.184">And</a>  if we can get in there and they're going to correct their issues, we're going to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3146.926">I've</a>  seen some neighborhoods really change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3149.728">In</a>  other neighborhoods where we just have one person pushing back, it's just a constant pressure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3154.811">But</a>  the reason I came up was to invite anybody who would like to attend that meeting next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3158.595">It's</a>  Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3159.235">I</a>  know everybody has real jobs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3161.918">And</a>  it's hard to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3162.739">It's</a>  a daytime thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3164.06">If</a>  you want to try and make it, let me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3165.601">And</a>  just let you know, you have three people coming to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3168.444">And</a>  hopefully, they're going to come up with some new ideas of what to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3171.627">What</a>  time on Wednesday? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3172.868">It</a>  starts at 9 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3174.289">in</a>  my office to get done about one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3178.511">If</a>  you leave, I would ask you to leave your phone number with Emily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3181.652">We</a>  can pass it around to the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3184.614">And</a>  I just want to thank you for coming down and sharing that information with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3187.355">We</a>  do hear great things about folks who work with you when the city refers you out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3192.578">But</a>  I think it's really helpful and sobering for us to hear what you're saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3196.88">That's</a>  the experience that we've had issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3198.981">We</a>  had some folks <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3200.985">I</a>  don't know, six months ago, maybe eight months ago, from the Hillside neighborhood on the other side from here and up by like Osgoode Street, talking about a couple of problem properties where we were trying to get code enforcement out there to address overgrowth and waste, and the city not having, essentially the private owners just being able to continue to get away with it to the public detriment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3224.977">So,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3226.658">You</a>  know, it is a really important issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3228.699">But</a>  I do have a question from Councilor Callahan, if you don't mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3231.842">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3232.802">Thanks</a>  so much for coming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3233.623">It's</a>  great to have you here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3235.064">I</a>  just wanted to see if you had any opinion on the topic that one of the previous speakers mentioned about poison versus population control.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3244.735">about</a>  the what?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3245.616">Poison</a>  versus population control.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3248.137">Poison</a>  versus population control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3249.959">I'm</a>  not sure I'm going to say the question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3252.02">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3252.36">The</a>  question is birth control? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3253.961">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3254.662">Poison</a>  versus birth control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3256.483">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3256.883">It</a>  depends upon the type of poison that you're talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3260.026">And</a>  birth control <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3262.207">hasn't</a>  proven itself yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3264.308">We</a>  had it years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3266.229">We</a>  tried it, and it blew up in our face. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3268.73">And</a>  then we had concerns about that getting into the water supply, infecting most mammals with birth control that we didn't want to affect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3275.413">So</a>  that was taken off the market by the EPA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3279.175">So</a>  I mean, other poisons that we use, some things we use have no secondary poisonings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3286.138">Some</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3286.998">I</a>  don't think that we're actually hurting <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3290.492">Animals</a>  like we've been told that we've been hurting animals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3294.693">For</a>  instance, MK in Arlington died of the bird flu, not of rodent poisoning, rodenticide poisoning, and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3304.297">So</a>  I mean, can we cut back and things can change in the industry? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3307.638">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3308.718">And</a>  this training program we're doing is gonna really hit on that, on the alternatives and the best way to control the problem.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3315.343">And</a>  the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, that's not, I mean, it's obviously deadly, but it's not a poison.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3321.045">Well,</a>  there's no secondary.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3322.666">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3324.587">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3325.587">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3327.067">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3327.828">Thank</a>  you for coming down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3328.748">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3332.149">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3333.999">Hi,</a>  Melanie Tringali from 16 Forest Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3338.223">I</a>  just want to thank them for bringing this up again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3341.226">I</a>  have a property on Forest Street where I live and have been seeing rodent activities the first time I've seen it in five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3348.732">And</a>  I also own a property that I lived in for 25 years at 2931 Stoughton Street and have never had <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3355.478">rat</a>  issues over by the hillside, but that is becoming an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3360.002">The</a>  Method Health Department was very responsive and coming out after my calls and people have come out and looked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3368.228">I</a>  do just want to say two things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3370.59">One,</a>  there's a huge health concern with rats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3375.708">A</a>  friend of mine's actual dog got liver disease from being in touch with rat urine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3382.472">So</a>  rat urine actually causes liver disease in animals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3387.936">So</a>  that's an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3388.857">It</a>  can also cause a lot of issues with human contact as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3392.499">And</a>  two, you mentioned something about the trash. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3396.421">Is</a>  trash being done, because I walked through Medford Square on Monday night, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3402.631">And</a>  it is disgusting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3403.672">I</a>  don't even like walking through this square at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3407.976">It's</a>  deplorable, the amount of trash that's not in any receptacles whatsoever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3413.241">They're</a>  just sitting in cardboard boxes and trash bags. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3417.665">And</a>  I wanna be supportive of the businesses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3419.466">I</a>  think it's really important to have the businesses there, but I also think it doesn't put our city in good light and it also attracts all types of rodents.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3427.856">Yes,</a>  I can give more context on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3430.118">And</a>  again, if I get it wrong, please correct me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3433.922">My</a>  understanding is that under prior trash contracts, there was kind of selective. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3439.008">Some</a>  businesses were getting city pickup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3440.81">Some</a>  businesses were paying for private pickup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3442.532">It</a>  was not really clear what the rhyme or reason was, but there was an equal treatment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3447.056">some</a>  condo buildings were getting city pickup, some were having to pay for private. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3450.977">This</a>  contract straightens that out, A, from a pure fairness perspective, but it also, part of the ordinance that we passed establishes a private hauler program where there's essentially a preferred private hauler, which is the person that the city has, the group that the city has a contract with, and businesses or large residential buildings can sign up for a contract at a preferred rate with that hauler, because they're already in the community doing the public contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3477.223">The</a>  idea is, and this contract just went into effect five weeks ago, six weeks ago, and I'm not sure when these provisions exactly start to kick in yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3486.049">I</a>  think there's some grace period in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3489.491">But</a>  the idea is that in the major squares, instead of having street <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3493.474">pick</a>  up with city stuff overnight, that there would be potentially areas of public parking lots or areas on private property where you might have all of the businesses for that building using a single dumpster or multiple dumpsters and then being part of this preferred hauler program to then be able to have the trash in a containment space that is subject to an integrated pest management plan and is rodent-proof. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3517.894">Because,</a>  yeah, I mean, I worked at Rosa's when I was a kid here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3523.198">Yeah,</a>  putting out the trash. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3524.4">I</a>  mean, I put it out because that's what my boss told me to do, but I wasn't happy seeing the street lined and obviously one windstorm that night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3532.431">And</a>  we've seen that before in Medford Square and the trash is all over the square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3535.916">So</a>  that is the intent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3537.638">Councilor</a>  Collins seems to have more information than me, so I will let her answer.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3541.242">Not</a>  more, but just I think in terms of what, and I agree, I think that this was a lot of what was kind of negotiated while this new contract was being formed between the city side and waste management. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3550.625">I</a>  think that a lot of the provisions and goals, since it just went into effect July 1, are probably still being formulated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3557.227">But</a>  I think in terms of what residents can expect to see, especially in the square specifically, is consolidation, because absolutely when you have <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3564.329">one</a>  business that has overflow trash cans on the sidewalk, and another that has a dumpster, and then the other one doesn't use that dumpster, they just have a receptacle, and the next one just has a bag that looks messy, and the more we can just keep everything in one container that really is solid and reinforced, hopefully that'll be one piece of the puzzle in getting trash off the streets, rats off the streets.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3585.923">And</a>  just one other thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3587.364">I</a>  think the other big thing comes down to enforcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3590.325">Enforcing</a>  ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3600.33">And</a>  if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3612.077">Yeah,</a>  one thing we're looking at is the fee and fine schedule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3614.538">We've</a>  heard from our building commissioner right now that it actually costs more to add a new code enforcement officer because we're only charging certain rates than they're going to actually bring back in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3624.681">So</a>  it's cost negative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3625.561">Is</a>  there a way to make that more cost neutral, cost positive? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3629.562">And</a>  you've heard a million times in this room, we don't have enough code enforcement, so I don't need to get into that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3634.774">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3636.296">Now</a>  address the record, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3639.44">I</a>  just want to emphasize what was mentioned here by the pest control expert and the previous speaker that I think you keep complaining that you don't have financial resources, so a great way to address this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3651.035">is</a>  actually through fines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3653.676">And</a>  the advantage of that is it's also like a dynamic stream of revenue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3656.776">So</a>  if you have a lot of rodent issues, and then you fine, fine, fine, fine, you get a lot of money, and then that helps you to address the problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3664.538">Because,</a>  you know, later on, then you have less rodent pressure, then you don't need as many staff in the health department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3671.62">So</a>  with the fine, it would allow you to just have a lot of resources when you actually need it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3676.121">And</a>  then the second thing that I wanted to emphasize that the pest control experts mentioned is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3681.643">individual</a>  responsibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3683.043">I</a>  think everyone in the community should understand that they have a responsibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3687.065">And</a>  in fact, they are the primary responsible party here to address this problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3693.568">And</a>  a lot comes to up to education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3696.37">And</a>  I think, you know, the city can play a role in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3699.852">But</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3701.372">At</a>  the end of the day, it's each of us that can go online or get a book from the library and learn about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3708.495">And</a>  then if we just don't have an individual sense of responsibility, then, you know, probably as a pest control expert emphasized, then we're just going to live with rats rather than with squirrels. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3719.58">So</a>  those two things, first, like, you know, individual responsibility, addressing the issue, being nice to your community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3724.902">And</a>  then the second one is that actually <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3727.163">enforcing</a>  fines and getting a lot of money from that, from businesses, as has been said, like, you know, why aren't they dealing with the trash in the proper way, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3735.552">That's</a>  just not acceptable, so the city should go and get revenue from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3738.775">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3739.656">Thank</a>  you, Jan, and I appreciate the comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3742.239">One</a>  thing I think, when we pass the road control ordinance, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3745.442">There's</a>  a state law around non-criminal disposition that limits the maximum amount of fines and how often you can do them, and I think that was one of the barriers for us in terms of using fines as a revenue source. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3755.307">I</a>  think we wanted to see, I think it's a maximum of $300 per incident, and then you have to have a certain time period between incidents, and it's a barrier that we face because of the state law around that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3767.693">I</a>  don't know when the legislature will change it, but that would be helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3774.257">Yes?</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Vartabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3776.858">I'll</a>  let Roderick Beatty in part two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3779.54">If</a>  you assert fines to repeat offenders, such as one of them said that every time they go by this house, the dumpster's overloaded, overloaded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3790.229">So</a>  you find this landlord or owner and they don't correct it and you find them again and find them again, whatever the allotted period is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3800.777">Is</a>  it legal? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3802.098">If</a>  I get a lot of speeding tickets, I'm not allowed to renew my license because I have these outstanding speeding tickets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3809.545">Is</a>  there anything that you can do to, this is going to be extreme, but put a lien on the house or something like that to make these people clean up their problem? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3820.915">Because</a>  the only thing that really makes <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3823.865">humans</a>  do something is when it hurts them in the pocket. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3827.967">And</a>  again, the only thing that's gonna correct this problem is humans by cleaning up their mess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3833.389">All</a>  these other loading controls are not gonna work if the food source is still there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3839.572">So</a>  my question is, how far can a fine go to make this workable? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3846.655">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3847.45">Yeah,</a>  so I can answer partially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3849.611">So</a>  there is this state law that over overarches what cities and towns are able to do through a non-criminal disposition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3857.096">One</a>  thing we are trying, my first term, like I think basically the only thing I really was able to get done was we worked on a <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3863.199">the</a>  snow removal ordinance, updating the snow ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3865.481">And</a>  one of the things we were trying to get done was looking into this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3870.604">And</a>  when we passed that snow removal ordinance update, there is now a provision where if you have a repeat offender, you can put a lien on the property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3880.31">not</a>  just for the fine, which is still stuck at that 300 non-criminal disposition, but also we put in the ordinance the cost of removal of the smell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3890.178">So</a>  if the city has to send out city employees or contractors to clear the sidewalks, then there could be a lien placed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3898.525">I</a>  don't think we've actually gotten to that point with any property yet since that ordinance was passed, so I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3904.37">And</a>  then I think there is an open question as to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3907.933">when</a>  that comes down the road, and we actually try to do it, and then someone sues and says, no, you can't do this, where are the courts gonna land on it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3914.596">We</a>  passed it in the solicitor, it went through legal counsel, but we haven't tested it yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3920.619">So</a>  we'll see, it's a litigious society out there these days.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3925.915">Councilor</a>  Saint. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3926.896">I</a>  just wanted to quickly thank everyone for coming up and speaking about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3929.938">I</a>  think everyone had something super productive to add to the conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3934.841">I</a>  think in the future, with this resolution passed, with more meetings about this, the more voices we can get, the more advice that we can get, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3943.487">will</a>  be able to make some positive progress on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3946.989">I</a>  think Mr. Benedetto's statements actually reminded me of something I wanted to say, which is that I think we have to think in terms of our messaging and our strategy, we need to go in two new directions with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3960.056">One</a>  is to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3961.237">go</a>  more local. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3963.558">I</a>  know my own neighborhood held a road and control meeting, basically neighbors educating each other about the best ways to get rid of road and control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3972.263">Now</a>  that's something that should be less neighbors doing it and city coming in and city leaders coming in and helping organize those meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3982.509">So</a>  the local aspect is very, very important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3985.05">And</a>  as much as we can harness that organic momentum, the better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3988.112">I</a>  think we also need to think bigger too and recognize that the road control problem is also a regional problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=3994.075">And</a>  so the more that we can do to set up institutions where Councilors like us, city employees from Medford are working with city employees and Councilors in neighboring municipalities to deal with projects that are on the border, I think the better we can serve our residents too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4014.044">So</a>  building those channels of communication I think will be really important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4018.998">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4182.145">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4184.926">If</a>  you allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4197.511">the</a>  school department or employees of the city or the schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4202.137">Yet</a>  many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4215.426">Going</a>  back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4224.289">The</a>  purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4240.535">My</a>  motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4247.079">That</a>  is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4254.403">People</a>  deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4257.865">With</a>  this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4262.909">Now,</a>  as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4266.531">We</a>  said we need more funding, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4269.453">We</a>  need more funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4271.375">And</a>  we've seen <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4273.893">Over</a>  the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million free cash that was recently certified, the lack of new growth in our community over the past four years, payments to outside council that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are, and lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4302.038">So</a>  this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4313.746">Now,</a>  I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4325.208">But</a>  there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4329.469">Like</a>  we mentioned the other day, that city, you just go and speak to the department heads. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4334.39">Well,</a>  the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4339.308">So</a>  like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4349.412">It's</a>  frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4362.025">So,</a>  I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salta. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4373.169">I</a>  know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, even the most simple things, an arbitration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4383.012">If</a>  an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4386.854">I'd</a>  like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4391.293">not</a>  just the outcome, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4393.735">Because</a>  we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4408.297">and</a>  we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey, in the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes and how we've run the finances in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4421.021">Okay,</a>  we've seen that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4424.183">It's</a>  public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4435.924">why</a>  we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4442.328">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4443.789">I</a>  appreciate the time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4446.371">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4446.731">Do</a>  any other councilors have any questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4454.956">Seeing</a>  none, I would just note that the council has not approved any appropriations beyond the city budget for settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4461.08">So</a>  settlements are being done within the appropriate amount of the city budget.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4466.894">Members</a>  of the public would like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4678.112">Yep,</a>  Neil Osborne. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4682.248">We</a>  move on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4683.769">Next,</a>  Sandra Gail versus city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4686.851">Next,</a>  there's a bunch of inspectors versus city of Medford next is there's about 50 dpw employees versus the city of Medford next I want to go to settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4698.217">2022,</a>  30 school custodians, $495,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4698.857">2023,</a>  school security, $28,500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4699.357">June</a>  of 2024, a member of the DPW, $265,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4700.378">2024,</a>  you just settled it out in the hall today, $47,500 for another member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4702.198">2024,</a>  Medford DPW pending settlement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4703.739">It's</a>  gonna be signed sometime very soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4725.847">2024</a>  Samari Montes, you guys took it up outside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4729.97">I</a>  also want to point out that while the city is paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements and are actually there's much more liability and maybe in the millions that the city council is approving two raises for itself as well as all the other non-union. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4749.141">three</a>  raises for the Medford mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, that goes into effect July 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4755.822">That's</a>  one for the school committee and two raises for the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4760.043">And</a>  all the while, the city still has many employees under collective bargaining agreements that haven't had a raise in years, including police patrolmen, police superiors, recreation department, DPW superintendents, inspectors, and others.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4776.487">And-</a>  Steve, you're a minute over.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4777.927">Yeah,</a>  I just I just I'm almost done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4780.388">I</a>  got two more points. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4781.488">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4781.949">I</a>  also want to point out that the city is spending many hundreds of thousands on KP law again, while all these other things are pending when they could hire a city solicitor, but they choose not to by leaving the wages so low. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4796.754">And</a>  lastly, I want to point out what the city is treating the taxpayer dollars as monopoly money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4802.476">You're</a>  asking for multiple prop two and a half overrides in November over seven <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4807.478">and</a>  a half million dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4808.578">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4808.978">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4809.379">That</a>  was two minutes over.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4811.779">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4813.66">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4815.16">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4817.241">On</a>  that note, again, we have not appropriated a single dollar above the budgeted appropriated amount for any settlement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4824.903">So</a>  there's not a monopoly money approach here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4827.784">Steve,</a>  I'm sorry, but you know, you can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4831.88">Right,</a>  and they've been paid for by appropriated funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4837.403">There's</a>  no additional funding, magic money, wasted money that's going to these things beyond what is approved in the city budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4848.79">The</a>  city council, Steve, I'm not gonna get into a back and forth with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4851.972">The</a>  city council has to approve all appropriations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4855.654">It's</a>  the law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4856.234">The</a>  city council has not been asked to appropriate a single dollar beyond the budget for legal settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4862.667">Well,</a>  I would, good luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4869.091">Any</a>  questions on the resolution? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4871.652">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4875.315">I</a>  don't have a question on the resolution specifically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4877.596">I</a>  thank the Councilor for bringing it forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4879.277">I</a>  think that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4883.068">I</a>  think that a lot of what we've heard in terms of premises for this conversation, I have an honest disagreement with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4890.072">At</a>  the same time, I think that there's a lot of ways for us to have really productive conversations about settlements and liabilities before the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4900.938">These</a>  sometimes occur in public session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4902.919">These</a>  sometimes occur in executive session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4906.36">Anytime</a>  we are getting more information from the administration as opposed to less when it comes to the city side of things, we have no jurisdiction over the schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4913.902">I</a>  think that is a good thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4914.923">I</a>  think that always leaves us better off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4917.184">That</a>  often leaves the atmosphere more productive and collaborative than it was when we were feeling under-informed prior to, you know, whether it's a meeting or a memo or just a substantive update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4931.168">I</a>  think for myself, I feel, I think, across many issues we've all had the experience of feeling under informed on various issues and then we get that bolus of information it's like wow, now we can really have a conversation about this, that leaves me feeling pretty open and flexible when it comes to what type of <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4948.147">format</a>  or venue we receive information about settlements and liabilities in going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4954.054">This,</a>  like a lot of our resolutions, when it comes to making resolutions to the administration, they are essentially requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4959.74">We</a>  cannot compel reports or requests to be filled by the administration just because of the nature of the way our government is set up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4969.893">That</a>  being said, I hope that the administration takes this request for more information in the best faith possible to say it is better for us when we put our issues out on the table and we're able to have these conversations when there's fewer surprises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4993.538">I</a>  think that there's a lot of cliche ways to put this, but I think that we're better when fewer things are in the dark. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=4999.181">I</a>  think that it's better to shine a light on things that people are hearing about than to have to speculate until kind of a belated information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5013.289">So</a>  that being said, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5016.235">more</a>  information is always better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5017.536">I</a>  know that a lot of this is very sensitive, like we saw earlier today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5020.197">A</a>  lot of this has to be discussed in executive session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5022.539">Some</a>  of it, you know, there's some litigations, there's some settlements that always come to the council as a matter of course, we saw that earlier this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5030.043">I</a>  always wanna correct the record when it comes to what information, you know, the city council does get. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5036.267">Certain</a>  settlements do come before us, we do appropriate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5039.889">You</a>  know, I wouldn't want to put forward a request and also forward the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5045.833">story</a>  that we're in this complete and total information desert in the same way that I wouldn't want it to go by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5057.973">unusual</a>  number for free cash is in some way evidence of financial mismanagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5062.676">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5064.377">We</a>  know from communities across the street that this was a banner year for free cash surpluses for many communities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5070.78">But</a>  in the same way, I don't think that we should need to treat settlements and liabilities like something that we cannot talk about and we cannot ask about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5080.906">I</a>  think to the extent that we are able to have a freer flow of information about this with the administration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5086.348">leave</a>  us better off, leave us better able to communicate with the community when there are concerns, be able to say, this is what it really is, you know, and help us dial in on what our real problems are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5097.246">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5100.199">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5103.14">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5104.781">I</a>  agree with my councilors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5108.802">This</a>  is a simple request that, again, through transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested, and I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5122.547">If</a>  it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5131.113">So</a>  I welcome your support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5133.554">I</a>  think that, I know Councilor Villes said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Sealth just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5146.823">So</a>  again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5162.323">These</a>  are real lawsuits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5164.783">what's</a>  already been settled are real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5167.325">A</a>  lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5170.828">So</a>  I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5174.892">And</a>  when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories, and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5181.217">If</a>  they're fact, then we can discuss something else that's very important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5185.601">And</a>  that's what we're paying for our <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5191.205">our</a>  insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5195.248">How,</a>  what does that increase? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5196.249">What</a>  have we paid? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5196.93">You</a>  know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5200.933">My</a>  opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5216.645">express</a>  that we just we just certify nine million dollars that's nine million dollars of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly so in definition to myself whether you want to take it or not it's fiscal mismanagement you do not manage <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5232.885">that</a>  money responsibly, and that's the taxpayer's money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5237.269">So,</a>  yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my council colleagues and the mayor to see <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5249.76">where</a>  we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5254.966">There's</a>  a lot of questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5256.027">This</a>  is just a piece. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5256.948">That's</a>  all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5263.656">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5267.711">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5269.052">You</a>  know, I like Vice President Collins. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5271.594">I</a>  disagree with a lot of the premises put out there and to the best effort of Councilors to get me to vote no on this, I do intend to vote yes on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5282.282">You</a>  know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5283.503">I</a>  do believe that the text of the resolution that's in front of us is what we have to debate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5288.925">And</a>  I agree with what's being said in the resolution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5291.425">I</a>  agree with greater transparency. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5293.346">I</a>  think it's good when we as the City Council have more oversight over these issues, when we are much more to know about these issues, when we can inform our residents about what's going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5306.53">any</a>  motion that I think, any motion or resolution that reasonably increases transparency in our community is something that I would support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5314.076">And</a>  so I do plan on voting yes on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5317.399">Councilor</a>  Calderon.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5318.059">I</a>  plan to vote in favor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5321.642">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5322.243">Any</a>  further comments from members of council? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5326.018">I'll</a>  just say for one Councilor, the text of the resolution, I don't have a problem with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5331.444">It's</a>  answers that already exist and could be compiled into a report, I would guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5335.368">We've</a>  seen them in the Warren articles and we've seen them in reports previously, and I'd like to see them all in one place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5341.395">And</a>  I think we've said so many times here, it'd be nice to see it all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5345.319">No</a>  problem with the text of the resolution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5347.688">but</a>  the narrative and the arguments being put forth underlying the resolution to try to tie it into some larger accusation, it's just spurious, it's just not real. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5360.858">The</a>  facts of the matter are this council has never been asked to appropriate additional money for settlements and legal services since I've been on this council, which includes all these fiscal years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5370.705">I</a>  haven't seen a million dollar end of year transfer to the legal budget because of all these settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5375.308">That</a>  has to happen legally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5377.549">There's</a>  about six different checks and balances on it from the finance director to the state division of local services and the Department of Revenue to the mayor to this body. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5385.854">That</a>  if that was happening, they'd have to go through all these, there'd have to be such a massive conspiracy going all the way up to the state level to the commissioner of revenue for that to be true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5396.605">that</a>  it's not true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5398.006">So</a>  I'm perfectly fine asking the questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5400.326">I'm</a>  gonna vote yes on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5402.067">But</a>  the idea that this fits some sort of larger narrative or example of something that's going on about malfeasance is just false. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5409.53">The</a>  number of people who would have to be involved in it intentionally is not possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5415.232">And</a>  I think as everyone knows here, it would involve people who strongly disagree with each other, somehow colluding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5422.095">I</a>  disagree strongly with Mayor Lungo-Koehn on a number of substantive issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5426.717">I</a>  disagree with her on some of the management style in this building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5429.941">I</a>  am not, you know, it's just not possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5435.948">So</a>  I have no problem answering, asking the questions, but when we try to tie it into this larger thing, it's just plainly political. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5444.658">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5446.949">I</a>  would agree with what president bears was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5455.157">I</a>  think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the that the city wouldn't have been able to, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5464.825">access</a>  the funds to pay out legal fees and things like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5471.235">There</a>  are blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5476.082">So,</a>  for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5479.847">he</a>  just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5487.789">That</a>  was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5495.311">I</a>  think that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5497.411">I</a>  also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5510.155">elements</a>  of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5517.909">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5520.013">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5522.527">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5524.128">So,</a>  like my colleagues, I don't really like to hear a lot of the conspiratorial narratives, but I have a purely technical question about this that I hope that perhaps Councilor Scarpelli or somebody else could address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5539.039">If</a>  this information is already out there, I'd just like to know, are there any <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5545.277">particular</a>  papers or types of information that could be received with this resolution that could not be addressed with a simpler FOIA request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5560.164">Sorry,</a>  can you repeat that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5560.844">A</a>  what request?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5562.465">FOIA,</a>  Freedom of Information Act request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5564.586">So</a>  my question is, could somebody simply submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the mayor <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5573.259">to</a>  the city to get the information requested in this resolution? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5577.482">Or</a>  is the resolution asking for information that could not be gotten through a Freedom of Information Act request? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5586.187">It's</a>  just a technical question that I hope makes sense.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5595.372">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5595.853">I</a>  truly understand what he's saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5597.193">What</a>  I'm thinking, my take and the comment, the question is that why wouldn't someone put a FOIA in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5603.955">If</a>  that's the case, they could do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5605.215">I</a>  think he was asking if there's anything that a public records request wouldn't provide that this would provide.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5611.647">Maybe,</a>  but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5623.569">We</a>  would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested, just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5642.173">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5642.834">Any</a>  further comments? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5643.534">Councilor</a>  Levee?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5645.856">No,</a>  I just, I am just, uh, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5649.836">I</a>  guess my point was, first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5662.643">And</a>  also, just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there, could be just as an effective means <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5678.012">transparency.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5679.694">Um,</a>  obviously, that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5686.48">But</a>  that was that was what I was asking.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5691.504">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5691.804">There</a>  would be a shot clock on a public records request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5694.727">Technically,</a>  the mayor has no obligation to respond to our resolution, but that's the only difference I'm aware of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5700.872">Um,</a>  any further comments by members of the council? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5704.412">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5706.653">Name</a>  and address for the record at the podium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5708.214">Raise</a>  your hand on Zoom, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5710.436">You</a>  have to press the, just once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5712.677">That</a>  should be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5722.279">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5722.94">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5723.481">So</a>  that's some theory 61 stignero. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5725.944">I</a>  just wanted to make a general reminder to everyone that one of the basic principles that we learn in a civics education class, which is what stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5739.163">checks</a>  and balances or separation of powers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5742.124">There's</a>  absolutely no reason why I, you know, want to vote no on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5746.886">I</a>  strongly support voting yes, and I hope every member of the council does so as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5752.207">This</a>  is just like, even if this information is, you know, spread out and publicly somewhere else, I think it would be very helpful for members of the, for residents of Medford to basically see this in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5763.571">in</a>  a compiled report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5764.452">And</a>  as I said, it's about just checks and balances, as two Councilors here mentioned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5770.178">I</a>  don't see a reason to not do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5771.679">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5773.381">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5773.862">Name</a>  of the desk record, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5775.003">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5776.531">Steve</a>  South, 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5778.233">I</a>  just wanted to clarify a couple of the questions that were asked and comments that were made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5783.099">One</a>  is a FOIA request would not capture some lawsuits that are considered private until, or litigations I should say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5794.852">such</a>  as complaints with MCAD, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, which those complaints are private until they are decided or adjudicated or settled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5804.535">Then</a>  they become public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5805.635">I</a>  just want to point that out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5806.835">So</a>  there are things that would be captured by this item that would not be captured by a FOIA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5814.197">I</a>  just want to clarify a couple other things that <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5818.358">I'm</a>  trying to understand if several of the Councilors, including you, President Bears, were saying that the settlements that I mentioned never happened because I have copies of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5827.462">So</a>  I didn't understand if that's what you guys were saying, that it's not possible due to checks and balances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5833.966">Nobody</a>  said that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5834.986">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5835.766">I</a>  heard people saying that it would have to go through all checks and balances and money allocated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5842.008">These</a>  are settlements that, several of them happened that were never approved by the council and I came and spoke at that time and gave copies of the settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5850.97">I</a>  just want to point that out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5852.29">I</a>  also want to point out to one of the Councilors who said, you know, that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5857.651">something</a>  about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5858.471">I</a>  mentioned Sandra Gayle twice, and maybe it's exaggerated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5862.032">I</a>  just want to point out that the litigation that you approved out there in executive session for $47,500 was a complaint made by Teamsters Local 25 at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5877.315">That</a>  was settled a couple weeks ago during the middle of a trial. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5880.776">I</a>  believe you guys approved it today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5882.897">The</a>  other lawsuit- I can't comment on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5884.937">Yeah,</a>  that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5885.858">I'm</a>  commenting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5886.519">I</a>  know what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5887.5">It's</a>  47-5. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5888.401">You</a>  guys just approved it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5889.922">And</a>  the lawsuit that I gave to you guys in your packet, and I just want to point out to Councilor Lazzaro, this is a United States District Court <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5902.075">District</a>  of Massachusetts lawsuit for wage and hour violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5907.419">It's</a>  valued somewhere in the couple hundred thousand dollar range. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5910.601">So</a>  they're two separate litigations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5912.543">I</a>  just wanted to point that out, you know, as people are talking about exaggeration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5917.447">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5918.167">Appreciate</a>  your time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5921.489">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5922.67">Yeah,</a>  my point being, I think the comment was made, the words monopoly money were used. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5927.514">And</a>  the point was made that <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5930.405">an</a>  appropriation to pay for a settlement must be approved by the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5934.887">You</a>  may be well right that something was approved by the school department or something didn't come to the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5940.989">We</a>  had that discussion in the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5944.371">The</a>  money for that would have to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5946.872">So</a>  that's what I'm saying here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5948.572">There's</a>  been no appropriation requested by the mayor or made by this council to pay for <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5955.943">any</a>  sort of settlement sum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5957.904">And</a>  I'm just gonna leave it there, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5961.084">There's</a>  not monopoly money activity going on, it's just false.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5964.005">Many</a>  of the lawsuits, up until recently, you guys started approving them, many of them, and Councilor Scarpelli was here when I came up on previous years and handed out the settlements and the lawsuits, they were never approved by the council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5981.51">you</a>  guys and I appreciate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5983.17">That's</a>  not the point that's being made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5985.111">No,</a>  it's not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5986.031">The</a>  point that I'm making is that these settlements were approved within the confines of the budget as approved by the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5993.353">No</a>  additional money was asked to be appropriated from the mayor to the council to pay for these settlements.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=5998.134">We're</a>  not talking about additional money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6000.215">What</a>  we're talking about is when a lawsuit is settled for $500,000, you guys should approve it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6007.517">I'll</a>  leave it at that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6009.277">And</a>  yes, the point being that this council has never been asked to make an appropriation for money beyond the scope of the city budget for settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6017.102">That</a>  is a fact, and it is indisputable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6018.944">I'm</a>  not talking in circles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6020.765">You're</a>  saying there's all this extra money that we're being asked to spend on this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6023.867">I'm</a>  saying that this is not a right to tax payers' money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6027.389">You</a>  can get a lot of money because you own the house.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6030.932">Oh,</a>  Steve, you're a big man, aren't you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6036.494">No,</a>  I'm giggling about your obvious political attempt to malign the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6041.178">Steve,</a>  please stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6042.279">Steve,</a>  please stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6043.439">Please</a>  stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6044.921">And</a>  we are paying attention, but you're the one who doesn't know.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6048.584">Councilor</a>  Collins, you clearly have no clue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6053.207">Councilor</a>  Collins? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6056.33">I</a>  mean, I'm not the one making it a goof show here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6060.48">I'm</a>  just commenting, he's the one who's trying to, if we're gonna throw conspiracy theories around in the public forum, they will be combated by this chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6069.447">Thank</a>  you, Harry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6070.428">Council</a>  Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6073.57">I</a>  do wanna underline the point, which is reflected in city paperwork, most of which has already been reviewed by the council in public session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6082.136">If</a>  one of the points that this conversation is about is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6090.518">Is</a>  there secret money being spent on settlements that is not known to Councilors, that is not known to the public? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6096.7">I</a>  would offer an amendment or a B paper that this information, if it's provided by the administration, also include legal department, budget to actuals for this fiscal years that are being asked about so that we can, we don't have to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6111.318">I</a>  mean, I was gonna say we don't have to take it on faith, but it's all on the city website already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6114.139">We</a>  did just see it on paper in the packet that we will receive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6117.881">How</a>  much money was budgeted for the legal department and how much was spent?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6124.424">Yes,</a>  we do.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6125.085">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6125.525">Please</a>  stop disturbing the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6126.485">And</a>  with that, President Perez, I would move the question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6128.826">Are</a>  you asking for a beat paper?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6131.332">I</a>  would put that forward as an amendment if the councilor is open to it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6136.695">There's</a>  an amendment to include the budget to actuals for the law department, which of course has been in every city budget for all of those fiscal years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6144.66">Is</a>  that amendment acceptable, Councilor Scarpelli? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6152.305">We'd</a>  like to include as part of the report you're requesting that we get the budget to actuals, although we already have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6157.848">It's</a>  already in the Warren articles as well.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6163.927">We're</a>  seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6168.793">Anything</a>  over $2,500, we should be voting on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6172.723">When</a>  we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6177.465">These</a>  are the things that I want to show. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6179.085">I</a>  didn't say monopoly money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6181.046">What</a>  I'm saying is- I didn't say you did, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6182.627">Yeah,</a>  no, I'm saying it's real money, and it's taxpayers' money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6185.928">So</a>  that's why this resolution's come about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6187.669">Whether</a>  Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue, but I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6202.714">is,</a>  and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6208.095">We're</a>  seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6222.459">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6223.059">Anything</a>  to help? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6223.939">With</a>  the point of order?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6230.1">With</a>  my fellow councilors statement that this has maybe gone astray, I'd like to move the question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6236.388">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6238.111">If</a>  I may?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6238.811">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6239.532">I</a>  just want to note, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6242.488">I</a>  obviously strongly disagree that there's anything fraudulent going on, but my point with the, including the budget to actuals as context in this information is to illustrate, if we talk about managing money, what does that literally mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6253.457">Where</a>  the money comes from, where it goes, the budget to actuals, we don't have to talk about how much money is being spent and where does it come from, we can literally see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6260.563">And</a>  I don't see why that shouldn't be a part of the conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6262.565">And</a>  again, we do already have that information, but I think it makes sense to put all the context next to each other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6267.409">I'm</a>  gonna split your paper, George.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6272.452">There's</a>  a huge gaps in what's going on in this community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6275.175">So</a>  we can just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff, council president mentioned, let's talk about it because we talked about KP law and they came here during the budget season and openly said, we only spent $50,000 on KP law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6292.215">But</a>  using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up over almost $500,000. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6297.196">And</a>  that's not totally what was in other departments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6302.077">So</a>  there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6306.899">These</a>  are questions that I brought up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6308.539">These</a>  are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6314.34">We've</a>  asked for an audit to do this for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6316.221">We've</a>  asked for transparency and accountability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6319.201">This</a>  is the form that we're asking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6321.782">move</a>  to a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6323.483">Let's</a>  get the answers from the mayor's office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6325.484">Hopefully</a>  she does what she's supposed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6327.864">And</a>  like Councilor Leming said, that's a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6331.146">If</a>  she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a FOIA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6334.347">So</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6335.467">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6336.027">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6337.968">Motion</a>  by Councilor Collins to approve as amended, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6341.469">And</a>  I just want to go, you know, we can talk about whatever losing the thread. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6346.851">The</a>  thread is very clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6347.891">I</a>  have no issue asking the administration as one councilor to compile information that already exists in this way so that it is easy to understand it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6356.493">This</a>  council has never appropriated a dollar beyond the city budget for settlements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6362.215">And</a>  that narrative, I agree, not pushed by you, Councilor Scarpelli, but stated in this forum, is blatant misinformation and will be challenged. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6373.808">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6374.709">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6375.65">Kyle</a>  Heath, 131 Fulton Street Road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6377.852">I</a>  think we're getting a little lost here, too, about this just being about money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6384.089">One</a>  of the big things is why are people being treated in such this way that this money's being spent? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6390.356">Why</a>  is there lawsuit after lawsuit that people are winning? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6394.58">That's</a>  because of the administration in this city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6398.484">It's</a>  like George was saying, it's financial mismanagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6403.209">I</a>  can tell you a quick story about what happened just a few weeks ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6407.84">You</a>  know, we had arbitration a few weeks ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6409.902">We</a>  had a settlement done with the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6411.904">And</a>  after six or seven hours in court, the mayor decided, I changed my mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6417.169">I</a>  need to sleep on it more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6418.63">Let's</a>  set up another court date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6420.512">So</a>  after somebody goes and tells their family they just got the settlement and arbitration and they're getting this job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6428.005">The</a>  mayor changed her mind after a few hours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6430.467">And</a>  now after spending $2,400 that day, we're going back to court again for another $24 from the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6436.252">So</a>  it's almost five grand just to spend on court with one case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6441.216">The</a>  financial mismanagement is just unbelievable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6444.579">But</a>  why is this happening? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6447.461">Why</a>  is the city treating its workers in such a way that this is happening? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6452.425">I</a>  don't understand it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6453.326">I</a>  just don't get why. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6455.909">No</a>  one's bringing that up with, it's not just money with these lawsuits, it's how are they getting away with the cost of all treating people like this, the workforce that work every single day out there for the city, no matter what, understaffed and this lawsuit after lawsuit that we're winning and winning and winning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6473.625">And</a>  I think that needs to be looked into. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6477.695">I</a>  don't know, you know, I don't want to say it, but I think one of the reasons is the way you just spoke to the public and how you're speaking up there, calling it a clown show and everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6487.19">You're</a>  making comments and not allowing anyone here to make any comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6489.934">I</a>  think that's part of it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6491.036">Do</a>  you just note two minutes of comments, Kyle? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6493.359">I</a>  allow everyone to make their comments, but I'm just saying that what you just said, I agree with you 100%, and my three terms on this council, we have been diligent about asking these questions, but we have no formal authority to manage anyone.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6504.227">We</a>  have- That's perfectly fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6505.268">You're</a>  supposed to be in control of this hall.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6507.389">I</a>  am in control of this hall, and you're just interrupting me.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6509.33">You're</a>  in control of the hall, but you're calling it a clown show of comments under your breath. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6512.453">Everyone</a>  can hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6513.433">I'm</a>  aware. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6513.934">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6514.574">but</a>  that's the reason why they get away with it, is because you're doing it over here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6518.737">That's</a>  all I gotta say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6519.838">No,</a>  Kyle, again, you interrupted me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6521.239">I'd</a>  like to have a dialogue with you, but again, when people interrupt me and they don't allow me to have the dialogue, that's when it becomes out of control, and that's when we have these sessions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6528.684">Now,</a>  can I make the point that I was gonna make, and then I'll give the floor back to you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6531.306">Go</a>  for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6532.126">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6533.267">The</a>  thing we all agree on behind this council and behind this rail is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6538.0">We'd</a>  like to see the figures presented in a certain way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6540.502">And</a>  I think all of us have raised questions about the workplace culture and the management of the city in many different aspects, many different departments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6549.447">That's</a>  something we all share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6551.664">when</a>  that gets mixed into a political narrative about overrides and what happens in public meetings and not liking the outcomes of certain city council votes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6562.733">And</a>  you just said that we're understaffed, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6564.474">I</a>  support an override because we've been understaffed and I think we need more money to get out of understaffing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6569.318">I</a>  don't think even if everything that was just said happened in every lawsuit that Mr. South just presented to us and everything else, if all that money happened and went out the door for settlements tomorrow, it still wouldn't be reliable recurring revenue to pay people in the long term to address the city's financial issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6584.925">So</a>  when that <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6586.686">True</a>  thing that I'm saying, it's just statistical fact that the city budget gets lumped in with the settlements and gets politicized around revenue and overrides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6594.271">That's</a>  when we have a disagreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6595.892">That's</a>  when people start yelling from the crowd and breaking the quorum. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6600.095">And</a>  that's when I lose patience with that narrative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6603.397">So</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6604.478">I</a>  have those questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6605.579">I</a>  share those concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6606.719">I</a>  raised them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6607.66">I</a>  raised them when I was sitting there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6608.881">I</a>  try to raise them when I'm sitting here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6610.762">I</a>  don't think anyone would say that I'm <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6613.824">their</a>  best friend of this administration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6615.585">I</a>  try to work with them collaboratively because that's what the job of government is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6619.227">When</a>  the narratives start getting spun up in a certain way to politicize things and attack other things that aren't related to these fundamental factual questions, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6627.083">What</a>  are you gonna do?</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6628.024">What</a>  are you gonna do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6628.704">We</a>  can talk all we want up here, but what are we doing about it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6631.366">As</a>  Mr. Seltz just mentioned, we're going back just four years of this going on, and nothing's been changed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6638.411">We're</a>  looking at a city charter change right now.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6641.213">But</a>  this isn't just financial. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6642.514">It's</a>  been four years of lawsuits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6644.415">What's</a>  being changed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6646.237">Look</a>  at this administration and say, why are you guys treating the employees this way? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6648.999">What's</a>  being done about it?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6650.059">We</a>  have been exercising our, how many resolutions have we passed on legal issues, George? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6655.567">5,</a>  6, 7, 8, 10, Steve was talking about all the meetings he's come and given the report.</p>

    <p>[Kyle Heath]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6660.53">I</a>  haven't seen any changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6662.451">Well,</a>  I haven't seen anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6663.992">I</a>  haven't actually seen one of you guys come down with DPW. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6666.093">I</a>  didn't even talk to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6667.554">What's</a>  the limit of our authority, Kyle? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6670.235">I'm</a>  not sure, I'd like to know if you can come down to the DW and say hello once in a while too, that'd be nice to see how we're actually doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6676.419">We'd</a>  love to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6677.4">Come</a>  on down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6677.881">Give</a>  us a call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6678.641">It'd</a>  be nice to see you guys, to show that everyone actually cares about us, because we're not getting there right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6682.684">We</a>  do, we'd love to come down, we'd love to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6685.346">I've</a>  been there five years, I haven't seen anyone but Mr. Scott Bailey.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6687.968">I've</a>  been down there, but I'm sorry I missed you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6690.49">I'm</a>  there all the time, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6691.811">Well,</a>  maybe you miss me, but I've been down to the building.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6694.733">Oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6695.433">Thank</a>  you, but in any case, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6698.949">My</a>  point being, I don't disagree with what you're saying when it gets wrapped up in all this other stuff, that's the division. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6704.71">So</a>  I'm not wrapping it up in anything and I will continue not to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6707.911">And</a>  I hope that we can have, I appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6711.132">And</a>  I hope that we can continue to have meetings where we have a respectful dialogue like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6714.793">Thank</a>  you, instead of yelling from the crowd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6717.813">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6721.194">On</a>  a motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Collins to approve the motion as amended, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=6727.04">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council or members of the public?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7234.204">Thank</a>  you, President Collins. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7236.586">The</a>  resolution is relatively self-explanatory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7239.188">There</a>  are five statewide questions and three local ballot questions on the ballot for November 5th, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7244.953">This</a>  is question four, certified by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, which would legalize certain, decriminalize, I should say, certain <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7254.198">psychedelic</a>  substances that have been shown in clinical studies to help address mental health issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7260.504">The</a>  decriminalization of these has occurred in other places, and it has helped, gone a long way to helping a lot of folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7267.851">I</a>  personally have spoken to a number of advocates, including veterans who would like to see these options provided to them where current other pharmaceutical <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7279.635">items</a>  in medicines have not been helpful to address their mental health challenges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7284.977">And</a>  again, this is a limited decriminalization of certain substances that have been seen in clinical studies and by the FDA to be really helpful in addressing serious mental health challenges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7296.84">So</a>  I'm hopeful that the voters will approve in November, but also I'm hopeful that the council will endorse this question as well.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7307.007">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7307.827">Any</a>  further comment from members of the council? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7313.149">I</a>  have a motion to approve from Councilor Tsengh. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7315.009">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7315.81">Seconded</a>  by President Bears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7318.59">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7321.631">Castagnetti</a>  Andrew, Cushing Street, East Method Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7327.173">Through</a>  the Chair and over the table, I'd like to address to Councilor Bears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7337.226">Totally,</a>  I'm 99.9 behind Councilor Bears on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7344.171">I</a>  think it's great, because this country has really neglected to study alternative medicines for the longest time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7353.597">For</a>  example, cannabis, it took them 85 years to legalize it, only after they could figure out a way to tax it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7365.53">Let's</a>  call the diamond a diamond and a club a club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7368.491">They</a>  figure out a way to tax it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7370.992">Now</a>  on this psilocybin, I'm hearing really good stories. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7376.613">It's</a>  helping people with the PTSD, depression, anxiety. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7380.675">This</a>  could be a natural God's sin. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7384.296">If</a>  you don't believe in God, a natural nature's sin that could help a lot of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7392.355">And</a>  this should have been done a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7395.016">I</a>  believe Harvard Professor Timothy Leary, back in 1960, was experimenting with lysergic acid, and this government should have been right on it, not to lock him up, but to look at the different parts of psilocybin, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7412.501">I</a>  commend you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7414.822">Let's</a>  get it through, no matter what they say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7418.543">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7421.524">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7423.466">I</a>  have a hand from Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7427.95">Thank</a>  you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7431.493">So</a>  I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two... <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7445.921">The</a>  advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7451.588">There</a>  were two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7454.913">There</a>  were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7462.272">One</a>  group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use, and it would be less regulated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7475.255">The</a>  other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7491.54">body,</a>  an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7507.19">It</a>  turns it into a for-profit industry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7513.695">I</a>  will be supporting it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7516.056">I</a>  think that <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7518.45">Any</a>  progress is good, although I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7534.405">So</a>  thank you once again for your efforts.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7825.134">Gaston</a>  Fiore 61, Stigney Road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7826.634">I</a>  just wanted to say that I'm appalled at the lack of definitive information that was given regarding the September 3rd <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7838.028">state</a>  primary or state representative for the 35th Middlesex District. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7843.83">There's</a>  no Republican candidate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7845.11">There's</a>  no libertarian candidate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7846.371">There's</a>  only three candidates in the Democratic ballot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7850.972">As</a>  such, the primary is the definitive election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7855.114">And</a>  I would have hoped that this body would have stated that immediately and in a very definitive manner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7861.516">Everyone</a>  should get out and vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7864.182">on</a>  the September 3rd primary, because that's going to determine the person that then goes into the general election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7869.563">In</a>  the general election, there's only one person you can vote for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7871.944">So</a>  the September 3rd state primary is the election that everyone should vote for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7877.105">And</a>  the other thing that I'm appalled that there wasn't more definitive answer to is that I'm here at the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William and Frances Baldwin website, and I think it was Consuelo Escarpilla that brought up what happens <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7892.169">if</a>  someone is registered as a Republican or a Libertarian and <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7898.195">wants</a>  to go and vote in the September 3rd state primary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7902.716">And</a>  I think they wouldn't be able to do so because you have to register it as a Democrat or an enrolled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7908.277">And</a>  it says here, voting registration deadlines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7910.998">The</a>  deadline to register to vote, update your registration, or change your party is 10 days before any election or town meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7919.699">So</a>  if I go to my calendar, where is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7922.74">I</a>  think that puts it on the 24th, which is a Saturday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7927.161">anyone</a>  that is registered as either a Republican or a Libertarian needs to change their party affiliation to either Democratic or Unenrolled by Friday, August 23rd, according to what this website says, because otherwise you're not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7945.514">And</a>  I would hope that this body would definitively state that, because it's extremely important, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7952.879">And</a>  I'm not sure that everyone understands that if they are registered as either Republican or Libertarian, that they know that they are not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7964.643">So,</a>  anyways, I just wanted to state that, you know, I'm appalled and disappointed, to be honest, that I think, you know, I would have hoped that this information was clear and absolutely clear, and there's absolutely no doubt about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7978.392">Oh,</a>  would you like it to say, like, two candidates go from September 30th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7981.814">No,</a>  no, no, no, it's just one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7982.915">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7983.375">That</a>  was corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7984.596">Sorry?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7985.036">I</a>  did correct that.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7986.593">Yeah,</a>  I know, but it wasn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7988.013">And</a>  then about, again, what happens if someone is registered as a party, that wasn't clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7993.175">I</a>  think they need to change their party affiliation 10 days before any election. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7997.977">That's</a>  the registration deadline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=7999.417">Yes,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8000.298">Otherwise,</a>  they're not going to be able to vote.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8003.419">I</a>  appreciate you making the comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8005.619">As</a>  an elected body, we <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8008.817">Once</a>  you start going down that road, you go into the road not just of advising people how to access information, but suggesting a course of action. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8016.139">And</a>  I don't believe it is the, that any, you know, the city is, if you call the elections office and you say, how do I do this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8021.76">They'll</a>  tell you how to do it, but they're not going to say everyone really should do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8025.501">And</a>  that's, that's gets to the point of influencing people toward the direction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8029.062">It's</a>  different than providing information.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8030.442">No,</a>  but what direction? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8031.484">It's</a>  just that anyone that wants to vote, in order to vote in the primary, is going to have to be either registered... I agree.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8037.954">I'm</a>  talking about the other piece of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8039.376">Which</a>  one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8040.158">A</a>  well-organized Republican write-in candidate could conceivably win the November general election.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8045.345">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8046.405">I'm</a>  just saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8048.046">I</a>  agree that on its face, it's not going to happen, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8051.227">But</a>  it's not the job.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8052.327">It's</a>  completely unbiased and not political. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8055.388">The</a>  election to Odom is September 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8057.488">And</a>  in order to vote, you need to be able to take as a democrat, to run and vote, which means that if you are a Democrat, you need to take as a Democrat.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8062.27">I</a>  don't want to go that route. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8063.11">But</a>  to say the election is this day, and what happens in November doesn't matter, that gets down the road of suggesting a course of action.</p>

    <p>[Gaston Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8069.132">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8069.852">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8073.921">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public in person at the podium or on Zoom?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8083.391">Just</a>  want to make sure, seeing no hands on Zoom, seeing no one at the podium, the public participation is closed.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8089.251">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-08-13-24&start=8089.491">I</a>  would motion to take from the table and approve for third reading 24421.</p>
