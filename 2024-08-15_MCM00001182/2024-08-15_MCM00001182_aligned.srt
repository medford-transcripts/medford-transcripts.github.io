Henry Malone and our member Aaron DiBenedetto to share anything they'd like to share about this call for election for our state primary on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2024.

250
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:57,055
Well, actually, you did such a good job, Mr. President.

251
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:05,202
I don't think I have anything to add to it, except when we get to the one, we'll talk about it, which is the same thing.

252
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:06,423
Perfect, we're taking that next.

253
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:10,106
Any questions for Elections Commission on the call to election?

254
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,148
Councilor Sayeed.

255
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,352
This is more about the voting locations.

256
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:25,279
I know, Henry, you and I worked a lot a few months ago on getting the Waukland Court polling location open for our residents around there.

257
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,563
I see on this form that we have Waukland Court again.

258
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,506
Do we know if that's true for the November election?

259
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,467
Is it the same building as it usually is?

260
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:36,709
For the entire year, we probably will have to

261
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:45,037
find another location in 2025, but we got lucky since February, we have it September and November.

262
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:45,517
Great.

263
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:49,759
I'm so happy that our hard work is continuing to work out there.

264
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,159
When we work together, we produce things.

265
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,380
That's so true.

266
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,120
Great.

267
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,761
And I am talking to Director Driscoll about some stuff around that too.

268
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,362
I'll inform the council if it becomes relevant.

269
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,726
and the president, also Scott Crowley.

270
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:05,427
Thank you very much.

271
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:17,435
I know that you've worked very hard on this, but a lot of people have still reached out saying they just don't know, since we've moved some places around, they were curious how they can really know where they're supposed to vote.

272
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:26,842
Is there a number or an office that I can direct them to and that we can maybe send something out publicly?

273
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:37,147
I don't think there's much changes as far as, you know, election is concerned in Medford.

274
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,010
We've been voting at the same location.

275
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,155
The only time we've seen a change was when we come up with what, 6-2A.

276
00:16:48,678 --> 00:17:03,873
and what seven to eight and some of the people get displaced but that's been about something like three cycle of election I'm sure they have it additionally one of the thing we're trying we're working with the communication director is to send a message

277
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:08,237
to the community, telling them where to vote.

278
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:11,860
On top of it, if they have an issue, call the election department.

279
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,340
Okay.

280
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:27,130
That's a great idea, if we can get like a robo-call to those residents to say, don't forget your new location, or, to a lot of people, it's funny, because conversations I had, we have a big state, State Representative Donato has a big,

281
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,792
big race coming up in September, September 3rd.

282
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:36,756
And a lot of people are really coming back out that haven't voted since the last presidential race.

283
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,497
So that's where the questions arose.

284
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,499
And I appreciate that, if we can get that word out.

285
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,599
And I think the other thing was,

286
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:50,208
that with that race, is it district, Middlesex district?

287
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:50,208
35.

288
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:53,550
35, what is it?

289
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:00,733
We really, I think the other question is that people don't know that September is the election.

290
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:06,036
There is no November with this race, because there isn't a Republican, correct?

291
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:06,556
There will be.

292
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:11,739
No, to the chair, the one in September is a state primary.

293
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,202
see you referring to the 35th.

294
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:22,126
The other sex has three people on the ballot.

295
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:24,528
So it's going to be reduced to two.

296
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,530
And the two will be in November.

297
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,671
So the two will go in November.

298
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:32,394
Now that's confusing because we were told that

299
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:47,135
the three candidates running on the democratic ticket that the winner that comes out of that race is the winner there's a partisan primary and there's a partisan primary there's a democratic primary there's three candidates yeah yeah

300
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,978
You have, that's what you have.

301
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:54,580
The first one, because what it is, you can only have at the general, two people.

302
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,501
Well, that's for Municipal Henry.

303
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,862
In this case, it'll be one.

304
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:04,824
It will be, that one will be the only person, just like you see for 23rd.

305
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:12,488
Right now, we have Gavile, who's not unopposed, only his name, but he's still sure on the primary.

306
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:12,868
Right.

307
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,049
Right, no, I understand that.

308
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:21,473
But I think people think that let's skip the primary and we'll vote in November.

309
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,895
In November, there'll be no race.

310
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:27,277
There'll be the candidate that came out of the primary.

311
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:30,820
I think we should generally avoid going down this road.

312
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,182
But yes, there will be one candidate on the ballot in November for the Democratic Party.

313
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:35,503
Right.

314
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:40,146
And there's no candidate running, I believe, for the Republican nomination.

315
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:40,906
OK.

316
00:19:42,227 --> 00:20:01,129
so that's that's where the confusion because if they're the same party whoever wins is the one that move forward all right so and that's why i think that this is something that educating our voters and getting something out part of that part of that 3-1-1 is making them understand that there is no republican uh

317
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,931
party running in this race.

318
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:10,294
So in essence, the winner that comes out of the Democratic primary will be our representative.

319
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:14,016
So we have to, it is very confusing as you just saw.

320
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:25,302
So it would be imperative that maybe we, as a form of a motion, we ask the election department and the mayor and the city administration

321
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:35,632
share a robocall throughout that district, those districts that are affected that they understand that November is really just ceremonial.

322
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:41,158
It's not the actual election for that race is the third of September.

323
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

324
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:45,623
I don't know that we can

325
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:57,483
We could do a V-paper to communicate to the public that there's an election coming up and that they can contact the elections department, 781-393-2491.

326
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:08,414
Or they can go online wheredoivotema.com to find out who their representative, what district they're in, their polling location.

327
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:17,483
If I can, Mr. President, this is what's terrible about not having a city solicitor, because I think this is a message that truly needs to be detailed.

328
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,906
I think it's very political.

329
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:23,449
Well, it's for all three candidates, not political.

330
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,833
It's to make sure that everybody knows for all three candidates,

331
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:36,018
that you have a constituent that's going to vote for one of the three candidates, and they assume that they're in the assumption that we'll just vote in November.

332
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:39,420
But the truth of the matter is not understanding the processes.

333
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,464
We just saw that letting them know that September is truly the election for this seat.

334
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:54,670
And I don't think it's, I'm not saying one party or the other, I'm saying for all three parties that are running for that seat should be given the respect

335
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,152
and the effort by this body to ask if we can do that.

336
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,294
Now, again, like I said, if we had a city solicitor, it'd be very simple.

337
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:09,898
We'd say, let's make reference to city solicitor, let's do that, let's send it off as a B paper, and we'll get to that when we can.

338
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:13,840
But having it stop right now, I think it's not right.

339
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,540
It's not right.

340
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,860
All right.

341
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,281
Yeah, it's fine.

342
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,982
I'm just, what's the text of the B paper?

343
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:32,966
We would like the elections department in the mayor's office to work with a robocall and other messaging, whatever other messaging possible to reach that district that is voting in the, once again, sorry, District 30.

344
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,747
The 35th Middlesex.

345
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:35,508
35th Middlesex.

346
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:53,522
the state representative, we have three candidates to educate those voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that position.

347
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,625
Does that make sense, Mr. Clerk?

348
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,627
I know that you're very good at fixing my mistakes, so.

349
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:17,694
I'm going to read this back, Councilor Scarpelli, because I'm still... Sure, I know, but...

350
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:28,440
The fee paper is to ask the elections department and the mayor's office to do a robocall and whatever other means possible regarding the 35th Middlesex- Quiet, please.

351
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,541
I'm sorry, I can't hear.

352
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:40,209
Regarding the possible 35th Middlesex District to educate these voters on the importance of that race being the final representation of that election.

353
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,190
The September 3rd race.

354
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,611
The September 3rd race.

355
00:23:44,432 --> 00:23:47,234
The September primary being the- Yes.

356
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:47,674
Right, yes.

357
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:48,375
Good, thank you.

358
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:51,239
Thank you.

359
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,460
Vice President Collins.

360
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:57,182
Thank you, President Burris.

361
00:23:57,262 --> 00:24:08,626
As a similar alternative, I know that the Election Commission is working pretty much year-round to publicize upcoming elections and not just make sure that people know the dates on the calendars and where to go, but to do things like motor drives.

362
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:19,716
I would offer at the point that we're asking the Elections Commission to add another layer to redouble their existing efforts to make sure that people know when to get out and vote.

363
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:25,441
I would say, you know, there's a primary on September 3rd, not just on the 35 Middlesex.

364
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:30,526
You know, I'd ask maybe we can just extend that to incorporate all voters within the city of Medford.

365
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,527
I think everybody

366
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:41,753
more people, you know, that we would think can always use a reminder about when to vote and that goes for everybody within the city for September 3rd as well as for the November election this year.

367
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:50,498
So I'd offer as an alternative, you know, I would certainly support any efforts to make sure that people know and have that date circled on their calendar and, you know, not just one district, but citywide.

368
00:24:51,339 --> 00:25:01,985
So if we could, if you consider an amendment to have that just be a citywide effort at the point that we're going through the effort of a robocall at all, I'm sure that many voters across the community would benefit from it.

369
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:17,726
Vice President Collins, if I could, just for our clarity, you requested to amend the paper that this be a citywide robocall to remind, and other outreach to remind people of where to vote when the election is occurring?

370
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:19,588
Yes, for the September 3rd.

371
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,249
For the September 3rd state primary.

372
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,690
Through the chair.

373
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:24,672
One second, Henry.

374
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:25,813
Councilor Sang.

375
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,255
I was just gonna ask, is that an amendment or a B paper?

376
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,536
This is already a B paper.

377
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:30,577
This is an amendment to the B paper.

378
00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:31,498
Amendment to, okay.

379
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:31,758
Yeah.

380
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:43,418
We thought prior to September 3rd, we have to realize that we have the early voting that takes place from the 24th to the 30th.

381
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:45,540
So that is coming out.

382
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,484
It's not listed on any of the papers in front of you.

383
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,627
In addition to that, we also have

384
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,373
listed last day to register.

385
00:25:56,893 --> 00:26:02,637
If you don't register on time, you cannot vote on state primaries on the 3rd.

386
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:04,118
We have that coming.

387
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:09,401
It's not on the paper in front of you, because this is not what we're here for tonight.

388
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:16,025
We also have the last day to request a vote by mail ballot.

389
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:20,228
So all this information coming down the pipe

390
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:25,370
to inform citizens of the city when they can vote prior to September 3rd.

391
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,551
Great, thank you.

392
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,071
And on September 3rd.

393
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:35,995
If folks contact the Elections Department, they can find out more about the early voting at City Hall, as well as the mail-out balloting in addition to voting on Election Day.

394
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:36,475
That's correct.

395
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:37,195
September 3rd.

396
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:37,696
Got it.

397
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,016
Thank you.

398
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:46,220
If I can, Mr. President, another point with that, if I'm right, if I'm correct or wrong, I know that if there isn't a Republican candidate that

399
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:56,429
a registered Republican can't, what is it, they report to the elections office to ask to, is it unenrolled so they can vote in that election?

400
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:58,933
Is that possible?

401
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:01,234
I don't know.

402
00:27:01,674 --> 00:27:08,037
An unenrolled have the ability to choose a time of voting which party to vote for.

403
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:08,817
That's the only one.

404
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,739
Because they're not affiliated.

405
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,359
They can come.

406
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:17,081
If they're voting for the three parties, they can say, who are you voting for?

407
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:18,442
How do you want to vote today?

408
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:22,023
They say, well, I want to vote as a Democrat.

409
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,125
So that's important that people that don't have a candidate

410
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:37,293
in this district that are registered Republicans can come to the elections office and ask to be unenrolled so they can vote as a Democrat?

411
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:40,875
That's a technical question.

412
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:42,796
Yeah, so that's something if we can ask to.

413
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,077
That's something I can explore.

414
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,878
That was a question that was brought up to us by.

415
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,459
I'll get back to you on that one.

416
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,120
I don't want to give you the wrong answer.

417
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,683
Because once you, you have a window.

418
00:27:54,125 --> 00:28:01,529
If the window to UN enroll, you can come tomorrow and say, well, I want to change to this body.

419
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,590
It can be done.

420
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,631
As long as it's not that one.

421
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:05,032
Exactly.

422
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:05,532
All right.

423
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,652
Thank you.

424
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:08,674
Thank you.

425
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,815
There's a motion on the floor as amended.

426
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:16,358
If the amendment is accepted, I believe it now reads, could you read it back, Mr. Clerk?

427
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:32,765
Mr. President, Collins has asked for a date certain citywide robocall, um, and other outreach to remind voters where to vote for the September 3rd primary election.

428
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:35,883
All right, so then that's the amendment.

429
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,805
Do you accept the amendment?

430
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,426
Yeah, that's good.

431
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:47,772
All right, so on the motion, the B paper is to request citywide roll call to remind everyone where and how to vote in the September 3rd primary.

432
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:52,135
Councilor Scott Kelly seconded by Vice President Collins.

433
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:53,216
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

434
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,101
On the B paper.

435
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,261
Councilor Callahan.

436
00:29:00,462 --> 00:29:00,602
Yes.

437
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:03,489
Vice President Collins?

438
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:03,769
Yes.

439
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:05,670
Councilor Lozano?

440
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,030
Yes.

441
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:06,931
Councilor Fleming?

442
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:08,252
Yes.

443
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:10,093
Councilor Scarpelli?

444
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:10,714
Yes.

445
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:12,034
Councilor Sanchez?

446
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:12,315
Yes.

447
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:13,255
Councilor Behrs?

448
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:13,596
Yes.

449
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:23,122
On the main paper, the call to election, motion to approve by, sorry, it's been a while now, was it by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

450
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:24,083
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

451
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:49,883
on the main paper.

452
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:50,684
Councilor Callaghan?

453
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:51,124
Yes.

454
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:52,805
Vice President Collins?

455
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,325
Yes.

456
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:54,646
Councilor Lozaro?

457
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:55,106
Yes.

458
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:56,167
Councilor Lemming?

459
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:57,127
Yes.

460
00:29:58,248 --> 00:29:59,008
Councilor Scarpelli?

461
00:29:59,268 --> 00:29:59,528
Yes.

462
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,709
Councilor San Buenaventura?

463
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:02,010
Yes.

464
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,430
Vice President Behrs?

465
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:03,590
Yes.

466
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,432
Senator Fevella, the negative motion passes.

467
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:07,732
24-4-5-4, make an election law in September 2024.

468
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:14,879
Warrant for the Medford September 2024 state primaries election to the residents of the city of Medford, Massachusetts.

469
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,461
Greetings in the name of the Commonwealth.

470
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:21,648
You are hereby required to notify and warn the inhabitants of said city or town who are qualified to vote in elections to vote at.

471
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,270
I've already gone through this.

472
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,394
on Tuesday, the third day of September 2024 from 7 a.m.

473
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:31,476
to 8 p.m.

474
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:37,501
for the following purpose to cast their votes in the state primary election for the candidates of the political parties in the following offices.

475
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:43,567
Senator in Congress for the Commonwealth, Representative in Congress, 5th District, Councilor, 6th District,

476
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:55,134
as a governor's counselor, State Senator, 2nd Middlesex District, State Representative, 23rd, 34th, and 35th Middlesex District, Clerk of Courts, Middlesex County, Register of Deeds, Middlesex Southern District.

477
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:59,197
Given into our hands this 13th day of August 2024, the Medford City Council.

478
00:31:02,718 --> 00:31:04,559
You already read all the location.

479
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:09,160
The only thing we're seeking here is to have this warrant legally.

480
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,681
We're seeking signature of the council members.

481
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:18,322
Everybody have to sign it, but we have a deadline to get it done.

482
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,323
That's the reason we're in front of you today, so we can meet our deadline.

483
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:24,443
Do you have a copy that you want us to sign?

484
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,744
Could you come behind the rail and have us sign it?

485
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:31,745
We're down Larry today, so he would do that, but thank you, Aaron.

486
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:39,351
We do have Councilor Lemming remotely.

487
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:46,716
If he's here in the state, just like I did last year.

488
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,498
You'll find him.

489
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:49,719
If you're six of us, it's fine.

490
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,801
If I get six, I'll go with it, but if I get seven, it's better.

491
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:53,922
All right, thank you.

492
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:07,870
All right, on the motion by Councilor Sang, seconded by Council Vice President, was that you, Councilor Lazzaro?

493
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:12,293
That's Councilor Vice President Collins to accept the warrant and introduce signatures.

494
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,074
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

495
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,560
Councilor Callahan?

496
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:22,840
Yes.

497
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,321
Vice President Collins?

498
00:32:24,962 --> 00:32:25,802
Councilor Lazzaro?

499
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:27,783
Yes.

500
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,364
Councilor Lemming?

501
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:30,045
Yes.

502
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:34,188
Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sanz, President Barras.

503
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:37,991
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

504
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:44,518
24449 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, and if I may request a motion to join, I have a similar resolution.

505
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,200
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

506
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,542
24449, be it resolved.

507
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:51,704
Thanks, Aaron.

508
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,407
This is thinner paper than I was expecting.

509
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:00,492
Thanks.

510
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:01,816
Thanks, guys.

511
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:07,849
Um, be it resolved that the City Council discuss continued concerns dealing with road infestation in our community.

512
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:16,471
Be it further resolved that we request a meeting with the Health Department and City Administration to schedule a strategic planning meeting dealing with a serious health concern across the City of Medford.

513
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:31,775
And then I also have, uh, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Health Department undertake additional efforts in partnership with Tufts Medicine and the City of Malden to provide significant additional road control to mitigate the impact of construction at the former Malden Hospital site on the neighboring community.

514
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:32,415
Councillor Scarpa.

515
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,137
Thank you, Mr. President.

516
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:42,805
I know that I appreciate Council President bringing his resolution forward, but in the past

517
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:53,722
Past week and a half, we've been getting multiple phone calls from the residents in the Fulton Heights area, which is odd for rodent infestation, considering we live in a ledge.

518
00:33:55,702 --> 00:34:02,465
And you don't have, you know, too many business districts in that area that promote rodents.

519
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:11,429
But we're seeing that over the last few years, we've tried, we've talked, I know the director of the health department has made efforts to try to

520
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:16,268
stymie the road infestation issues.

521
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:30,175
We've even moved to put in ordinances that allow us to go onto private property if we see nesting and try to do, we have to do more.

522
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,856
I know that I've had a few phone calls.

523
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:36,278
I know that the curbside composting is a great initiative.

524
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:43,726
But you're seeing the fear that even though they can't open the lid, they're eating through the bottom.

525
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:51,515
So there are questions that I think as we move forward that we need to now get more in depth.

526
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,919
You see neighborhood communities

527
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:13,948
put together subcommittees and special task force that work directly with professionals from local colleges and local pest control companies and try to find different avenues to stop or slow this process down.

528
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:18,090
I think that, I know that my motion would be Mr. President,

529
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:30,503
is that we would convene a meeting with the health department, the mayor's office, the inspectional services, and the DPW to try to craft a task force.

530
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:33,706
I know Boston's calling it the rodent czar.

531
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:48,337
I think that Medford has to do something more to figure out the process in stopping this huge health scare that's growing across the community.

532
00:35:49,178 --> 00:35:55,963
And I think that what we're seeing is the different

533
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,652
different forms of control.

534
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:08,277
I think that some of them at one time worked to feed the catch basins to make sure that the rodents couldn't reproduce.

535
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:18,604
It wasn't the fact that they were horribly destroying rats all over the community, but they were making sure that they were stopping so they couldn't reproduce.

536
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:23,628
So there's gotta be something more being done other than calling the health department,

537
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:36,930
which, by the way, we don't have enough staff to service the needs that we have right now, to then call the exterminator to come out to put bait boxes down and leave, it's not working.

538
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,292
So my recommendation is that we move forward.

539
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:44,837
I know that it's the work that we've done, the Council President's done with a few members of the,

540
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:50,141
the community with Tufts Medical in that area, but it's just not that area.

541
00:36:50,562 --> 00:37:02,612
I think it's time that now that we have Tufts involved in this area, well, let's come together, let's pull everybody together, and let's find a solution for the whole community, and how we can attack this problem, because it's only gonna get worse.

542
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:03,893
So, thank you.

543
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:05,354
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

544
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:06,255
Vice President Collins.

545
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:15,332
I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli as well as President Burris for bringing this forward and for being so responsive to, you know, really just the latest wave of resident outreach about this.

546
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,154
And I think Councilor Scarpelli is exactly right.

547
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:36,264
You know, I think that the city has been working hard with the available tools to try to stem the tide of increasing rat populations over the past several years, but it's always seemed to me that our approach is, you know, fundamentally reactive and everybody can see with their eyes, you know, that that isn't doing enough.

548
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:48,997
I think that the idea of a task force is potentially a great idea because there have been so many disparate approaches either tried already in the city or things that have been floated.

549
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,999
I think it'd be great to collect some of the

550
00:37:52,660 --> 00:38:10,704
topics of discussion from the Solid Waste Task Force, which I was a member of a couple of years ago, and talking about how can we make sure that our evolving trash and compost receptacles are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, which is something that they are getting better and better at being rodent-proof, but it's important to share that information with the community whenever we can.

551
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:19,346
I know that there's a lot of pioneering rodent innovations going on in neighboring cities that we hear about time to time from residents.

552
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,707
One, because they seem more effective than just

553
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:29,834
sending somebody out when we get that latest call about where it's getting especially bad, and because we do want to mitigate the effects on other members of the ecosystem.

554
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:37,420
And I think that we're all aware that, you know, just putting out a lot of rat poison is really harmful to the other animals that we do treasure in Medford.

555
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:45,047
So everything takes resources, you know, investing in the right tools and the right systems to really attack this, but

556
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:50,710
It's not going to get better without these major institutions pitching in to help us have a more systemic approach.

557
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,092
So I would absolutely support this.

558
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,273
I thank my fellow councilors for bringing it forward.

559
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:57,814
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

560
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:58,435
Councilor Sang.

561
00:38:59,311 --> 00:38:59,711
Thank you.

562
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:06,636
I wanted to thank both Councillor Scarpelli and President Beres for the resolutions on this.

563
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:14,022
I think we all know that this is a really important issue for public health, for quality of living here in Medford.

564
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:17,764
It's, as Councillor Scarpelli said, it's not just Fulton Heights.

565
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:24,367
But this happening in Fulton Heights is particularly concerning because it's not a place that's used to this.

566
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:32,430
South Medford and Wellington have been particularly hit hard by the rodent infestation over the last few years.

567
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,572
Now, anecdotally talking to neighbors, some of the methods we have employed seem to have been working.

568
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:43,894
There is a slight decrease anecdotally talking to my neighbors about this.

569
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:46,915
However, rodents are still there.

570
00:39:47,735 --> 00:40:01,542
I think it's really important to note that we did hold a Committee of the Whole on this a few months ago, where we had a long conversation with the Director of the Board of Health about methods that we could employ to combat this.

571
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:04,724
this problem.

572
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:11,710
Now, Councillor Collins has alluded to the public education piece, which really has to be a very, very big part of it.

573
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,513
That message was reinforced over and over again at that meeting.

574
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:27,422
It would be lovely to get this resolution passed, to sit down with the Director of the Board of Health and other stakeholders to get an update on those strategies, to see how we're doing,

575
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:32,347
are there, what are the metrics that we're using to measure and how are we doing on those metrics?

576
00:40:32,948 --> 00:40:36,712
I think it's also really important to note that the council has been working really hard on this.

577
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:46,744
We have a resolution coming to our, an ordinance coming to our next meeting about wildlife feeding, reduce, basically,

578
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,009
regulating that so that we're discouraging rodent behavior.

579
00:40:53,432 --> 00:41:03,525
Past councils have also passed ordinances tackling rodent infestations as well, which city staff have reported back with metrics showing that they have been useful.

580
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:05,735
Thank you.

581
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,237
Any further comment by members of the council?

582
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:14,186
I'll go and then we can go to members of the public, but I just wanted to note specifically around the Malden Hospital site.

583
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:20,253
I want to thank David Tedisco, who sent around a number of emails, has been organizing his neighborhood.

584
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:24,015
communicating around this issue with the City of Medford and the City of Malden.

585
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:35,117
Tufts Medicine at the former Malden Hospital site is responsible for rodent mitigation, and it is on Malden land, and so they have been very responsive.

586
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:37,738
Tufts Medicine has made it clear they know they need to do more.

587
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:47,580
Mayor Christensen as well, and also Director O'Connor, Mayor Longo-Kern have been involved in some of those discussions as well to bring whatever resources we can to bear from the Medford side.

588
00:41:48,681 --> 00:42:01,031
Thank you, Councilor Sang for noting the rodent control ordinance that we passed, the solid waste ordinance, which really is going to help focus on reducing rodent populations in the commercial areas with the combined

589
00:42:03,502 --> 00:42:22,216
dumpster, for lack of a better word, in the private hauler program, which should really significantly improve both the efficiency and the requirements on the business districts and the businesses in those districts to keep their trash and waste away from rodents and to also centralize removal of it, which hopefully will help.

590
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:23,756
on a cost basis.

591
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:27,318
Um, I think the point is we're really well taken around funding and staff.

592
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:37,763
We've heard time and time again from our animal control health department, um, from every member of this council that there's not enough people, there's not enough money in the health department budget to effectively address this problem.

593
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:45,669
That's because the city does not have enough money to address almost any of our problems, and that is something that we're working on extensively.

594
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:47,130
So we need more funds.

595
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,830
We need more staff.

596
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,332
We know we can't get by with one animal control officer.

597
00:42:50,853 --> 00:42:53,174
We know we can't get by with only two sanitarians.

598
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,776
And that problem has been raised time and time again.

599
00:42:55,917 --> 00:43:06,204
You know, we're not even, I think, hitting a six-figure-a-year budget for rodent control right now, even though everyone in the city and everyone in this room acknowledges that we need to be spending significantly more on that.

600
00:43:07,966 --> 00:43:09,488
We do the best with what we have.

601
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:16,034
What we have is too little, and we need more funding for the city to effectively provide services such as road control.

602
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,216
With that, I will go to the podium.

603
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,278
Name and address for the record, please.

604
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:21,580
And you have three minutes.

605
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:27,291
I'm Paulette Bartabedian, 27th Central Ave., Medford, Mass.

606
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:34,461
Just want to commend Vice President Collins on bringing up the environmental impact of the road in control.

607
00:43:34,602 --> 00:43:39,208
And I know that it's a huge problem everywhere, and I'm not

608
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:52,115
dismissing that, but I do hope that we as a city will look to other alternatives other than rodenticides, which are the worst, worst thing.

609
00:43:52,475 --> 00:44:04,542
It actually is counterproductive to rodent control because many of the wildlife and wild birds that use rats, mice, things like that as their meals are getting killed,

610
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:07,723
due to secondary rodenticide poisoning.

611
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:14,967
It also affects foxes, coyotes, other things that will feed on rodents, so it's really counterproductive.

612
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:17,709
You're killing the things that will kill the rats.

613
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:30,916
I did read that there is some population control drugs they're trying to use, and I just read that it's a fairly new process, I believe, that some of the

614
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:36,099
participants are saying that they're seeing more rats now than ever.

615
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:41,560
That just may be a small percentage that we're seeing.

616
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,260
It may not be the whole picture as of yet.

617
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:46,601
But again, it's a multifaceted problem.

618
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:57,444
Education, as Councilor Hang said, is I think the most important thing, is to have people, businesses, et cetera, take care of their garbage.

619
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:58,724
No food, no rats.

620
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,406
No food, no coyotes.

621
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:02,148
That's just common sense.

622
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:09,198
So please, as a whole, please try to avoid using rodenticides foremost amongst everything.

623
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:10,339
And thank you very much.

624
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:10,660
That's it.

625
00:45:11,323 --> 00:45:11,723
Thank you.

626
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:19,192
And I just wanted to note on that point, the new solid waste contract and the solid waste councils are can correct me if I'm wrong.

627
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:30,544
But I believe the new solid waste contract, because of how we can structured it with the State Department of Environmental Protection, we are receiving some funds specifically around an educational program around the solid waste.

628
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,827
So there should be more information going out to residents.

629
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:34,408
through that education program.

630
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:42,779
Now that is just limited to the trash, the recycling, the composting, funding for other stuff like the wildlife feeding, et cetera, would have to come from somewhere else.

631
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:45,342
Name and address for the record, please.

632
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,103
You have three minutes.

633
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,021
Hi, Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street.

634
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:56,845
I live in the hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer.

635
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:04,229
I personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive.

636
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:06,630
I think accountability has to come in play.

637
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:15,094
I think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground.

638
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:15,895
So people think,

639
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,660
and they live near food sources.

640
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:23,022
So gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water.

641
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:25,702
So they're gonna live near those things.

642
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:40,006
My question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way?

643
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:45,267
Like go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist,

644
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:51,369
fire station, have a meeting there, go with to the community and educate them in that way.

645
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:52,969
It has to be hands on.

646
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:59,932
And if you really communicate to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns.

647
00:47:00,332 --> 00:47:06,274
I think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online

648
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:16,481
and you really see the people that you are representing face-to-face and that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together.

649
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:22,623
They'll talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property.

650
00:47:22,983 --> 00:47:25,824
And that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents.

651
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:34,027
And that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself.

652
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,488
If you're elderly, get some help.

653
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:52,059
right but don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats that's one thing so the community piece the other piece is um wakling court is scheduled for demolition is there

654
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:58,455
a plan in place for the hillside area on rodents?

655
00:47:58,655 --> 00:47:59,876
Is that part of that?

656
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:01,979
How much money is allocated to that?

657
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,261
What are we doing?

658
00:48:03,301 --> 00:48:04,182
What are we planning?

659
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:08,067
Because I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that.

660
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:11,271
I know they'll reach out to the media community about

661
00:48:11,912 --> 00:48:16,396
like 400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area?

662
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:35,170
We need notification and we need notification about what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens, because everybody who's talking about it are worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and a rat this big walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon.

663
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,813
I won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out.

664
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:41,135
It's pretty bad when it's still sunny

665
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,474
and they're walking in front of me.

666
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:48,970
So I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed.

667
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:55,116
Thank you.

668
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:56,417
My time must be up.

669
00:48:56,837 --> 00:48:59,098
Apparently, I didn't realize it was going to play you off like that.

670
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:05,240
Zoom's getting a little snotty.

671
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,162
On the Waffling Court thing, there is a pest mitigation plan that is part of the Waffling Court project.

672
00:49:12,842 --> 00:49:16,624
The road and control ordinance that we passed, as well as some of the building code stuff that we've done,

673
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:24,272
And maybe zoning requires all major project construction to have integrated pest management plans as part of the ordinance.

674
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:27,035
And Director O'Connor can talk more about that.

675
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:29,477
It'd be on file with the Board of Health in her office.

676
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:35,364
And then I can also talk to Director Driscoll about trying to communicate out better that there is a plan to the residents.

677
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:35,925
Thank you.

678
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:36,605
Appreciate it.

679
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:36,886
Thanks.

680
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,760
Please, you have three minutes and I'm going to try to shut off.

681
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,760
Thank you for the time.

682
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,860
My name is Gavin Murphy.

683
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,301
I'm actually a Malden resident.

684
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,262
I'm here because I'm a contractor for the city of Medford with the Iraq problem.

685
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:54,843
I'm the guy that the health department calls when there's an issue in the neighborhood.

686
00:49:55,423 --> 00:50:01,645
I saw this on the agenda and I thought maybe I could pop in tonight and take a beating like a man if it's necessary.

687
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:15,291
I would like to let you know that next week, the New England Pest Management Association is putting on a training program for health inspectors, and the city of Memphis is sending three people to that training program.

688
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:26,116
I know when they go through their sanitation training, they do not get any specific rodent control or rodent identification training, so we're gonna try and correct that issue.

689
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:32,040
I do have seats available, although very few, if any city councilors wanna come over

690
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,063
see what rats look like up close and personal.

691
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:37,828
So I open that invitation up to each of you.

692
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,233
If you want to come, please just give me a call and I'll make a seat for you.

693
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:43,757
As far as what's going on in the city.

694
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:45,481
with rats.

695
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:57,664
I made a prediction two years ago at the National Pest Management Association Conference, it happened to be in Boston, and I was up speaking, and I do speak at different national level programs.

696
00:50:58,165 --> 00:51:05,787
I made a prediction, and nobody's gonna like this prediction, that within the next five to 10 years, rats are gonna become as common as squirrels, we're gonna accept them.

697
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:13,569
I just don't see us changing our habits as people that's gonna bring these rats under control.

698
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,732
Last moment said walking down the street, there's rats in front of her.

699
00:51:17,432 --> 00:51:19,294
I think it's gonna pretty much stay that way.

700
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,296
It's not a rodent problem.

701
00:51:21,497 --> 00:51:22,658
It's a people problem.

702
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:24,580
I see it in this very city.

703
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:33,209
I see it in every community in eastern Massachusetts that I walk in on a regular basis, that I walk into people's backyards and the garbage and the trash is just piled up.

704
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:35,636
and you can't get people to clean it up.

705
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:44,461
The conducive conditions are there, and I'm sure each of you have heard enough about this, and how do we get people to respond to that?

706
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:53,787
I watch my health inspectors go out there, and they work tirelessly to try and correct these issues, and I see them just get pushed back by people constantly.

707
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:55,408
I'm working on them doing this.

708
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:58,950
I know one site that I've been at for the last two years,

709
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:09,076
and your health inspectors try and be cooperative and work with people and educate and we're still dealing with rats at the same house and it's just not getting corrected.

710
00:52:09,477 --> 00:52:13,940
Other neighborhoods we go into and people work with your health inspectors and they work with us because

711
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:22,343
Your health department will pay me to go on their property and dispatch the animals using carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide directly right into the burrows.

712
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:23,804
And it works great.

713
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,806
And if we can get in there and they're going to correct their issues, we're going to do that.

714
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:29,167
I've seen some neighborhoods really change.

715
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:34,231
In other neighborhoods where we just have one person pushing back, it's just a constant pressure.

716
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:38,535
But the reason I came up was to invite anybody who would like to attend that meeting next week.

717
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:39,215
It's Wednesday.

718
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:41,377
I know everybody has real jobs.

719
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:42,719
And it's hard to do that.

720
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:43,660
It's a daytime thing.

721
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,541
If you want to try and make it, let me know.

722
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:48,424
And just let you know, you have three people coming to it.

723
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:50,927
And hopefully, they're going to come up with some new ideas of what to do.

724
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:52,508
What time on Wednesday?

725
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:54,088
It starts at 9 a.m.

726
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:57,990
in my office to get done about one o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:01,172
If you leave, I would ask you to leave your phone number with Emily.

728
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:03,413
We can pass it around to the council.

729
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,295
And I just want to thank you for coming down and sharing that information with us.

730
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:12,018
We do hear great things about folks who work with you when the city refers you out.

731
00:53:12,578 --> 00:53:16,020
But I think it's really helpful and sobering for us to hear what you're saying.

732
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,941
That's the experience that we've had issues.

733
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:19,622
We had some folks

734
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:44,697
I don't know, six months ago, maybe eight months ago, from the Hillside neighborhood on the other side from here and up by like Osgoode Street, talking about a couple of problem properties where we were trying to get code enforcement out there to address overgrowth and waste, and the city not having, essentially the private owners just being able to continue to get away with it to the public detriment.

735
00:53:44,977 --> 00:53:45,177
So,

736
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:48,679
You know, it is a really important issue.

737
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:51,621
But I do have a question from Councilor Callahan, if you don't mind.

738
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:52,242
Yes.

739
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:53,603
Thanks so much for coming.

740
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:55,004
It's great to have you here.

741
00:53:55,064 --> 00:54:03,970
I just wanted to see if you had any opinion on the topic that one of the previous speakers mentioned about poison versus population control.

742
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:05,355
about the what?

743
00:54:05,616 --> 00:54:07,677
Poison versus population control.

744
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:09,939
Poison versus population control.

745
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:11,980
I'm not sure I'm going to say the question.

746
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,340
I'm sorry.

747
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,921
The question is birth control?

748
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:14,622
Yes, exactly.

749
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:16,343
Poison versus birth control.

750
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:16,803
Okay.

751
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:19,425
It depends upon the type of poison that you're talking about.

752
00:54:20,026 --> 00:54:21,026
And birth control

753
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,408
hasn't proven itself yet.

754
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:25,709
We had it years ago.

755
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,170
We tried it, and it blew up in our face.

756
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:35,013
And then we had concerns about that getting into the water supply, infecting most mammals with birth control that we didn't want to affect.

757
00:54:35,413 --> 00:54:37,454
So that was taken off the market by the EPA.

758
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:45,297
So I mean, other poisons that we use, some things we use have no secondary poisonings.

759
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:46,638
Some do.

760
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:48,499
I don't think that we're actually hurting

761
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:53,893
Animals like we've been told that we've been hurting animals.

762
00:54:54,693 --> 00:55:04,257
For instance, MK in Arlington died of the bird flu, not of rodent poisoning, rodenticide poisoning, and things like that.

763
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:07,558
So I mean, can we cut back and things can change in the industry?

764
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,178
Absolutely.

765
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:14,240
And this training program we're doing is gonna really hit on that, on the alternatives and the best way to control the problem.

766
00:55:15,343 --> 00:55:20,525
And the carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, that's not, I mean, it's obviously deadly, but it's not a poison.

767
00:55:21,045 --> 00:55:22,566
Well, there's no secondary.

768
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:23,306
Okay.

769
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,567
Any other questions?

770
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:27,007
All right.

771
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:27,748
Thank you for your time.

772
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,668
Thank you for coming down.

773
00:55:28,748 --> 00:55:29,028
Yes.

774
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:33,390
Name and address for the record, please.

775
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:37,402
Hi, Melanie Tringali from 16 Forest Street, Method Mass.

776
00:55:38,223 --> 00:55:41,206
I just want to thank them for bringing this up again.

777
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:47,831
I have a property on Forest Street where I live and have been seeing rodent activities the first time I've seen it in five years.

778
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:52,295
And I also own a property that I lived in for 25 years at 2931 Stoughton Street and have never had

779
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,520
rat issues over by the hillside, but that is becoming an issue.

780
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:07,627
The Method Health Department was very responsive and coming out after my calls and people have come out and looked.

781
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:10,450
I do just want to say two things.

782
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,732
One, there's a huge health concern with rats.

783
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:22,032
A friend of mine's actual dog got liver disease from being in touch with rat urine.

784
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:27,916
So rat urine actually causes liver disease in animals.

785
00:56:27,936 --> 00:56:28,837
So that's an issue.

786
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:31,598
It can also cause a lot of issues with human contact as well.

787
00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:35,461
And two, you mentioned something about the trash.

788
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:41,385
Is trash being done, because I walked through Medford Square on Monday night,

789
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:43,652
And it is disgusting.

790
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:47,736
I don't even like walking through this square at all.

791
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:53,201
It's deplorable, the amount of trash that's not in any receptacles whatsoever.

792
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:57,604
They're just sitting in cardboard boxes and trash bags.

793
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,426
And I wanna be supportive of the businesses.

794
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:06,773
I think it's really important to have the businesses there, but I also think it doesn't put our city in good light and it also attracts all types of rodents.

795
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:09,638
Yes, I can give more context on that.

796
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:12,661
And again, if I get it wrong, please correct me.

797
00:57:13,922 --> 00:57:18,407
My understanding is that under prior trash contracts, there was kind of selective.

798
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:20,750
Some businesses were getting city pickup.

799
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,472
Some businesses were paying for private pickup.

800
00:57:22,532 --> 00:57:26,596
It was not really clear what the rhyme or reason was, but there was an equal treatment.

801
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:30,217
some condo buildings were getting city pickup, some were having to pay for private.

802
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:56,543
This contract straightens that out, A, from a pure fairness perspective, but it also, part of the ordinance that we passed establishes a private hauler program where there's essentially a preferred private hauler, which is the person that the city has, the group that the city has a contract with, and businesses or large residential buildings can sign up for a contract at a preferred rate with that hauler, because they're already in the community doing the public contract.

803
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:05,909
The idea is, and this contract just went into effect five weeks ago, six weeks ago, and I'm not sure when these provisions exactly start to kick in yet.

804
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,730
I think there's some grace period in there.

805
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:13,214
But the idea is that in the major squares, instead of having street

806
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:37,874
pick up with city stuff overnight, that there would be potentially areas of public parking lots or areas on private property where you might have all of the businesses for that building using a single dumpster or multiple dumpsters and then being part of this preferred hauler program to then be able to have the trash in a containment space that is subject to an integrated pest management plan and is rodent-proof.

807
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:41,697
Because, yeah, I mean, I worked at Rosa's when I was a kid here.

808
00:58:43,198 --> 00:58:44,180
Yeah, putting out the trash.

809
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:52,271
I mean, I put it out because that's what my boss told me to do, but I wasn't happy seeing the street lined and obviously one windstorm that night.

810
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:55,335
And we've seen that before in Medford Square and the trash is all over the square.

811
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,498
So that is the intent.

812
00:58:57,638 --> 00:59:00,402
Councilor Collins seems to have more information than me, so I will let her answer.

813
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:10,505
Not more, but just I think in terms of what, and I agree, I think that this was a lot of what was kind of negotiated while this new contract was being formed between the city side and waste management.

814
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:16,407
I think that a lot of the provisions and goals, since it just went into effect July 1, are probably still being formulated.

815
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:23,389
But I think in terms of what residents can expect to see, especially in the square specifically, is consolidation, because absolutely when you have

816
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:44,802
one business that has overflow trash cans on the sidewalk, and another that has a dumpster, and then the other one doesn't use that dumpster, they just have a receptacle, and the next one just has a bag that looks messy, and the more we can just keep everything in one container that really is solid and reinforced, hopefully that'll be one piece of the puzzle in getting trash off the streets, rats off the streets.

817
00:59:45,923 --> 00:59:47,124
And just one other thing.

818
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:49,625
I think the other big thing comes down to enforcement.

819
00:59:50,325 --> 01:00:00,030
Enforcing ordinances, and we've talked, this has been a subject matter for many city councils, but enforcing the ordinances is necessary.

820
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:11,455
And if we're not enforcing, it's also a good way to raise money, but if we're not enforcing the ordinances, then as the gentleman previously said, we won't be able to get any control of the rat population at all.

821
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:14,498
Yeah, one thing we're looking at is the fee and fine schedule.

822
01:00:14,538 --> 01:00:24,641
We've heard from our building commissioner right now that it actually costs more to add a new code enforcement officer because we're only charging certain rates than they're going to actually bring back in.

823
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:25,501
So it's cost negative.

824
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:28,522
Is there a way to make that more cost neutral, cost positive?

825
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:33,003
And you've heard a million times in this room, we don't have enough code enforcement, so I don't need to get into that.

826
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:35,435
Thank you very much.

827
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:39,360
Now address the record, please.

828
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:49,874
I just want to emphasize what was mentioned here by the pest control expert and the previous speaker that I think you keep complaining that you don't have financial resources, so a great way to address this.

829
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:52,335
is actually through fines.

830
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:56,716
And the advantage of that is it's also like a dynamic stream of revenue.

831
01:00:56,776 --> 01:01:03,438
So if you have a lot of rodent issues, and then you fine, fine, fine, fine, you get a lot of money, and then that helps you to address the problem.

832
01:01:04,538 --> 01:01:11,560
Because, you know, later on, then you have less rodent pressure, then you don't need as many staff in the health department.

833
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,621
So with the fine, it would allow you to just have a lot of resources when you actually need it.

834
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:20,182
And then the second thing that I wanted to emphasize that the pest control experts mentioned is that

835
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:22,923
individual responsibility.

836
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:27,045
I think everyone in the community should understand that they have a responsibility.

837
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:32,948
And in fact, they are the primary responsible party here to address this problem.

838
01:01:33,568 --> 01:01:36,210
And a lot comes to up to education.

839
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:39,752
And I think, you know, the city can play a role in that.

840
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:40,112
But

841
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:47,955
At the end of the day, it's each of us that can go online or get a book from the library and learn about this.

842
01:01:48,495 --> 01:01:58,439
And then if we just don't have an individual sense of responsibility, then, you know, probably as a pest control expert emphasized, then we're just going to live with rats rather than with squirrels.

843
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:04,862
So those two things, first, like, you know, individual responsibility, addressing the issue, being nice to your community.

844
01:02:04,902 --> 01:02:06,403
And then the second one is that actually

845
01:02:07,163 --> 01:02:15,532
enforcing fines and getting a lot of money from that, from businesses, as has been said, like, you know, why aren't they dealing with the trash in the proper way, right?

846
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:18,555
That's just not acceptable, so the city should go and get revenue from there.

847
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:19,216
Thank you very much.

848
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:21,678
Thank you, Jan, and I appreciate the comment.

849
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,561
One thing I think, when we pass the road control ordinance,

850
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:35,287
There's a state law around non-criminal disposition that limits the maximum amount of fines and how often you can do them, and I think that was one of the barriers for us in terms of using fines as a revenue source.

851
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:47,613
I think we wanted to see, I think it's a maximum of $300 per incident, and then you have to have a certain time period between incidents, and it's a barrier that we face because of the state law around that.

852
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:51,575
I don't know when the legislature will change it, but that would be helpful.

853
01:02:54,257 --> 01:02:54,397
Yes?

854
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,339
I'll let Roderick Beatty in part two.

855
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:10,029
If you assert fines to repeat offenders, such as one of them said that every time they go by this house, the dumpster's overloaded, overloaded.

856
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:19,576
So you find this landlord or owner and they don't correct it and you find them again and find them again, whatever the allotted period is.

857
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:21,538
Is it legal?

858
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:29,025
If I get a lot of speeding tickets, I'm not allowed to renew my license because I have these outstanding speeding tickets.

859
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:40,855
Is there anything that you can do to, this is going to be extreme, but put a lien on the house or something like that to make these people clean up their problem?

860
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:42,977
Because the only thing that really makes

861
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:47,186
humans do something is when it hurts them in the pocket.

862
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,949
And again, the only thing that's gonna correct this problem is humans by cleaning up their mess.

863
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:59,272
All these other loading controls are not gonna work if the food source is still there.

864
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:06,215
So my question is, how far can a fine go to make this workable?

865
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:06,955
Thank you.

866
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:09,571
Yeah, so I can answer partially.

867
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:16,335
So there is this state law that over overarches what cities and towns are able to do through a non-criminal disposition.

868
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:22,879
One thing we are trying, my first term, like I think basically the only thing I really was able to get done was we worked on a

869
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:25,421
the snow removal ordinance, updating the snow ordinance.

870
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:30,144
And one of the things we were trying to get done was looking into this.

871
01:04:30,604 --> 01:04:39,109
And when we passed that snow removal ordinance update, there is now a provision where if you have a repeat offender, you can put a lien on the property.

872
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:49,558
not just for the fine, which is still stuck at that 300 non-criminal disposition, but also we put in the ordinance the cost of removal of the smell.

873
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:57,464
So if the city has to send out city employees or contractors to clear the sidewalks, then there could be a lien placed.

874
01:04:58,525 --> 01:05:04,290
I don't think we've actually gotten to that point with any property yet since that ordinance was passed, so I don't know.

875
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:06,472
And then I think there is an open question as to

876
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:14,316
when that comes down the road, and we actually try to do it, and then someone sues and says, no, you can't do this, where are the courts gonna land on it?

877
01:05:14,596 --> 01:05:20,359
We passed it in the solicitor, it went through legal counsel, but we haven't tested it yet.

878
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:24,161
So we'll see, it's a litigious society out there these days.

879
01:05:25,915 --> 01:05:26,435
Councillor Saint.

880
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:29,878
I just wanted to quickly thank everyone for coming up and speaking about this.

881
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:34,781
I think everyone had something super productive to add to the conversation.

882
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:41,886
I think in the future, with this resolution passed, with more meetings about this, the more voices we can get, the more advice that we can get, I think.

883
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,788
will be able to make some positive progress on this.

884
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:59,876
I think Mr. Benedetto's statements actually reminded me of something I wanted to say, which is that I think we have to think in terms of our messaging and our strategy, we need to go in two new directions with this.

885
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:00,517
One is to

886
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:02,338
go more local.

887
01:06:03,558 --> 01:06:12,223
I know my own neighborhood held a road and control meeting, basically neighbors educating each other about the best ways to get rid of road and control.

888
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:21,228
Now that's something that should be less neighbors doing it and city coming in and city leaders coming in and helping organize those meetings.

889
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:24,950
So the local aspect is very, very important.

890
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,632
And as much as we can harness that organic momentum, the better.

891
01:06:28,112 --> 01:06:33,354
I think we also need to think bigger too and recognize that the road control problem is also a regional problem.

892
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:53,203
And so the more that we can do to set up institutions where counselors like us, city employees from Medford are working with city employees and counselors in neighboring municipalities to deal with projects that are on the border, I think the better we can serve our residents too.

893
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,845
So building those channels of communication I think will be really important.

894
01:06:58,998 --> 01:06:59,398
Thank you.

895
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:05,540
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to join and approve Papers 24449 and 24451.

896
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:06,820
Seconded by.

897
01:07:07,701 --> 01:07:09,021
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

898
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:10,241
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

899
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,083
Councilor Callahan.

900
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:14,423
Yes.

901
01:07:15,463 --> 01:07:16,163
Vice President Collins.

902
01:07:16,183 --> 01:07:16,263
Yes.

903
01:07:17,484 --> 01:07:18,124
Councilor Luzardo.

904
01:07:18,144 --> 01:07:18,204
Yes.

905
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:18,984
Councilor Levin.

906
01:07:25,586 --> 01:07:25,846
Yes.

907
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:28,487
Councilor Scarpelli.

908
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:29,663
Yes.

909
01:07:29,683 --> 01:07:30,224
Councilor San Buenaventura?

910
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:30,584
Yes.

911
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:31,445
President Paris?

912
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:31,865
Yes.

913
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:33,906
I move for non-negative motion passes.

914
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:38,269
Whereas good government is based on the fund, I'm sorry, 24450 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

915
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:42,411
Whereas good government is based on a foundation of openness, clarity, transparency, and accountability.

916
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:52,898
And whereas the city council, taxpayers, and residents of the city of Medford are intended to be made aware whenever the city resolves claims against the city, the school department, any employee, any department, department head, or employee of the city.

917
01:07:53,458 --> 01:08:01,460
by payment regardless of whether those claims are resolved prior to litigation, after litigation, but before trial, by way of judgment, or decision by a court or administrative or quasi-judicial body.

918
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:21,646
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Mayor provide the Council with a list of all such matters resolved during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further for each matter so resolved by payment, the Mayor report to the Council the name of each person, persons, or entity who made such claim and the amount paid to each such person, persons, or entity, if there is a legal reason that any such name should not be disclosed.

919
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:38,092
such as in the case of a minor, a general description of the claim without identifying the person will suffice, and further, for each matter so resolved by payment, the Mayor reports to the City Council the source of the money or funding that was used to pay the claim by specifying which city or school account that money was from, whether it was paid by an insurer of the city or meant for public schools.

920
01:08:38,372 --> 01:08:39,913
Further, that the Mayor reports to the Council

921
01:08:40,753 --> 01:09:05,508
the names and addresses of any insurers with whom the city or school department maintained a policy of insurance whose coverage was the source of payments used to pay any such claim during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025, and further, for each policy of insurance listed by the mayor in answering the request set forth in the previous paragraph that the mayor state the annual premiums paid for each insurance policy listed in the applicable deductibles for each year during fiscal years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024,

922
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:26,859
or 2025 and finally that the mayor provide the city council with a breakdown of all amounts paid to outside council for representing the city of Medford or the Metro Public Schools or any department department head or employee of the city of Medford for any claims made against the city as a municipality or the Metro Public Schools or any department department head or employee of the city of Medford during fiscal years 2021

923
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,042
2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, or 2025.

924
01:09:32,122 --> 01:09:40,925
This request includes payments made for any work performed on such claims to the compliment and page law firm, PB&R law firm, or to any other attorneys.

925
01:09:40,965 --> 01:09:41,905
Councilor Scarpelli.

926
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,566
Thank you, Council President.

927
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:56,751
If you allow me, over the past few years, I've heard many people talk about the legal claims or settlements or court judgments that have been paid by the city or school department for claims made against the city.

928
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:00,595
the school department or employees of the city or the schools.

929
01:10:02,137 --> 01:10:14,073
Yet many of these claims and settlements that have been mentioned have never come before this council, either for an appropriation of money for payment or just to inform us about the claims.

930
01:10:15,426 --> 01:10:24,049
Going back to a time even before I was on the council, I know that the council had to approve the expenditures of any amount that was over $2,500.

931
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:39,595
The purpose of this resolution is for the council to be made aware of the expenditures to settle or pay for various claims made against the city, the school, or any of our employees of the city or our schools.

932
01:10:40,535 --> 01:10:46,418
My motivation to bring this resolution forward is based on a very simple principle that I'm sure my colleagues can agree with.

933
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:53,643
That is, expenditures of the city revenue is always a matter of accountability, transparency, and good government.

934
01:10:54,403 --> 01:10:57,005
People deserve to know where municipal dollars are being spent.

935
01:10:57,865 --> 01:11:02,248
With this in mind, I ask for the support of my colleagues on this resolution.

936
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:06,491
Now, as we said tonight, I know that we mentioned just tonight, right?

937
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:09,293
We said we need more funding, right?

938
01:11:09,453 --> 01:11:10,314
We need more funding.

939
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,195
And we've seen

940
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:40,467
Over the last couple of months, we've seen a blatant financial mismanagement of our city's finances, as witnessed with the $9 million free cash that was recently certified, the lack of new growth in our community over the past four years, payments to outside council that we still have yet to find what the true numbers are, and lastly, the settlements that mostly are unfunded by the city leadership.

941
01:11:42,038 --> 01:11:52,975
So this is very important because it's another aspect that week after week we're coming forward and that we're seeing mismanagement of our city funds.

942
01:11:53,746 --> 01:12:04,268
Now, I get it, there are things that we can't talk about legally, and there are things that might go in an executive session to protect certain laws, and I get that.

943
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:09,449
But there is a lot of money, from what I've heard, from different department heads.

944
01:12:09,469 --> 01:12:14,050
Like we mentioned the other day, that city, you just go and speak to the department heads.

945
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,911
Well, the department heads aren't gonna tell you the truth, because they work for the mayor.

946
01:12:19,308 --> 01:12:28,772
So like I've said in the past, I've talked to rank and file members that have really shared with me some insight, and it's horrifying.

947
01:12:29,412 --> 01:12:39,757
It's frightening where we're looking at maybe five or $10,000 hit here or there with a legal issue, and we never hear anything about it.

948
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:53,149
So, I'm glad we have a representative here tonight because I have some questions that I was gonna leave as a resolution, but maybe you can help with, Mr. Salta.

949
01:12:53,169 --> 01:13:02,652
I know that as a representative of the teamsters and our employees here at the city, even the most simple things, an arbitration.

950
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:06,513
If an arbitration is heard, I'd like to know who pays for those arbitrations.

951
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:10,235
I'd like to know how the attorneys are paid, both sides.

952
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:13,435
not just the outcome, right?

953
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:27,247
Because we still haven't heard the outcome of many things, which we know to avoid the rumor mill, just to get this information from the mayor would be so important, just so we can understand.

954
01:13:28,297 --> 01:13:41,001
and we could share this with our public and saying, you know, hey, in the last couple of months, especially last month, we've seen some pretty disgusting processes and how we've run the finances in the city.

955
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:43,222
Okay, we've seen that.

956
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:53,426
It's public knowledge, but this is another aspect that I think needs to be opened so the community can see

957
01:13:55,924 --> 01:14:01,728
why we don't have the funding needed for extra help in the health department.

958
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:03,769
So thank you, Mr. President.

959
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:05,450
I appreciate the time.

960
01:14:06,371 --> 01:14:06,711
Thank you.

961
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,532
Do any other councilors have any questions?

962
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:20,600
Seeing none, I would just note that the council has not approved any appropriations beyond the city budget for settlements.

963
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,643
So settlements are being done within the appropriate amount of the city budget.

964
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:28,255
Members of the public would like to speak.

965
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:41,082
Yeah, if you leave it with, do you want us to review it now or do you want us to review it after the meeting?

966
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,904
Okay, thanks.

967
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:46,825
Okay.

968
01:14:57,837 --> 01:14:59,478
Name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.

969
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:07,600
Thank you.

970
01:15:11,602 --> 01:15:14,342
Thank you, President Behrs and members of the council.

971
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,724
I appreciate the- Steve, name and address.

972
01:15:17,964 --> 01:15:21,305
Oh, sorry, Steve South, 106 Damon Road, Medford, Mass.

973
01:15:21,345 --> 01:15:21,545
Okay.

974
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:27,410
Again, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli putting this item forward.

975
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:36,334
For the last four and a half years, I've been educating the three different councils about all the open litigation.

976
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:39,276
This all started a little over four years ago.

977
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:44,939
So when I saw this resolution, I thought it would be a good time to give you my yearly update.

978
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:50,441
So I did some research and found out some of the open litigations.

979
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:51,922
These are just lawsuits.

980
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:59,825
This doesn't include all the open labor charges with all the unions, arbitrations, mediations, fact finding, and other litigations.

981
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:02,386
So I just wanna take you through a couple of these briefly.

982
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:09,149
This was filed, I believe this is 2002, Allison Convoy versus City of Medford.

983
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:12,271
And I just wanna take you through a couple of accounts.

984
01:16:12,331 --> 01:16:14,892
Failure to pay FLSA overtime.

985
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:16,913
That's count one.

986
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,074
Failure to pay overtime for off-the-clock work.

987
01:16:21,134 --> 01:16:21,955
That's count two.

988
01:16:22,355 --> 01:16:26,356
Failure to pay overtime wages required under GL-149.

989
01:16:27,157 --> 01:16:32,118
Violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act by failure to make timely payment of earned wages.

990
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:34,219
So that's one lawsuit.

991
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,001
Another lawsuit, Alicia Nunley versus City of Medford.

992
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:43,123
Also, Breonna Lungo Kern, as well as David Rodriguez.

993
01:16:43,743 --> 01:16:45,845
and I'll just read you the opening.

994
01:16:46,625 --> 01:17:09,463
This is an action arising out of the wrongful acts and omissions of the defendants who engaged in discrimination and harassment against Alicia Nunley Benjamin in her employment as Chief Financial Officer slash Auditor Finance Director for the city of Medford, Massachusetts, based on race, color, and sex, and retaliated against her after she complained about the mistreatment.

995
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:15,577
Next is going to be, and these are all open, by the way, these are pending lawsuits.

996
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:25,784
Again, this is Superior Court, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Michael Durham versus City of Medford, Breonna Lungo Kern and Neil Osborne.

997
01:17:27,585 --> 01:17:28,746
Sorry, give me one second.

998
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:36,986
Okay, count one, discrimination based on disability.

999
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:42,267
Count two, violation of MGL-151B, retaliation.

1000
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:46,949
Count three, violation of MGL, the Massachusetts Whistleblower Act.

1001
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:55,711
Count four, this is against, individually against Breonna Lungo Kern, aiding and abetting discrimination and violation of MGL.

1002
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:58,091
Claims against- Steve, you have about 30 seconds.

1003
01:17:58,112 --> 01:17:59,472
Yep, Neil Osborne.

1004
01:18:02,248 --> 01:18:02,948
We move on.

1005
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:06,490
Next, Sandra Gail versus city of Medford.

1006
01:18:06,851 --> 01:18:17,837
Next, there's a bunch of inspectors versus city of Medford next is there's about 50 dpw employees versus the city of Medford next I want to go to settlements.

1007
01:18:18,217 --> 01:18:18,797
2022, 30 school custodians, $495,000.

1008
01:18:18,857 --> 01:18:19,297
2023, school security, $28,500.

1009
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:20,338
June of 2024, a member of the DPW, $265,000.

1010
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:22,178
2024, you just settled it out in the hall today, $47,500 for another member.

1011
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,719
2024, Medford DPW pending settlement.

1012
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:25,160
It's gonna be signed sometime very soon.

1013
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:49,509
2024 Samari Montes, you guys took it up outside.

1014
01:18:49,970 --> 01:19:08,441
I also want to point out that while the city is paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in settlements and are actually there's much more liability and maybe in the millions that the city council is approving two raises for itself as well as all the other non-union.

1015
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:15,122
three raises for the Medford mayor, Brianna Lungo-Kern, that goes into effect July 1.

1016
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:19,603
That's one for the school committee and two raises for the mayor.

1017
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:35,667
And all the while, the city still has many employees under collective bargaining agreements that haven't had a raise in years, including police patrolmen, police superiors, recreation department, DPW superintendents, inspectors, and others.

1018
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:37,647
And- Steve, you're a minute over.

1019
01:19:37,927 --> 01:19:40,348
Yeah, I just I just I'm almost done.

1020
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:41,348
I got two more points.

1021
01:19:41,488 --> 01:19:41,788
Okay.

1022
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:56,414
I also want to point out that the city is spending many hundreds of thousands on KP law again, while all these other things are pending when they could hire a city solicitor, but they choose not to by leaving the wages so low.

1023
01:19:56,754 --> 01:20:02,136
And lastly, I want to point out what the city is treating the taxpayer dollars as monopoly money.

1024
01:20:02,476 --> 01:20:07,078
You're asking for multiple prop two and a half overrides in November over seven

1025
01:20:07,478 --> 01:20:08,498
and a half million dollars.

1026
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:08,958
Thank you.

1027
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:09,319
Thank you.

1028
01:20:09,379 --> 01:20:10,839
That was two minutes over.

1029
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:12,740
Awesome.

1030
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:14,540
Thank you.

1031
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:15,780
You're welcome.

1032
01:20:17,241 --> 01:20:24,823
On that note, again, we have not appropriated a single dollar above the budgeted appropriated amount for any settlement.

1033
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:27,004
So there's not a monopoly money approach here.

1034
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:29,585
Steve, I'm sorry, but you know, you can't.

1035
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:37,363
Right, and they've been paid for by appropriated funds.

1036
01:20:37,403 --> 01:20:42,746
There's no additional funding, magic money, wasted money that's going to these things beyond what is approved in the city budget.

1037
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,912
The city council, Steve, I'm not gonna get into a back and forth with you.

1038
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,574
The city council has to approve all appropriations.

1039
01:20:55,654 --> 01:20:56,194
It's the law.

1040
01:20:56,234 --> 01:21:00,817
The city council has not been asked to appropriate a single dollar beyond the budget for legal settlements.

1041
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:06,790
Well, I would, good luck.

1042
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:10,552
Any questions on the resolution?

1043
01:21:11,652 --> 01:21:13,173
Councilor Collins.

1044
01:21:15,315 --> 01:21:17,556
I don't have a question on the resolution specifically.

1045
01:21:17,596 --> 01:21:19,077
I thank the Councilor for bringing it forward.

1046
01:21:19,277 --> 01:21:19,797
I think that,

1047
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:29,452
I think that a lot of what we've heard in terms of premises for this conversation, I have an honest disagreement with.

1048
01:21:30,072 --> 01:21:39,817
At the same time, I think that there's a lot of ways for us to have really productive conversations about settlements and liabilities before the city.

1049
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,859
These sometimes occur in public session.

1050
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:45,179
These sometimes occur in executive session.

1051
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:53,522
Anytime we are getting more information from the administration as opposed to less when it comes to the city side of things, we have no jurisdiction over the schools.

1052
01:21:53,902 --> 01:21:54,863
I think that is a good thing.

1053
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:57,084
I think that always leaves us better off.

1054
01:21:57,184 --> 01:22:08,547
That often leaves the atmosphere more productive and collaborative than it was when we were feeling under-informed prior to, you know, whether it's a meeting or a memo or just a substantive update.

1055
01:22:11,168 --> 01:22:27,587
I think for myself, I feel, I think, across many issues we've all had the experience of feeling under informed on various issues and then we get that bolus of information it's like wow, now we can really have a conversation about this, that leaves me feeling pretty open and flexible when it comes to what type of

1056
01:22:28,147 --> 01:22:33,974
format or venue we receive information about settlements and liabilities in going forward.

1057
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:39,680
This, like a lot of our resolutions, when it comes to making resolutions to the administration, they are essentially requests.

1058
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:48,169
We cannot compel reports or requests to be filled by the administration just because of the nature of the way our government is set up.

1059
01:22:49,893 --> 01:23:08,782
That being said, I hope that the administration takes this request for more information in the best faith possible to say it is better for us when we put our issues out on the table and we're able to have these conversations when there's fewer surprises.

1060
01:23:13,538 --> 01:23:18,941
I think that there's a lot of cliche ways to put this, but I think that we're better when fewer things are in the dark.

1061
01:23:19,181 --> 01:23:32,568
I think that it's better to shine a light on things that people are hearing about than to have to speculate until kind of a belated information.

1062
01:23:33,289 --> 01:23:33,929
So that being said,

1063
01:23:36,235 --> 01:23:37,496
more information is always better.

1064
01:23:37,536 --> 01:23:40,177
I know that a lot of this is very sensitive, like we saw earlier today.

1065
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:42,379
A lot of this has to be discussed in executive session.

1066
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:50,023
Some of it, you know, there's some litigations, there's some settlements that always come to the council as a matter of course, we saw that earlier this evening.

1067
01:23:50,043 --> 01:23:55,507
I always wanna correct the record when it comes to what information, you know, the city council does get.

1068
01:23:56,267 --> 01:23:58,549
Certain settlements do come before us, we do appropriate.

1069
01:23:59,889 --> 01:24:04,672
You know, I wouldn't want to put forward a request and also forward the,

1070
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:15,147
story that we're in this complete and total information desert in the same way that I wouldn't want it to go by.

1071
01:24:17,973 --> 01:24:22,215
unusual number for free cash is in some way evidence of financial mismanagement.

1072
01:24:22,676 --> 01:24:23,116
It's not.

1073
01:24:24,377 --> 01:24:29,280
We know from communities across the street that this was a banner year for free cash surpluses for many communities.

1074
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:40,226
But in the same way, I don't think that we should need to treat settlements and liabilities like something that we cannot talk about and we cannot ask about.

1075
01:24:40,906 --> 01:24:45,289
I think to the extent that we are able to have a freer flow of information about this with the administration.

1076
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:57,226
leave us better off, leave us better able to communicate with the community when there are concerns, be able to say, this is what it really is, you know, and help us dial in on what our real problems are.

1077
01:24:57,246 --> 01:24:58,428
Thank you.

1078
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:01,840
Thank you, Councilor Scarpa and then Councilor Seng.

1079
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:03,920
Thank you, Mr. President.

1080
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:08,162
I agree with my councilors.

1081
01:25:08,802 --> 01:25:21,787
This is a simple request that, again, through transparency, accountability, have the mayor present to us what I've requested, and I think it's a simple, it eliminates that outside talk, but then again, it shows

1082
01:25:22,547 --> 01:25:30,592
If it's something that the community, the taxpayers in this community need to identify that this could be an issue, then it's their right.

1083
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:33,514
So I welcome your support.

1084
01:25:33,554 --> 01:25:46,383
I think that, I know Councilor Villes said whatever we budget is appropriate and whatever that is, but when you look at the numbers, just as Mr. Sealth just presented, there's some numbers in there that I don't remember going in that room and approving.

1085
01:25:46,823 --> 01:26:01,842
So again, this is why we asked, I put this motion forward to ask the mayor for detailed answers in, you know, redacting names or whatnot, but actually showing us that these are real stories.

1086
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,424
These are real lawsuits.

1087
01:26:04,783 --> 01:26:06,645
what's already been settled are real.

1088
01:26:07,325 --> 01:26:10,408
A lot of those aren't private anymore, they're public record.

1089
01:26:10,828 --> 01:26:14,872
So I would ask the mayor to present to us that fact.

1090
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:21,137
And when I say mismanagement, when you hear these stories, and whether they're fact or not, let's see if they're fact.

1091
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:25,300
If they're fact, then we can discuss something else that's very important.

1092
01:26:25,601 --> 01:26:28,883
And that's what we're paying for our

1093
01:26:31,205 --> 01:26:34,408
our insurance, our premiums for our settlements, right?

1094
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:36,209
How, what does that increase?

1095
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:36,910
What have we paid?

1096
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:40,873
You know, when we say mismanaging $9 million, it's a matter of opinion.

1097
01:26:40,933 --> 01:26:55,504
My opinion and the people that I've spoke with, when you are in crisis, fiscal crisis, and you're calling with a financial task force to come out to call for an override, but then just a week later ask,

1098
01:26:56,645 --> 01:27:12,224
express that we just we just certify nine million dollars that's nine million dollars of taxpayers money that wasn't used properly so in definition to myself whether you want to take it or not it's fiscal mismanagement you do not manage

1099
01:27:12,885 --> 01:27:16,649
that money responsibly, and that's the taxpayer's money.

1100
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:28,439
So, yeah, there are a lot of things that have come up in the last couple of weeks that we need clarity as we move forward with the agenda presented by my council colleagues and the mayor to see

1101
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,365
where we're going, what direction this community is going, how we got there, and how we don't get there ever again.

1102
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:35,987
There's a lot of questions.

1103
01:27:36,027 --> 01:27:36,888
This is just a piece.

1104
01:27:36,948 --> 01:27:43,376
That's all I'm asking, is to support the resolution, let the mayor present the information that's needed, and we can move forward.

1105
01:27:43,656 --> 01:27:43,936
Thank you.

1106
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:47,391
Councilor Sang and then Councilor Kellyanne.

1107
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:48,132
Thank you.

1108
01:27:49,052 --> 01:27:51,414
You know, I like Vice President Collins.

1109
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:59,760
I disagree with a lot of the premises put out there and to the best effort of Councilors to get me to vote no on this, I do intend to vote yes on this.

1110
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:02,562
You know,

1111
01:28:03,503 --> 01:28:08,305
I do believe that the text of the resolution that's in front of us is what we have to debate.

1112
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:11,325
And I agree with what's being said in the resolution.

1113
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:13,226
I agree with greater transparency.

1114
01:28:13,346 --> 01:28:24,029
I think it's good when we as the City Council have more oversight over these issues, when we are much more to know about these issues, when we can inform our residents about what's going on.

1115
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:34,036
any motion that I think, any motion or resolution that reasonably increases transparency in our community is something that I would support.

1116
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:35,577
And so I do plan on voting yes on this.

1117
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:38,039
Councilor Calderon.

1118
01:28:38,059 --> 01:28:40,321
I plan to vote in favor.

1119
01:28:41,642 --> 01:28:41,962
Thanks.

1120
01:28:42,243 --> 01:28:43,744
Any further comments from members of council?

1121
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:50,923
I'll just say for one counselor, the text of the resolution, I don't have a problem with it.

1122
01:28:51,444 --> 01:28:55,308
It's answers that already exist and could be compiled into a report, I would guess.

1123
01:28:55,368 --> 01:29:01,355
We've seen them in the Warren articles and we've seen them in reports previously, and I'd like to see them all in one place.

1124
01:29:01,395 --> 01:29:04,017
And I think we've said so many times here, it'd be nice to see it all.

1125
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,720
No problem with the text of the resolution.

1126
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:19,857
but the narrative and the arguments being put forth underlying the resolution to try to tie it into some larger accusation, it's just spurious, it's just not real.

1127
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:30,144
The facts of the matter are this council has never been asked to appropriate additional money for settlements and legal services since I've been on this council, which includes all these fiscal years.

1128
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:34,668
I haven't seen a million dollar end of year transfer to the legal budget because of all these settlements.

1129
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:36,949
That has to happen legally.

1130
01:29:37,549 --> 01:29:45,834
There's about six different checks and balances on it from the finance director to the state division of local services and the Department of Revenue to the mayor to this body.

1131
01:29:45,854 --> 01:29:54,880
That if that was happening, they'd have to go through all these, there'd have to be such a massive conspiracy going all the way up to the state level to the commissioner of revenue for that to be true.

1132
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:57,585
that it's not true.

1133
01:29:58,006 --> 01:30:00,286
So I'm perfectly fine asking the questions.

1134
01:30:00,326 --> 01:30:01,307
I'm gonna vote yes on it.

1135
01:30:02,067 --> 01:30:09,130
But the idea that this fits some sort of larger narrative or example of something that's going on about malfeasance is just false.

1136
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:15,012
The number of people who would have to be involved in it intentionally is not possible.

1137
01:30:15,232 --> 01:30:21,835
And I think as everyone knows here, it would involve people who strongly disagree with each other, somehow colluding.

1138
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:25,697
I disagree strongly with Mayor Longo Kern on a number of substantive issues.

1139
01:30:26,717 --> 01:30:29,921
I disagree with her on some of the management style in this building.

1140
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:34,827
I am not, you know, it's just not possible.

1141
01:30:35,948 --> 01:30:43,697
So I have no problem answering, asking the questions, but when we try to tie it into this larger thing, it's just plainly political.

1142
01:30:44,658 --> 01:30:45,318
Councilor Lazaro.

1143
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:55,137
I would agree with what president bears was saying, and I would like to additionally point out that I think that a report would be great to see.

1144
01:30:55,157 --> 01:31:02,883
I think that the checks and balances that exist at the state level and at the that the city wouldn't have been able to, um,

1145
01:31:04,825 --> 01:31:10,454
access the funds to pay out legal fees and things like this.

1146
01:31:11,235 --> 01:31:15,621
There are blocks in the way of that happening without our knowledge.

1147
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:19,487
So, for example, some of the things that Mr. South mentioned,

1148
01:31:19,847 --> 01:31:27,729
he just said them a couple of times and there was one, it was just one, like Mrs. Gayle's case, he said it two times.

1149
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:35,251
That was, you know, it's, we have the things that are here and we are, I would be happy to see them all listed out.

1150
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:36,071
I think that would be great.

1151
01:31:37,411 --> 01:31:48,214
I also think that conflating what we're talking about here with other votes that we're taking about raises for people who work in City Hall or other

1152
01:31:50,155 --> 01:31:57,889
elements of the operations of the city that are unrelated, I think is unfair and unreasonable and not what we're talking about.

1153
01:31:57,909 --> 01:31:59,252
Thank you.

1154
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:00,875
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1155
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:04,108
Thank you, Council President.

1156
01:32:04,128 --> 01:32:18,518
So, like my colleagues, I don't really like to hear a lot of the conspiratorial narratives, but I have a purely technical question about this that I hope that perhaps Councilor Scarpelli or somebody else could address.

1157
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,102
If this information is already out there, I'd just like to know, are there any

1158
01:32:25,277 --> 01:32:37,023
particular papers or types of information that could be received with this resolution that could not be addressed with a simpler FOIA request.

1159
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:40,804
Sorry, can you repeat that?

1160
01:32:40,844 --> 01:32:41,565
A what request?

1161
01:32:42,465 --> 01:32:44,546
FOIA, Freedom of Information Act request.

1162
01:32:44,586 --> 01:32:51,169
So my question is, could somebody simply submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the mayor

1163
01:32:53,259 --> 01:32:57,462
to the city to get the information requested in this resolution?

1164
01:32:57,482 --> 01:33:06,147
Or is the resolution asking for information that could not be gotten through a Freedom of Information Act request?

1165
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:13,032
It's just a technical question that I hope makes sense.

1166
01:33:15,372 --> 01:33:15,773
I don't know.

1167
01:33:15,853 --> 01:33:17,153
I truly understand what he's saying.

1168
01:33:17,193 --> 01:33:23,835
What I'm thinking, my take and the comment, the question is that why wouldn't someone put a FOIA in?

1169
01:33:23,955 --> 01:33:25,195
If that's the case, they could do that.

1170
01:33:25,215 --> 01:33:30,397
I think he was asking if there's anything that a public records request wouldn't provide that this would provide.

1171
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:43,169
Maybe, but as the governing body, is a governing body that it's my responsibility that if I have a question, why would I have someone else put a FOIA request in?

1172
01:33:43,569 --> 01:34:00,993
We would ask the city, we would ask the mayor for, as I've done with the resolution, with hopefully with the support of the council, that the mayor gets us the information that I requested, just to show the answer to the questions under transparency and accountability.

1173
01:34:02,173 --> 01:34:02,614
Thank you.

1174
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:03,514
Any further comments?

1175
01:34:03,534 --> 01:34:04,155
Councilor Levee?

1176
01:34:05,856 --> 01:34:08,258
No, I just, I am just, uh,

1177
01:34:09,836 --> 01:34:21,603
I guess my point was, first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request.

1178
01:34:22,643 --> 01:34:37,212
And also, just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there, could be just as an effective means

1179
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:38,933
transparency.

1180
01:34:39,694 --> 01:34:46,439
Um, obviously, that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received.

1181
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,621
But that was that was what I was asking.

1182
01:34:51,504 --> 01:34:51,784
Thank you.

1183
01:34:51,804 --> 01:34:54,567
There would be a shot clock on a public records request.

1184
01:34:54,727 --> 01:35:00,031
Technically, the mayor has no obligation to respond to our resolution, but that's the only difference I'm aware of.

1185
01:35:00,872 --> 01:35:02,534
Um, any further comments by members of the council?

1186
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:06,633
Seeing none, we'll go to the public.

1187
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:08,154
Name and address for the record at the podium.

1188
01:35:08,214 --> 01:35:09,995
Raise your hand on Zoom, you have three minutes.

1189
01:35:10,436 --> 01:35:12,637
You have to press the, just once.

1190
01:35:12,677 --> 01:35:13,437
That should be good.

1191
01:35:22,279 --> 01:35:22,439
Hello?

1192
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:23,120
Okay.

1193
01:35:23,481 --> 01:35:25,303
So that's some theory 61 stignero.

1194
01:35:25,944 --> 01:35:38,402
I just wanted to make a general reminder to everyone that one of the basic principles that we learn in a civics education class, which is what stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful?

1195
01:35:39,163 --> 01:35:40,924
checks and balances or separation of powers.

1196
01:35:42,124 --> 01:35:46,585
There's absolutely no reason why I, you know, want to vote no on this.

1197
01:35:46,886 --> 01:35:51,847
I strongly support voting yes, and I hope every member of the council does so as well.

1198
01:35:52,207 --> 01:36:02,671
This is just like, even if this information is, you know, spread out and publicly somewhere else, I think it would be very helpful for members of the, for residents of Medford to basically see this in a

1199
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:04,432
in a compiled report.

1200
01:36:04,452 --> 01:36:09,918
And as I said, it's about just checks and balances, as two counselors here mentioned.

1201
01:36:10,178 --> 01:36:11,499
I don't see a reason to not do this.

1202
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:12,200
Thank you very much.

1203
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:13,842
Thank you.

1204
01:36:13,862 --> 01:36:14,963
Name of the desk record, please.

1205
01:36:15,003 --> 01:36:15,804
You have three minutes.

1206
01:36:16,531 --> 01:36:18,173
Steve South, 106 Damon Road.

1207
01:36:18,233 --> 01:36:22,258
I just wanted to clarify a couple of the questions that were asked and comments that were made.

1208
01:36:23,099 --> 01:36:33,891
One is a FOIA request would not capture some lawsuits that are considered private until, or litigations I should say,

1209
01:36:34,852 --> 01:36:44,034
such as complaints with MCAD, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, which those complaints are private until they are decided or adjudicated or settled.

1210
01:36:44,535 --> 01:36:45,575
Then they become public.

1211
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:46,775
I just want to point that out.

1212
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:53,857
So there are things that would be captured by this item that would not be captured by a FOIA.

1213
01:36:54,197 --> 01:36:57,158
I just want to clarify a couple other things that

1214
01:36:58,358 --> 01:37:07,362
I'm trying to understand if several of the counselors, including you, President Bares, were saying that the settlements that I mentioned never happened because I have copies of them.

1215
01:37:07,462 --> 01:37:13,946
So I didn't understand if that's what you guys were saying, that it's not possible due to checks and balances.

1216
01:37:13,966 --> 01:37:14,626
Nobody said that.

1217
01:37:14,986 --> 01:37:15,626
Oh, okay.

1218
01:37:15,766 --> 01:37:21,908
I heard people saying that it would have to go through all checks and balances and money allocated.

1219
01:37:22,008 --> 01:37:30,910
These are settlements that, several of them happened that were never approved by the council and I came and spoke at that time and gave copies of the settlements.

1220
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:31,970
I just want to point that out.

1221
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:36,711
I also want to point out to one of the counselors who said, you know, that,

1222
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:38,431
something about that.

1223
01:37:38,471 --> 01:37:41,512
I mentioned Sandra Gayle twice, and maybe it's exaggerated.

1224
01:37:42,032 --> 01:37:56,955
I just want to point out that the litigation that you approved out there in executive session for $47,500 was a complaint made by Teamsters Local 25 at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations.

1225
01:37:57,315 --> 01:38:00,456
That was settled a couple weeks ago during the middle of a trial.

1226
01:38:00,776 --> 01:38:02,436
I believe you guys approved it today.

1227
01:38:02,897 --> 01:38:04,857
The other lawsuit- I can't comment on that.

1228
01:38:04,937 --> 01:38:05,818
Yeah, that's fine.

1229
01:38:05,858 --> 01:38:06,459
I'm commenting.

1230
01:38:06,519 --> 01:38:07,420
I know what it is.

1231
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,361
It's 47-5.

1232
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:09,402
You guys just approved it.

1233
01:38:09,922 --> 01:38:21,395
And the lawsuit that I gave to you guys in your packet, and I just want to point out to Councilor Lazaro, this is a United States District Court

1234
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:27,299
District of Massachusetts lawsuit for wage and hour violations.

1235
01:38:27,419 --> 01:38:30,281
It's valued somewhere in the couple hundred thousand dollar range.

1236
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:32,463
So they're two separate litigations.

1237
01:38:32,543 --> 01:38:37,206
I just wanted to point that out, you know, as people are talking about exaggeration.

1238
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:38,147
Thank you very much.

1239
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:39,368
Appreciate your time.

1240
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:41,990
Thank you.

1241
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:46,613
Yeah, my point being, I think the comment was made, the words monopoly money were used.

1242
01:38:47,514 --> 01:38:48,595
And the point was made that

1243
01:38:50,405 --> 01:38:54,147
an appropriation to pay for a settlement must be approved by the council.

1244
01:38:54,887 --> 01:39:00,969
You may be well right that something was approved by the school department or something didn't come to the council.

1245
01:39:00,989 --> 01:39:04,331
We had that discussion in the past.

1246
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:05,871
The money for that would have to be.

1247
01:39:06,872 --> 01:39:08,272
So that's what I'm saying here.

1248
01:39:08,572 --> 01:39:14,515
There's been no appropriation requested by the mayor or made by this council to pay for

1249
01:39:15,943 --> 01:39:17,263
any sort of settlement sum.

1250
01:39:17,904 --> 01:39:21,064
And I'm just gonna leave it there, sir.

1251
01:39:21,084 --> 01:39:23,945
There's not monopoly money activity going on, it's just false.

1252
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:41,090
Many of the lawsuits, up until recently, you guys started approving them, many of them, and Councilor Scarpelli was here when I came up on previous years and handed out the settlements and the lawsuits, they were never approved by the council.

1253
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,130
you guys and I appreciate it.

1254
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,051
That's not the point that's being made.

1255
01:39:45,111 --> 01:39:45,931
No, it's not.

1256
01:39:46,031 --> 01:39:52,413
The point that I'm making is that these settlements were approved within the confines of the budget as approved by the council.

1257
01:39:53,353 --> 01:39:57,954
No additional money was asked to be appropriated from the mayor to the council to pay for these settlements.

1258
01:39:58,134 --> 01:40:00,195
We're not talking about additional money.

1259
01:40:00,215 --> 01:40:07,437
What we're talking about is when a lawsuit is settled for $500,000, you guys should approve it.

1260
01:40:07,517 --> 01:40:08,297
I'll leave it at that.

1261
01:40:09,277 --> 01:40:17,062
And yes, the point being that this council has never been asked to make an appropriation for money beyond the scope of the city budget for settlements.

1262
01:40:17,102 --> 01:40:18,924
That is a fact, and it is indisputable.

1263
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:20,264
I'm not talking in circles.

1264
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:23,567
You're saying there's all this extra money that we're being asked to spend on this.

1265
01:40:23,867 --> 01:40:27,169
I'm saying that this is not a right to tax payers' money.

1266
01:40:27,389 --> 01:40:30,912
You can get a lot of money because you own the house.

1267
01:40:30,932 --> 01:40:32,773
Oh, Steve, you're a big man, aren't you?

1268
01:40:36,494 --> 01:40:41,058
No, I'm giggling about your obvious political attempt to malign the city.

1269
01:40:41,178 --> 01:40:42,118
Steve, please stop.

1270
01:40:42,279 --> 01:40:43,119
Steve, please stop.

1271
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:44,140
Please stop.

1272
01:40:44,921 --> 01:40:47,703
And we are paying attention, but you're the one who doesn't know.

1273
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,206
Councilor Collins, you clearly have no clue.

1274
01:40:53,207 --> 01:40:53,988
Councilor Collins?

1275
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,632
I mean, I'm not the one making it a goof show here.

1276
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:07,265
I'm just commenting, he's the one who's trying to, if we're gonna throw conspiracy theories around in the public forum, they will be combated by this chair.

1277
01:41:09,447 --> 01:41:10,327
Thank you, Harry.

1278
01:41:10,428 --> 01:41:11,849
Council Vice President Collins.

1279
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:22,116
I do wanna underline the point, which is reflected in city paperwork, most of which has already been reviewed by the council in public session.

1280
01:41:22,136 --> 01:41:28,601
If one of the points that this conversation is about is,

1281
01:41:30,518 --> 01:41:35,900
Is there secret money being spent on settlements that is not known to counselors, that is not known to the public?

1282
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:50,026
I would offer an amendment or a B paper that this information, if it's provided by the administration, also include legal department, budget to actuals for this fiscal years that are being asked about so that we can, we don't have to,

1283
01:41:51,318 --> 01:41:54,119
I mean, I was gonna say we don't have to take it on faith, but it's all on the city website already.

1284
01:41:54,139 --> 01:41:56,761
We did just see it on paper in the packet that we will receive.

1285
01:41:57,881 --> 01:42:02,283
How much money was budgeted for the legal department and how much was spent?

1286
01:42:04,424 --> 01:42:05,024
Yes, we do.

1287
01:42:05,085 --> 01:42:05,465
Thank you, sir.

1288
01:42:05,525 --> 01:42:06,445
Please stop disturbing the meeting.

1289
01:42:06,485 --> 01:42:08,246
And with that, President Perez, I would move the question.

1290
01:42:08,826 --> 01:42:09,847
Are you asking for a beat paper?

1291
01:42:11,332 --> 01:42:16,675
I would put that forward as an amendment if the councilor is open to it.

1292
01:42:16,695 --> 01:42:24,600
There's an amendment to include the budget to actuals for the law department, which of course has been in every city budget for all of those fiscal years.

1293
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:26,601
Is that amendment acceptable, Councilor Scarpelli?

1294
01:42:32,305 --> 01:42:36,667
We'd like to include as part of the report you're requesting that we get the budget to actuals, although we already have it.

1295
01:42:37,848 --> 01:42:39,569
It's already in the Warren articles as well.

1296
01:42:43,927 --> 01:42:48,733
We're seeing settlements, but we're not appropriating, we're not voting on it.

1297
01:42:48,793 --> 01:42:49,734
Anything over $2,500, we should be voting on.

1298
01:42:52,723 --> 01:42:57,125
When we're talking about the settlements, we're talking about insurance, we talk about attorney fees.

1299
01:42:57,465 --> 01:42:59,065
These are the things that I want to show.

1300
01:42:59,085 --> 01:43:00,446
I didn't say monopoly money.

1301
01:43:01,046 --> 01:43:02,607
What I'm saying is- I didn't say you did, sir.

1302
01:43:02,627 --> 01:43:05,888
Yeah, no, I'm saying it's real money, and it's taxpayers' money.

1303
01:43:05,928 --> 01:43:07,328
So that's why this resolution's come about.

1304
01:43:07,669 --> 01:43:21,614
Whether Council Beals was strayed off of what the bigger picture is, maybe I should have stayed focused on this issue, but I really think common sense, eyes wide open, we can see that there's,

1305
01:43:22,714 --> 01:43:27,255
is, and again, I'm not saying fraudulent, I'm not saying illegal, I'm saying mismanagement.

1306
01:43:28,095 --> 01:43:39,318
We're seeing the way the city is spending our money, it's fraudulent, it's non-transparent, and there's no accountability.

1307
01:43:42,459 --> 01:43:42,979
So thank you.

1308
01:43:43,059 --> 01:43:43,899
Anything to help?

1309
01:43:43,939 --> 01:43:44,759
With the point of order?

1310
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:56,148
With my fellow councilors statement that this has maybe gone astray, I'd like to move the question.

1311
01:43:56,388 --> 01:43:56,809
All right.

1312
01:43:58,111 --> 01:43:58,471
If I may?

1313
01:43:58,811 --> 01:43:59,512
Vice President Collins.

1314
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:00,113
I just want to note,

1315
01:44:02,488 --> 01:44:12,897
I obviously strongly disagree that there's anything fraudulent going on, but my point with the, including the budget to actuals as context in this information is to illustrate, if we talk about managing money, what does that literally mean?

1316
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:20,523
Where the money comes from, where it goes, the budget to actuals, we don't have to talk about how much money is being spent and where does it come from, we can literally see it.

1317
01:44:20,563 --> 01:44:22,505
And I don't see why that shouldn't be a part of the conversation.

1318
01:44:22,565 --> 01:44:27,389
And again, we do already have that information, but I think it makes sense to put all the context next to each other.

1319
01:44:27,409 --> 01:44:29,350
I'm gonna split your paper, George.

1320
01:44:32,452 --> 01:44:34,514
There's a huge gaps in what's going on in this community.

1321
01:44:35,175 --> 01:44:49,932
So we can just see what spreadsheet, you know, the ones that our chief of staff, council president mentioned, let's talk about it because we talked about KP law and they came here during the budget season and openly said, we only spent $50,000 on KP law.

1322
01:44:52,215 --> 01:44:56,956
But using that example, when I counted up those months, it came up over almost $500,000.

1323
01:44:57,196 --> 01:45:01,677
And that's not totally what was in other departments.

1324
01:45:02,077 --> 01:45:06,478
So there are questions that this isn't a conspiracy theory.

1325
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:08,419
These are questions that I brought up.

1326
01:45:08,539 --> 01:45:13,960
These are concrete issues that we have that we want answers from the city.

1327
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,181
We've asked for an audit to do this for us.

1328
01:45:16,221 --> 01:45:18,741
We've asked for transparency and accountability.

1329
01:45:19,201 --> 01:45:20,802
This is the form that we're asking.

1330
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:23,163
move to a question.

1331
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:25,203
Let's get the answers from the mayor's office.

1332
01:45:25,484 --> 01:45:27,724
Hopefully she does what she's supposed to.

1333
01:45:27,864 --> 01:45:31,126
And like Councilor Lemming said, that's a great idea.

1334
01:45:31,146 --> 01:45:33,907
If she doesn't do it, I hope someone in the audience files a FOIA.

1335
01:45:34,347 --> 01:45:34,987
So that's it.

1336
01:45:35,467 --> 01:45:35,807
Thank you.

1337
01:45:36,027 --> 01:45:36,968
Is there a motion on the floor?

1338
01:45:37,968 --> 01:45:41,449
Motion by Councilor Collins to approve as amended, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1339
01:45:41,469 --> 01:45:46,010
And I just want to go, you know, we can talk about whatever losing the thread.

1340
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:47,871
The thread is very clear.

1341
01:45:47,891 --> 01:45:55,933
I have no issue asking the administration as one councilor to compile information that already exists in this way so that it is easy to understand it.

1342
01:45:56,493 --> 01:46:01,315
This council has never appropriated a dollar beyond the city budget for settlements.

1343
01:46:02,215 --> 01:46:10,804
And that narrative, I agree, not pushed by you, Councilor Scarbelli, but stated in this forum, is blatant misinformation and will be challenged.

1344
01:46:13,808 --> 01:46:14,689
Name and address for the record, please.

1345
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:15,329
You have three minutes.

1346
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:17,432
Kyle Heath, 131 Fulton Street Road.

1347
01:46:17,852 --> 01:46:22,197
I think we're getting a little lost here, too, about this just being about money.

1348
01:46:24,089 --> 01:46:29,975
One of the big things is why are people being treated in such this way that this money's being spent?

1349
01:46:30,356 --> 01:46:33,579
Why is there lawsuit after lawsuit that people are winning?

1350
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:37,383
That's because of the administration in this city.

1351
01:46:38,484 --> 01:46:42,208
It's like George was saying, it's financial mismanagement.

1352
01:46:43,209 --> 01:46:45,451
I can tell you a quick story about what happened just a few weeks ago.

1353
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,381
You know, we had arbitration a few weeks ago.

1354
01:46:49,902 --> 01:46:51,323
We had a settlement done with the city.

1355
01:46:51,904 --> 01:46:57,149
And after six or seven hours in court, the mayor decided, I changed my mind.

1356
01:46:57,169 --> 01:46:58,190
I need to sleep on it more.

1357
01:46:58,630 --> 01:46:59,792
Let's set up another court date.

1358
01:47:00,512 --> 01:47:06,018
So after somebody goes and tells their family they just got the settlement and arbitration and they're getting this job.

1359
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,847
The mayor changed her mind after a few hours.

1360
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:16,192
And now after spending $2,400 that day, we're going back to court again for another $24 from the city.

1361
01:47:16,252 --> 01:47:20,676
So it's almost five grand just to spend on court with one case.

1362
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:24,199
The financial mismanagement is just unbelievable.

1363
01:47:24,579 --> 01:47:27,081
But why is this happening?

1364
01:47:27,461 --> 01:47:32,165
Why is the city treating its workers in such a way that this is happening?

1365
01:47:32,425 --> 01:47:33,206
I don't understand it.

1366
01:47:33,326 --> 01:47:34,707
I just don't get why.

1367
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:52,804
No one's bringing that up with, it's not just money with these lawsuits, it's how are they getting away with the cost of all treating people like this, the workforce that work every single day out there for the city, no matter what, understaffed and this lawsuit after lawsuit that we're winning and winning and winning.

1368
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,607
And I think that needs to be looked into.

1369
01:47:57,695 --> 01:48:07,170
I don't know, you know, I don't want to say it, but I think one of the reasons is the way you just spoke to the public and how you're speaking up there, calling it a clown show and everything.

1370
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:09,834
You're making comments and not allowing anyone here to make any comments.

1371
01:48:09,934 --> 01:48:11,016
I think that's part of it.

1372
01:48:11,036 --> 01:48:12,599
Do you just note two minutes of comments, Kyle?

1373
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:24,207
I allow everyone to make their comments, but I'm just saying that what you just said, I agree with you 100%, and my three terms on this council, we have been diligent about asking these questions, but we have no formal authority to manage anyone.

1374
01:48:24,227 --> 01:48:25,228
We have- That's perfectly fine.

1375
01:48:25,268 --> 01:48:27,169
You're supposed to be in control of this hall.

1376
01:48:27,389 --> 01:48:29,310
I am in control of this hall, and you're just interrupting me.

1377
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:32,413
You're in control of the hall, but you're calling it a clown show of comments under your breath.

1378
01:48:32,453 --> 01:48:33,173
Everyone can hear you.

1379
01:48:33,433 --> 01:48:33,914
I'm aware.

1380
01:48:33,934 --> 01:48:34,134
Okay?

1381
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:38,677
but that's the reason why they get away with it, is because you're doing it over here.

1382
01:48:38,737 --> 01:48:39,798
That's all I gotta say.

1383
01:48:39,838 --> 01:48:41,199
No, Kyle, again, you interrupted me.

1384
01:48:41,239 --> 01:48:48,644
I'd like to have a dialogue with you, but again, when people interrupt me and they don't allow me to have the dialogue, that's when it becomes out of control, and that's when we have these sessions.

1385
01:48:48,684 --> 01:48:51,286
Now, can I make the point that I was gonna make, and then I'll give the floor back to you?

1386
01:48:51,306 --> 01:48:52,106
Go for it.

1387
01:48:52,126 --> 01:48:52,367
All right.

1388
01:48:53,267 --> 01:48:56,650
The thing we all agree on behind this council and behind this rail is,

1389
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,281
We'd like to see the figures presented in a certain way.

1390
01:49:00,502 --> 01:49:08,546
And I think all of us have raised questions about the workplace culture and the management of the city in many different aspects, many different departments.

1391
01:49:09,447 --> 01:49:10,508
That's something we all share.

1392
01:49:11,664 --> 01:49:22,333
when that gets mixed into a political narrative about overrides and what happens in public meetings and not liking the outcomes of certain city council votes.

1393
01:49:22,733 --> 01:49:24,174
And you just said that we're understaffed, right?

1394
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:28,618
I support an override because we've been understaffed and I think we need more money to get out of understaffing.

1395
01:49:29,318 --> 01:49:44,485
I don't think even if everything that was just said happened in every lawsuit that Mr. South just presented to us and everything else, if all that money happened and went out the door for settlements tomorrow, it still wouldn't be reliable recurring revenue to pay people in the long term to address the city's financial issues.

1396
01:49:44,925 --> 01:49:46,066
So when that

1397
01:49:46,686 --> 01:49:53,831
True thing that I'm saying, it's just statistical fact that the city budget gets lumped in with the settlements and gets politicized around revenue and overrides.

1398
01:49:54,271 --> 01:49:55,532
That's when we have a disagreement.

1399
01:49:55,892 --> 01:49:59,795
That's when people start yelling from the crowd and breaking the quorum.

1400
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:03,157
And that's when I lose patience with that narrative.

1401
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:04,378
So I agree with you.

1402
01:50:04,478 --> 01:50:05,459
I have those questions.

1403
01:50:05,579 --> 01:50:06,659
I share those concerns.

1404
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:07,280
I raised them.

1405
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,861
I raised them when I was sitting there.

1406
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:10,742
I try to raise them when I'm sitting here.

1407
01:50:10,762 --> 01:50:12,823
I don't think anyone would say that I'm

1408
01:50:13,824 --> 01:50:15,545
their best friend of this administration.

1409
01:50:15,585 --> 01:50:18,747
I try to work with them collaboratively because that's what the job of government is.

1410
01:50:19,227 --> 01:50:25,892
When the narratives start getting spun up in a certain way to politicize things and attack other things that aren't related to these fundamental factual questions,

1411
01:50:27,083 --> 01:50:27,703
What are you gonna do?

1412
01:50:28,024 --> 01:50:28,684
What are you gonna do?

1413
01:50:28,704 --> 01:50:30,626
We can talk all we want up here, but what are we doing about it?

1414
01:50:31,366 --> 01:50:37,070
As Mr. Seltz just mentioned, we're going back just four years of this going on, and nothing's been changed.

1415
01:50:38,411 --> 01:50:41,193
We're looking at a city charter change right now.

1416
01:50:41,213 --> 01:50:42,174
But this isn't just financial.

1417
01:50:42,514 --> 01:50:43,915
It's been four years of lawsuits.

1418
01:50:44,415 --> 01:50:45,316
What's being changed?

1419
01:50:46,237 --> 01:50:48,959
Look at this administration and say, why are you guys treating the employees this way?

1420
01:50:48,999 --> 01:50:49,959
What's being done about it?

1421
01:50:50,059 --> 01:50:53,462
We have been exercising our, how many resolutions have we passed on legal issues, George?

1422
01:50:55,567 --> 01:50:59,689
5, 6, 7, 8, 10, Steve was talking about all the meetings he's come and given the report.

1423
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:01,510
I haven't seen any changes.

1424
01:51:02,451 --> 01:51:03,932
Well, I haven't seen anything.

1425
01:51:03,992 --> 01:51:06,033
I haven't actually seen one of you guys come down with DPW.

1426
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:07,414
I didn't even talk to us.

1427
01:51:07,554 --> 01:51:09,295
What's the limit of our authority, Kyle?

1428
01:51:10,235 --> 01:51:16,199
I'm not sure, I'd like to know if you can come down to the DW and say hello once in a while too, that'd be nice to see how we're actually doing.

1429
01:51:16,419 --> 01:51:16,980
We'd love to.

1430
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:17,861
Come on down.

1431
01:51:17,881 --> 01:51:18,481
Give us a call.

1432
01:51:18,641 --> 01:51:22,664
It'd be nice to see you guys, to show that everyone actually cares about us, because we're not getting there right now.

1433
01:51:22,684 --> 01:51:24,725
We do, we'd love to come down, we'd love to do that.

1434
01:51:25,346 --> 01:51:27,608
I've been there five years, I haven't seen anyone but Mr. Scott Bailey.

1435
01:51:27,968 --> 01:51:29,769
I've been down there, but I'm sorry I missed you.

1436
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:31,650
I'm there all the time, I don't know.

1437
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:34,312
Well, maybe you miss me, but I've been down to the building.

1438
01:51:34,733 --> 01:51:34,813
Oh.

1439
01:51:35,433 --> 01:51:37,315
Thank you, but in any case,

1440
01:51:38,949 --> 01:51:44,450
My point being, I don't disagree with what you're saying when it gets wrapped up in all this other stuff, that's the division.

1441
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,291
So I'm not wrapping it up in anything and I will continue not to.

1442
01:51:47,911 --> 01:51:50,672
And I hope that we can have, I appreciate that.

1443
01:51:51,132 --> 01:51:54,552
And I hope that we can continue to have meetings where we have a respectful dialogue like that.

1444
01:51:54,793 --> 01:51:57,793
Thank you, instead of yelling from the crowd.

1445
01:51:57,813 --> 01:51:58,173
Thank you.

1446
01:52:01,194 --> 01:52:05,395
On a motion of councilor saying, seconded by Vice President Collins to approve the motion as amended,

1447
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,422
Any further discussion by members of the council or members of the public?

1448
01:52:11,423 --> 01:52:13,065
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please follow.

1449
01:52:13,385 --> 01:52:14,106
Councilor Kellyanne?

1450
01:52:14,646 --> 01:52:14,846
Yes.

1451
01:52:15,807 --> 01:52:16,688
Vice President Collins?

1452
01:52:16,728 --> 01:52:16,988
Yes.

1453
01:52:18,989 --> 01:52:19,770
Councilor Lazaro?

1454
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:20,491
Yes.

1455
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:21,751
Councilor Lemmon?

1456
01:52:22,432 --> 01:52:22,712
Yes.

1457
01:52:23,993 --> 01:52:24,754
Councilor Scarpelli?

1458
01:52:24,914 --> 01:52:25,374
Yes.

1459
01:52:25,795 --> 01:52:26,355
Councilor Singh?

1460
01:52:26,515 --> 01:52:26,775
Yes.

1461
01:52:27,536 --> 01:52:28,156
President Bex?

1462
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:28,757
Yes.

1463
01:52:28,857 --> 01:52:30,738
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1464
01:52:30,779 --> 01:52:31,859
The motion passes.

1465
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:37,791
24-452 is mine, so Council Vice President Collins can take the chair.

1466
01:52:44,136 --> 01:52:46,237
On the motion to take paper, 24-459, we had multiple appointments.

1467
01:52:46,257 --> 01:52:46,338
Yeah.

1468
01:52:46,378 --> 01:52:47,939
Can we take 2445, if we're gonna do that, 24447, 24448, and 24459?

1469
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:04,890
on the motion of councilor saying to take those papers out of order.

1470
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:23,959
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1471
01:53:23,979 --> 01:53:26,040
The second is Council Vice President Collins.

1472
01:53:29,218 --> 01:53:29,839
Councilor Kellyanne?

1473
01:53:30,059 --> 01:53:30,259
Yes.

1474
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:31,701
Vice President Collins?

1475
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:31,981
Yes.

1476
01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:33,142
Councilor Lozaro?

1477
01:53:33,203 --> 01:53:33,463
Yes.

1478
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:34,264
Councilor Lemming?

1479
01:53:34,664 --> 01:53:34,904
Yes.

1480
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:36,847
Councilor Scarpelli?

1481
01:53:36,867 --> 01:53:37,067
Yes.

1482
01:53:37,828 --> 01:53:38,368
Councilor Sanchez?

1483
01:53:38,649 --> 01:53:38,829
Yes.

1484
01:53:39,149 --> 01:53:39,750
President Ferris?

1485
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:40,491
Yes.

1486
01:53:40,631 --> 01:53:43,214
And the amended motion passes.

1487
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:46,477
24459 Medford Board of Election Commissioners Appointment, William O'Keefe.

1488
01:53:47,862 --> 01:54:03,433
Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of William O'Keefe, Republican of 18 Kilgore Avenue to the Election Commission for the unexpired term of the existing vacancy to expire March 30th, 2026 in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 51, Section 16A.

1489
01:54:03,493 --> 01:54:07,315
William will be present in person or visor before the meeting and a copy of the appointment letter is enclosed.

1490
01:54:07,776 --> 01:54:09,237
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1491
01:54:09,297 --> 01:54:10,718
Sincerely, Brianna Lungo Kern, Mayor.

1492
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:13,440
And I just want to add, for folks who may not know about the law,

1493
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:18,545
The law requires partisan balance on our elections commission to ensure that all parties represented.

1494
01:54:19,106 --> 01:54:23,431
And Mr. O'Keefe here is filling the vacant term of the Republican seat that expires March 30th, 2026.

1495
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,554
Thank you for being here.

1496
01:54:25,814 --> 01:54:26,274
Absolutely, yes.

1497
01:54:27,285 --> 01:54:28,986
and welcome the opportunity to take any questions.

1498
01:54:30,207 --> 01:54:46,420
Lifelong Method resident, father, husband, served on the school committee, attorney, and I also think that the mayor's doing a wonderful job, as well as his council, so it can be as impossible as impossible can be, but just like anything else, everybody's gotta agree to disagree sometimes.

1499
01:54:47,221 --> 01:54:49,122
Think about that, a Republican and a socialist.

1500
01:54:49,322 --> 01:54:49,582
Yes.

1501
01:54:50,963 --> 01:54:52,305
Any questions for Mr. O'Keefe?

1502
01:54:53,222 --> 01:54:54,322
Council Vice President Collins.

1503
01:54:54,923 --> 01:54:58,624
Thank you so much for stepping up and putting yourself forward to fill this position.

1504
01:54:58,664 --> 01:54:59,784
I think we'd be very lucky to have you.

1505
01:54:59,804 --> 01:55:00,744
I have a motion to approve.

1506
01:55:02,705 --> 01:55:05,266
On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Zahra.

1507
01:55:05,286 --> 01:55:06,446
Mr. Clerk, please spell the roll.

1508
01:55:06,506 --> 01:55:08,427
Oh, we have a comment from Mr. Leona.

1509
01:55:09,955 --> 01:55:11,837
Glenn Goyon, 86 Chandler Road.

1510
01:55:11,857 --> 01:55:19,843
I just want to say that I've known Bill O'Keefe as an attorney and somebody that has been so active with Medford Little League.

1511
01:55:20,504 --> 01:55:24,107
Back when my three kids started, we had four Little Leagues in the city of Medford.

1512
01:55:24,587 --> 01:55:25,608
Now we're down to one.

1513
01:55:26,049 --> 01:55:33,335
Bill O'Keefe was the one responsible for negotiating, and it wasn't easy to bring

1514
01:55:37,043 --> 01:55:40,264
He brought the parties together so that we still have an active.

1515
01:55:45,446 --> 01:55:45,906
But anyway.

1516
01:55:45,926 --> 01:55:48,507
As long as it wasn't during election season.

1517
01:55:50,748 --> 01:55:54,529
I think we're very fortunate to have Bill O'Keefe on the Elections Commission.

1518
01:55:54,589 --> 01:55:56,009
I would hope you would approve it, thank you.

1519
01:55:56,189 --> 01:55:57,370
All right, great, thank you.

1520
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:02,991
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Zahra, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1521
01:56:03,752 --> 01:56:04,532
Councilor Callahan.

1522
01:56:04,572 --> 01:56:04,712
Yes.

1523
01:56:06,273 --> 01:56:07,134
Vice President Collins?

1524
01:56:07,174 --> 01:56:07,394
Yes.

1525
01:56:08,014 --> 01:56:08,875
Councilor Lazaro?

1526
01:56:08,975 --> 01:56:09,175
Yes.

1527
01:56:09,676 --> 01:56:10,296
Councilor Lemming?

1528
01:56:10,796 --> 01:56:11,037
Yes.

1529
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:13,799
Councilor Scarpelli?

1530
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:15,420
Yes, yes.

1531
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:16,881
Councilor Sanz?

1532
01:56:16,941 --> 01:56:17,201
Yes.

1533
01:56:18,142 --> 01:56:18,762
President Behrs?

1534
01:56:19,243 --> 01:56:19,543
Yes.

1535
01:56:19,563 --> 01:56:26,768
Assembly affirmative then negative, motion passes.

1536
01:56:26,788 --> 01:56:32,673

Brianna Longo, current mayor.

1540
01:57:07,648 --> 01:57:10,429
Do we have Mr. Longo here on Zoom?

1541
01:57:12,549 --> 01:57:17,490
Seeing none, and whereas this is a reappointment, I'll leave it up to my fellow councilors as to how they'd like to dispose of this paper.

1542
01:57:21,511 --> 01:57:22,211
Councilor Lazaro.

1543
01:57:22,551 --> 01:57:23,171
Motion to approve.

1544
01:57:23,591 --> 01:57:25,551

Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1547
01:57:31,232 --> 01:57:31,873
Councilor Callahan.

1548
01:57:32,073 --> 01:57:32,273
Yes.

1549
01:57:33,313 --> 01:57:34,113
Vice President Collins.

1550
01:57:35,455 --> 01:57:36,256
Councilor Lazaro?

1551
01:57:36,516 --> 01:57:36,736
Yes.

1552
01:57:37,257 --> 01:57:37,838
Councilor Lemming?

1553
01:57:38,298 --> 01:57:38,558
Yes.

1554
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:40,741
Councilor Scarpelli?

1555
01:57:41,061 --> 01:57:41,281
Yes.

1556
01:57:42,202 --> 01:57:42,783
Councilor Sang?

1557
01:57:42,823 --> 01:57:43,063
Yes.

1558
01:57:43,564 --> 01:57:44,205
President Behrs?

1559
01:57:44,765 --> 01:57:45,046
Yes.

1560
01:57:45,166 --> 01:57:46,187
Affirmative, none negative.

1561
01:57:46,207 --> 01:57:47,228
The motion passes.

1562
01:57:47,248 --> 01:57:51,252
24-448 Medford Housing Authority Appointment and Schiavone.

1563
01:57:54,797 --> 01:58:23,883
President Pearson, members of the Medford City Council, I hereby, I'm guessing it says, I hereby request and recommend that your honorable body in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 121B, Section 5, confirm the appointment of the following individual, effective August 13th, 2024, for a five-year term through March 1, 2029, as the representative of the Salton Stall Local Tenant Organization board members, as cited in the reference statute, and Chiavone, representative of the Salton Stall Local Tenant Association board members, 121 Riverside Avenue, number 206, Medford, MA,

1564
01:58:25,103 --> 01:58:29,286
02155 to the Manford Housing Authority for a term of five years to expire September 30th, 2029.

1565
01:58:29,326 --> 01:58:31,827
A copy of the appointment letter is attached.

1566
01:58:31,867 --> 01:58:33,288
Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.

1567
01:58:33,308 --> 01:58:34,669
Sincerely, Brianna Lugo, current mayor.

1568
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:37,691
We did receive an email from the administration that Ms.

1569
01:58:37,711 --> 01:58:46,617
Chiamoni was ill and unable to attend tonight, but there she was, the recommendation of the Tenants Association for the seat that goes to a public housing resident.

1570
01:58:47,257 --> 01:58:47,917
Is there a motion?

1571
01:58:48,558 --> 01:58:50,159
Council Vice President Collins.

1572
01:58:51,867 --> 01:58:56,388
On the motion to approve of Vice President Collins seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1573
01:58:56,448 --> 01:58:57,548
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1574
01:59:02,009 --> 01:59:02,650
Councilor Callahan?

1575
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:03,190
Yes.

1576
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:05,490
Vice President Collins?

1577
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:06,030
Yes.

1578
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:07,911
Councilor Lozano?

1579
01:59:08,471 --> 01:59:08,711
Yes.

1580
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:09,831
Councilor Lemon?

1581
01:59:11,992 --> 01:59:12,152
Yes.

1582
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:14,327
Councilor Scarpelli?

1583
01:59:14,628 --> 01:59:14,848
Yes.

1584
01:59:15,268 --> 01:59:15,849
Councilor Sang?

1585
01:59:15,909 --> 01:59:16,249
Yes.

1586
01:59:16,649 --> 01:59:17,270
President Paris?

1587
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:17,650
Yes.

1588
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:21,332
And then I get the motion passes.

1589
01:59:21,352 --> 01:59:21,833
24452 resolution.

1590
01:59:21,873 --> 01:59:22,413
This is mine.

1591
01:59:22,513 --> 01:59:24,034
Can you take that chair, Chair?

1592
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:34,642
Oh, perfect.

1593
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:50,206
24452, resolution to support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural substances on the November 5, 2024 general election ballot offered by President Behrs.

1594
01:59:51,200 --> 02:00:12,497
Whereas one in three Massachusetts residents struggle with mental health challenges, and whereas pioneering research from Johns Hopkins and Harvard Medical School find that natural psychedelics can be effective in managing treatment-resistant depression and other forms of mental illness, and whereas the FDA recently granted psilocybin, one of the psychedelics, a quote, breakthrough therapy, unquote, designation,

1595
02:00:13,037 --> 02:00:21,200
for treatment-resistant depression, and whereas the ballot question would create a regulated framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy for adults 21 and older.

1596
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:33,064
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support question four, limited legalization and regulation of certain natural psychedelic substances on the November 4, 2024 general election ballot.

1597
02:00:33,464 --> 02:00:33,864
President Burris.

1598
02:00:34,204 --> 02:00:35,845
Thank you, President Collins.

1599
02:00:36,586 --> 02:00:38,648
The resolution is relatively self-explanatory.

1600
02:00:39,188 --> 02:00:44,072
There are five statewide questions and three local ballot questions on the ballot for November 5th, 2024.

1601
02:00:44,953 --> 02:00:52,438
This is question four, certified by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, which would legalize certain, decriminalize, I should say, certain

1602
02:00:54,198 --> 02:00:59,403
psychedelic substances that have been shown in clinical studies to help address mental health issues.

1603
02:01:00,504 --> 02:01:07,110
The decriminalization of these has occurred in other places, and it has helped, gone a long way to helping a lot of folks.

1604
02:01:07,851 --> 02:01:17,380
I personally have spoken to a number of advocates, including veterans who would like to see these options provided to them where current other pharmaceutical

1605
02:01:19,635 --> 02:01:24,096
items in medicines have not been helpful to address their mental health challenges.

1606
02:01:24,977 --> 02:01:36,800
And again, this is a limited decriminalization of certain substances that have been seen in clinical studies and by the FDA to be really helpful in addressing serious mental health challenges.

1607
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:45,383
So I'm hopeful that the voters will approve in November, but also I'm hopeful that the council will endorse this question as well.

1608
02:01:47,007 --> 02:01:47,747
Thank you, President Behrs.

1609
02:01:47,827 --> 02:01:49,888
Any further comment from members of the council?

1610
02:01:53,149 --> 02:01:54,889
I have a motion to approve from Councilor Sangh.

1611
02:01:55,009 --> 02:01:55,570
Is there a second?

1612
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:57,330
Seconded by President Behrs.

1613
02:01:58,590 --> 02:01:59,671
Name and address for the record, please.

1614
02:02:01,631 --> 02:02:04,652
Castaneda Andrew, Cushing Street, East Method Mass.

1615
02:02:07,173 --> 02:02:12,154
Through the Chair and over the table, I'd like to address to Councilor Behrs.

1616
02:02:17,226 --> 02:02:22,410
Totally, I'm 99.9 behind Councilor Beers on this.

1617
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:33,117
I think it's great, because this country has really neglected to study alternative medicines for the longest time.

1618
02:02:33,597 --> 02:02:44,145
For example, cannabis, it took them 85 years to legalize it, only after they could figure out a way to tax it.

1619
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,891
Let's call the diamond a diamond and a club a club.

1620
02:02:48,491 --> 02:02:49,811
They figure out a way to tax it.

1621
02:02:50,992 --> 02:02:54,773
Now on this psilocybin, I'm hearing really good stories.

1622
02:02:56,613 --> 02:02:59,974
It's helping people with the PTSD, depression, anxiety.

1623
02:03:00,675 --> 02:03:03,896
This could be a natural God's sin.

1624
02:03:04,296 --> 02:03:11,118
If you don't believe in God, a natural nature's sin that could help a lot of people.

1625
02:03:12,355 --> 02:03:14,316
And this should have been done a long time ago.

1626
02:03:15,016 --> 02:03:30,961
I believe Harvard Professor Timothy Leary, back in 1960, was experimenting with lysergic acid, and this government should have been right on it, not to lock him up, but to look at the different parts of psilocybin, et cetera.

1627
02:03:32,501 --> 02:03:33,761
I commend you, Counselor Pierce.

1628
02:03:34,822 --> 02:03:37,543
Let's get it through, no matter what they say.

1629
02:03:38,543 --> 02:03:38,843
Thank you.

1630
02:03:41,524 --> 02:03:42,545
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1631
02:03:43,466 --> 02:03:46,228
I have a hand from Councilor Lemming.

1632
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:51,073
Thank you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward.

1633
02:03:51,493 --> 02:04:03,584
So I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two...

1634
02:04:05,921 --> 02:04:11,088
The advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot.

1635
02:04:11,588 --> 02:04:13,271
There were two.

1636
02:04:14,913 --> 02:04:20,159
There were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them.

1637
02:04:22,272 --> 02:04:34,375
One group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use, and it would be less regulated.

1638
02:04:35,255 --> 02:04:50,658
The other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a

1639
02:04:51,540 --> 02:05:06,050
body, an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them.

1640
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:13,214
It turns it into a for-profit industry.

1641
02:05:13,695 --> 02:05:15,296
I will be supporting it.

1642
02:05:16,056 --> 02:05:16,617
I think that

1643
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:34,125
Any progress is good, although I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago.

1644
02:05:34,405 --> 02:05:36,908
So thank you once again for your efforts.

1645
02:05:39,008 --> 02:05:39,829
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1646
02:05:39,869 --> 02:05:40,409
President Pierce.

1647
02:05:40,649 --> 02:05:40,990
Thank you.

1648
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:41,790
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1649
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:43,031
Yeah, and I completely agree.

1650
02:05:44,052 --> 02:05:53,140
And I am hopeful that if this question passes, that the legislature may look to make some technical adjustments after passage as they did.

1651
02:05:53,721 --> 02:06:00,346
I didn't agree with all of them on the cannabis law and some of the other valid questions that have passed to address some of your concerns.

1652
02:06:00,767 --> 02:06:01,047
Thank you.

1653
02:06:02,731 --> 02:06:03,512
Thank you, President Behrs.

1654
02:06:04,292 --> 02:06:09,797
Seeing no further comments on the motion by President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Seng to approve.

1655
02:06:10,658 --> 02:06:11,879
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1656
02:06:15,462 --> 02:06:20,526
President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Seng to approve the roll.

1657
02:06:20,546 --> 02:06:24,770
Councilor Kellogg?

1658
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:25,211
Yes.

1659
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:26,912
Vice President Collins?

1660
02:06:27,392 --> 02:06:27,573
Yes.

1661
02:06:29,474 --> 02:06:30,155
Councilor Lozaro?

1662
02:06:31,489 --> 02:06:32,750
Yes.

1663
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:33,610
Yes.

1664
02:06:35,171 --> 02:06:37,813
I'm sorry, I should have said something.

1665
02:06:38,474 --> 02:06:41,696
I don't have enough information to support this tonight, so I'm going to vote no.

1666
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:47,440
Yes.

1667
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:48,000
Yes.

1668
02:06:57,727 --> 02:06:58,867
Six in favor, one opposed.

1669
02:06:58,887 --> 02:06:59,628
The motion passes.

1670
02:07:16,452 --> 02:07:19,313
24446 offered by me.

1671
02:07:19,453 --> 02:07:21,733
Brooks PTO food truck.

1672
02:07:24,014 --> 02:07:27,915
Request for a food truck permit for the Brooks school fall festival by me food truck.

1673
02:07:28,875 --> 02:07:29,935
Any discussion or motions?

1674
02:07:31,256 --> 02:07:35,537
Motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

1675
02:07:35,577 --> 02:07:36,637
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1676
02:07:52,148 --> 02:07:52,228
Yes.

1677
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:52,348
Yes.

1678
02:07:52,368 --> 02:07:52,548
Yes.

1679
02:07:52,588 --> 02:07:52,729
Yes.

1680
02:07:52,809 --> 02:07:53,029
Yes.

1681
02:07:53,369 --> 02:07:53,509
Yes.

1682
02:08:11,837 --> 02:08:27,834
Social Services Coordinator, Dean of President Beers and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve of the following amendment to the revised ordinances, Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved, the City's Classification and Compensation Plan, formerly included as Article 2, Sections 6631 to 6640, by adopting the following

1683
02:08:29,616 --> 02:08:52,888
language the language of cap 11 should be amended to replace the title of community social worker with the following title quote social services coordinator upon review by the health department office of outreach and prevention the term social worker is very specific and may require the city to hire a licensed social worker limiting the pool of applicants upon their assessing other municipalities in similar positions several have social services or human service coordinators for this role and fit within the current cap range in medford

1684
02:08:53,388 --> 02:08:56,290
The primary responsibility of this role is to connect residents to services.

1685
02:08:56,411 --> 02:08:59,193
As the cap would remain the same, there's no change in compensation budget.

1686
02:08:59,253 --> 02:09:01,194
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lingo-Kern, Mayor.

1687
02:09:02,996 --> 02:09:04,197
Any questions, comments, or motions?

1688
02:09:04,217 --> 02:09:05,158
Vice President Collins.

1689
02:09:05,178 --> 02:09:06,259
I have a motion to approve.

1690
02:09:06,279 --> 02:09:14,345
I have a motion to approve for first reading by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

1691
02:09:15,486 --> 02:09:17,668
Unless, well, technically there was a motion to approve.

1692
02:09:17,688 --> 02:09:22,212
Is there any objection to taking all three readings tonight, or would we like to do a first reading?

1693
02:09:24,326 --> 02:09:25,367
No objection.

1694
02:09:25,767 --> 02:09:28,128
No objections to moving through all readings this evening.

1695
02:09:28,809 --> 02:09:33,171
All right, on the motion to approve for all three readings by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Zahra.

1696
02:09:33,191 --> 02:09:34,111
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1697
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:50,781
To approve the third reading.

1698
02:09:51,781 --> 02:09:52,502
Councilor Callahan.

1699
02:09:52,762 --> 02:09:52,902
Yes.

1700
02:09:54,026 --> 02:09:54,947
Vice President Collins?

1701
02:09:55,107 --> 02:09:55,307
Yes.

1702
02:09:55,787 --> 02:09:56,708
Councilor Lazaro?

1703
02:09:57,488 --> 02:09:57,689
Yes.

1704
02:09:58,389 --> 02:09:58,950
Councilor Lemming?

1705
02:09:59,390 --> 02:09:59,650
Yes.

1706
02:10:00,671 --> 02:10:01,451
Councilor Scarpelli?

1707
02:10:01,732 --> 02:10:01,932
No.

1708
02:10:05,394 --> 02:10:05,934
Councilor San Buenaventura?

1709
02:10:06,055 --> 02:10:06,315
Yes.

1710
02:10:06,875 --> 02:10:07,456
President Behrs?

1711
02:10:07,876 --> 02:10:08,176
Yes.

1712
02:10:08,296 --> 02:10:09,277
Sixty affirmative and negative.

1713
02:10:09,297 --> 02:10:10,178
The motion passes.

1714
02:10:11,286 --> 02:10:16,709
Public participation, to participate outside of Zoom, please email ahertabuse at menthor-ma.gov.

1715
02:10:17,409 --> 02:10:22,972
If you'd like to participate, please come to the podium, or raise your hand on Zoom, and I'll recognize you.

1716
02:10:22,992 --> 02:10:24,853
Name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.

1717
02:10:25,134 --> 02:10:26,594
Gaston Fury 61, Stigney Road.

1718
02:10:26,634 --> 02:10:35,939
I just wanted to say that I'm appalled at the lack of definitive information that was given regarding the September 3rd

1719
02:10:38,028 --> 02:10:43,430
state primary or state representative for the 35th Middlesex District.

1720
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:45,070
There's no Republican candidate.

1721
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:46,331
There's no libertarian candidate.

1722
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:50,392
There's only three candidates in the Democratic ballot.

1723
02:10:50,972 --> 02:10:54,694
As such, the primary is the definitive election.

1724
02:10:55,114 --> 02:11:01,136
And I would have hoped that this body would have stated that immediately and in a very definitive manner.

1725
02:11:01,516 --> 02:11:03,137
Everyone should get out and vote.

1726
02:11:04,182 --> 02:11:09,543
on the September 3rd primary, because that's going to determine the person that then goes into the general election.

1727
02:11:09,563 --> 02:11:11,504
In the general election, there's only one person you can vote for.

1728
02:11:11,944 --> 02:11:16,705
So the September 3rd state primary is the election that everyone should vote for.

1729
02:11:17,105 --> 02:11:30,908
And the other thing that I'm appalled that there wasn't more definitive answer to is that I'm here at the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William and Frances Baldwin website, and I think it was Consuelo Escarpilla that brought up what happens

1730
02:11:32,169 --> 02:11:36,045
if someone is registered as a Republican or a Libertarian and

1731
02:11:38,195 --> 02:11:42,476
wants to go and vote in the September 3rd state primary.

1732
02:11:42,716 --> 02:11:48,197
And I think they wouldn't be able to do so because you have to register it as a Democrat or an enrolled.

1733
02:11:48,277 --> 02:11:50,598
And it says here, voting registration deadlines.

1734
02:11:50,998 --> 02:11:59,619
The deadline to register to vote, update your registration, or change your party is 10 days before any election or town meeting.

1735
02:11:59,699 --> 02:12:02,160
So if I go to my calendar, where is it?

1736
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:05,901
I think that puts it on the 24th, which is a Saturday.

1737
02:12:07,161 --> 02:12:24,914
anyone that is registered as either a Republican or a Libertarian needs to change their party affiliation to either Democratic or Unenrolled by Friday, August 23rd, according to what this website says, because otherwise you're not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates.

1738
02:12:25,514 --> 02:12:31,678
And I would hope that this body would definitively state that, because it's extremely important, right?

1739
02:12:32,879 --> 02:12:43,209
And I'm not sure that everyone understands that if they are registered as either Republican or Libertarian, that they know that they are not going to be able to vote for any of these three candidates.

1740
02:12:44,643 --> 02:12:58,312
So, anyways, I just wanted to state that, you know, I'm appalled and disappointed, to be honest, that I think, you know, I would have hoped that this information was clear and absolutely clear, and there's absolutely no doubt about that.

1741
02:12:58,392 --> 02:13:01,794
Oh, would you like it to say, like, two candidates go from September 30th?

1742
02:13:01,814 --> 02:13:02,875
No, no, no, no, it's just one.

1743
02:13:02,915 --> 02:13:03,335
That's it.

1744
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:04,116
That was corrected.

1745
02:13:04,596 --> 02:13:04,796
Sorry?

1746
02:13:05,036 --> 02:13:05,817
I did correct that.

1747
02:13:06,593 --> 02:13:07,793
Yeah, I know, but it wasn't.

1748
02:13:08,013 --> 02:13:12,455
And then about, again, what happens if someone is registered as a party, that wasn't clear.

1749
02:13:13,175 --> 02:13:17,617
I think they need to change their party affiliation 10 days before any election.

1750
02:13:17,977 --> 02:13:19,377
That's the registration deadline.

1751
02:13:19,417 --> 02:13:20,158
Yes, that's right.

1752
02:13:20,298 --> 02:13:22,718
Otherwise, they're not going to be able to vote.

1753
02:13:23,419 --> 02:13:25,159
I appreciate you making the comment.

1754
02:13:25,619 --> 02:13:27,180
As an elected body, we

1755
02:13:28,817 --> 02:13:35,579
Once you start going down that road, you go into the road not just of advising people how to access information, but suggesting a course of action.

1756
02:13:36,139 --> 02:13:41,740
And I don't believe it is the, that any, you know, the city is, if you call the elections office and you say, how do I do this?

1757
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,161
They'll tell you how to do it, but they're not going to say everyone really should do this.

1758
02:13:45,501 --> 02:13:48,682
And that's, that's gets to the point of influencing people toward the direction.

1759
02:13:49,062 --> 02:13:50,382
It's different than providing information.

1760
02:13:50,442 --> 02:13:51,343
No, but what direction?

1761
02:13:51,484 --> 02:13:57,914
It's just that anyone that wants to vote, in order to vote in the primary, is going to have to be either registered... I agree.

1762
02:13:57,954 --> 02:13:59,076
I'm talking about the other piece of it.

1763
02:13:59,376 --> 02:14:00,017
Which one?

1764
02:14:00,158 --> 02:14:04,444
A well-organized Republican write-in candidate could conceivably win the November general election.

1765
02:14:05,345 --> 02:14:05,605
No.

1766
02:14:06,405 --> 02:14:07,706
I'm just saying.

1767
02:14:08,046 --> 02:14:11,147
I agree that on its face, it's not going to happen, right?

1768
02:14:11,227 --> 02:14:12,227
But it's not the job.

1769
02:14:12,327 --> 02:14:15,348
It's completely unbiased and not political.

1770
02:14:15,388 --> 02:14:17,448
The election to Odom is September 3rd.

1771
02:14:17,488 --> 02:14:22,250
And in order to vote, you need to be able to take as a democrat, to run and vote, which means that if you are a Democrat, you need to take as a Democrat.

1772
02:14:22,270 --> 02:14:23,090
I don't want to go that route.

1773
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:28,812
But to say the election is this day, and what happens in November doesn't matter, that gets down the road of suggesting a course of action.

1774
02:14:29,132 --> 02:14:29,232
OK.

1775
02:14:29,852 --> 02:14:30,132
Thank you.

1776
02:14:33,921 --> 02:14:42,390
Any further comment by members of the public in person at the podium or on Zoom?

1777
02:14:43,391 --> 02:14:48,677
Just want to make sure, seeing no hands on Zoom, seeing no one at the podium, the public participation is closed.

1778
02:14:49,251 --> 02:14:49,471
Thank you.

1779
02:14:49,491 --> 02:14:53,196
I would motion to take from the table and approve for third reading 24421.

1780
02:14:54,298 --> 02:15:03,870
On the motion by Vice President Collins to take paper 24421, the South Street Historic District Ordinance, and approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Sen.

1781
02:15:04,071 --> 02:15:05,032
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1782
02:15:05,232 --> 02:15:08,433
Mr. President, if I can.

1783
02:15:08,453 --> 02:15:12,735
I just wanted to thank Mr. Bader this morning I talked to.

1784
02:15:13,115 --> 02:15:17,577
We had some questions that residents had and the reason why in the past I voted no.

1785
02:15:17,797 --> 02:15:34,965
I think that the questions that were asked by those residents and were clear in those answers and I shared those answers to those residents that reached out and I'm in full support with

1786
02:15:35,405 --> 02:15:37,666
with the process as we speak, so thank you.

1787
02:15:37,747 --> 02:15:47,332
Just to note that this is a motion to take from the table and approve, so we're technically not considering it yet, so there's no, there can be discussion about whether or not we want to take it off the table or not, but we're not gonna have it.

1788
02:15:48,033 --> 02:15:49,394
Would you like it to be taken off the table?

1789
02:15:49,414 --> 02:15:49,454
No.

1790
02:15:49,994 --> 02:15:51,735
No, you don't?

1791
02:15:52,295 --> 02:15:52,515
Yes.

1792
02:15:53,396 --> 02:15:54,857
Would you like it to be voted on this evening?

1793
02:15:55,057 --> 02:15:55,237
Yes.

1794
02:15:55,497 --> 02:15:58,559
All right, that's what we can take for public participation, that's the motion before us.

1795
02:16:02,101 --> 02:16:04,063
I don't wanna tell you what to do.

1796
02:16:04,143 --> 02:16:09,126
I'm guessing that having shepherded it to this point, you'd like us to vote on it.

1797
02:16:09,346 --> 02:16:15,571
On the motion to take from the table and approve for third reading by Vice President Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1798
02:16:15,711 --> 02:16:16,852
The second from Councilor Sviggum.

1799
02:16:16,872 --> 02:16:18,053
The second from Councilor Sviggum.

1800
02:16:19,214 --> 02:16:19,894
Councilor Keohokalole.

1801
02:16:19,914 --> 02:16:20,134
Yes.

1802
02:16:21,135 --> 02:16:21,836
Vice President Collins.

1803
02:16:21,856 --> 02:16:21,956
Yes.

1804
02:16:22,676 --> 02:16:23,637
Councilor Lozaro.

1805
02:16:25,258 --> 02:16:25,478
Yes.

1806
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:26,859
Councilor Lemi.

1807
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:27,600
Yes.

1808
02:16:28,608 --> 02:16:29,349
Councilor Scarpelli?

1809
02:16:29,589 --> 02:16:29,829
Yes.

1810
02:16:30,289 --> 02:16:30,830
Councilor Sanchez?

1811
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,190
Yes.

1812
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:32,071
President Bares?

1813
02:16:32,091 --> 02:16:32,311
Yes.

1814
02:16:32,331 --> 02:16:33,752
I have the affirmative and then the negative.

1815
02:16:33,772 --> 02:16:34,713
The motion passes.

1816
02:16:35,173 --> 02:16:37,095
That is taken from the table and approved for third reading.

1817
02:16:37,135 --> 02:16:37,695
It is done.

1818
02:16:37,715 --> 02:16:38,676
It's done?

1819
02:16:38,836 --> 02:16:39,176
Yes.

1820
02:16:39,196 --> 02:16:39,637
Done.

1821
02:16:39,657 --> 02:16:39,797
Okay.

1822
02:16:40,157 --> 02:16:40,817
I can go home now?

1823
02:16:41,538 --> 02:16:42,339
You can go home now.

1824
02:16:42,379 --> 02:16:42,659
Okay.

1825
02:16:42,699 --> 02:16:43,179
No wait.

1826
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,240
Okay.

1827
02:16:45,341 --> 02:16:46,682
Yes, that is approved for third reading.

1828
02:16:46,722 --> 02:16:48,003
The ordinance is now ordained.

1829
02:16:48,363 --> 02:16:53,267
It will go to the mayor to be signed, and then will go to the clerk to be added to the book of ordinances.

1830
02:16:54,268 --> 02:16:57,190
If I may make a personal comment, President Bares.

1831
02:16:57,210 --> 02:16:57,971
Sure.

1832
02:16:58,932 --> 02:17:00,773
Could you just give name and address for the record?

1833
02:17:01,393 --> 02:17:06,596
Yes, Christopher Bader, formerly of 298 High Street.

1834
02:17:09,097 --> 02:17:11,518
I've been on the commission for 23 years.

1835
02:17:12,259 --> 02:17:20,943
I'm going to be retiring in December, and I just want to thank the city of Medford for the opportunity to serve.

1836
02:17:21,223 --> 02:17:23,224
Thank you for 23 years of service, Mr. Bader.

1837
02:17:23,244 --> 02:17:24,745
I wish there were more of us here to clap for you.

1838
02:17:30,168 --> 02:17:31,570
All right, any further motions?

1839
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:33,232
Council Vice President Collins.

1840
02:17:33,272 --> 02:17:36,336
Motion to take from the table and approve for surgery day.

1841
02:17:37,118 --> 02:17:37,598
You all right?

1842
02:17:37,678 --> 02:17:40,142
It broke.

1843
02:17:40,162 --> 02:17:42,385
Sabotage, they say, sabotage.

1844
02:17:42,465 --> 02:17:42,966
I'm all right.

1845
02:17:42,986 --> 02:17:43,686
So you okay?

1846
02:17:43,787 --> 02:17:44,748
My God, I broke the door.

1847
02:17:47,108 --> 02:17:50,271
Seconded by, seconded by Councilor Zahra, Ms.

1848
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:51,753
Cook please call the roll.

1849
02:18:17,161 --> 02:18:17,561
I did that.

1850
02:18:17,862 --> 02:18:18,422
I will tell you.

1851
02:18:18,582 --> 02:18:19,222
I unscrewed it.

1852
02:18:19,262 --> 02:18:26,126
I promised people that had called me that if this resolution came up for third reading, I had to do anything possible to stop it.

1853
02:18:26,246 --> 02:18:26,766
I tried.

1854
02:18:28,127 --> 02:18:29,607
The old Fred G. Sanford.

1855
02:18:29,627 --> 02:18:31,408
