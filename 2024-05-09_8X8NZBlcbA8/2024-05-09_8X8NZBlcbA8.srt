1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:01,674

[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we are live on YouTube, and let me record it locally.

25
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda for today is as approved by the committee on February 4th, 2024, item number 2024-8,

26
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:25,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee will establish an ad hoc subcommittee to establish a process and norms around annual handbook review for the resolution passed unanimously on 11-20-22.

27
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: 2024, which was item 2023-26.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody hasn't lost yet, I'm impressed.

29
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:49,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That one said, be it resolved that the subcommittee will establish at the February 5th school committee meeting, we're a little late, and we'll work to complete the process as close to the original deadline of April 1st, 2024 as reasonably possible.

30
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to take the role.

31
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ntapa?

32
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:54,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

33
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Reinfeld?

34
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Russo present three present we have a quorum so um you know um our charge is to draft well a document in other words a policy about how we would like to proceed with our handbook reviews each year and um

35
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:25,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I did search other school systems and not surprisingly slash not surprisingly, actually, I couldn't find anything.

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So the law does require us to approve them each year.

38
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And my guess is some years we do it in Medford, some years we don't.

39
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:44,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm betting that a lot of school systems are in the same boat, but hopefully we can lay that down and that.

40
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a draft.

41
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,531
[SPEAKER_03]: that I have been writing today that I will share.

42
00:03:52,632 --> 00:04:10,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, is there any history that we need to know about about how this has been done in the past other than inconsistently or in terms of timeline where the administration this year we got a packet full of policies slash draft policies with the final draft forthcoming?

43
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:12,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

44
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do that's thank you because

45
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:20,449
[SPEAKER_03]: while there's nobody watching right this moment, there might be somebody in YouTube and certainly people might watch this later.

46
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:39,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way the intent is that school councils will draft a recommended update to the handbook and then those will come to the school committee for approval, presumably in the spring for the following school year.

47
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:48,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that historically in Medford there, I remember one time approving handbooks or maybe two times in my seven years.

48
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was sort of like, here are the handbooks, you have to approve them.

49
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:53,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

50
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:59,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were at that time, they were all very different handbooks.

51
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously middle schools and high schools and elementary schools have different handbooks, but for all four elementary schools to have different handbooks was kind of,

52
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just that they were formatted differently with different fonts and colors.

53
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:19,881
[SPEAKER_03]: There were actually some policy and content differences that could not be correct.

54
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:26,148
[SPEAKER_03]: The School Committee has a policy, and in some of the books, it was the policy.

55
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,029
[SPEAKER_03]: In others, it was

56
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:32,510
[SPEAKER_03]: something drafted long ago or by a principal or a superintendent.

57
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So the need to clean that up has been an ongoing process.

58
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I will say that we are in much better place now than then.

59
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:43,974
[SPEAKER_03]: The elementary school handbooks, for the most part, are the same.

60
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Content-wise, I believe they're pretty much the same.

61
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:52,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of them is still formatted very differently, but honestly, that is not a hill to die on.

62
00:05:53,156 --> 00:06:16,071
[SPEAKER_03]: um i have a guess as to which one that is but we don't need to talk about that but i have it in front of me as well um but you know again i i do honestly feel like format and you know like some schools have they're named after a person others are named after a river you know like to have your handbooks look different i i could get behind that um but the content

63
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to comply with policy, law, regulations, et cetera.

64
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's sort of the point of this meeting is to get a process in place.

65
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:34,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we review things, first of all, we know that all of the handbooks we've approved are, in fact,

66
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,391
[SPEAKER_03]: complying with that stuff.

67
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:47,841
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's always more interesting things like, you know, how does each school handle a drop off in the morning and pick up and, you know, every school's got a different physical structure.

68
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So those would be different, but

69
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:57,435
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sort of the baseline stuff that we need to make sure we have and that we are doing the approval that we're supposed to do.

70
00:06:57,715 --> 00:07:04,076
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the number one most important thing is that we are supposed to by law put our signature on these things.

71
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're gonna lay that out tonight, how we get there.

72
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you see this okay?

73
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

74
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:31,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am drafting a different policy which we're not here to discuss tonight and it just happened to have it was a schedule timeline kind of a policy which I'm not going to tell you about because of open meeting law, but I realized that it was sort of useful here.

75
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's.

76
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: three phases in my mind.

77
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, this is a dialogue between us.

78
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:45,317
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the initiation of the update process.

79
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:49,860
[SPEAKER_03]: These are dates that I just walked back in my mind when I thought would make sense.

80
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:57,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I do expect the administration to have opinions on this, and we can change the dates, obviously, during the regular meeting.

81
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:02,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my mind, sometime time between August 1 and September 30.

82
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:14,794
[SPEAKER_03]: The process will begin, and this is to begin the handbook update for the following school year, so I have that the superintendent will create a digital versions of each hand school handbook.

83
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:20,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I know using the word digital here is kind of annoying, but I just wanna make sure we are clear.

84
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,774
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not talking about printing huge binders of paper that we're expecting to get anywhere.

85
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:34,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is just a copy of the current, this is the current handbook that will be in use this particular school year that this is happening.

86
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to use dates.

87
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna say during school year,

88
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,203
[SPEAKER_03]: 2024, which began in 2023, this would be the current handbook we're using right now.

89
00:08:49,004 --> 00:09:04,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the superintendent's office, and this is one thing where I'm not clear if maybe it's somebody else in her office or whatever, but that these copies, which I'm calling drafts, will be updated.

90
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:10,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in the office will go through them, looking at school committee policy that has changed within the last year,

91
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,583
[SPEAKER_03]: any district policy and for the uninitiated.

92
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So school committees have a lot of authority over policy.

93
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:31,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the law is written is that if we do not actually say what our policy is, then the superintendent is the policymaker.

94
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Just anything the superintendent says,

95
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:37,456
[SPEAKER_03]: goes as policy, I mean, obviously within the law.

96
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:48,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I've separated them out here because there are plenty of things for which we may have a policy on, or we may make a statement about what we expect and want, but then there's lots of things we don't.

97
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:51,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, whether we should or not is unrelated to this conversation.

98
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So then district policy is,

99
00:09:55,451 --> 00:10:05,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to put superintendent because sometimes it actually ends up being the principal, or it could be at a departmental level of like a science policy.

100
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so I just put district.

101
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think the word district, it might be a better word, but I don't know what it is.

102
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:20,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, any of the changes that have to happen because of changing policies, laws, regulations, legal rulings,

103
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:26,806
[SPEAKER_03]: those need to just be put into the drafts by the central office.

104
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:35,250
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want seven or eight schools running around trying to find out what legal rulings there were this year, what school committee policies changed.

105
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just silly.

106
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be school councils doing that.

107
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:44,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are just volunteers from the school.

108
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:46,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's the right way to go.

109
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's teachers too.

110
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: So a draft,

111
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:58,813
[SPEAKER_03]: that incorporates all of that stuff will be created by the central office, a memorandum detailing each of those changes.

112
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I do not mean, I don't think anybody here expects to include in the memorandum corrections to spelling and punctuation, but each substantive change, there should be an explanation for what it is.

113
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:26,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a copy of the handbooks originally, which are the current operating handbooks, the draft one, the memorandum explaining the changes, and a copy of this policy.

114
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:28,999
[SPEAKER_03]: will be sent to each school principal.

115
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:36,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Roberts will get their version of their handbook with the required things and each of the schools will too.

116
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, each of the handbooks do not necessarily contain, you know, the high school handbook may contain things that the elementary one does not and vice versa.

117
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the initiation of the process.

118
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:55,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect administration will have some tweaks to this and you know,

119
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:01,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is it starts within some reasonable timeframe.

120
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:16,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most important things in my personal opinion are this memorandum of changes so that we are not being asked at the end of this to read a whole manual from a school and just guess what changed from the previous year.

121
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an impossible task.

122
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So next, those things go over to the principal.

123
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:32,285
[SPEAKER_03]: The school councils and I'm not outlining how school councils get created and all that other business that's all the schools have them already.

124
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:39,955
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expected to draft what I'm calling the recommended.

125
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Handbook, so they'll go through it.

126
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have the document that includes all of the changes that had to happen.

127
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:50,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are not changes that the school council is expected to.

128
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'll have opinions on I mean, everybody has opinions, but these are not changes.

129
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,683
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to if the superintendent makes an update because school committee changed the policy.

130
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,745
[SPEAKER_03]: The school council doesn't undo it.

131
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:07,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, this is just, they can make all of the other changes that they want.

132
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:10,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are many changes school councils recommend.

133
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will go through the handbook.

134
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not be confused about why this language suddenly changed because it will be in the memorandum explaining it.

135
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:25,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will generate what's called, John, go ahead.

136
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so quick question.

137
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:28,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's more of like a point of clarification.

138
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:49,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming this is sort of the point the school council's made up of like students, staff, faculty, is this the point for them to kind of give their feedback on like, we're finding that this isn't working or this like we've noticed this uptake in this and we need to do something about it like is this the community's chance to sort of

139
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not feedback, the school council is responsible for providing it.

140
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they may provide us, there's also this school council changes memorandum.

141
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they make a change,

142
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:10,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a substantive change.

143
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really struggling with examples.

144
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a substantive change.

145
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:17,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Not again, not regarding the laws and policies and regulation stuff.

146
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,600
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a change to the handbook and.

147
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say it's about arrival and dismissal.

148
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:24,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

149
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

150
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:34,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's not controversial, they're just gonna say, we've changed this and the principal and everybody thinks this is gonna work better.

151
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one sentence and everybody's happy.

152
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:44,498
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything more challenging, then I can certainly see dialogue going on there.

153
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:52,643
[SPEAKER_03]: But the goal here is also that the school councils don't have to come and stand before us as a school committee for hours on one night.

154
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not expected of them.

155
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also not reasonable.

156
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:07,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Because if they have a concern about a school committee policy, that would be raised outside of this process.

157
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

158
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:14,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they can have a concern, but the policy change isn't going to happen in time for this.

159
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

160
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:25,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I guess I'm more thinking about when the users of the handbook can give feedback on what they're seeing made, like when that period would be essential.

161
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't sure if that was the time for it or not.

162
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:35,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the school councils, I think, are constantly in that mode all year long.

163
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've not been on a school council, but I imagine that things are piling up.

164
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:46,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it's time to start this work, they've got their pile of things that they need to work through.

165
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's between them and, well, the principal is part of the school council, I believe.

166
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,977
[SPEAKER_03]: The listing is in the law, but I forgot it.

167
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:03,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but so this is, you know, this is in every way divorced from school committee so far.

168
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:12,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll create a memorandum as well that just explains their changes, not the required changes.

169
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they will send that recommended handbook

170
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:22,244
[SPEAKER_03]: and the memorandum to the superintendent for review and submission to us.

171
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:29,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put it in here that the superintendent may have opinions on it, but my thoughts on that are this.

172
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:36,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent and central administration staff are not 16, 25, 40 people.

173
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:40,269
[SPEAKER_03]: If a school council and a principal have all approved this,

174
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:47,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't foresee the central administration sitting down to review and decide whether they agree on everything.

175
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:55,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a universe of endless availability of time and resources that doesn't exist in most places, I'm sure.

176
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so I just want it to be like, superintendent gets it.

177
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,225
[SPEAKER_03]: The review is if the superintendent really even wants to review it, and getting it to us.

178
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up is our review.

179
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:16,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put a pretty big timeframe here, but I did wanna make sure it happens before we're in May.

180
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:35,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So for school committee members and you both are, this is your first term, but May has many names in school committee council, school committee circles, because that is when we get 750 invitations to every performance at every grade, at every school,

181
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:44,353
[SPEAKER_03]: and every art show and every presentation from the social studies and the humanities and every single award ceremony.

182
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And May is both joyful and absolutely impossible for school committee members.

183
00:17:51,839 --> 00:18:00,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my mind, thinking about all the other responsibilities we have, I want this thing to be out of the way before May hits because May, I like May,

184
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:07,510
[SPEAKER_03]: if we're able to just focus on the students and the successes of that school year.

185
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If we also have to fit in countless other meetings, which we do, but let's limit it if we can.

186
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so that's the purpose of the timeline.

187
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put that the item on the agenda would be review and approval of school year, and then obviously the number of handbooks.

188
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be put on a regular school committee meeting.

189
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:40,700
[SPEAKER_03]: digital copies of the handbook prior to changes, the recommended handbook, the mandatory changes memorandum, and the school council's changes memorandum will be in our packets.

190
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:50,904
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee will take action such as approval amendments or postpone approval to a subsequent meeting or subcommittee meeting.

191
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I can envision that like

192
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:59,880
[SPEAKER_03]: early on, you know, the first year, maybe even first two years, we may be like, this takes a lot more time.

193
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:13,869
[SPEAKER_03]: But ideally, after we've done this, maybe even only one year, we'll be like, we'll all know to flip to the memorandum, we'll read the memorandum, we'll be like, oh, okay, well, that all makes sense, both of the memorandums.

194
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:21,213
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we won't be going line by line through, you know, dense handbooks from multiple schools.

195
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously people are free to do what they want with their time.

196
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:33,738
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that obviously the first time you ever review a handbook, it's probably a good idea to read the whole thing.

197
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:43,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But considering most of the content doesn't change, it's not a very efficient use of anybody's time to read it again from scratch.

198
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:48,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but in the event that, you know, like title,

199
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:53,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Title IX, is that the one that's got major changes that just happened?

200
00:19:54,344 --> 00:20:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be lots of changes that will come into our handbooks.

201
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:13,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We may, and how that language gets transmitted from the law, I think that's regulation, but how it gets transmitted from the regulation into language that the superintendent is putting into the manual.

202
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:19,927
[SPEAKER_03]: we may have a real interesting set of conversations that need to be happening.

203
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:37,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So that may be like, we send that to a committee of the whole or a subcommittee just to discuss that specific piece, like how this really works in Medford or what we think.

204
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of times we will have no choice.

205
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:42,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that during the previous,

206
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: presidential administration, there were changes and we did not like them, but we also didn't have a decision.

207
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,367
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no decision making for us to do.

208
00:20:52,909 --> 00:21:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make sure we had it out that at the end of this meeting, we will do one of these things to make sure we eventually do approve them.

209
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So would I be so on.

210
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:21,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you wanna discuss this, but since we were just talking about this phase three, step three, sounds like we're talking about approval of handbooks as a whole once all of the discrepancies.

211
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's an item that needs discussion in subcommittee, that handbook is not approved rather than everything approved except for this section.

212
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:33,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a cleaner way to do this.

213
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we only can approve the whole handbook.

214
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:39,387
[SPEAKER_03]: We can amend it.

215
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a better wording for that, you think?

216
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:53,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's just an added sentence around each handbook will be approved.

217
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:54,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let me ask.

218
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:57,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume we're approving handbooks one at a time.

219
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:00,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we approve one handbook at a time?

220
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:02,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We can approve one at a time.

221
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:03,795
[SPEAKER_03]: We can just say they're all good and go.

222
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:05,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but to say, you know,

223
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:14,388
[SPEAKER_02]: approved by the school committee committee will be her handbook.

224
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:22,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we say singular complete approval, meaning it's a, like, it has to be complete, a complete approval of a singular handbook.

225
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:28,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Could that phrasing just before approval, make sense, or is there like some caveat.

226
00:22:28,793 --> 00:22:34,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind that except in a lot of other districts, all the elementary schools have one handbook.

227
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:37,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of value to that.

228
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was the question I asked on April 8th that sent us down a little spiral, and I just walked it back as it was late.

229
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:49,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I mean, singular, complete.

230
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,037
[SPEAKER_01]: By singular, I mean, like, this is the McGlynn handbook.

231
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:54,257
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Brooks handbook.

232
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:58,099
[SPEAKER_01]: If we approve one of them, that is a singular, complete approval.

233
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be in whole.

234
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good message, really, really good.

235
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, both all of us as well as the future school committee members will be like, what did they mean?

236
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we, how do we do that?

237
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, that's the whole purpose of this meeting so we can stop that conversation.

238
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:27,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

239
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:33,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there ever a scenario when we send a handbook back to a school saying, fix this?

240
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:38,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a, you are invited to this subcommittee meeting to discuss this handbook?

241
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:46,831
[SPEAKER_03]: What does... I think that the school council's approval of the handbook is procedural.

242
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:49,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, that doesn't make it the handbook.

243
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:53,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think sending it back is a thing.

244
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We just can change what we want within the, you know, excluding the legal stuff.

245
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,680
[SPEAKER_03]: But

246
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:13,780
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, being collaborative, I would certainly much rather us be like, let's invite them over to discuss this in a subcommittee, rather than just whole cloth, like tearing out something that they took pains to create.

247
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:26,744
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's not really ever something we want, unless, you know, in the weird situation where as a council creates something, and as a committee, we just, a majority of us disagree.

248
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And,

249
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we could make such a change.

250
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:39,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that we've done that before, but again, we've also not approved in a meaningful way before, so.

251
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:50,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it seems to me the main thing, the role that school committee has here, or possibly the superintendent, I guess this is my question at the end of

252
00:24:54,123 --> 00:25:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of phase two here, this point three, the second part, or the first part of it, the school council will send the handbook and memorandum to the superintendent for review.

253
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:07,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to specify what that review entails?

254
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's just sign off, but maybe it's the question about in one and two, because

255
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:26,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time the handbook becomes a problem, and I've certainly received questions from parents about this, is if they perceive that an enforcement of a policy, which is kind of what the handbook lays out, is in conflict with the policy itself.

256
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's doing that reconciliation?

257
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:41,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably it's happening in one... Or is that just what needs to happen in that first review and then the memorandum of changes says,

258
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:54,660
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to make sure that this section, I guess I think there are relevant sections of the handbook that relate to new policy, law, regulation, et cetera.

259
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the memorandum is meant to do is to say, we changed the, I had this, we changed the discipline to match the new bullying.

260
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:24,179
[SPEAKER_02]: policy, or when the out-of-school suspension, when the suspensions policy changed, to say we changed the discipline section of our handbook to comply with this, who checks it?

261
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, right.

262
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that

263
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:46,866
[SPEAKER_03]: The, so if we assume for instance that there's nothing, when the superintendent in the first section is making updates, let's say that the superintendent does not feel that there's any conflict in that particular school's manual and that there's no update required.

264
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:56,588
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing about school councils is they are volunteers and they are, and with anything where there's a volunteer

265
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:02,577
[SPEAKER_03]: where you rely on volunteers, there's gonna be people who, the people who volunteer are interested.

266
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:07,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And why people are interested varies very greatly.

267
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be people, there could be a whole pile of people who are volunteering for school councils right now because they disagree with how we did discipline policies.

268
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:28,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they draft language around that, they may interpret our policies in ways that as a majority of the school committee does not.

269
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,061
[SPEAKER_03]: see that that is how we did it.

270
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the thing about language.

271
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:44,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how hard we try to be as precise and clear as we can be, there's honest interpretation involved.

272
00:27:44,637 --> 00:27:48,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's, of course, always not good faith interpretation involved.

273
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:50,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And so

274
00:27:51,198 --> 00:28:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, if there's something going on in a handbook that is not a good faith interpretation of what we have in policy, well, then we would use our authority to make the change to the handbook.

275
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:14,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, my hope is that that's just not a regular occurrence or something we really need to worry about.

276
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:18,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I am grateful to these school councils that there's all this extra work that they're doing.

277
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:21,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's some of our staff.

278
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but there's always going to be

279
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:32,632
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity for disagreement between the school council and the school committee.

280
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:39,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though the law lays out this whole process, it is our approval that is required.

281
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:46,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my mind, at least I'm pretty sure that's the case, it is really up to us what they say.

282
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:51,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I think nobody writing the law was gonna say school committee sit down and write a school manuals every year.

283
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:53,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's...

284
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:56,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the root of that.

285
00:28:56,687 --> 00:29:05,630
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, a superintendent could also read the changes and be like, that doesn't really comply with the intent of the policy.

286
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,391
[SPEAKER_02]: But are we asking them to do that before they send it to us?

287
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:12,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not asking them to do that.

288
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:12,892
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

289
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think that that's, in a district where we had endless resources and that might be a thing, but none of us believe that that's coming anytime soon.

290
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:40,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I would certainly, I would be happy if the superintendent's office had the capacity to read all of these things and really confirm that they comply with all of our policies, but it's a huge, huge undertaking.

291
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that,

292
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting us through this the first time is the part that's going to be hard because it's going to be more work for every single group involved.

293
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that once we're through it once, it should be dramatically easier.

294
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:04,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from the fact that there'll be examples of what the memorandums should look like.

295
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: People will perhaps number their sections of their handbooks so they can refer to them.

296
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:11,325
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be page numbers everywhere.

297
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:19,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those things just happen naturally when you have to start writing about another document in a document.

298
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And that won't be easy the first time.

299
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:31,428
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, like anything, like all policy, we go through this, we do it for a year, and we're like, oh, that just stunk.

300
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:32,729
[SPEAKER_03]: What were we thinking?

301
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:33,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's change it.

302
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:43,165
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely happy to change it, happy to throw it all away if it turns out it was just not a good idea.

303
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: But the most important thing to me is that we can approve these handbooks and approve them knowing what we're approving.

304
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:54,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of the unfair thing.

305
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Friday we get 400 pages of handbooks.

306
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a slow reader, but I think for fast readers to get through it by Monday is a challenge.

307
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The memorandums, I think, is perfect.

308
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:11,004
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what's changed.

309
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your track changes of the.

310
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:15,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love this.

311
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:21,211
[SPEAKER_03]: We could just use track changes, but I don't want us to get into the specifics of the technology.

312
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:25,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it also requires that school councils are all using Google.

313
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they don't necessarily have Google accounts with the district.

314
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:31,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just goes wild from there.

315
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:47,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I think one thing that we do need the superintendent's office to do unless this is us, but is to confirm consistency across elementary schools right if one elementary school makes a change.

316
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:49,638
[SPEAKER_02]: To something.

317
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:56,317
[SPEAKER_02]: that affects the other ones or the two middle schools.

318
00:31:56,377 --> 00:32:01,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I might've missed it, but one of them seems to have a homework policy and the other doesn't.

319
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems like a problem in equity for students that making expectations clear.

320
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:14,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I might just have missed it in this as I flipped through this large binder that we got.

321
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:27,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, a new phase three, superintendent, I'm just gonna put that as- I think it's just, what is the superintendent review?

322
00:32:27,556 --> 00:32:45,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do think, if you get a memorandum that says you need to change this to comply with that policy and one school changes it in one way and another changes it in a different way, or is this first memorandum saying, no, no, this needs to change in this specific way.

323
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:54,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think- We're to say that all handbooks have the, you know, I think there's an important, there's a useful conversation to have.

324
00:32:54,331 --> 00:33:04,537
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to have it this year about should each elementary school have, should there be a Medford Elementary Schools expectations and then school-specific procedures?

325
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:13,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Should there be one elementary school handbook with an addendum for the Roberts, for the Missittuck, for the McGlynn?

326
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:16,003
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think there's some consistency that,

327
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,407
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to happen.

328
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a heck of a job for the first time through.

329
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:30,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that's right.

330
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:33,292
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that, just making it number four instead of a whole other?

331
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:36,773
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

332
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

333
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:39,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

334
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:43,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really important point and one that has come up many times in my time as well.

335
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And it handbooks, the,

336
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:51,066
[SPEAKER_03]: recess and homework.

337
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:52,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

338
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:53,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

339
00:33:53,808 --> 00:34:14,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those are the three things I think we hear about consistency on levels, consistency across schools, consistency between school protocol and official policy, and then consistency between what parents are told verbally in the moment and what's written down in one or another location.

340
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:26,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So this process can't address all of that, but it can address the consistency across schools with alignment with official policy.

341
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:27,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

342
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:31,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that you just said something reminds me, like we want to make sure also that this policy is

343
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if all the hair books were perfect today, we'd want this to still be the policy and we don't have to like keep coming back and changing it.

344
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, and that's why I like that consistency language.

345
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:57,357
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, the superintendent can, with this first phase, which I don't honestly know that happens at all right now, but if this first phase isn't happening and it begins to happen,

346
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean the superintendent herself, but under her direction.

347
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:09,047
[SPEAKER_03]: But this cleanup of inconsistent language can happen.

348
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,270
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to create a draft to send to them.

349
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:20,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's already corrected in there, kind of getting out ahead of it.

350
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:26,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a process between her and I think the principals and school councils.

351
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:38,216
[SPEAKER_03]: What else we got?

352
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:46,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to double check that there were tables of contents and everything, which there aren't.

353
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:52,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we mandate any parts of handbooks that every handbook must have this section or?

354
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

355
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if that's part of this policy.

356
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:05,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that might be a very, that might be a resolution we should work on is that we will draft a,

357
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,601
[SPEAKER_03]: a handbook schema or whatever the right word would be.

358
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we do it for our agendas and for other things.

359
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:20,684
[SPEAKER_03]: We say like, this is the structure we want.

360
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:27,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And some, you know, some handbooks, you open it up and there'll be like, mass general law quoted.

361
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:32,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think most everybody can agree that no,

362
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:43,367
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to include it, put it in an appendix, but in fact, maybe just don't put it at all and just say what the law number is, because exactly two people per year are going to read it.

363
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:50,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do know people are looking and saying, look, this says right here.

364
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it can be at the end.

365
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:55,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely at the end, but I don't.

366
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Stability of our handbooks, some of them is,

367
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:01,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, because some of these have federal laws included.

368
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these say, we've included the policies we think are most relevant to elementary school students.

369
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:15,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nobody says, here, go to this website, which who would want to, knowing that website where our policies live?

370
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:16,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

371
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:17,265
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.

372
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think a nice,

373
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:35,632
[SPEAKER_03]: addendum would be great, but some of them it's very much like, welcome to this school, and then you see language on the Mass General Law website, and you're just like, what does that even say?

374
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not welcoming.

375
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:41,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that handbooks really do need to be welcoming.

376
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember who was recently talking to about this, but they're like, you should open the handbook and read the first page and have a really a strong sense already of your expectations as a student.

377
00:37:53,419 --> 00:38:01,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it shouldn't be that you have to go 42 pages in, start to kind of grasp what's expected of you because nobody reads the whole thing.

378
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,047
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a different conversation, I think.

379
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:13,650
[SPEAKER_03]: either for another policy or just for the councils to have themselves.

380
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:23,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the high school principal is actually working on a whole new format for that one.

381
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:26,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't seen it or anything, but I'd be very interested.

382
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the one that they gave us has a bunch of yellow highlighting that says, this is changing.

383
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:35,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

384
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of this is to prevent some of that from happening too.

385
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:46,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's helpful when policy respects all of the people in the process as people who have lives and other things to do.

386
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:57,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got that binder that the rest of us got, it didn't, and frankly, it just didn't feel very respectful.

387
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, really, we're gonna go through this and know what's different this year from last year.

388
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:13,759
[SPEAKER_03]: and not to be unfair to anybody, but like the process as it's currently happening is not respectful of anybody's time.

389
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

390
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:27,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I will say when it comes time for me to review, I like having it in hard copy, but.

391
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying we couldn't get hard copies.

392
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, but you know, do you want to read four elementary

393
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:42,028
[SPEAKER_03]: school handbooks when in fact, much of it will be the same.

394
00:39:44,889 --> 00:39:46,090
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a fast reader though, I think.

395
00:39:47,951 --> 00:40:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but is that, and then I guess in phase three here, we haven't said, so it says the school committee will receive copies and we will approve it, amend it or discuss further.

396
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:07,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean everyone is reading every handbook?

397
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, honestly, that is sort of the expectation, that everyone is reading every handbook.

398
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:19,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my mind, once we've done this once, everyone will just need to read the memorandums.

399
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So is maybe is so is that I guess is that a separate question in terms of onboarding new members is you should have the handbook so you know what's happening in the schools on paper.

400
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:39,936
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you know we've talked about onboarding of new members i'm going to move don't mind my.

401
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:46,424
[SPEAKER_03]: screen going my video going out, because I need to plug in but um.

402
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: The onboarding of new members has been a topic.

403
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:54,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I have a Google Doc with a very long list of things for new members.

404
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:57,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I did send some of the things out.

405
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:06,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is that there's too much.

406
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:10,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And so figuring out how to deal with that is a problem.

407
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:15,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too much.

408
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:19,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I mean, I would say it's an impossible list of things.

409
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:27,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, when you go to a school committee conference and when you go to the, the, the, the, the.

410
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Charting the course.

411
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Charting the course.

412
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,182
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a, I'm pretty sure it's a conversation that happens.

413
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:41,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been to several of them, but you know, there's this whole concept of becoming an effective school committee member and it's,

414
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:50,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It can sound a bit snotty or snooty, and it's not meant that way.

415
00:41:51,102 --> 00:42:00,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the depth and breadth of knowledge you need to bring all year long to every conversation and things that are changing is frankly staggering.

416
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:08,658
[SPEAKER_03]: What that means is you're adding more each year you're in office.

417
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:22,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody, I don't believe, and I would doubt anybody who says otherwise, nobody in the history of school committees has been elected and been effective immediately, maybe on an issue, for sure.

418
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: but not like on the breadth of things that we are required to approve.

419
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Our list of presentations on our policy manual is several pages long.

420
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:40,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to receive all of those each year and all of us are supposed to understand and approve them.

421
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes you a while just to read the list.

422
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:47,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that,

423
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:56,607
[SPEAKER_03]: What we decide to include in onboarding, which I know we're slightly off topic, is we might want to have a subcommittee meeting on at some point, a different one.

424
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:02,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Because how do you bring people up to speed so they are effective as quickly as possible?

425
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:08,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the truth is, is the whole committee benefits when the new members are effective as quickly as possible.

426
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:09,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We all do, you know.

427
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not that you won't have to ask the questions for which everybody else in the room already knows the answer to.

428
00:43:17,771 --> 00:43:19,693
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always going to happen.

429
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:21,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine.

430
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:33,245
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there are some basic things, and I don't just mean Robert's Rules and Open Meeting Law, that you kind of have to know.

431
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nobody out there teaching them.

432
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:38,049
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't teach them at Charting the Course, because every district's different.

433
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:44,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good question and a hard one to answer in my opinion.

434
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:45,697
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

435
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:48,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't mean to take us quite so far off topic.

436
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of this policy, I think the staging is good.

437
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The dates seem reasonable to me.

438
00:43:56,422 --> 00:44:07,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the people carrying out phases one and two have opinions on that.

439
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:08,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

440
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:12,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, our approval, by the way, I mean, I gave us a February, March and April, three months.

441
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:20,347
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get these handbooks and we get the memorandum, it's, we just do it in one weekend.

442
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, we don't need three months.

443
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:28,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they say they need more time in certain sections of this process, we have it to give to them.

444
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,169
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just cut some of our time down here.

445
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted it, I like going early and having them pat tough.

446
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,211
[SPEAKER_03]: more time.

447
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:42,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, the councils are meeting in March to start talking about the handbook.

448
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know,

449
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,860
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we're approving handbooks the last week of June at best or just not doing it.

450
00:44:55,441 --> 00:45:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if this October to January school council thing is reasonable at all.

451
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I haven't been on a school council.

452
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:14,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know when they form and I'm sure they form at different times with each school and whether or not, if everybody's just coming over and staying around for another year,

453
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:21,195
[SPEAKER_03]: then, you know, oh, it's born, we agreed, and we're just going to keep the same council versus a whole turnover.

454
00:45:21,215 --> 00:45:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I mean, I only know about the Roberts because Mia said, Oh, yes, I'm on this.

455
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

456
00:45:29,908 --> 00:45:31,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, former member of stone.

457
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I, this is a, this is a, in my mind, this is a draft policy that if we report out of here positively, then the committee and the administration can respond to and I, I will.

458
00:45:47,293 --> 00:46:07,241
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do approve it tonight to go to the full committee, I will ask the superintendent when I send her this document to send it to principals for their feedback, you know, to come to the committee or to email all of us so we can bring our notes on how we might want to change it at the meeting.

459
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:19,469
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a policy so it would be you know first reading and then this is not what we would want to just waive the second reading we want people to have a chance to let it soak in.

460
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:27,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to say in phase 1.1 the superintendent or their designee

461
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a designee within central administration?

462
00:46:35,454 --> 00:46:43,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it needs to be clear that they're not designating it to... Yeah, so it always is or designee.

463
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:52,030
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time it is not or designee, we actually would say, we'd have to specify that only the superintendent can do something.

464
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:55,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that is implied kind of across the board.

465
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:58,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know we've had things saying, well, we didn't mean that you should do it.

466
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:00,085
[SPEAKER_02]: We meant that your office should do it.

467
00:47:00,646 --> 00:47:00,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

468
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:07,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's, you know, part of that is that also the superintendent is the only person we actually can have, we have authority over.

469
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:12,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, but no, we, we don't have to say that.

470
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's something that I very much wanted.

471
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:19,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I, for a while when I was writing policy, I always went or designee.

472
00:47:19,397 --> 00:47:19,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm like,

473
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:25,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, it's like putting the words Medford in our school committee policy everywhere.

474
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:28,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to remind myself to go take the words Medford out.

475
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Medford school committee policy.

476
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously we don't mean Belmont.

477
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:34,563
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll do this.

478
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:39,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And the length of this thing matters greatly.

479
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:49,337
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who reads very, very slowly, I'm very attuned to this becoming too verbose.

480
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:54,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Verbose enough, but not... I mean, there's also this...

481
00:47:55,245 --> 00:48:00,970
[SPEAKER_03]: other conversation, we're off topic slightly here again, but like just saying the committee is actually sufficient.

482
00:48:02,271 --> 00:48:15,781
[SPEAKER_03]: But whenever we're talking about things like this, where there's a school council, that's when I decide we need to go verbose because, you know, like with the school building committee, you can't say the committee, do you mean us, the school building committee?

483
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:16,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean the school committee?

484
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:19,304
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I see that, that's...

485
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:25,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard to find consistency because you'll end up with some policies where you're like, oh, you said school committee everywhere here.

486
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but there was a reason.

487
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

488
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:31,932
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

489
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:35,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just put this up on the screen so I can read everything, I think?

490
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:37,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it?

491
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:38,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you not see it all?

492
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:39,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me.

493
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:39,556
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

494
00:48:39,976 --> 00:48:42,157
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yep, that's great for me.

495
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't need the, that magnification that you had before was great.

496
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:48,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

497
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:52,750
[SPEAKER_02]: 125.

498
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:52,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just needed it scrolled.

499
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I can see the end of three.

500
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:58,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to see the policy information section.

501
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:00,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry.

502
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:05,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing I have to notice, which is the typo on phase 3.2 mandatory.

503
00:49:06,316 --> 00:49:12,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I have three to mandatory?

504
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:12,900
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with that?

505
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

506
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:13,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

507
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:20,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I googled it just in case I didn't understand linguistics for a second, but member member and Tapa has been finding Dory.

508
00:49:20,823 --> 00:49:22,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mandatory.

509
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:26,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny, I thought I copied it and I had mandatory here.

510
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my I paid for?

511
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:31,746
[SPEAKER_03]: What's my call it?

512
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing that should find all my typos.

513
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:36,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Docs does it automatically.

514
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought so too, but I don't see it.

515
00:49:38,748 --> 00:49:40,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have turned it off by accident.

516
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

517
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:43,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna have to look at that,

518
00:49:45,922 --> 00:49:46,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I do rely on that.

519
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:49,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the timeframe seemed logistical to me.

520
00:49:49,685 --> 00:50:00,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the cushion to an RN of like, hey, if these things need to get moved back, ours is significant so that way we're the ones who are kind of paid to do the work and can kind of speed things along if we have to.

521
00:50:02,857 --> 00:50:06,821
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in my experience of drafting policy and drafting

522
00:50:07,936 --> 00:50:13,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Dates, we did it with elections with our student council and like, it was like, it looked great on paper.

523
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:14,323
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this makes sense.

524
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:18,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just executed the constitute the new constitution this year.

525
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:20,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, no, we need to, we need to do this a lot earlier.

526
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:24,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be something we live and learn that we can.

527
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:28,156
[SPEAKER_01]: But logistically, having a month for initiation.

528
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:41,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm right in thinking that, because the handbooks have to be final and approved for students to receive at the end of August when school starts, because I know they sign off.

529
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:47,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, yes, but again- No, I want this done by May 1st.

530
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:55,437
[SPEAKER_02]: May has been terrible and with our very wise decision to push, bring the budgeting process forward.

531
00:50:57,466 --> 00:51:00,487
[SPEAKER_02]: it just may, it compounds may.

532
00:51:00,787 --> 00:51:04,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not saying push budgeting back because knowing all this early is great.

533
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a disconnect?

534
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:15,214
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my pedantry on display here, that the digital versions being created in phase 1.1

535
00:51:17,802 --> 00:51:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: is what becomes the draft digital handbooks.

536
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:24,984
[SPEAKER_03]: As I wrote it, I was like, how can I connect those things?

537
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:27,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping is a better way to describe.

538
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to not use the word digital.

539
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:31,747
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

540
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to assume that it's implied.

541
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:52,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what you're asking is for the superintendent to duplicate the current year's handbook and update that to create the upcoming year draft.

542
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,871
[SPEAKER_02]: The upcoming school year.

543
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we'll leave that.

544
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:24,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'll say there's copies of the handbook.

545
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to specify the format because some members prefer digital, some prefer papers.

546
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:33,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave that out of there.

547
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:33,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

548
00:52:55,886 --> 00:53:06,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if the superintendent notices an inconsistency and makes an update, do then they need to have, is there a third memorandum?

549
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:16,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this many memorandums, but do we need to know that the superintendent updated the Brooks handbook to match the Roberts handbook?

550
00:53:27,563 --> 00:53:36,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do they do the superintendent have to go back to the school council and say hi for consistency reasons I'm making this change I.

551
00:54:05,936 --> 00:54:06,516
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

552
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:13,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to resist giving it a name, because it's one that we may never see.

553
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's good.

554
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have any further questions or comments.

555
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide the memorandum to whom?

556
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:25,542
[SPEAKER_02]: To school committee and the school council, or?

557
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

558
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, sounds good.

559
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:51,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remove the provide before create on the second line of number four.

560
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Backseat typing.

561
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better than finding out what I typed later was like, didn't make sense.

562
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandatory.

563
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:08,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

564
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I would call these mandatory changes, but that'll just confuse things.

565
00:55:18,403 --> 00:55:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we then, we're in subcommittee, do we motion to send this to full committee?

566
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:27,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Passing it by the administration first.

567
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:31,498
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we would, so let me stop sharing.

568
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:35,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I can find that, stop share, great.

569
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to move to my bedroom where my power cord is.

570
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:44,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to do that horrible thing where people have meetings from their bed.

571
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:52,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, I have too many windows open, sorry.

572
00:55:53,732 --> 00:56:02,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So the motion, the basic motion would be to report out

573
00:56:02,742 --> 00:56:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Policy, BC, whatever the policy ID was, I just had it in my face a second ago.

574
00:56:08,886 --> 00:56:09,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

575
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:16,290
[SPEAKER_03]: H-C, C-H-C-A-dash-B, C-H-C-A-dash-B.

576
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:23,914
[SPEAKER_03]: To report policy.

577
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not positively, what's the word?

578
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:38,819
[SPEAKER_02]: What comes after the word?

579
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:43,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I can figure out words in context, but I don't have enough of it for this one.

580
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:52,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so to report policy blah out to the full committee for... Adoption?

581
00:56:53,543 --> 00:57:04,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Adoption with subcommittee, with unanimous, well, not with subcommittee recommendation.

582
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:06,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read it out loud.

583
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:14,599
[SPEAKER_03]: To report policy CHCA-B out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.

584
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,081
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the other thing that we were just talking about?

585
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:22,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting administrative, getting the approval from the administration and or principals.

586
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration and school principals, I'll just say principals, so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee.

587
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,184
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting where the policy will be considered.

588
00:57:56,204 --> 00:58:00,390
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

589
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to read it one more time or do you all get that?

590
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:05,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I can read it one more time.

591
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:07,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I never like people- Second reading, no.

592
00:58:09,176 --> 00:58:20,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So the motion, which one of you all would have to say so moved, to report policy CHCA-B out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.

593
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration and principals so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee meeting where the policy will be considered.

594
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:31,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So moved.

595
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:32,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

596
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:35,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

597
00:58:46,638 --> 00:58:47,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

598
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So, on the motion Member Ntapa.

599
00:58:54,892 --> 00:58:55,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

600
00:58:56,615 --> 00:58:57,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rheinfeld.

601
00:58:57,696 --> 00:58:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

602
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, in the affirmative, the draft policy is reported out.

603
00:59:05,164 --> 00:59:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for this wonderful work.

604
00:59:07,905 --> 00:59:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't look forward to having to actually do all this work on the first time through.

605
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of this conversation for this meeting or is that the follow-on motion once this is reported out?

606
00:59:23,835 --> 00:59:27,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't honestly see this, we'll be doing any of this this school year.

607
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:29,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

608
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:30,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

609
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:36,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nobody's gonna be able to draft any memorandums at the timeline we're in right now.

610
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:43,024
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I mean, do we need, do we just need to approve these as is once we get the?

611
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what we do this time around, I don't know.

612
00:59:48,229 --> 00:59:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we may in fact,

613
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:58,603
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if folks get time to read them all, somebody definitely should make an emotion to approve them, but they have to be on the agenda for us to do that, and they aren't.

614
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:09,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's fairly awkward for me to say out loud in a meeting, especially recorded, that maybe we end up doing the proper thing in approving them this year.

615
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Alas, we have also not done that for many years.

616
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:17,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like I'm suggesting we break the law and do something that's never been done before.

617
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:31,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, yeah, we can talk, you know, maybe you and I could talk offline about how we would want to do this, or you could talk to another member and say, like, so how do we get these approved?

618
01:00:31,823 --> 01:00:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to approve them?

619
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the current policy is we don't have a policy, just they have to be approved.

620
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:40,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

621
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:44,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Until this policy goes into effect, we are not breaking our own policy.

622
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:46,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, that's correct.

623
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:52,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, looking around other districts, all they have is that same language, they have to be approved.

624
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:56,828
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment about when, what happens if they don't, no comment about

625
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:06,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it too late to amend this policy to say this policy will be effective as of August 1st, 2024?

626
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too late, but it's also not necessary because unless policy specific, I don't know if this is the law, but I'm, this is definitely how everybody operates.

627
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:23,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless a policy says effective immediately, it is intended, implied to begin the next school year, July 1.

628
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:29,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought our rule said it's effective immediately unless indicated otherwise.

629
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:32,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear I read that somewhere.

630
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,140
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, let's take a peek.

631
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got the page open.

632
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

633
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:38,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm dragging this out.

634
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:44,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, that's not it.

635
01:01:46,484 --> 01:01:47,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Governance.

636
01:01:49,365 --> 01:01:51,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish this tab could move.

637
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're right.

638
01:02:15,044 --> 01:02:22,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Rule 46, the policy will take effect immediately unless another date is specified.

639
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I should point out that immediately, we're already past the end date of this implementation on this.

640
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:30,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So immediately does mean August 1st.

641
01:02:32,412 --> 01:02:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We can echo back to April.

642
01:02:34,072 --> 01:02:35,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking your word on that.

643
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:37,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm just making it up as I go, of course.

644
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:44,090
[SPEAKER_03]: But since all these dates are now passed, I don't think we could reasonably think that we have to have done this.

645
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:46,071
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that sounds about right to me.

646
01:02:46,211 --> 01:02:48,193
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's outside of the time we're dialoguing.

647
01:02:48,293 --> 01:02:50,615
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that does make sense to amend it.

648
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:56,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But right, if this was April 28th, we'd be having a different conversation, I think.

649
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,100
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's May 8th.

650
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're OK.

651
01:03:00,363 --> 01:03:01,023
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my sense.

652
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:05,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't even think about that, member Ratcliffe.

653
01:03:05,189 --> 01:03:07,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that up, because that would have been fun.

654
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:09,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

655
01:03:09,433 --> 01:03:09,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

656
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:27,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when we passed the policy on out-of-school suspensions, we actually passed it in December, and we specified implementation for September 1 of the following year, because we expected there to be substantial effort to

657
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,251
[SPEAKER_03]: be in compliance.

658
01:03:31,031 --> 01:03:33,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a really important question, is when does something start?

659
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:41,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for bringing it up and for reminding me that the policy I wrote, the rule I wrote, actually I had backwards in my head.

660
01:03:44,038 --> 01:03:49,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless there's any other discussion, is there anything?

661
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:56,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my only question is, when we bring this to the floor, do we need to talk about this year's handbooks?

662
01:03:59,529 --> 01:04:05,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we would do that because it wouldn't be on the agenda.

663
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:07,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

664
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:10,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess maybe I'm asking if it needs to get added to the agenda.

665
01:04:12,357 --> 01:04:12,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.

666
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:16,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

667
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have not received yet the three updated handbooks.

668
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:27,567
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got an email saying that we have them and that physical copies will be given to us.

669
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Timing me.

670
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:38,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, like, like literally 20 minutes ago, we got the three of them, and we will be giving hard copies out for the May 20 meeting.

671
01:04:38,814 --> 01:04:39,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

672
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:44,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So then yeah, that seems like a really good time for us to get around to actually approving them.

673
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:56,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so, but that's not a motion of this subcommittee that we review handbooks for approval by the end of the school year.

674
01:04:59,127 --> 01:05:02,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's outside the scope of our agenda of this meeting.

675
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

676
01:05:03,171 --> 01:05:05,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I guess we didn't have that conversation.

677
01:05:06,394 --> 01:05:09,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't make any decisions.

678
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:13,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

679
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:14,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

680
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:15,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So moved.

681
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:22,469
