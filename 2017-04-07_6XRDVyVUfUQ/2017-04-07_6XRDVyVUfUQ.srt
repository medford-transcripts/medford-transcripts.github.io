1
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,518
[SPEAKER_07]: April 15th, 2013 is a day no one will ever forget.

2
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a day of horror and sorrow, but it also inspired a unified community and pride for our city.

3
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:22,904
[SPEAKER_07]: April 16th was not your average game day for the Medford High varsity softball team.

4
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:28,688
[SPEAKER_07]: With yesterday's events fresh in their mind, one woman's story touched a girl's heart and that was Crystal Campbell.

5
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Crystal was a Medford High alum.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And a former softball player.

7
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:36,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So the team thought that it was only fitting to dedicate the rest of their season to her.

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Four softball seasons later, Medford High Softball continues to support Crystal.

9
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Through tournaments and selling Medford Strong t-shirts.

10
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And their proceeds go to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

11
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:50,112
[SPEAKER_06]: From then on, Medford Softball has done all in their power to carry on Crystal's legacy.

12
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:03,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I will visit the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and say a prayer.

13
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:23,317
[SPEAKER_03]: This garden is a fitting tribute to Crystal, Sunflower, Mark, Baseball Bro, Lindsey, Brooks, and Sean Badge.

14
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:37,342
[SPEAKER_05]: In the days, weeks, and years following the horrific events, these families, first responders, and survivors have demonstrated pure strength by their actions and words.

15
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:44,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I will attend the Boston Marathon to support the many runners who are trying to make a difference.

16
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:05,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing this for four years, the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run.

17
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right by the Peace Garden.

18
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:20,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make a difference in the Medford community by working with young adults every day to make Medford High School the best school.

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a difference by supporting my students to be successful.

20
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make a difference by making everyone around me smile.

21
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make a difference by praying for those in need.

22
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:46,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to celebrate One Medford Day by honoring the victims of the Boston Marathon, particularly Crystal Campbell.

23
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchase a Medford Strong t-shirt to support the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

24
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:56,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to make a difference by doing random acts of kindness and making sure all the students at Medford High graduate.

25
00:02:56,284 --> 00:03:00,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a moment of silence in honor of the Boston Marathon victims.

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:07,932
[SPEAKER_02]: is I will get to know students, get to know as many students as I can, and support them and learn about them.

27
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,593
[SPEAKER_03]: We will take a moment of silence to honor the Boston Marathon victims.

28
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:23,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment of silence in honor of the Boston Marathon victims.

29
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:30,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a donation to the Crystal Campbell Fund, and I challenge you to do the same thing.

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make a difference by attending the softball tournament in the name of Crystal Campbell.

31
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustangs on three!

32
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three!

33
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustangs!

34
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:56,011
[SPEAKER_03]: A big part of Crystal's life was Medford High School and the activities that she participated in with the band and softball.

35
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,474
[SPEAKER_07]: We are Medford Strong!

36
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you, Crystal!
