1
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to get started?

2
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I see somebody in the waiting room.

3
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we?

4
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who that is.

5
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:06,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

6
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:08,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

7
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:11,134
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let them in and see what happens.

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:11,575
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

9
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, we think that's the Zoom bomber.

10
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:15,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

11
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:16,757
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to join every single meeting.

12
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

13
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So just leave them.

14
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:19,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

15
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:20,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

16
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:25,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay, then let's carry on.

17
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay, so I'll.

18
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick us off here, so please be advised that on December 8th.

19
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:38,567
[SPEAKER_04]: 2025 at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom.

[SPEAKER_04]: So three present, zero absent.

34
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, okay, so since we met last.

35
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, just right immediately before this meeting, I was trying to do some work to get our winding conversation onto 1 page.

36
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I have a plan to do that.

37
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to talk to you all through that.

38
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:01,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have some specific questions to move things into the right place.

39
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That we can go through and then if there's any members of the public who have questions or comments, we can hear from them as well.

40
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:13,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sounds like a plan.

41
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:17,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so let me share my screen.

42
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, can you all see my screen?

43
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:39,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

44
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

45
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:43,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

46
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

47
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:54,818
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was looking at this, I had some question, I just had some questions about some of these projects that are in progress.

48
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:04,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Namely, like, are they finished or are they still in progress so that I can put them in their rightful home?

49
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So the district wide security updates.

50
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so that is an ongoing project with cyber calm as the vendor motor rollers, the manufacturer.

51
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: They have completed probably 95% of the work at the high school.

52
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:24,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Same at maybe 90% of veterans.

53
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working at Andrews.

54
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,134
[SPEAKER_02]: They're at Curtis Tufts now, actually tonight.

55
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:33,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And they hope to be completed by like the mid-January range.

56
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've got all the wiring run.

57
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:38,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They're now doing the device installation.

58
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going around installing cameras, door hardware.

59
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We're training users.

60
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the halo sensors, which are vape

61
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,747
[SPEAKER_02]: and noise detectors up and running at the high school and the McGlynn.

62
00:04:51,728 --> 00:05:01,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have some training on Friday scheduled with the high school and the McGlynn and Andrews admin team about the software and searching and all that kind of stuff.

63
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in full swing and we hope to be completed mid-January.

64
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just said January, February because, you know, blizzards and snow and whatnot.

65
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

66
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's great.

67
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's elementary, the work hasn't begun or that is also 90%.

68
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,498
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got all the wiring done at the elementary schools.

69
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:23,199
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go do the hardware next.

70
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would call them 50% done, the elementaries.

71
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:26,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

72
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,807
[SPEAKER_02]: At the high school, they did all the wiring, all the devices, a few punch list items left.

73
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And you said 50%?

74
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:42,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say at the elementaries, because all the wiring is done at the Brooks, the Roberts, and Mississippi.

75
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:46,316
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to go now install the devices and configure things and put the server in.

76
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:49,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's roughly, I would say, that's half the battle.

77
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,978
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hard stuff to do.

78
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: The easier stuff is putting out the devices.

79
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next one was the freight elevator and motor controls at MHS.

80
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so the motor has been replaced.

81
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,411
[SPEAKER_02]: They found some additional issues.

82
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:11,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They were replacing those, some parts have been replaced because it's not been used for long enough for a while.

83
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they are going to do an inspection.

84
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hope that's finished in the next couple of months.

85
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:21,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Elevators are notoriously hard to get everything done and inspected and whatnot.

86
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:26,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And expensive.

87
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, very.

88
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

89
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:57,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the network closet mini splits, I had this as part of the HVAC project.

90
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still true?

91
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good question.

92
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:11,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a discussion about that last week, as we reviewed the budget and started to talk to jail about the presentation they're going to be doing about the project coming up in December 15 at school committee.

93
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So original the original budget for the project listed $180,000 to do the mini splits at all of the schools.

94
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:25,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the Roberts was done path this past summer and was actually the last fiscal year.

95
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:30,010
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not done the Brooks or the Mesa tuck the McGlynn or the Andrews.

96
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but now they're kind of saying that that money was not part of that project that was moved into the school.

97
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:36,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Budget.

98
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I was told the end of last week.

99
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:44,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do have extraordinary repair money with that's listed as part of the work to be done.

100
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but those have not been launched yet.

101
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we have funding or do we not have funding?

102
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is money in the extraordinary repair project that could be put towards it.

103
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:03,516
[SPEAKER_02]: The extraordinary repair project has a lot of things that need to be addressed in there.

104
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:13,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so we're looking at, you know, what we can afford this year and potentially fault something next year if necessary, but that's something that Noel and I and Jerry are working on.

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

106
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken, who said that the money was moved into the schools?

107
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was Brenda.

108
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:35,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda Pike was talking about it, because we were working with JLL talking about where the change orders are and how those are being funded and the extended time of the project.

109
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's three lines outside of the project.

110
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:44,114
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the mini splits, the other is the McGlynn roof, and then contingency for the roof.

111
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I don't know what that means, though.

112
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, was the allocation we got

113
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:55,091
[SPEAKER_01]: for July one, just assume to include this amount or additional funds.

114
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that means moved into the school budget.

115
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little foggy to me.

116
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:07,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the original from Jerry, that the original, um, extraordinary repair line was submitted much higher.

117
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:12,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end in June, in June, when the budget was finally resolved, that it got cut back.

118
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's part of the, where the money kind of went and it's not all there or not.

119
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the extraordinary repair list that I have, as far as what was, what was the project assigned to it is much greater than what was left in the budget at the end of the, when the budget was finally approved.

120
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:29,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

121
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:31,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know Noel is on the call.

122
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:45,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Noel, can we get, can we take the fuzziness away on this somehow and find out, you know, the funds that were, those were funds that were still in the city side, if I'm correct.

123
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:50,678
[SPEAKER_01]: or were those on the school side already in last fiscal year?

124
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started off on the city side.

125
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I apologize.

126
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:05,531
[SPEAKER_00]: They started off on the school side when we wanted an extra about $600,000 in extraordinary maintenance compared to what we finally approved of.

127
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:12,778
[SPEAKER_00]: In June, the mayor allocated a couple of, worked with Peter

128
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:32,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pull those projects with Jerry for a couple of free cash projects that was approximately $400,000, $400,000 to $500,000 earmarked for a few of the extraordinary projects that Peter had wanted to put in to start July 1, that we moved to that area.

129
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:38,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took on, Jerry and myself kind of put this under our extraordinary maintenance umbrella.

130
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:47,608
[SPEAKER_00]: to either finish this year and or move to next fiscal year, depending on how much money we had left.

131
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:55,570
[SPEAKER_00]: As we were, A, completing the budget and looking to see what we could actually take on fully shorting maintenance.

132
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it sounds like this wasn't part of our fiscal year 25 budget.

133
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:05,773
[SPEAKER_01]: It was additional funds on the city side that were free cash.

134
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:08,494
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get used in time and then

135
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:14,445
[SPEAKER_01]: they were just sort of treated as, well, here's your FY26 allocation.

136
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:15,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure it out.

137
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:18,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what happened.

138
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:23,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was involved with those free cash asks.

139
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,971
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were many split.

140
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not me.

141
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not admit that person.

142
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:34,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.

143
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if somebody would get smart enough to do that.

144
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So those asks never included the McGlynn and the Andrews.

145
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

146
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:51,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I understood too.

147
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I can find the documentation about that because I wrote it.

148
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:58,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if I can dig it up.

149
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was never intended to be part of, not for those many splits, I don't believe.

150
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,194
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will go back and check my notes.

151
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so this work has not been started.

152
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:24,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

153
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:26,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not been specter quoted yet.

154
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Only the Roberts has been done.

155
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done at the end of last year.

156
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:37,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the information to put the spec out, but then we also have several other items in the extraordinary repairs.

157
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:38,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get through.

158
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:47,722
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, um, the main office AC air conditioning at the high school, the Brooks, the Mesa tuck, the Andrews, the McGlynn split AC units.

159
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:53,724
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, um, some auditorium seating work, the Karen railings, if that doesn't get done this year.

160
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:57,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have the Brooks turf and the repairs and all the drainage work there.

161
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:05,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Erica.

162
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:10,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to ask, do we have the, how much it costs to do that at the Roberts?

163
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:12,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that translatable?

164
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:12,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking.

165
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking that using the Roberts as an example, I would estimate that the Brooks is about $35,000.

166
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:19,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mississippi is another $35,000.

167
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The McGlynn and Andrews, if you just do the network rooms, the McGlynn's about 50 and the Andrews is about 35.

168
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are rough estimates.

169
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:39,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the high school office air conditioning, just doing the high school office itself is about $20,000.

170
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my rough estimates at this point.

171
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:51,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can maybe get to the bottom of this and then I can add those rows appropriately once we have clarity on that.

172
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just want to be clear.

173
00:13:54,774 --> 00:14:06,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm worried that things we didn't think of as our budget could lead to the end of the year if we spend all of the budget on the things we were going to spend it on to this, uh-oh, we're out of money, and I don't want to be a news story.

174
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:17,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, this isn't millions of dollars, but at the same time, we expected this money to not be part of this budget.

175
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:23,962
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've approved, so spending it outside of our approval is a concern.

176
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:29,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we'll know more, but thank you.

177
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:33,108
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

178
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the fields flashing?

179
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: At the McGlynn, that was part of the project, and that's been repaired.

180
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:42,915
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so complete.

181
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:44,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

182
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,798
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the liquid applied roof, the whole thing.

183
00:14:47,685 --> 00:15:00,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then I have from from last year bike rack modernization at McGlynn Andrews and NHS and that it was grant funded by the CPC.

184
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:03,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was in progress.

185
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know anything about that?

186
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I know the bike racks themselves are complete at McGlynn and Andrews and then we had 3 bike repair stations.

187
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:14,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the McGlynn and the Anders have been installed.

188
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: The high school, I literally just met, the voc is going to pull the pad for it.

189
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it here to install it in front of the high school.

190
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:21,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

191
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So McGlynn.

192
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:27,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And Anders, they're done.

193
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was done.

194
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,095
[SPEAKER_02]: They completely did that for us.

195
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:31,897
[SPEAKER_04]: High school nearing completion.

196
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:31,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

197
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:33,758
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

198
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:43,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had MHS classroom phone access, no capital needed, but the project was going on.

199
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:52,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was left, so when they did the Zoom phone integration, they bought new phones for all of the existing phones in the district.

200
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:02,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was all the McGlynn Andrews Elementary classrooms, they had phones, they replaced phones, and then they replaced the phones in the high school where there were phones, but that was not in the classrooms.

201
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:10,464
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea was to take the old phones from the other schools, repurpose those into the high school classrooms.

202
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Our IT team is still working on that.

203
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:17,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite labor intensive to repurpose those old phones.

204
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got most of the phones done.

205
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now having to backtrack and set up network ports and access and everything else.

206
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a project ongoing.

207
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We are short-staffed in IT right now with someone being out on medical leave for a while.

208
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing the best we can to get that going and hope to do that this year.

209
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick with me for a minute.

210
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:42,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to skip down to this other bucket of things.

211
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:44,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We still don't need new capital for that, right?

212
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:45,905
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

213
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:46,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It's confirming.

214
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:49,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just a labor issue of getting the work.

215
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:50,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

216
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:50,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

217
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:51,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

218
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

219
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,256
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

220
00:16:53,516 --> 00:17:01,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other status questions I had, we had this historic assessment of the front stairwell for Curtis Tufts.

221
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:08,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year, we said we had an application pending with the CPC.

222
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no knowledge of that going forward at all.

223
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if the application was

224
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no knowledge that we ever got funding for that or the application was approved or not approved.

225
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I can check into that.

226
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

227
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I can update that once we get that information.

228
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:45,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think my other question for maybe for this group is, um, whether given the decisions to integrate Curtis Tufts on the main high school campus with the high school project, um, whether,

229
00:17:46,243 --> 00:18:01,826
[SPEAKER_04]: we should be pursuing this at all at the moment, or is it something that we should be pursuing because the state of affairs is that bad?

230
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,607
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding of the stairs are not in great shape.

231
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them myself.

232
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:09,167
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not good railings, things like that.

233
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:11,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not falling apart, but they're not in good shape.

234
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,351
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the stairs outside?

235
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the front steps.

236
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:18,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

237
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:31,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's check on the application and then we can, Ken, you can make a recommendation on where you think it belongs on this list.

238
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:32,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

239
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:34,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just check applications.

240
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it as a FY25 or FY26 application.

241
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can search our internal records to see what the status of the application, whether we filed it, if we wrote it, if I'm not sure.

242
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

243
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,339
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

244
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll put a pin in that one for now.

245
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:03,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the rest of the network, many splits, Roberts complete.

246
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:07,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked about that one already.

247
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:11,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the drainage at the fields.

248
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:12,272
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Brooks?

249
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:13,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

250
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:19,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have quotes for the turf repair, for the enlarging of two drains, for the installing of the berm.

251
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:23,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the total cost, it needs to be all sent out to bid.

252
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:28,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to write a bid spec and hopefully get that out to bid for the spring to have the work done.

253
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:33,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gonna be a cost issue with the other items, whether or not we can afford it this fiscal year or not.

254
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are thinking that it could be FY25.

255
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Potentially, yeah.

256
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:44,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we can hold true to what we have in the... 26.

257
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in 26.

258
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:47,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, FY26, yeah.

259
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:54,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Be done in the spring, hopefully.

260
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:57,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And this 22.5 includes the repair and the drainage?

261
00:19:58,086 --> 00:19:58,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That number's low.

262
00:19:58,907 --> 00:19:59,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It's closer to 30.

263
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from the estimates we have from one vendor.

264
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,133
[SPEAKER_02]: When we spec it all together, maybe it'll...

265
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,512
[SPEAKER_02]: go down a little bit, but we've got to get that onto the street to get some quotes.

266
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just, because of the amount of money, it's over $10,000.

267
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just have one vendor give us a quote.

268
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get multiple kids.

269
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

270
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think my idea is that

271
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:42,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have a completed project section, so anything that's complete would sort of float out of those 2 categories.

272
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just talking about would float up to completed projects.

273
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we would cover the accelerated repair projects.

274
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:56,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, then we would cover the in process, like, the funded projects, which is primarily all things like McGlynn.

275
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:01,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew's HVAC that's in progress, then we would cover.

276
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:07,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The accelerated repair projects, and then we would have just 1 category for, like.

277
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Future as yet unfunded unfunded projects.

278
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense to everybody?

279
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:16,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yes.

280
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:16,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

281
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:21,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So forget about all the things we've just talked about.

282
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:21,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to.

283
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,289
[SPEAKER_04]: skip down to the future unfunded projects.

284
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:29,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sort of timeline starts at FY27.

285
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all the things that we talked about a couple of weeks ago.

286
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:38,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we were on the first tab of the sheet, the prioritized list.

287
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we'd work from the last meeting.

288
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the same, though.

289
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:50,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a lot of added stuff, because this has all the added stuff from the facilities condition assessment report.

290
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would not be on the capital plan.

291
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe it is maybe it is maybe this was the probably prioritize it at the last meeting.

292
00:21:59,418 --> 00:21:59,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

293
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:00,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

294
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:03,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I made some changes to push things out as we discussed.

295
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:07,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I think my idea is that we would.

296
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:14,204
[SPEAKER_04]: port all of these things over onto the capital plan, which I can do.

297
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:27,497
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I was thinking about, Ken, is that we have all of these items down on the bottom here that are like all the pieces and parts right from the facilities conditions assessment.

298
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:32,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think my vision was perhaps to say like,

299
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:39,285
[SPEAKER_04]: In total, at each building, here's what we're recommending for allocation over the coming years.

300
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:54,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with an acknowledgement that once you know how much money that we have, we can figure out the sequencing, as we were talking about last time, of the most important work to be done.

301
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are we going to do all the doors at the same time?

302
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:58,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are we going to do doors in one place?

303
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

304
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So that all can be considered by you.

305
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:06,247
[SPEAKER_04]: as you look at what your staff has capacity to do.

306
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:16,926
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the other work happening in the district so that we're not rendering buildings inoperable because we have too many things going on, right?

307
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,367
[SPEAKER_04]: During various points in the summer or whatever.

308
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:30,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think my vision was to just simply try to sort of wrap all of these up together so that we could say like, over the next five years, this is the recommended investment.

309
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And then down here, like this could just be like,

310
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,900
[SPEAKER_04]: like a bigger description of what the need is.

311
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And we could talk, we could tally up by school.

312
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the, what's like that net total for the school.

313
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:53,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's not in those lines in that FCA item area is the money to study and develop specifications.

314
00:23:54,464 --> 00:24:01,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had talked about the money necessary to develop specifications for the fire alarms, for instance, and the paving.

315
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:02,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

316
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:16,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We have that here, so we could drop those in and then spec out those estimated amounts.

317
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense to everybody?

318
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:28,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like there's so much information and you need all of that to tick off what's being completed and whatnot.

319
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:43,510
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, like, trying to get all of this onto something digestible, not just for us, but for, like, the rest of the school committee and the mayor and the council, because ideally, this is going to go with a memo that says, here's a recommendation.

320
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:49,172
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the amount of free cash that we are or allocation that we are seeking.

321
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So that work can begin enough by 27.

322
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had communication with Niner in the mayor's office.

323
00:24:55,671 --> 00:25:04,095
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for a spreadsheet with a specific format to send to the, I'm dropping a blank on the name of the firm that does their capital planning.

324
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:05,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to see.

325
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:09,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shoot, what is it?

326
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find it.

327
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollings Group is it?

328
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:19,343
[SPEAKER_02]: call and center.

329
00:25:19,963 --> 00:25:20,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

330
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:28,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want a spreadsheet ASAP listing all the projects on their spreadsheet format to send to the call and center.

331
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:38,206
[SPEAKER_03]: How close is their format to what we've got here or the simplified version that we presented last year to the full school committee?

332
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely different.

333
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

334
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:41,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we see that?

335
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just want to make sure.

336
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

337
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nina needs to understand that we have a

338
00:25:47,984 --> 00:26:04,558
[SPEAKER_04]: capital planning process here that we are like literally just, and we can certainly pass this information to the calling center and ask them to, you know, let us know if they have questions or have a meeting with whoever they need.

339
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yes, they've been asking this information for a while.

340
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:15,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And I explained that to her that, you know, we are going through our strategic capital planning committee and that was going to school committee.

341
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they're looking for this, like,

342
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: ASAP after that.

343
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, we can put it on the next agenda.

344
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:26,195
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty close to ASAP.

345
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:36,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I can connect with the mayor and Nina as well, just to give them an update.

346
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I can share this with you now if you want.

347
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one project per page.

348
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:54,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, this is nothing like what, oh well.

349
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:58,793
[SPEAKER_01]: This will take exorbitant amounts of time.

350
00:26:58,813 --> 00:26:59,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

351
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:11,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, we have a, I don't know, why did we have a plan and process if we're just gonna do something else?

352
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:15,280
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know what role the Collins Center comes in.

353
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to be coming back and advising us to make changes to our capital plans?

354
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:20,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not an option.

355
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:23,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what role they play in the process.

356
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:25,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.

357
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what I can find out.

358
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is like completely different.

359
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it our goal?

360
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not our goal to present this at the December 15th meeting.

361
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:51,694
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at this in presenting in January, February, because our hard deadline is grant application deadlines for CPC.

362
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:59,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, last year we presented it and passed it in December because we were ready.

363
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:00,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

364
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:04,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're ready to do that again.

365
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:08,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not ready to fill one of these out for every single project.

366
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:17,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are ready to do what our approved policy dictates that we do.

367
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of these questions

368
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:30,153
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on operating expenses are, I hope some of the, many of these are just recommended, because like, how long would that take to even calculate?

369
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:31,814
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an Excel spreadsheet.

370
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:34,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I can't, there can't actually be required fields.

371
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,162
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think

372
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:54,177
[SPEAKER_04]: given all the information we have, like that we maybe need to have a conversation with the call-in center so that we can figure out a better path forward.

373
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:57,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I don't mind this format at all.

374
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:02,581
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do mind is that we're going to make changes to our spreadsheet on a regular basis.

375
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:07,203
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get those into this every single time there's an update?

376
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:11,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it could be that what goes on this is just

377
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: some view of the specific ask that we make rather than every single thing.

378
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever the FY27 ask is, maybe those things get formed eventually.

379
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

380
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:33,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see what I think.

381
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:37,196
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big question here in terms of project name, even the location.

382
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:46,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Is all elementary schools a reasonable location, or are they looking for four versions of the same piece?

383
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:47,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

384
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:55,405
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely a conversation with them about what they're going to do with this information, how it gets integrated.

385
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how does the accelerated repair parts go in here?

386
00:29:59,467 --> 00:29:59,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

387
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:19,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't known exactly when to bring this up, but the other piece of this is going to be, how does this fit in in revenue planning for, or in allocations for the new high school and crafting a potential debt exclusion?

388
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:24,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a whole other layer, but it's one we need to be thinking about.

389
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,334
[SPEAKER_03]: was what fit in this form?

390
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:30,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the form, the decisions.

391
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:46,790
[SPEAKER_03]: If the city is doing their capital planning, some of the money that is being used for buildings, presumably, we're thinking about what will the city absorb from non-reimbursable expenses, what will go into a debt exclusion, what won't.

392
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:54,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not too early to start having those conversations.

393
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not.

394
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not been asked to be part of any of those conversations as yet, so I can find out.

395
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:15,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm happy to put a resolution that we ask for that plan from the city as part of the capital planning, but we need to get our spreadsheet.

396
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:23,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get our capital ducks in a row to say what we know our expenses to be for our requests.

397
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,361
[SPEAKER_03]: for the continuing maintenance of our schools.

398
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:32,543
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

399
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:34,184
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

400
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I go back to screen two.

401
00:31:56,421 --> 00:32:02,924
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the order in which we described the need.

402
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:09,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I will port these all over to the one-page spreadsheet.

403
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'll probably be more than one page, but then we'll have completed.

404
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:23,355
[SPEAKER_03]: This capital progress tab, the third tab down there.

405
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:24,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

406
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:26,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

407
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:31,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll basically jump in here.

408
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:48,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it, I think it's probably reasonable to, we're going to study things all together because it doesn't make sense to, oh no, there was one, there was at least one project here that we were going to stagger the studies and the.

409
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,742
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the top one there.

410
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:53,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

411
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: The ARP is staggered because they have dates where you have to approve the money and do them.

412
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't join those together.

413
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:05,845
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire alarms, you may do multiple schools the same year for studying.

414
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of code issues, I wouldn't plan those too far in advance.

415
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:15,048
[SPEAKER_02]: The network refresh phase two is not allocated.

416
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:17,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke to Jerry and knew all about that.

417
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only phase one was allocated money.

418
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:20,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken?

419
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:21,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

420
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:23,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you remind us what phase two was?

421
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:29,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Phase two is the wireless and network switches at the elementary schools, the middle, and the two middle schools.

422
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Phase one was the core switches at the elementaries, all the switches at the high school, and all the wireless at the high school.

423
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:36,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

424
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:36,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

425
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:37,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still underway.

426
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:41,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get some more information about the playground renovation.

427
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:59,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I spoke with someone in Alicia Hunt's office, and she got me into contact with Copley-Wolf, and I gave them a broad spec of what we were looking for for a design, and they suggested it'd be about $100,000 for the design, not including site and civil work.

428
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:01,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put a $150,000 number.

429
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember that.

430
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Habib had suggested it was like $350,000.

431
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

432
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:13,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Theresa Dupont was like, well, it's probably closer to $200,000.

433
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:18,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So that money, that number is coming more into focus as far as what a study of those three playgrounds might be.

434
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:25,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind that the CPA, Theresa was suggesting they'd want to see them as three separate projects for fun.

435
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:33,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And was that a purely architect design, or are we looking at inclusive design?

436
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:41,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the strengths of the McGlynn project was the community input and that it was a design that came out of.

437
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:45,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a design based upon what we wanted.

438
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have to give input of all the things we wanted.

439
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:48,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

440
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Copley-Wolf is who did that project for us.

441
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:53,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.

442
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:56,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

443
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you speak to the DPW, you would ask it.

444
00:35:03,398 --> 00:35:07,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They had room and bandwidth to do a lot of these paving projects.

445
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not.

446
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do small repairs, but they can't do a parking lot or a whole bunch of sidewalks, things like that.

447
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,941
[SPEAKER_02]: They farm all that kind of stuff out.

448
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

449
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:21,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like those are free cash.

450
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:23,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That's free cash ask.

451
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:24,222
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not.

452
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,480
[SPEAKER_03]: School budget built for sure.

453
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

454
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,200
Yeah.

455
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:39,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I think.

456
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: If I just sort of, like, merge these 2 spreadsheets together, we'll have something presentable.

457
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:50,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I will leave this piece of it intact so that.

458
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:55,807
[SPEAKER_04]: We all can work from the places in this document that makes sense for us, but.

459
00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:03,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's- I like this format better, Jenny.

460
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,135
[SPEAKER_04]: You what?

461
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this tab's format better, by the way.

462
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:09,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

463
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

464
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:13,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I just- What do you like about it?

465
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you switch to the other one?

466
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just feels more structured.

467
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:25,822
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main difference.

468
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,699
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever, I don't care the format.

469
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's probably true.

470
00:36:37,020 --> 00:37:00,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we need to present to the larger school committee and then eventually the mayor and city council and the mayor's mayor capacity rather than school committee capacity is that executive summary of what we're asking for, what we're putting in our budget, what we're asking for from the city side and that timeline.

471
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:04,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

472
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:14,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I think the snapshot is what says these are our priority projects for this year and how we're paying for them.

473
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:18,460
[SPEAKER_03]: These are our priority projects for next year and how we're paying for them.

474
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked what we did last year.

475
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:29,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your memory, Erica.

476
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:32,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It was digestible.

477
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:38,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to say, OK, this is how much we're spending this year and how much of it is coming from the school budget.

478
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:51,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But I fully grant that we didn't have the luxury of this detail from the assessment, which is hugely useful.

479
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ken is nodding vigorously.

480
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:58,186
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the level of detail we need to actually manage the project on it.

481
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get the approvals,

482
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:06,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just have an outside agency come up and say, this is what you need to do.

483
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives it credence, documentation, backup.

484
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

485
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

486
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:11,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive.

487
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to, I think there just might need to be like, we just might, I don't know, maybe we could just add a couple of columns or something.

488
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:21,743
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

489
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:24,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think.

490
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,788
[SPEAKER_04]: think about if we could do that.

491
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:35,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I do think it's helpful visually for people to see like chunks of things, like here's completed, here's in progress, here's what's funded.

492
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:42,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Because otherwise, like, it's just like, it's overwhelming unless you're like really willing to dive into the details.

493
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And not everybody always is.

494
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

495
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, let me see if I can make that work and

496
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:58,801
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can get ready to present it.

497
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:11,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So, which I think we can be ready to do next week, unless there's any reason you all think we should wait until January.

498
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:17,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I think January is already a little funky.

499
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:18,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

500
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more concerned with what we have to report to the city.

501
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

502
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:22,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

503
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:24,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

504
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:37,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I will follow up with the mayor and Nina in the next day or so and report back, Ken, what I find out.

505
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:43,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

506
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:49,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you still have, I think you were the one who presented that spreadsheet last year.

507
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:49,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

508
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

509
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

510
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:54,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll try to find it too.

511
00:39:55,525 --> 00:40:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm currently looking at the Google Drive and I will not find it before this meeting ends.

512
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I can guarantee that.

513
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It was March 26th, 2024.

514
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:08,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We were later, wait, no.

515
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:09,595
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not right.

516
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:10,896
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not right.

517
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:25,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were just a handful of, there was just a legend on the top, which I have.

518
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I found it.

519
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:29,114
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

520
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:34,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the chat since I need to see it to have my memory work.

521
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:44,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to be a drive link that only people with access to the school committee drive will see.

522
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:46,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait, now I just lost my Zoom window.

523
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is it.

524
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:52,124
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tiny.

525
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:55,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the process of downloading it so I can actually look at it.

526
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, and it's crooked.

527
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's that rotate button?

528
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:21,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's oriented, right?

529
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Tools, rotate.

530
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:29,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the spreadsheet.

531
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

532
00:41:31,382 --> 00:41:33,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's a scan of the spreadsheet, isn't it?

533
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that is.

534
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:36,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

535
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:37,764
OK.

536
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:39,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken, have you seen this?

537
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I have drafts of, I have the prior two years that Jenny had given me.

538
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we created this year's from.

539
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,051
[SPEAKER_02]: We took this year's from last year's copy that started editing it.

540
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:51,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because this is.

541
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

542
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:53,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

543
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is the capital plan tab.

544
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:56,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

545
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:56,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

546
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:58,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, from the prior year.

547
00:41:58,993 --> 00:41:59,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

548
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:05,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

549
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:09,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we get this cleaned up, it can probably look like that.

550
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:10,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

551
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:33,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any moving around of things that we need to do in this meeting in terms of integrating our priorities from the facility review with our priorities from last year for the next fiscal years?

552
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:41,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we know accelerated repair is the top priority because that is dependent on those dates.

553
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:42,703
[SPEAKER_01]: and free money.

554
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:43,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

555
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:44,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

556
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:52,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but I think like I'm considering those somewhat separate, the council will, the council will take care of those approvals in January.

557
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,453
[SPEAKER_04]: That's already identified.

558
00:42:54,473 --> 00:43:04,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the thing that we still have to work on Ken and I is just coming up with the number for feasibility that we're going to authorize.

559
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so that's just a separate thing.

560
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:11,283
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked a few different people.

561
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:14,245
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked to left field.

562
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:15,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne reached out to superintendents.

563
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting any clear information from anybody.

564
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not surprised.

565
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:22,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Really disconcerting.

566
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get through one of them, I think it was Robert's first.

567
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:31,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get one done, we'll be able to inform the other two how we will budget for those.

568
00:43:31,114 --> 00:43:38,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we budget a number knowing that we might have to raise it once we start negotiating with the assigned team.

569
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:43,460
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so we don't inflate this huge number that they designed to their budget.

570
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:43,900
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

571
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

572
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

573
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:59,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, um, we had that conversation when I spoke with the finance task force and they understand that there's like a lot of just gray area in this number.

574
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:06,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think they're just looking for us to do what we can to come up with something that is reasonable.

575
00:44:06,632 --> 00:44:07,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're,

576
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:10,891
[SPEAKER_04]: if it has to change, we'll deal with it at that time.

577
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The only worry I have is this has to be voted on, and it has to be voted on with the MSBA language.

578
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:24,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if we say, we approved $10,000 for this, and then they say that's not enough, but they haven't given us clarity.

579
00:44:24,904 --> 00:44:26,705
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be some back and forth at that point.

580
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:29,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we talked about that as well.

581
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:32,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a decent plan to address that.

582
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:51,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in preparing the spreadsheet, one question that I will have, since we can't answer it in this meeting, but is how much are we deviating from our fiscal year 26 plan that we approved last year?

583
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:56,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we still within the amount that we approved last year for the plan?

584
00:44:56,976 --> 00:44:57,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we gone over?

585
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:58,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we gone under?

586
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:01,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we bumping something from 27 to 28 because 26 was fuller or that?

587
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:14,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what didn't go great last time is we built a plan.

588
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:17,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said, these are things we recommend proceeding with.

589
00:45:18,638 --> 00:45:25,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was not clear enough what the ask was when it was passed off.

590
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what ultimately happened was there was spot funding of certain things that floated up.

591
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:42,684
[SPEAKER_04]: that I helped broker between myself and the rest of the finance task force, which is fine.

592
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this time, we need to say this is the ask for free cash funding.

593
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,791
[SPEAKER_04]: so that these projects can kick off in FY27.

594
00:45:54,892 --> 00:46:02,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the timeline of the projects was a little bit more all over the place the last time as well.

595
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:05,736
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some things that had to start right away.

596
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're at a more planful point now.

597
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:17,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can say, this is an ask of free cash in FY26 so that work can happen in FY27.

598
00:46:17,262 --> 00:46:17,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

599
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:32,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, and I just think my question is, what did these new projects that we discovered through the facilities assessments do to that ask?

600
00:46:35,436 --> 00:46:41,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we just insert a whole bunch of new things, and so we're asking for a lot more than we anticipated asking for?

601
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Just understanding the magnitude of that deviation.

602
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:52,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we knew last year that we were doing this assessment.

603
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We heavily budgeted for the assessment.

604
00:46:55,884 --> 00:47:08,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there will be a several million dollar ask to feed FY27.

605
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:14,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's going to take a little bit of a memo that says, we did this assessment.

606
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:16,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It revealed this.

607
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:31,361
[SPEAKER_04]: here's our capital plan, it addresses FY, so the ask for right now is this, and this is what it will enable us to do, which are the highest priority items as justified by this very long, detailed report.

608
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

609
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:46,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about longer term than even our plan here, we're not going to have to spend this kind of money

610
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:48,117
[SPEAKER_01]: every year forever.

611
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:58,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to spend, you know, the appropriate amount to maintain the buildings, but we're not going to have to try and catch up forever.

612
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:03,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, are we thinking if we follow this plan that like in five years,

613
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:15,214
[SPEAKER_01]: will be sort of set to do the normal expected things and stop asking for multiple millions a year, or is it seven years or 10 years?

614
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:20,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if, Ken, I mean, I know that's, you know, where's your crystal ball, right?

615
00:48:20,655 --> 00:48:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if we did everything on this plan, and regardless of what it costs, we just did everything on the plan, at the end of the day, everything on the FCA should be

616
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:55,787
[SPEAKER_01]: tidied up, all the big ticket items are done, and we can, I just don't want anybody in the public, the mayor, to think that every year forever, we're gonna be asking for millions and millions and millions to do this stuff, and I just, I don't think that's cool.

617
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think if you completed all the items in the FCA, which is a lot,

618
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:06,090
[SPEAKER_02]: and the three accelerated repairs for the Brooks and Roberts and Missituck, you would be in excellent shape.

619
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:09,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You would still need to do things going on.

620
00:49:10,353 --> 00:49:14,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And that assumes that the high school project completely gets funded and get completely finished.

621
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:19,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if the high school project doesn't, you've got a boatload of stuff in this building you'd have to deal with.

622
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:22,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

623
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other thing that we have done is we've dramatically increased the amount of like,

624
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:34,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Operating budget repair money funding that.

625
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:37,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We have historically had in the budget, right?

626
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may still not be.

627
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:46,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely right sized, but it is dramatically closer than it was like, 2 years ago.

628
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:52,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the other thing is, like, why do you have all of this deferred?

629
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Maintenance that is has this huge price tag.

630
00:49:56,328 --> 00:50:02,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you under invested for an extended period of time and now like bigger repairs are needed.

631
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:03,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

632
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:08,533
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, yeah, yeah, and the buildings are getting older, right?

633
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:12,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's there's and they were all built at exactly the same time.

634
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:15,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of not shocking that.

635
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:18,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They would all need the same things at the same time.

636
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:22,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we built 5 schools all at all at once.

637
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:22,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

638
00:50:24,757 --> 00:50:25,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not.

639
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:27,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not surprising.

640
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:52,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in that case, maybe this is a comment for Noel, I think it's really important to emphasize the fact, the ways in which the school budget has accommodated this, that it's not an extraordinary, that we are, that the school, that we have gotten closer to right-sizing this within the school budget.

641
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the asks outside of that are not for everything and they're not,

642
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:23,736
[SPEAKER_03]: mad grabs for the cash, that this is really thoughtful in saying what the school budget can absorb in terms of general repairs, maintenance, everything coming due, and extraordinary maintenance of being able to be flexible when

643
00:51:24,993 --> 00:51:27,716
[SPEAKER_03]: something else comes due that we didn't know was going to come due.

644
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:43,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's just a communication point, but I think it's really essential to make when we're talking about these numbers and looking at what a new high school is going to cost.

645
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:47,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate what you said about identifying

646
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:55,576
[SPEAKER_03]: that if the high school doesn't get funded, these are the new things that are going to be part of this budget.

647
00:51:57,637 --> 00:52:01,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the things that go away if we have funding for a high school.

648
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And the feasibility study will give you that.

649
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:05,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to give you the repair only option.

650
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:15,744
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to tell you how much it's going to cost just to repair the building to a functional code compliance state in its current layout that doesn't meet your educational needs, but still.

651
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:17,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have that big number there to compare to.

652
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:22,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a few months away, I admit.

653
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:33,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to be really clear that this plan that we're presenting takes these things into account and is thoughtful.

654
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:39,694
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually one of all the exciting things about the new high school that we have going on.

655
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: All the things we don't have to fix in the old building.

656
00:52:42,988 --> 00:52:49,330
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the thing I am, frankly, one of the most exciting things in the short term that I'm looking forward to is what is that number?

657
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to be staggering.

658
00:52:52,551 --> 00:53:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: To get this building to meet current heating code, seismic code, electrical code, fixing everything, ADA, yeah, there's a lot there.

659
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:10,917
[SPEAKER_02]: A new building is still going to be a lot more money, but that fix will not fix any of the spaces we're using.

660
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:13,329
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing the structure.

661
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the question we're getting from the public.

662
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there specific spaces that would do better being renovated?

663
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, that we don't have to have that conversation right here right now.

664
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:28,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

665
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:40,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think if we're all in agreement, we can put, we'll put this on the agenda on Monday and I'll like write a little memo that tries to like wrap all of this up.

666
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken and I can maybe work on it together.

667
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:55,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that anticipates like that, that memo will go to the mayor and the council so that the committee can review that as well.

668
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:57,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So that there's a clear pathway.

669
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:04,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll follow up with Nina about the capital plan.

670
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:14,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ken, you'll check on CPC for Curtis Tufts and the bike racks, right?

671
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:18,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the bike rack stuff was mostly completed.

672
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:21,930
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just waiting on the last one with the bike repair station.

673
00:54:25,832 --> 00:54:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a second one, though.

674
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:27,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

675
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:31,829
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones, the McGlynn and the Andrews as part of the project.

676
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They mounted them for us and everything.

677
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,372
[SPEAKER_04]: High school's nearing completion.

678
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:35,933
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

679
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

680
00:54:38,656 --> 00:54:44,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I had another row from Missitech, Roberts, and Brooks.

681
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:46,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

682
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:46,863
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was done.

683
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:46,924
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

684
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was a conversation on whether we're going to be submitting CPC applications for playgrounds, but there were studies needed before we could.

685
00:55:00,483 --> 00:55:01,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's on here.

686
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:11,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other piece that this subcommittee does, is to say what are the things that we are submitting CPC applications for.

687
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:18,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't sound like there are any new ones that we need to hit that we're ready to submit for in this upcoming cycle.

688
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The playground design.

689
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:22,093
[SPEAKER_03]: The playground feasibility.

690
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:24,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Feasibility, that was it, not the design.

691
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:24,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

692
00:55:32,158 --> 00:55:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, got it.

693
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

694
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready for the closing motion?

695
00:55:40,383 --> 00:55:49,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, I think we just need to recommend that we'll put this on the agenda, that we approve this and want to place it on the agenda for next week.

696
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:53,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I move.

697
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:54,693
