1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:07,894
[SPEAKER_02]: the meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee, Article 6, Financial Procedures Subcommittee.

2
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:12,815
[SPEAKER_02]: This doesn't have to be a long meeting.

3
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:14,836
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically have two items on the agenda.

4
00:00:16,136 --> 00:00:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to look at Gene's research and the other is to just go over some of the feedback we got from the administration about the section of the

5
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: article six about the annual budget meeting.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So should we do that first?

7
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:34,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it's pretty quick.

8
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:36,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

9
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:37,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.

10
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:43,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just pull it up so that people can see exactly what section we're talking about.

11
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we had talked about when we put together this draft was to

12
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:58,780
[SPEAKER_02]: meet with the administration and just run it by them to see what the timelines, you know, if the timelines were feasible.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've heard from the chief of staff, Maury and I met with her and she said she wasn't sure.

14
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And she talked further with the mayor and the chief financial officer.

15
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And they think that this, they're worried about this section.

16
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:18,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of the reason is because they have this budget ordinance.

17
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:35,901
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're worried that there's a lot of detail in the budget ordinance and that this might be hard to do in conjunction with everything that they're going to have to do with the budget ordinance.

18
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:45,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we did keep this in, this would supersede the budget ordinance, however, and that could create a weird situation.

19
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we haven't on the agenda to talk about with the whole committee tomorrow night.

20
00:01:56,356 --> 00:02:08,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, you know, I'll just put this forward when we talk about this article, but I just wanted us to sort of look it over and see if we think, what we think about it.

21
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:11,265
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their recommendation?

22
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:14,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it to delete the whole section or?

23
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,096
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't say, you know, what the recommendation is.

24
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:22,300
[SPEAKER_02]: They just said that this as written would not work.

25
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, we

26
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,766
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the three charters we looked at.

27
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:34,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, everyone that we looked at and compared to has some sort of language close to this.

28
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,832
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of tweaked it a little bit, but they all have language pertaining to that move.

29
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:45,835
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that this particular annual budget meeting was only in Melrose, but we should look again.

30
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember it being in all three charters?

31
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was in all three.

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I could be wrong.

33
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kind of look now.

34
00:02:56,444 --> 00:03:02,007
[SPEAKER_00]: They always just had a tad different bit of language on, you know, 30 days, 45 days.

35
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I seem to remember that, too.

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,275
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we can certainly look at, you know, some other ones, too, and see if this is, you know, commonplace.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Who'd let me just let me just take a look because I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure it was only Melrose of those three, but I could be wrong.

38
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:24,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

39
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep talking.

40
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wonder if we if we want to keep this section and we could say, you know, between these days.

41
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:51,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And then add a clause that says, or at another time mutually agreed by the mayor and city council or something so that the button allowing whatever budget ordinance timeline to be in effect.

42
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:55,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we should mention the budget ordinance in the charter.

43
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

44
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,947
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't saying the ordinance.

45
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:03,991
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just say, or add another mutually agreed upon time between the mayor and city council.

46
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:08,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't mention an ordinance, but that would be how they would agree.

47
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what I particularly like about this and, you know.

48
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:20,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can move it to another time in the calendar or something like that.

49
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it forces communication.

50
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:30,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And collaboration between the 3 among all 3 branches.

51
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:35,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets them to sit down in 1 room with each other.

52
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:41,875
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that that's something that's been lacking, and I think it's something that is really important.

53
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:49,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said, Eunice, because that was my position when we talked about all of this.

54
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:57,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny, when we, Melvin, you might recall when we opened the meeting up down there with the chief of staff and the

55
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:05,634
[SPEAKER_00]: the other gentleman that was there, they kind of chuckled when we said, you know, this is a good way to get all three together.

56
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:09,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you got a better chance of seeing God or something, so.

57
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:25,425
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of like forcing their hand a little bit, making everybody come to the table and put your feelings aside because you're working for the city, you're working for the community, you're working for the people of the city.

58
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:39,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should be in a position to demand that they work in the best interests of the citizens of the city.

59
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:46,045
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had my druthers, I'd have the bodies meeting a few times a year.

60
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:51,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But that didn't seem to go so well.

61
00:05:51,707 --> 00:06:02,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think requiring them to sit down once, we should be able to find a way to ensure that they do that.

62
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:03,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

63
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is the reason for that.

64
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the concern is,

65
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:17,712
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the requirements in the budget ordinance and the timeline of this and what it requires the administration to do.

66
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:21,615
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're worried about.

67
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:29,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find that document right now, but I'll check for tomorrow night to find out if all three charters have this.

68
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it was only Melrose that had this.

69
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:41,906
[SPEAKER_00]: If I recall, like I said earlier, I thought it was all three that we looked at, but they had a little bit different language.

70
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:47,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody even had like before January and we said, yeah, that'd be stupid.

71
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,371
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even, you know, six months into the fiscal year.

72
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,893
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you make a judgment of where you're at?

73
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:54,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

74
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:54,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

75
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:56,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take a look at, um,

76
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a handful of other charters so that we have maybe a few.

77
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, take a look at.

78
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:13,215
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm thinking is that maybe some of this language, like revenue and expenditure forecasts.

79
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:18,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, maybe if we just edited it to say.

80
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: To review to review the financial condition of the city can mean a lot of things.

81
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And.

82
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:40,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just say end it there or take, I think the forecasts are a little like, oh, that implies that there has to be a lot of material put together that maybe there's a concern that it's not going to be available.

83
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about that?

84
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:55,947
[SPEAKER_04]: In looking at some of the budget stuff that's been prepared for the budget meetings that have been occurring now for the last few weeks,

85
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:12,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And knowing, I think, what Bob Dickinson, the finance guy, does, I mean, if we're looking at a meeting, say, in, I don't know, 100 days puts us where?

86
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:13,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Early March?

87
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, we should be able to, July, August, September, October, November, December, we should have,

88
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:31,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The bodies, the, the school side and the city side should be able to have at least the 1st, 2 quarters of the budget.

89
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever.

90
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:48,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they call it, but that's too, if we're looking at early March, then they should have the first two quarters of any data of revenue and expenses and things like that.

91
00:08:49,063 --> 00:09:00,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, even to be able to provide that much and then just sort of a narrative of how things are going, what, I mean,

92
00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:24,605
[SPEAKER_04]: does the city feel like all of a sudden we're here in March and they've allocated X amount of dollars for pencils and all the pencils are gone and they have to order more for whatever reason.

93
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gives an idea of, oh, we used more of X than we thought.

94
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:29,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

95
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And or on the school side, you know, we started this program and we've had, we didn't know how it was going to go, but we've had a waiting list for it.

96
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:51,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now next year, we're going to have to, you know, add a staff member or buy more materials or more narrative form than, you know, maybe data.

97
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:58,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at Eunice, you probably are more up to date on this than I am the proposed ordinance.

98
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,595
[SPEAKER_01]: The budget ordinance, which requires quarterly.

99
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Financial reports and media, I mean, it's, it's more extensive and there's.

100
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:13,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is much more extensive, but it has that in there.

101
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:17,021
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more than what we're saying has to happen.

102
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, and I think that the concern was that this, even though it's just one annual budget meeting, that it could sort of interface weirdly with all those requirements in the ordinance.

103
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:41,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I hear Eunice and Maury saying is they want to make sure this happens, but the ordinance is requiring it quarterly.

104
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for all three branches?

105
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

106
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:52,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's quarterly financial reports and meetings.

107
00:10:52,376 --> 00:11:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: The finance director will provide a written report regarding the city's finances to city council on a quarterly basis no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter of the fiscal year.

108
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:11,809
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council will hold a committee or subcommittee meeting to review the reports.

109
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:13,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they're not

110
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,731
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exchanging information.

111
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not meeting in person.

112
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I don't think they're requiring.

113
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:25,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more having the finance guy come before them.

114
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:26,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

115
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:29,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on the city side.

116
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it really has much to do with the school side.

117
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:40,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they kind of, even though the city council approves their budget,

118
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the school, they do all of their own finance work.

119
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:52,048
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a finance guy that does all their data.

120
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that they're bringing all three bodies together.

121
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a finance guy coming before them.

122
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:00,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Before city council, yeah.

123
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is a

124
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:03,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Preliminary budget meeting.

125
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:10,858
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council will hold preliminary budget meetings between April 15th to May 15th of each year.

126
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what they're doing now.

127
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:22,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what actually is occurring at 6 o'clock tonight is the 5th or 6th meeting because they're following the budget ordinance now.

128
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:26,859
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a meeting or two ago, they've been following it.

129
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So the departments are coming before them to present their budget.

130
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:34,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The school hasn't come before them yet.

131
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so no earlier than 100 days before the beginning, no later than 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year puts us in, uh,

132
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,426
[SPEAKER_01]: March, right?

133
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:50,627
[SPEAKER_01]: End of March?

134
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:54,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how we define days, which we never quite decided.

135
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:59,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you include weekends, then yes, right?

136
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:00,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so.

137
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought it was calendar days.

138
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,271
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't business days.

139
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:15,754
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, I think it was, we get them back into March, that would give them enough time to get through their June 30th fiscal year budgetary concerns.

140
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And when do those preliminary budget meetings start?

141
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,351
[SPEAKER_02]: They start in April?

142
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,155
[SPEAKER_02]: From April 15th to May 15th is what the ordinance says.

143
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would come before that?

144
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:28,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

145
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:34,164
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the consideration that we were taking, not to interfere with them.

146
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:39,470
[SPEAKER_00]: But this individual council, I think, is a little more aggressive than

147
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:45,960
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous 40 years of when they try to get the budget through, you know.

148
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, last year was the earliest the budget was ever submitted by the mayor in decades.

149
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,225
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's about time they're trying.

150
00:13:55,245 --> 00:14:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, I think there's a good faith effort in trying to do something here on getting a budget in, not be 11th hour.

151
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,225
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, what do you all think about my suggestion, just to change the language a bit?

152
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I think that it's important to try to respond to the feedback we got.

153
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your proposal, Melvin?

154
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take out, it's in the comments there.

155
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:25,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see it.

156
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:34,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically to just take out to review revenue and expenditure forecast, which is the most specific thing in there, right?

157
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

158
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:57,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I think then as it would read, it would say that the three bodies would have a meeting to review the financial condition of the city and that the mayor could share whatever information the administration had in order to develop a coordinated budget.

159
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:01,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of like a preview meeting, right?

160
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Could the mayor request

161
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:07,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

162
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:24,743
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought we also, that would give us, give the three bodies kind of like a financial outlook of how the city has been operating on the budget that they're in.

163
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:32,290
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be able to, number one, review that before they started going forward on the new budget and saying, okay.

164
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be covered under review of the financial condition of the city.

165
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:38,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

166
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:41,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

167
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:41,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

168
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:47,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an idea because that takes away.

169
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:50,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they twisting your arm, Milva?

170
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,098
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

171
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to include something that they say is

172
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,682
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially not feasible.

173
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:26,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking that the meeting in and of itself, I think that the word about preparing, you know, like the revenue, to me, it's the line revenue and expenditure forecast, because that would require a lot of information and a lot of preparation and a lot of maybe information that they feel they don't have.

174
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:39,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If we put in something that's a little bit more vague or generic, then could the mayor request.

175
00:16:41,848 --> 00:17:07,682
[SPEAKER_04]: or I suppose order her because the finance director reports to her that he or she prepares the first two quarters worth of data and asks the superintendent to do the same for the school side so that at least there's some data

176
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:16,072
[SPEAKER_04]: to serve as some guidance.

177
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:19,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be up to the mayor.

178
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:34,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I guess what I'm saying is the three bodies are going to sit together and the mayor can, in his or her infinite wisdom, determine what

179
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, what reports and so forth should be brought to a meeting of that nature and then request their, you know, finance people to do that.

180
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that that could happen.

181
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, if we take out that particular, those really only four words, um,

182
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: then it just leaves it much more open.

183
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:06,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's still a budget meeting, so that's specific.

184
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:17,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still says that the financial condition of the city will be reviewed, but it's general and open-ended in terms of what information is going to be shared.

185
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:23,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But the goal of whatever is shared is to develop a coordinated budget, which

186
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:32,371
[SPEAKER_02]: as I read it, coordinated among the departments of the city and the school side, et cetera.

187
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:37,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with that.

188
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking that out.

189
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:50,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I think it, you know, I, I, I am also just a young guy because you hit it right on the head and over just by what you said, you know, just a coordinated budget between,

190
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,517
[SPEAKER_00]: all the departments, the different, the schools, and the operating of the city.

191
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:02,038
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing, that they work in harmony, and they work in the best interest of the city.

192
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:06,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how we can hold them accountable, get them to do it in the time we matter.

193
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm concerned about that.

194
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the critical thing is to get them all sitting in one room around one table, looking at each other and talking to each other.

195
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:17,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

196
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to what's already highlighted.

197
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll put it in a different color.

198
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:31,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll, you know, we'll share this with the whole committee tomorrow.

199
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:32,515
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

200
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:34,276
[SPEAKER_02]: There.

201
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the best color.

202
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:37,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too dark.

203
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:38,297
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

204
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:38,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

205
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:39,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Need a lighter blue.

206
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:48,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we can move on from this to the other item on our agenda.

207
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

208
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, which I sent out a report, but I don't know that you all had time to read it because it went out a couple hours ago.

209
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked it up.

210
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:06,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

211
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

212
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chance.

213
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

214
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was seeing my work as sort of focusing on why does Massachusetts have a setup so that the legislative body, which is city council, can only decrease budget lines but can't increase.

215
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:35,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to understand why the Massachusetts history of that.

216
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:44,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really find a good reason in my research as to why Massachusetts has a setup like that.

217
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:58,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find other cities and some other states that allow their legislative body for municipal government to increase or decrease.

218
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,704
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of bigger, major cities.

219
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:16,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for Alabama, Alabama is kind of similar to Massachusetts in that most of the government happens through cities and towns.

220
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:22,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of some other places, they have large county systems that actually make more money and have

221
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,719
[SPEAKER_01]: more responsibilities, but Alabama is similar to Massachusetts in that way.

222
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:35,464
[SPEAKER_01]: In Alabama, the legislative body can increase or decrease the budget.

223
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:47,971
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do that, if they increase the budget in one line, then they have to decrease it somewhere else or they have to identify additional revenue source.

224
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:57,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So this wasn't super easy to research, quite honestly.

225
00:21:57,104 --> 00:22:00,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Google's gotten worse, or I wasn't using the right search terms.

226
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I think sometimes it's hard.

227
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I think municipalities sometimes don't have the most updated websites.

228
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:11,036
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.

229
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:12,517
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be why, too.

230
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

231
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:23,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not weird or unheard of for city council to have that power.

232
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:25,365
[SPEAKER_01]: It is weird and unheard of in Massachusetts.

233
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So Boston's the only city that has that right now.

234
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:36,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find it was very interesting, and I guess maybe my main recommendation might be

235
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:51,019
[SPEAKER_01]: in a future charter study that somebody be hired to look at other budgeting practices and maybe make a better, like maybe that's something that could be reviewed in five or 10 years when the charter is re-reviewed.

236
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some cities had, you know, in October,

237
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:03,264
[SPEAKER_01]: the city council and the mayor meet and they set up their goals for the year.

238
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:13,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's like a year long budget process, which I thought was a good way of communicating and having everybody on the same page.

239
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:25,448
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a increasing effort across the US to have more community engagement and budget making decisions through participatory budget,

240
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:37,007
[SPEAKER_01]: budgeting, which really is a certain amount of money in the city budget is set aside and city residents get to vote on how that money is used, basically.

241
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:41,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cambridge, Massachusetts does that, New York City does it.

242
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:43,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

243
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just have an aside to that?

244
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:46,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

245
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So Boston, when they got

246
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,413
[SPEAKER_02]: the permission to give City Council that power.

247
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

248
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a ballot question and it passed, but also on the ballot question was the formation of a participatory budgeting office.

249
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:13,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was interesting because you couldn't really, I mean, I think most people were probably voting for the participatory budget office for sure.

250
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:14,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

251
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:21,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how far they've gotten on it, because I think it was just to set aside a certain amount of money to start that office.

252
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:27,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if they're actually, how far along they are on actually doing the participatory budgeting.

253
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:39,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it when I first started this, and it seemed like there was some pressure on Mayor Wu to set up the office so that it wasn't quite set up yet.

254
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think they're very far.

255
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,891
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very far, yeah.

256
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

257
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:50,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, I don't know that I have an ask for this committee.

258
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to better understand, like, why Massachusetts does it this way?

259
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,570
[SPEAKER_01]: What do other states do?

260
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:09,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it's feasible for legislative bodies to have the ability to increase or decrease, and it seems like it works in other locations across the country.

261
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:17,606
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not moving for this committee to change our decision on that.

262
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:23,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want people to be informed about it, and that maybe in the future it is something that

263
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:29,618
[SPEAKER_01]: we should be open-minded about at a future charter review process.

264
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:38,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have a lot on our plate with this review, but it, I think it is something that could work in Medford.

265
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:43,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We are much smaller than Seattle, Honolulu, Salt Lake City, some in Boston.

266
00:25:43,784 --> 00:25:54,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I wonder if, you know, future charter study, if there was money behind it, having someone like research this more for the city.

267
00:25:54,964 --> 00:26:04,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then, I mean, the issue of the participatory budgeting is related, but separate, because Cambridge, they have participatory budgeting.

268
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how long they've been doing that?

269
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did put their- Well, and, but they can't, but they still follow the rules of the Massachusetts General Laws, where the city council can only, so I wonder how that works, yeah.

270
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:36,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm assuming the mayor sets aside a certain amount in the budget, and then there's a community process, or the community votes how that money's used, and city council either approves or doesn't approve it.

271
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

272
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,882
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about Cambridge, Cambridge is still city management.

273
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Their mayor is just a figurehead.

274
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:43,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

275
00:26:43,323 --> 00:26:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

276
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:47,184
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plan E type governments.

277
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three or four that are left.

278
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for doing this, Jean.

279
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we want to have some discussion on it?

280
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice and Maury, do you have any?

281
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:06,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand exactly what Jean is saying as far as, you know, a small city and so forth might be ready.

282
00:27:07,697 --> 00:27:10,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're ready for it yet here.

283
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:24,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree wholeheartedly that if we're doing a charter review in five years or 10 years, exactly what Jean was suggesting, that that would be the time to maybe look at it a little further.

284
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,569
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that the political climate

285
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:44,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after this charter hopefully is successful and the city continues to go in the direction it's going, then you're going to have better lines of communication between all your bodies, which would give me the confidence then to say, OK, maybe that

286
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:54,100
[SPEAKER_00]: adding or subtracting from the budget isn't a political move, but it's a move in the best interest of the city.

287
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,221
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I look at it today.

288
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:02,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a tremendous amount of animosity between the bodies still.

289
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:09,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think out of spite, you'd be seeing them today, doing away with this if they could, or doing away with that.

290
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:12,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just my position and my point of view.

291
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Maury.

292
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I go along with a good deal of that.

293
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:23,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're caught in a couple of different places here.

294
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, wanting to.

295
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:46,474
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to the community who, you know, the reason that, you know, we're sitting here tonight is, you know, talking about, um, you know, a lot of the, what we heard from community feedback and surveys and from council members and so forth is a different balance of power.

296
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:51,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, so that's what brought us to, to here.

297
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:51,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know,

298
00:28:54,751 --> 00:29:02,279
[SPEAKER_04]: There are individuals within the community, both elected and not, that want a better or different balance of power.

299
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one thing.

300
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,267
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, in looking at some of the final reports that you sent out that we'll be looking at down the road,

301
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it seems that, you know, a lot of communities have, you know, tweak to chatter.

302
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:25,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically, you know.

303
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,483
[SPEAKER_04]: wrote one soup to nuts.

304
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:39,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, we've got a whole bunch of stuff that, you know, either we've formalized or created that's never been there before.

305
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because there wasn't much to tweak.

306
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

307
00:29:42,886 --> 00:29:46,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Two and a half pages worth of tweaking.

308
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:50,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think we've done an awful lot already.

309
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:51,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've talked continuously about

310
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:58,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this has to go from us to the council to the mayor to the state.

311
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:02,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then back to the voters and then back to the voters.

312
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:04,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we've got a lot of.

313
00:30:04,475 --> 00:30:09,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wholesale changes as it is, and then tomorrow's point.

314
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:13,260
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think this budget ordinance is going to.

315
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:19,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Go a long way to opening up lines of communication and transparency.

316
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:20,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, part of the.

317
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:33,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the angst over the last few years has been a lack of, you know, financial information emanating out of the corner office to the council.

318
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that there's a requirement that.

319
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:44,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the warrant articles, as they're called, which is basically the monthly bills are, you know, and other data is going to be forthcoming on a regular basis.

320
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to make a whole lot of difference.

321
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:51,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I kind of agree with Maury that, you know, maybe we're not there yet.

322
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have to.

323
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:54,821
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

324
00:30:56,443 --> 00:31:00,905
[SPEAKER_04]: See the data coming forward and bodies have to learn to work with that.

325
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,066
[SPEAKER_04]: On a regular basis, and then, um.

326
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there might be some trust built up, um, you know, for down the road.

327
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:15,391
[SPEAKER_04]: The lucky few that are reviewing what our work in 5 or 10 years.

328
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I think, you know, we're all retiring after the end of this.

329
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:27,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be the ones that will be making those decisions.

330
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:46,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I just want to, you know, also just bring in the reminder that this would be basically if it were included in the charter and we tried to send it to the state house, it would, we would be asking for an exception to state law, basically.

331
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:54,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we've discussed, we wanna make the charter as successful as possible.

332
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:03,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have ambivalence about putting something in the charter that is in conflict with state law at this point.

333
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:15,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So- Correct me if I'm wrong, but when the city council tried to do this with one of their charter amendments about a year or so ago, didn't KP law tell them that

334
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:20,953
[SPEAKER_04]: this doesn't really work?

335
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:22,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

336
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:35,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, the process that they were trying to use was a provision where there are certain amendments that can be made to the charter that they could send to the attorney general.

337
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,760
[SPEAKER_02]: as opposed to having to do it through a special act.

338
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So they considered this to be one of those because I believe the parameters are, if it's not a change to the elected bodies or whatever, terms of office, things like that.

339
00:32:56,292 --> 00:33:03,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember at one point having a meeting with the Collins Center, I think it was at one of our meetings, where the Collins Center,

340
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:14,617
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to think that that particular way of changing the charter would not apply to that change because it was too big of a change.

341
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:18,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's another opinion on the table.

342
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of open questions around the process that they were using, the legalities, all that.

343
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:36,477
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no idea what would happen if it was sent to the Attorney General or, yeah, no idea.

344
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:37,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

345
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:40,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we gave it its due diligence.

346
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

347
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:43,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to Jeanne.

348
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, thank you, Jeanne.

349
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:51,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeanne, do you think that, whoops, do you think that

350
00:33:52,539 --> 00:34:15,111
[SPEAKER_02]: When you mentioned saying, creating a recommendation that the next charter review, you know, do a deep dive into the budgeting process and potentially hire a consultant or make that a focus, is that a recommendation that we want to bring before the whole committee and put into the final report?

351
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to do that.

352
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:40,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Medford might like to do participatory budgeting where some of the funds are through a community engagement process this, you know, there's more community decision making on where the money goes.

353
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:52,398
[SPEAKER_01]: So those those two things might be, I mean, I think that maybe they should look at how the ordinance went and what are the things that aren't working and just maybe put more time.

354
00:34:52,439 --> 00:35:00,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, one thing that occurred to me is because most governments in Massachusetts are council manager like.

355
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:15,244
[SPEAKER_01]: that the city council controls the budget in a lot of places in Massachusetts because it's the city manager council situation.

356
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:18,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But most cities have mayors in Massachusetts.

357
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the cities that do have managers, yes.

358
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And in towns where they have managers, probably too.

359
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:29,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

360
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:32,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they think that's your option.

361
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,049
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want that, you go that way.

362
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:34,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

363
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:49,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's interesting because nobody seemed to have any appetite for changing to city manager, but it did seem like some of the things that certain people wanted would have been more in line with that form of government.

364
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:50,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

365
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

366
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:56,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know if folks agree.

367
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:02,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could bring that and just make the recommendation that the next charter review focus more on the budget.

368
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:11,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mind just writing up a one-sentence proposal on that recommendation and making it more night and we'll vote on it in the committee?

369
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

370
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I write it into that document?

371
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,555
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just write it down just so you can be ready to say exactly what the proposal is so that people know what they're voting on.

372
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,036
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

373
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that suggestion a lot.

374
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when it comes to the writing the final report in general, I think that there's, you know, as we kind of go through the bits and pieces of it, I think some of the things that maybe we, you know, took a dive into and for whatever reason, you know, it didn't, you know, pan out.

375
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I think definitely there's a lot of things that we could probably, you know,

376
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:06,855
[SPEAKER_04]: write to our successors and say, now that the chart has been working for a while, and see how it goes.

377
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:17,858
[SPEAKER_02]: take another look at X. Yeah, and that's if the charter makes it through, which is still a big if.

378
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And still a long way.

379
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, depending on when the city council finishes with it, and then if the mayor agrees, and then it goes to the state house, and then I have no idea how long they take with it.

380
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:31,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.

381
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: whether there's a way to sort of influence them to move faster.

382
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:40,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it will be a home rule petition, which is basically like a bill, right?

383
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

384
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:49,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like cell phone going in the... And there's so many home rule petitions that, you know, there's just so many of them.

385
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:52,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how long it will take them, but hopefully not too long.

386
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: When do we think that...

387
00:37:56,015 --> 00:38:01,219
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's based on the state delegation, when it gets that far, pushing it through there.

388
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:10,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I find them, if they've got the right numbers in the favor of people wanting to do it, that it kind of passes reasonably.

389
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:15,329
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to pass with only four votes in favor of doing it.

390
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to get on as a home rule petition.

391
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:19,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

392
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:22,280
[SPEAKER_00]: You know yourself, Milva, what we went through the last time.

393
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,740
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

394
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

395
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:24,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

396
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,962
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have five or more.

397
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,543
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dead in the water.

398
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:28,964
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, too.

399
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:36,689
[SPEAKER_02]: If the city council voted it through without a supermajority, then that would be different, too.

400
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

401
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:39,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

402
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:42,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of unknowns.

403
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: When might this go on the ballot?

404
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:46,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

405
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,687
[SPEAKER_02]: If all the stars and planets align.

406
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean for the Medford ballot?

407
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

408
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, it depends how much time the city council takes with it.

409
00:38:56,593 --> 00:39:01,157
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends whether the city council and the mayor reach agreement, how long that would take.

410
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:02,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it goes to the state house.

411
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, I have no idea.

412
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,161
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take three years.

413
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:09,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

414
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:13,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus, because it's got to go on a municipal election, too.

415
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they ever have special elections for something like this.

416
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:19,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

417
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I know of.

418
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:23,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought it just went hand in hand with the municipal election.

419
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:28,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So it ain't going on 25, 2025, so it could be 2027.

420
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:30,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

421
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:32,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It could go on 2025.

422
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If all the stars and planets align.

423
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, good luck with that.

424
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,657
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't got a chance to see him, God.

425
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:44,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be great if there's enough.

426
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:52,407
[SPEAKER_02]: momentum that sort of, you know, that make it.

427
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:53,768
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that that's the key.

428
00:39:53,788 --> 00:40:00,432
[SPEAKER_00]: If we finish our stuff in September and we've got a real viable project and a viable paper.

429
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:04,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we got to try to sit on them and say, hey, listen, we want this to be brought up.

430
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:07,016
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to we want to move forward with this.

431
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:14,080
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe you get it within a year or six months after after the total document been presented.

432
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:14,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.

433
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

434
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:15,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

435
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:18,656
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.

436
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:19,696
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

437
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:21,237
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we've got to finish our job.

438
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:24,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting there.

439
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:29,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're closer than it feels like we are.

440
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,561
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have done a great job.

441
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has.

442
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:33,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

443
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:34,242
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

444
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:35,402
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great committee.

445
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:37,003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

446
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:42,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So tomorrow night, we have much work to do to get through a bunch of material.

447
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:43,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, is there anything else?

448
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,708
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapped up the issues we needed to look at.

449
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that covers it for tonight.

450
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job, Gene, especially Welby.

451
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

452
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:55,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're back to normal.
