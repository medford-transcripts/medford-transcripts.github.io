1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permitting Committee, March 27, 2024.

2
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,788
[SPEAKER_04]: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

3
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:16,013
[SPEAKER_04]: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hess Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?

5
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:19,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Kelly?

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

7
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:21,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemingng?

8
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:23,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

9
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:24,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:25,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: President Bears?

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins?

14
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:30,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

15
00:00:32,307 --> 00:00:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Five present, none absent.

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,952
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is commenced.

17
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,897
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of tonight's meeting is to discuss two papers.

18
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: 23-427.

19
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:50,337
[SPEAKER_04]: This is proposed by President Bears in the previous council term.

20
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:59,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a resolution to amend short-term rental ordinance to include a monthly report from short-term rental platforms.

21
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:02,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And by that, we're talking about platforms such as Airbnb.

22
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:09,310
[SPEAKER_04]: The second action item for tonight is paper 24-008, also offered by President Bears.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,112
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a resolution to review the fee schedule

24
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I will read out the description of each resolution, then I will pass it over to President Bears to further describe these projects.

25
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:41,959
[SPEAKER_04]: 23427, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the former Zoning Planning and Development Subcommittee need to discuss amendments to Section 8.4 of the Zoning Ordinance regarding short-term rentals to require a monthly report from all short-term rental platforms

26
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:47,693
[SPEAKER_04]: to ensure that short-term rental units in Medford meet all requirements of this section.

27
00:01:49,273 --> 00:02:01,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And then resolution 24-008, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the fee schedule of the city of Method, appendix A to the city ordinances be reviewed and updated.

28
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:10,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I will now pass it off to President Bears as soon as he is ready to further orient us to these two topics.

29
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:15,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

30
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,402
[SPEAKER_02]: One second here.

31
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:22,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can start with the short-term rental platform report.

32
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:33,143
[SPEAKER_02]: 2022 zoning recodification, we created a section 94-8.4 to specifically regulate short-term rentals in the city.

33
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the elements of that regulation is a registration process where the actual operators of short-term rental units register with the city.

34
00:02:47,765 --> 00:03:01,251
[SPEAKER_02]: certifying that the operator has permission of the owner, that they pay a $200 annual registration fee, that they re-register the unit upon transfer of ownership or operator, and a number of other items.

35
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,812
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really designed to

36
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:15,854
[SPEAKER_02]: This entire ordinance is really section of the zoning ordinance designed to regulate short term rentals, which have become in some cases, a nuisance issue in certain neighborhoods, a supply issue across the city.

37
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not to say that we don't want short term rental options.

38
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of people who do take advantage of them for a number of.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:43,493
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly valid reasons, but to make sure that the city has a clear understanding of how much of the housing stock is being taken up by short-term rentals, what the conditions of those short-term rentals are, and that the operators are treating neighbors with respect when it comes to trash, noise, et cetera.

40
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:46,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the intent of the ordinance.

41
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:51,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been in place now for a little over, a little less than two years.

42
00:03:53,268 --> 00:04:12,715
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been certainly some improvements, but from conversations that we've had in this chamber with members of the public, with folks from the building department, in terms of enforceability, one of the biggest issues is there's really not enough staffing at the city level to make sure that every unit in the city is actually registered.

43
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:20,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no way to know if units are being, no systemic way for the city to know in an effective way if units are being,

44
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:28,743
[SPEAKER_02]: rented through these platforms without permission, essentially, unregistered units.

45
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:38,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the solutions that other communities have had when they've run into these situations is actually going to the profit centers here in the short-term rental industry.

46
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So going to your major short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, HomeAway, Vrbo, etc.

47
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:54,896
[SPEAKER_02]: and requiring that those platforms issue reports to the city of all of the units that are being rented on those platforms.

48
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:58,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the city has a clear piece of data.

49
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just like you have the

50
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:09,229
[SPEAKER_02]: building inspector, the code enforcement officer in their spare time going to airbnb.com and trying to figure out what's a valid rental and what isn't, which is basically the best that we can do right now.

51
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:20,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually having an official monthly report from the short-term rental platforms themselves that says, here's all the addresses at which short-term rental units were rented in your city.

52
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,884
[SPEAKER_02]: As I noted, some other communities have done this.

53
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Boston has done this.

54
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:48,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's worth consideration of a zoning amendment to put this into our short-term rental ordinance and beef up the ability of the city to have an accurate registry of the short-term rental units in the city as we work through comprehensive policy to try to address the housing crisis here in the community.

55
00:05:53,387 --> 00:06:21,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears, I appreciate that overview, and I, as one Councilor, certainly I've been at meetings where the nuisance issue that occasionally comes up with short-term rentals has been discussed, and others in which, you know, the effect of taking rentals off of the housing market to turn them into, you know, for example, Airbnb units, or HomeAway units, or Burbo units,

56
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:25,535
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel that effect in the availability of rentals citywide.

57
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:42,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that this makes sense as part of our overall efforts to keep tabs on activity of the short-term rental platforms in Medford and making sure that at least we have an accurate picture of what's going on.

58
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

59
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:44,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

60
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:50,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious if that monthly report comes in, who goes over the report and then what happens after that?

61
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:56,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a discussion we need to have with the building department.

62
00:06:57,311 --> 00:07:03,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they're tasked with enforcing the zoning ordinance and enforcing this element of it.

63
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:16,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe it would be staff in the building department who would be taking this report and entering it into the database that's currently required by the registration section of the ordinance.

64
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:22,940
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's part of kind of the next steps is we'd want to talk about that with them.

65
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have some suggestions to go forward from here about sending some draft language to the building department, getting input from the building commissioner.

66
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:39,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I think it'd be good to hear from planning a little bit, just if they have suggestions, but I'll hold that until we have more discussion.

67
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's thoughts, I do have some language here that I'm happy to read at any time from the Boston ordinance, if anyone just let me know.

68
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further comments or questions from Councilors?

69
00:07:51,067 --> 00:08:04,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in that case, we can proceed along to if you have any next steps in mind or care to share that sample language from the city of Boston.

70
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:17,795
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears, whenever you're ready, I think it makes sense to look at the language that other communities have used to mandate that platforms are reporting to the city on how many units they have in operation.

71
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:20,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

72
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second.

73
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:22,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.

74
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm happy to screen share if you want to send me a link or if you'd like to do so, whatever is easier.

75
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share with you.

76
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:38,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Google Doc.

77
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:39,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I just shared it with you.

78
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, it's a pretty short sentence.

79
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:56,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It really would just be amending section 94-8.4.13 to include some section around what they, in the Boston ordinance, they call data sharing.

80
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:04,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And the section is 90, this is in Boston, 9-14.11 data sharing.

81
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: A booking agent shall provide to the city on a monthly basis an electronic report in a format determined by the city.

82
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,902
[SPEAKER_02]: in consultation with their inspectional services, information technology, and neighborhood development departments.

83
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:32,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the listings maintained, authorized, facilitated, or advertised by the booking agent within the city of Boston for the applicable reporting period, the report shall include a breakdown of where the listings are located, whether the listing is for a room or a whole unit, and shall include the number of nights each unit was reported as occupied during the reporting period.

84
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:38,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did just start trying to work out, I think, what would be essentially a similar

85
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:52,963
[SPEAKER_02]: structure would be in place of their acronyms, just that the booking agent would provide it in a format determined by the city in consultation with the building department, IT department, and the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

86
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:56,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

87
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bereson.

88
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:10,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to sort of paraphrase that back to you, the fellow Councilors and residents, this is essentially mandating a report from the short-term booking platform.

89
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:34,135
[SPEAKER_04]: that tells the city, you know, we have listings, we have rooms and buildings available within the city of Method, this is where they are, this is if it's a room or a whole building or a whole unit, and this is the number of nights that each of the units was reported by the renter as being rented to somebody during the month to help us get a picture.

90
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I see this as helping us reconcile

91
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,774
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hearing from some of the people that rent rooms on the short-term booking platforms.

92
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this unit is a rental and I rented it for this number of nights.

93
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:53,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Reports such as this would capture from the platform side, this is the overall number of units that we know on the back end was rented in the city during this month.

94
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,851
[SPEAKER_04]: We could see if there's a discrepancy.

95
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:07,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments from councilors at this time, having looked at this draft language?

96
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:09,997
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be an amendment to the zoning ordinance.

97
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing none, President Perez, I want to kick it back to you for next steps, if you had any before I share my thoughts.

98
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just move that we request that the clerk refer

99
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:53,837
[SPEAKER_02]: this amended language to the building commissioner, the IT director, and the PDS director for review within 60 days and comments before we begin to incorporate this into, I think we could make it part of our zoning update.

100
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will set that too.

101
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

102
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:27,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

103
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:28,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, let me...

104
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any further comments or questions from councilors or members of the public before we take a vote on the motion?

105
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:39,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

106
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:42,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

107
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:42,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

108
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:44,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Fleming?

109
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:45,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

110
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

111
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:49,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

112
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:53,195
[SPEAKER_06]: President Pierce?

113
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

114
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins?

115
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:56,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

116
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Five in favor, none against.

117
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

118
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:17,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So this draft language will be referred to the building commissioner, IT director, and PDS director, and we'll get their expert feedback on it before we make any moves to fold this into our comprehensive zoning update so that this can also be updated while we're doing potentially other zoning changes.

119
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any other discussion on this topic before we move on to our second paper for the night, either from councilors or from members of the public?

120
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:33,422
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

121
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:40,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing none, let's proceed along to paper 24008.

122
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:46,772
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the resolution that the city council review the fee schedule.

123
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: of the city of Method and look for areas to modernize and update.

124
00:13:54,526 --> 00:14:01,428
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is that the intention of this resolution is to look across many departments, like any departments for whom it's relevant.

125
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:13,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Many departments charge fees for various things that they do in the city, such as issuing a marriage license or registering your car, getting residential parking permit.

126
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:20,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And in many departments, it's been a long time since those fees were updated and changed.

127
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:31,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's my understanding that in many departments, the fees that we charge are perhaps lower than they should be to correlate with the administrative cost of doing those functions.

128
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And they might also be very out of step with what similar municipalities are charging for the same functions.

129
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:43,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the intent here is to make any astronomical changes, but just to do a standard review

130
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:50,267
[SPEAKER_04]: since one has not been done in, I think, many years, to see where are those glaring spots where things really need to be updated.

131
00:14:52,489 --> 00:15:09,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the questions before us at this early stage is to say where all of the fee schedules for all of the departments are on the table, what departments do we want to look at specifically, and who are we requesting feedback and context from at this time?

132
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,765
[SPEAKER_04]: But for further table setting, President Bears, do you have anything else you want to

133
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,069
[SPEAKER_04]: and as the paper sponsor at this time?

134
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Councilor Collins.

135
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a quick run through of appendix A of the city ordinances, and I think there's a few things to note.

136
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:38,534
[SPEAKER_02]: One, in terms of fees set by ordinance, in my four plus years on the council, I believe we've only amended one or created one fee, and that was the planned development district fee.

137
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't believe we've ever amended another fee.

138
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:42,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be wrong.

139
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to go double check, but I can't remember a vote on updating a fee.

140
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:50,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly these fees have not been reviewed or updated in five years.

141
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:59,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I know anecdotally speaking with many department heads where fees are set by ordinance, they have said that some of these fees may well be 25, 30, 40 years old.

142
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:15,169
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly at least 10 plus years old and just are not reflective of the cost that it takes to process paperwork, not reflective of peer neighboring communities and the fees that they charge.

143
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:23,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I heard the clerk give telling the anecdote that he's told me before that there are people who come to get married in Medford because it's so much cheaper than getting married everywhere else.

144
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:30,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, there's some romance in that, I guess, uh, but, um,

145
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:33,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that it's...

146
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:46,394
[SPEAKER_02]: As we've worked through many ordinances and just looked through the bulk of the work of the city, it's very clear that there's things that have just not been looked at in a very long time.

147
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:50,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, some of these are ripe.

148
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:54,116
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about building permit fees for large developments.

149
00:16:54,196 --> 00:17:03,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about a number of things that could be really significant in terms of the questions that we have around revenue and the underfunding of city government, underfunding of

150
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,863
[SPEAKER_02]: all of our basic infrastructure, underfunding of staffing levels, schools, capital needs, etc.

151
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're having those hard, difficult conversations around funding in a lot of different ways.

152
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:28,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the kind of low-hanging fruit ways, along with what we talked about, I would say, with linkage earlier yesterday and last week, where

153
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:35,767
[SPEAKER_02]: we can knock some things off and try to see what we can bring in through these things.

154
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think dog licenses are ever going to be the solution to building a new high school.

155
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone thinks that to be true.

156
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can maybe help a little bit.

157
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an important thing for us to factor in.

158
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:58,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did go through, again, Appendix A. And it looks like of the about 10 or 11 or so fee categories,

159
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:15,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them are within the building department, some of them in the DPW, some of them in the clerk's office, but we have animals and rodents, much of that in the health department, but also some in the clerk's office, some in the building department around dogs for the clerk's office.

160
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:25,556
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of building fees in the building department, electrical fees sitting with the electrical department, plumbing fees with the building department.

161
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:32,088
[SPEAKER_02]: The business licenses and other fees are split between the clerk's office, DPW, and the building department.

162
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Cemetery fees with DPW.

163
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire prevention and protection with fire.

164
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Streets, sidewalks, and public places tended to be DPW or engineering.

165
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:46,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Utilities also tended to be DPW, engineering, water, sewer.

166
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Vehicles for hire I couldn't quite place.

167
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that maybe being in DPW engineering,

168
00:18:55,181 --> 00:19:07,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Traffic and Transportation Director there, but I also don't know that it's an entirely applicable fee schedule there anymore.

169
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to go back to see exactly what it is, but I don't know how many taxis are operating out of Medford these days, and it is just related to taxi cabs.

170
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:26,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And then zoning, again, goes back to building and planning development sustainability as well.

171
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:41,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are just some of the departments that I've identified having some relationship to the Appendix A fees, many of which are noted or set by ordinance.

172
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it will be worth

173
00:19:45,546 --> 00:20:05,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can kind of type this up in the form of a motion asking each department to take a look within the next 90 days at the fee schedules that their departments pertain to and reply with a recommended adjustment that we can then initiate the process to adjust.

174
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:10,798
[SPEAKER_02]: That should give them time to take a look at neighboring communities and what their fees are.

175
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:25,897
[SPEAKER_02]: contact any sort of professional associations or networks of city and municipal staff that they may be a part of and kind of just see what's the going rate these days and Medford getting caught up with the times.

176
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:30,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Bears.

177
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

178
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the timeline sounds right.

179
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:38,666
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I imagine, you know, trying to put myself in the position of a

180
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Department head looking at this, I'm sure that there are some of those fees where what it is and what it should be will jump out as obvious, and others where it will take a little bit of calculation.

181
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,629
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the administrative cost incurred?

182
00:20:51,649 --> 00:21:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: What would a more appropriate number be to do that research into what neighboring communities are charging to make sure that it's consistent with our regional neighbors?

183
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:05,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to Councilor Callahan, and then I see Planner Evans' hand raised on Zoom.

184
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:06,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan?

185
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:24,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we think that it's appropriate given that a lot of this is for new construction, and some of it may be fossil fuel stuff construction in buildings, is this a place where we can request that the departments that we're talking to take into consideration.

186
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:40,578
[SPEAKER_08]: incentives for our climate goals or our affordable housing goals that are lined out in our various plans, like the CAP, the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, or our Affordable Housing Production Plan.

187
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we ask that they take those into consideration when they are updating?

188
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:46,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great idea.

189
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:01,878
[SPEAKER_02]: with the language of the actual motion.

190
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm working on it.

191
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:11,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go now to Planner Evans on Zoom.

192
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Daniel Evans, Senior Planner in PDS.

193
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:19,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologies that I'm not downstairs.

194
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:22,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of work that I'm working on at the same time.

195
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:32,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did update our um community development fees in january I noticed when I first um took this role.

196
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:45,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that they hadn't been updated since the 90s and We did a cursory review of our peer communities in the boston metro area and um

197
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:52,075
[SPEAKER_01]: made adjustments, particularly to site plan review.

198
00:22:52,095 --> 00:23:01,064
[SPEAKER_01]: We effectively doubled them, which was necessary to even approach what other communities were charging.

199
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,987
[SPEAKER_01]: We instituted a base fee.

200
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:08,932
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually no base fee

201
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:17,899
[SPEAKER_01]: and the square footage that the fees kicked in was high enough that there were some applications that paid nothing.

202
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:30,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Raising Cane's had to pay a cent for their site plan review because it's small and there was no base fee, which is incredible considering the amount of staff time that went into that.

203
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:34,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So we rectified that, there were

204
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:39,206
[SPEAKER_01]: special permits that didn't have fees associated with them at all.

205
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:46,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wouldn't be able to even charge for them.

206
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:55,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I learned that abutters mailing notices, we weren't charging for postage.

207
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:05,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've started to at least bill or charge developers

208
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,752
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least the cost of our mailings.

209
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:13,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's little things like that that add up.

210
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:23,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Community Development Board is able to update their fees, not via the ordinance, through their rules and regulations.

211
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:31,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about the other boards and what their fees are, but the site plan review fees are,

212
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:39,980
[SPEAKER_01]: are basically targeted due to what's subject to site plan review and the size of them.

213
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It's larger developers where you're paying a couple extra thousand dollars is really just a drop in the bucket.

214
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:49,332
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even sneeze at it when you tell them the fee.

215
00:24:51,562 --> 00:25:11,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoning board fees probably need to be looked at a little bit closer because there could be some small, you know, property owners that are affected by those and we wouldn't want to put too much of a burden if someone wants to say, you know, put a small addition or build a porch or something.

216
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:17,499
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are already in the process of like reviewing these fees.

217
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,741
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to provide that update.

218
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:25,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Daniel.

219
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really helpful for President Bears.

220
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:30,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Daniel.

221
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:31,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that update.

222
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:37,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if those fees are... I actually didn't see, and maybe I just missed them.

223
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they even included in the fee schedule?

224
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the only site plan review I see is 150 per 1,000 square feet site plan review application at MUZ District.

225
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So we might need to...

226
00:25:54,656 --> 00:26:07,078
[SPEAKER_02]: further update all of the different fees even if they're not set by ordinance and maybe also want to indicate what body has the authority to set fees.

227
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:32,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know alicia had asked me to send some fees to her but I I didn't know the origin of the request and perhaps what you're looking at is Fees that your body would be approving and that's why it's not included but I think a full review of all fees Um need to be

228
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:33,695
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewed.

229
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:40,721
[SPEAKER_01]: But I put the fees on the website on the Community Development Board page.

230
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:46,366
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fee schedule, but I can also send that to you in a Word document as well, happy to.

231
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:53,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I honestly, as I look at the appendix, I don't know that they're all set by us.

232
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them certainly outline

233
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,721
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say what section of the ordinance the fee is set in.

234
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, like if I go over the opening of streets and sidewalks, it says the following license or permit shall be issued by director of public works and the fee set forth in appendix A of these revised ordinances, but it doesn't say what the fee is.

235
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:21,169
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important for us to

236
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:27,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be great if we could update this list to be comprehensive.

237
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that you're already working on some of that.

238
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that might be helpful is to look and see if other cities and towns incorporate fee schedules by reference.

239
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:49,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not an amendment to an ordinance every single time, because that could get bogged down.

240
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:59,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the legalities of what needs to actually be in an ordinance and what can be in rules and regulations incorporated by reference.

241
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:03,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a thought.

242
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be that that's what this is.

243
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we set up the PDD fee, we set it up, but that it would be updated.

244
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:13,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't require to go through a three reading ordinance process.

245
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:15,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be a simple majority vote of the council.

246
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:21,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there'd be a lot of value in just getting these all in one place.

247
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,492
[SPEAKER_02]: and having a clear list of who sets them and by what authority.

248
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Planner Everins.

249
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears, I appreciate this discussion.

250
00:28:44,342 --> 00:28:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's plenty of organization that would be helpful to both city staff and potentially developers and other people and entities that

251
00:28:53,308 --> 00:29:00,752
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to do the functions that incur fees to make it more clear what we're working with, where it lives.

252
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:13,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the city side, part of the overall effort is not only to update some fees that are at least a decade, if not several decades out of date.

253
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:19,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think in all of this, we're always trying to look at, is the procedure by which we update this the one that makes sense?

254
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:21,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm glad that we're also thinking

255
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting straight on for the different fees, for the different functions.

256
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it by ordinance?

257
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it by rule of regulation?

258
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:31,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Set by a board that doesn't have to go through an ordinance?

259
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:37,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be interested, as we're doing this review, just to see what options we have.

260
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:47,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always, for myself as one Councilor, for something like fees where we're trying to make sure that it stays up to date, it is sometimes helpful to

261
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:57,578
[SPEAKER_04]: consider if we have other non-ordinance mechanisms for doing that, so there doesn't have to be a legislation every time to keep something, you know, proceeding with, you know, cost of inflation.

262
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:58,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan.

263
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:17,722
[SPEAKER_08]: As I'm scrolling through all these many fees, I do notice taxi cabs on here, and I'm curious if the city has done anything about including the gig worker cab things into, I assume that this only applies to actual taxi cabs and not to like Uber drivers and everything else,

264
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know whether, I mean, that seems to me clearly to be totally outdated, and maybe we need something totally different.

265
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:28,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some stuff in here, if I may, along those lines.

266
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we do have the Uber Lyft, the TNC's, Transportation Network Company, I think is their non-branded label.

267
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard that before.

268
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:43,243
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect those.

269
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:44,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not listed here.

270
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,846
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect short-term rental fees.

271
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not listed here.

272
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:52,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a, yeah, definitely there's things that are not listed.

273
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:56,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of the community development fees that Danielle just mentioned.

274
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

275
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

276
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:14,389
[SPEAKER_04]: As we're, I think that we're going to be collecting input and feedback on ideas for a lot of departments and boards on this.

277
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:18,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's my hope that as we're going through and updating the fees themselves, we could also be

278
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:32,450
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as it's been mentioned, working to get all of the fees in the same place right now, it's really, it's pretty disorganized with a lot of things existing in other appendices on different webpages.

279
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be helpful to have all the fees in the same appendix.

280
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:38,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kellihan.

281
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:44,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a way of knowing which of these fees bring in what amount of money?

282
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Or which categories of fees bring in what amount of money?

283
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I mean, sometimes we will get a report during budget time that's like building permits brought in XYZ or anything.

284
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:59,621
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask for discrete reports from finance, but it's generally not.

285
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:07,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not seen like a spreadsheet table of here's what all the fees bring in, split out.

286
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure it's producible, but I haven't seen it.

287
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions or comments from councilors at this time?

288
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two more motions, but I can wait.

289
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:24,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to email it to you.

290
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:24,088
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

291
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:25,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

292
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to Councilor Lemingng.

293
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:33,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going on some of my thoughts from the linkage fee updates.

294
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:44,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible to tie, is it possible or legal to tie these to any sort of consumer price index just to make them sort of

295
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:50,757
[SPEAKER_05]: automatically go up with inflation every year so that future updates aren't quite as necessary?

296
00:32:50,817 --> 00:32:56,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does anybody see any problems with potentially implementing it that way?

297
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it would make sense.

298
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the legal.

299
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can ask for that.

300
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:12,388
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

301
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:27,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the legalese on that either, but I would be interested to know about the opinion of KP Law in doing that.

302
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:42,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to motion to request the legal opinion of KP Law on tying the city's fee schedule in Appendix A to the Consumer Price Index.

303
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:51,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

304
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely agree with the intent of that.

305
00:33:55,403 --> 00:34:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to know if it's possible for us to institute an annual percentage increase to a fee by ordinance, regardless of the percentage of that fee.

306
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

307
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

308
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:10,855
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

309
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:41,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that's two motions currently on the floor, one of which is to ask department heads to take 90 days to review the fees that pertain to their departments, do the necessary question and answer research review to look into what changes they might recommend, send that back to us.

310
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:48,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Planner Evans has also offered to send to city council leadership

311
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:57,949
[SPEAKER_04]: the document of community development fees that are not listed in Appendix A, which I think will be helpful context.

312
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:08,878
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion on the floor as well to ask legal counsel if it is possible to connect an annual... was that a CPI increase?

313
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be a CPI increase.

314
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:25,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, what you said earlier about just a concrete, about a set percentage increase every year, just their legal opinion on doing that.

315
00:35:25,962 --> 00:35:26,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

316
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:34,884
[SPEAKER_04]: For a legal opinion on, it's possible to put a annual percentage increase to a fee set by ordinance or CPI.

317
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:38,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

318
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

319
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:52,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to be a stickler, but if you can, if we can sever that piece with the, uh, KP law, um, anything dealing with KP law, I won't be, um, in favor of, okay.

320
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, uh, if that could be done, I'd appreciate it.

321
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate everybody's hard work on this.

322
00:35:58,841 --> 00:35:59,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks.

323
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly Councilors are probably, we'll be sure to take those as separate motions.

324
00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:13,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first one we got, it's the two on this paper we still need to vote on.

325
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:17,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the first one was on the short-term rental.

326
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sent it to you.

327
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And I included what I thought was in his amendment, too.

328
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:13,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wrote it down as an amendment, though.

329
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking credit.

330
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

331
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:30,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Perez moved to request that the below department heads reply to the council within 90 days with a recommendation to update fees in the city fee schedule, appendix A of the city ordinances, based on fee rates in neighboring and peer communities and other assessments deemed relevant.

332
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:34,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And then

333
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:50,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the amendment from Councilor Calohan is to request that department heads consider incentive structures within fee changes to encourage meeting of climate and housing goals outlined in the city's comprehensive plan, climate action and adaptation plan, housing production plan, and open space plan.

334
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:52,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And then.

335
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't made these other two ones yet.

336
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:57,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

337
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:00,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just take the first one for now.

338
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the first motion.

339
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:07,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I present embarrass with an amendment offered by Councilor Callahan.

340
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we good to vote on that?

341
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second on that motion?

342
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:14,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

343
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:16,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready.

344
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:35,326
[SPEAKER_04]: That motion passes.

345
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:57,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to give a moment to prepare, or sorry, there was a motion from Councilor Lemingng to ask legal counsel if it is possible to institute an annual percentage increase to a fee that is set by ordinance.

346
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second on that motion?

347
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:00,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I second.

348
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:02,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by President Bears.

349
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:07,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Consumer price index or I think Councilor, Vice President Collins also said consumer price index or an annual escalation.

350
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:09,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, was that in the text?

351
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:11,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question is just can we

352
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we increase a fee by a percentage?

353
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:32,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should be aware that when we ask KP law questions, they get very specific answers.

354
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:36,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should add the language, or another inflation measure.

355
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:39,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Or another inflation measure.

356
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:41,272
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would use, something like that.

357
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:49,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a second from President Bears on that.

358
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

359
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

360
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

361
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:56,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Fleming?

362
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:56,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

363
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

364
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:58,920
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

365
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:02,242
[SPEAKER_06]: President Barras?

366
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:02,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

367
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:03,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins?

368
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:04,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

369
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:06,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Four in favor, one opposed.

370
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:07,984
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

371
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two more motions.

372
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:11,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

373
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:22,149
[SPEAKER_02]: One is a motion to request that all city departments provide a report to the City Council within 90 days on any fees they assess as a department and share a complete list of those fees and the legal authority

374
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:28,449
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, state law, city ordinance, board and commission rules and regulations that allows them to charge set fees.

375
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one motion.

376
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:37,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second on that motion?

377
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:39,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Second from Councilor Callahan.

378
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:46,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last motion, I can give it a minute.

379
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:01,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

380
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:14,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a motion to request that all city departments share feedback on any new fees that should be charged, fees created by ordinance that are no longer relevant, and other comments on existing fees, for example, name changes, updates to legal authority, et cetera.

381
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:19,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically just a catch-all if you got a comment on the fees, feel free to send it.

382
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:21,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

383
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:22,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second on that motion?

384
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Kelly.

385
00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

386
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Scarpel.

387
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:38,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, on the first motion from President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

388
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:40,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, whenever you're ready, please call the roll.

389
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:41,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

390
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:42,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

391
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemingng?

392
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:43,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

393
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:44,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

394
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:45,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

395
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,841
[SPEAKER_06]: President Bears?

396
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:47,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

397
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:48,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins?

398
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:49,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

399
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:52,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Five in favor, none opposed, the motion passes.

400
00:41:59,129 --> 00:41:59,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the

401
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Second motion from President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

402
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:06,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotly pursued by Councilor Scarpelli.

403
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:10,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you're ready, Mr. Clerk.

404
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Hotly pursued, love it.

405
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:16,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

406
00:42:17,144 --> 00:42:17,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

407
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leming?

408
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:21,067
