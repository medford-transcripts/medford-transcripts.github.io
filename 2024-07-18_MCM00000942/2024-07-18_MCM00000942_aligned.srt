1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:03,593
Okay, so we're going to start with.

2
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:10,076
The meeting the minutes from last week.

3
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,157
From the last time we met.

4
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,984
Does anybody have any edits to the minutes?

5
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,165
Okay, here it is.

6
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:42,148
Brenda, you want to go through the minutes or.

7
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,250
I don't think we need to talk through them.

8
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,432
We sent them out ahead of time.

9
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:50,454
Did people have a chance to look at them?

10
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:56,399
This is the 1 from March 18, 2024, the 1 before that.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,741
The minutes from from February.

12
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,742
Yeah.

13
00:00:59,762 --> 00:00:59,922
Yeah.

14
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:10,955
I wasn't at that meeting, so I wouldn't have any edits or anything.

15
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,662
Basically, guys, motion to approve the minutes from February 26.

16
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,903
I second this motion.

17
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,705
Now we have to vote.

18
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,591
All in favor.

19
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,415
I proposed.

20
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:44,358
Abstained.

21
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:51,985
Motion granted, right?

22
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:55,107
Yes, motion granted.

23
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:02,954
Okay.

24
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:16,776
So, so the 1st is we're going to have to reschedule April.

25
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:20,098
The next April meeting.

26
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,141
If everyone wants to meet.

27
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:27,081
April 29.

28
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:34,465
Motion to approve to switch it to that date.

29
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,411
Yeah, I 2nd, the motion.

30
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,253
I'm okay with that all in favor.

31
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:50,976
Okay, so it will be April 29, right?

32
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:51,797
Okay.

33
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:52,537
Yes.

34
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,238
Did we hear Natasha on that 1?

35
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah, I'm looking so which 1 are we not.

36
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,942
Going to be on it's going to do it.

37
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:04,823
The 8th, right?

38
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,153
So it's the 15th?

39
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:13,095
City Hall is closed on the 15th because it's Patriots Day?

40
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,895
No, Patriots Day.

41
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,456
Okay.

42
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,697
So the 29th.

43
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,438
Okay, okay.

44
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:23,339
I just had to check to see.

45
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:25,239
Okay.

46
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:28,941
What was the word again?

47
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:30,681
Wait, no, never mind.

48
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:31,782
Are you in favor?

49
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:35,872
I'm in favor.

50
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:36,172
Okay.

51
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:36,853
I'm learning.

52
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:37,773
I'm in favor.

53
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:41,895
Okay.

54
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,135
That's great.

55
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:47,717
And I would also add, since we're talking about this, the June meeting.

56
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:54,139
June 17th is also a holiday.

57
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:02,823
So, we should, we could probably reschedule that as well just so that people can plan it out in advance.

58
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,183
What about June 24?

59
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:10,965
Do you approve on that date?

60
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:11,345
I approve.

61
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,085
So far, yeah.

62
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,446
It's too far away to know.

63
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:19,907
But if anything comes up.

64
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:20,247
Okay.

65
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,879
So is the 24th okay with folks?

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,680
Yes.

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,463
If it is, then we should do a motion for that, to reschedule that one.

68
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:57,209
Motion to approve that, switching the 17th of June to June 24th.

69
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,591
I second the motion.

70
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,754
I second the motion.

71
00:05:03,814 --> 00:05:04,995
If I'm not out of town.

72
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:07,917
Stacy?

73
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:08,958
Aye.

74
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:10,139
I'm in favor.

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay.

76
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,791
So, we're talking about April 29th.

77
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:21,671
And 624.

78
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:28,233
Trying to update my personal calendar.

79
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,757
Sorry, I was trying to sneeze.

80
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:45,538
If you see me like that.

81
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:53,938
But, um, okay, so the next 1 that we have for the agenda is that.

82
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:02,505
Update from Brenda before we jump to that 1 thing I wanted to talk about was, um, do we want to do any of these meetings in person?

83
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:04,767
Oh, yes, I remember that.

84
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:05,528
Um.

85
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:11,053
Natasha Stacy, do you guys want to do it in person?

86
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:19,670
Which 1, all of them are no, we can do 1 in person Brenda.

87
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:19,990
Right?

88
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,091
Or do you want to do them all in person?

89
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,112
No, you can do however many you can do.

90
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,834
However, many of them in person as you want or or none of them.

91
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,355
It's all it's all dependent on what you want.

92
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,498
I think maybe we can do like, once a month in person.

93
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:35,699
Just so we can see each other.

94
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,322
So, we're only meeting once a month for this, right?

95
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,060
Well, then we can meet.

96
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,083
We'll be a nice day.

97
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:50,464
There'll be some.

98
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,026
So.

99
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:59,475
But if we did, like, every other month, there's something like that or every 2 months, we meet in person or something like that.

100
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:01,497
Or quarterly every 3 months.

101
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,199
Yeah.

102
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
It's a suggestion.

103
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,363
So one month, yes, one month, no, is a good idea.

104
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:09,223
Say again.

105
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,286
One month, yes, one month, no, like every other.

106
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,206
So every other.

107
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:13,887
Yeah.

108
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:20,432
So would you guys want to meet, like, the next meeting we meet in person?

109
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:23,955
I would like that.

110
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,778
And on April 29th?

111
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:28,138
No, it was 27th.

112
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:29,619
Oh, 27, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:29,719
Yeah.

114
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,597
Or 27, is it?

115
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:35,758
No, the 29th.

116
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:37,639
Yeah, you're right, 29th.

117
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,900
Sorry, Sharba, I was looking at me.

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,900
Wait a minute.

119
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,002
Sorry.

120
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:46,163
The calendar is driving me insane.

121
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,544
Okay, yes.

122
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:52,866
Yes, so all in favor to meet me in person April 29?

123
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:53,947
Natasha?

124
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:10,290
Stacey, do we have an option of hybrid if the 1st, if I can't make it.

125
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:19,095
Yes, I think you, you might not have a good connection.

126
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:28,401
I'm like, no, but yes, we can do a hybrid setup.

127
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:34,147
So and that helps members of the public if they want to join, they can use the zoom link to join.

128
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,249
So we will set it up in a meeting room here at City Hall.

129
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,255
And I'll set up like a camera and microphone there so that people online can can watch if they want to.

130
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:51,410
Brenda, I was curious, um, the meetings like this that have to be in city hall or could it be the library as well?

131
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:56,813
Because how interesting yes, I think it.

132
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,875
Could be the library, although, um.

133
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:04,357
Scheduling the room might be a little bit more difficult for me.

134
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:05,458
Um.

135
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,600
But, yeah, we could, we could definitely go to the library.

136
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:11,974
Yeah, because we usually the connectors we meet on Mondays.

137
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,436
That's like our meet, like period.

138
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:20,841
So I think that'd be good for us to like have our meeting and then have like the connectors meeting, like there.

139
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,242
Oh, cool.

140
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:26,005
So you meet at the library every Monday at this time anyway.

141
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:27,506
Yep.

142
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:27,506
530.

143
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:29,247
What room are you in there?

144
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,690
Oh, well, we can choose any room, but we usually do room four.

145
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:38,168
Room for big enough, but it's small enough to at the same time.

146
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,948
So, it's it's a good conference room.

147
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:45,430
Okay, I mean, it has to be big enough so that if members of the public want to join that there's room for them to.

148
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,171
You can do the room 5, then the room 5 is the biggest 1 and it's really vague.

149
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:50,491
So.

150
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:57,033
I don't think they're opposed to it anyways, because we go there all the time.

151
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:57,593
Like I said.

152
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,634
We always call in advance, let them know and we book it.

153
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:03,555
Yeah.

154
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,850
Let me let's have Kim.

155
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,672
Can we not do it for the April meeting?

156
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:20,461
Because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to take the the camera and microphone setup that we have out of City Hall.

157
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:29,048
So it would give me time to like double check whether I can do that and to see what options they have at the library if we want to use those instead.

158
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,278
Sounds good.

159
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,539
I was saying more for like a field trip.

160
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,119
So you can get out of the city hall.

161
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:37,599
Yes.

162
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:38,539
Lovely.

163
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
Don't tell me that.

164
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:54,022
Okay, so yeah, so, so April 29, we'll meet here at city hall and we'll have an hybrid option if people do want to call in.

165
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,723
But then I'll look into for the

166
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:02,804
June meeting, which would be the next one that would be in-person if we could do it at the library.

167
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:03,605
Yeah.

168
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:08,668
Cool.

169
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,549
Just so that I'm on track here.

170
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,931
April, we will meet in-person, but we'll do that at City Hall.

171
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,232
That's April.

172
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,433
May, we'll be on the call.

173
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:24,597
In June, in-person, maybe the library, or we're shooting for the library.

174
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:25,997
Got it.

175
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:27,018
Roger that.

176
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,680
All in favor?

177
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:35,583
Natasha, Charbel, T?

178
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:37,404
Yes, okay.

179
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:40,345
Yes, in favor.

180
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:50,510
Okay, so next up, I think it's my updates on city actions.

181
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:56,513
Oh, sorry, should we discuss the letter first before that?

182
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:57,932
Oh, yes.

183
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,272
Oh, the letter.

184
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,013
Okay.

185
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:11,915
So in terms of the agenda, so we have Owen Wartella, who is the city engineer joining us at seven o'clock to talk about the stormwater improvements in South Medford.

186
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:19,736
I thought you might want to talk to him about it first before voting on the letter of support for the grant.

187
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,376
Yeah, that makes sense.

188
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,217
Okay, so we'll wait.

189
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,237
We'll wait then.

190
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:24,937
Cool.

191
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:33,753
Yeah, so just jumping into my updates.

192
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:39,475
So the translation widget on the gogreenmedford.org site is live.

193
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:42,996
Thank you guys for bringing to my attention that we needed to have that there.

194
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:50,638
Could you take a look at that and just let me know if it does a good job?

195
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,820
Because I know sometimes these translation widgets can be a little awkward.

196
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,451
I'm just dropping in the chat, the web address.

197
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:14,975
For the site, not something that we have to do now, and we're all together here, but but just sometime between now and the next meeting, it would be great if you could just take a look and let me know if it generally looks good in your languages.

198
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:21,516
Okay, where are you showing us now?

199
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,217
Are you sending it to us an email Brenda?

200
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:29,974
I just dropped it into the chat right now, but I'll also send it out with the minutes of the meeting.

201
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:36,359
Let's see.

202
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,388
Electrify Medford, so we're still working on getting the contract signed with the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, which is where we got the grant from.

203
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:53,481
And as we're working on that, we need to get some information up on the website and get some flyers out.

204
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:58,706
So none of that is ready yet for distribution, just so you know.

205
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:03,390
It's not happening, and you don't realize that it's just not ready yet.

206
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,915
For the energy coaches, so far we have 24 people signed up.

207
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:12,559
And I'm interviewing each one of them to better understand

208
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:22,727
sort of what their level of knowledge is and to better match them up with interested residents in the program once we get started.

209
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:36,699
So hopefully later this week, we'll be letting people know if they're eligible for stipends and reaching out to them to schedule our first training session.

210
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:43,132
And I'm working with a consultant on developing that heat pump training session.

211
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:54,358
And it's not just focused on heat pumps, it'll also be talking about energy efficiency and solar and things like that, but it's gonna dive deeper into the heat pump aspect of it, because it is a little bit more complicated.

212
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:07,285
And so it looks like the soft launch of the program will be in early April, when we get all the information up on the website and can start talking to people

213
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:23,694
just out in public about this, but we'll probably have a kickoff event sometime the last week of April, like April 24th or 25th, something like that.

214
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:24,775
I'm still scheduling that.

215
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:29,559
I'd love to have the mayor come to the event, so that's gonna take some scheduling.

216
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,604
Any questions about Electrify Medford?

217
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:46,910
I went on the website, Brenda, but I don't see where it shows.

218
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,312
It's a widget, Liza.

219
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:52,113
It's like... Oh, okay.

220
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:53,054
Yeah.

221
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,216
So it's, yeah, the top right of the little bar.

222
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:59,257
I checked out the Arabic one.

223
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:00,498
It works, but...

224
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,043
the translations are taken a little too literally.

225
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:14,388
Like, um, like, you know, where, where it says homepage, they literally put like the, the word for house.

226
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,070
Oh, house page.

227
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:29,957
So which is, you know, it's understandable because like, uh, there's not something like that in Arabic, like the, you, you, they could say the main page, but I don't know.

228
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,266
But it works, though.

229
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:33,867
I like it.

230
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,109
And it does the job good.

231
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,590
Yeah.

232
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:45,197
I think something like that that's doing it automatically, it's going to be tough.

233
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:52,084
If you know of a better widget that we could add to it, I would love to.

234
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:56,981
I would love to get recommendations if you've worked with something in the past.

235
00:16:57,802 --> 00:17:13,157
I mean, I haven't done, I haven't worked with widgets, but like we usually, we usually do like the translations, like whenever we want to need to translate a flyer for an event, we usually like do it ourselves.

236
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,198
Cause like, we know.

237
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:44,594
like uh culturally like how what's what to say this not not like the literal translation you know yeah that's always going to be better i don't know if it's uh feasible for the entire website but that's that's why i said like it's it's understandable you know as long as it it's uh it's like doing the the job you know brenda which one's the one that you guys use for that website oh what i mean

238
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,522
Let's see what the name of that was.

239
00:17:46,542 --> 00:18:06,218
Nope, I don't think I'm going to be able to pull it up quickly enough not to bore everybody, so.

240
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,100
Oh, I think it's Weaglot.

241
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:11,822
Weaglot, I think.

242
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:20,166
Because I know that my sister, when she did when she had her business, she had 1, and it was really good.

243
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:22,608
So I'm going to ask her what's the name of it and send it to you.

244
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:23,929
That would be great.

245
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:24,450
Thank you.

246
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:33,537
Okay, so.

247
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:41,924
Moving on to curbside composting that free program that is rolling out July 1st.

248
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:51,711
So 86 people have signed up to start that now, and they're actually paying a monthly fee between now and July 1st.

249
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:58,454
And 792 people have signed up to be, to start with the free program on July 1st.

250
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:07,078
So that's over 800 people who've now signed up for curbside composting because of this free program.

251
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,178
So that's exciting.

252
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,590
So people can sign up for the program.

253
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,414
I know I've shared this with you before, but it's at medfordcomposts.com.

254
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:27,502
And there is an online form for people who want to volunteer to get the word out about this.

255
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:35,668
So if you want to share that with people who you know who are interested,

256
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:43,250
or kind of excited about the program and might be interested in telling other people about it.

257
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,431
I just dropped that in the chat.

258
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:50,553
Again, I'll include it with the minutes when I send those out, too.

259
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:59,916
And that's something where I think they'll probably have people

260
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:05,163
You know, maybe going to events or going door to door.

261
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:12,887
I think they're really looking to go door to door for this 1, because it is a. Sort of a trash thing, right?

262
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,628
So everybody could be eligible for it.

263
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:24,253
Any questions about the composting program.

264
00:20:32,385 --> 00:20:36,606
And that the composting programs on the website, right?

265
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:37,946
Brenda?

266
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:42,027
Yep.

267
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:55,451
I should double check whether it's on, it's been updated on the Go Green Medford website.

268
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,812
It's definitely on the official city website.

269
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:10,865
So how long is the program free?

270
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:19,031
The intention is for it to be free forever moving forward.

271
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:20,112
Oh, OK.

272
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:20,712
Yeah.

273
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:23,494
Oh, OK.

274
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,996
Yeah, it's just people have to sign up for it.

275
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:31,160
It's not like trash where you can just, you know, where you just

276
00:21:31,717 --> 00:21:38,482
The city will just start picking up your trash because it's composting and you do have to know what to separate out and things like that.

277
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:44,027
You have to sign up for it and get the little bin for it and get a little flyer telling you what can go into it.

278
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:50,031
Okay, and then so so enrollment is for a limited time.

279
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,831
for a limited amount of time.

280
00:21:52,871 --> 00:22:06,559
And then once we get to that point, once we get to that date, then if you decide you're interested or you see your neighbors talking about it, then you have to do the monthly fee of 899?

281
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:07,599
No, no.

282
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,900
So enrollment is not for a limited time.

283
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,223
People will be able to sign up for this whenever they want to.

284
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:16,644
It's just July 1st is when it starts.

285
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:18,345
And so we're just trying to get as many people

286
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,700
starting with it immediately.

287
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,563
Okay, because on the site, it says enrollment is limited.

288
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:25,864
That's why I was asking.

289
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,647
It is limited, but I think it's limited to like 6,000 people.

290
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,748
Oh, yeah.

291
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:35,451
So far, we have we have 800 who signed up.

292
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:37,052
Yeah, that's that's quite a limit.

293
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:40,935
So I didn't know if the limit meant a date cut off or so it's a number cut off.

294
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:41,255
Got it.

295
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,276
Cool.

296
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:43,957
That's awesome.

297
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,310
Um, yeah, it's, it's really exciting.

298
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,052
I think it's, it's something that Cambridge has been doing for a little while now.

299
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,513
Somerville isn't doing yet.

300
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:58,114
So we're ahead of Somerville.

301
00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:58,874
That's great.

302
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:00,676
Yeah, that's, that's good.

303
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,437
That's a feather in our cap.

304
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:10,602
Um, there's a community cleanup happening April 27th, um, from 10 to one.

305
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:11,342
Um, and the.

306
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:21,557
Mayor's office has a little sign-up form where people can sign up to volunteer.

307
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:29,262
And I will actually share this sign-up form.

308
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:37,709
Well, I just shared the link in the chat, but I'm going to share my screen here so that you can take a look at the locations where people have already.

309
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:41,992
Let me see if I can.

310
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:43,233
There we go.

311
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,829
Can you see this now?

312
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,171
Yes, we can.

313
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:50,712
Okay.

314
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,435
So these are the locations where people have already signed up to do the community cleanup.

315
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:01,920
And so you can sign up just as a volunteer choosing one of these locations.

316
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:11,748
Or you can sign up as an ambassador, I think they're calling it, with a different location that you want to see a cleanup happening at.

317
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,010
And as the ambassador, you would be sort of

318
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:24,972
the connection with the city and getting materials and distributing it to the volunteers and essentially telling them what to do the day of and things like that.

319
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:31,777
So it would be great if you could help to get the word out about the cleanup that's happening.

320
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:44,145
And if there are areas where you would like to see a cleanup happening, either signing up to be an ambassador for that area or talking to people who you think would be

321
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:48,868
interested in having a cleanup at that area.

322
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:55,812
Brenda, what does the cleanup consist of?

323
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:59,735
Is it pretty much just picking up trash or is it weeding?

324
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:03,217
I think it's just cleaning up trash.

325
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:03,897
Okay.

326
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:06,359
Yeah.

327
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:12,903
I don't know if there's any gardening or anything like that happening, although I know that a lot of people would be excited if there were.

328
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:23,240
Well, yeah, you know, sometimes it's just kind of overgrown Bush and stuff kind of pathways blocking pathways or, you know.

329
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:27,343
So, what about materials and stuff like.

330
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:32,687
Trash bags, the city provide all that gloves or bags or whatever.

331
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:33,288
Yep.

332
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,029
The city will provide everything for this.

333
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,130
Okay.

334
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,459
Okay.

335
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:05,543
So Brenda, you're saying that for us per se would choose one of these places?

336
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:13,758
If you would like to volunteer or we're like, I'm a little bit confused.

337
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:15,859
Yeah, you could do either one.

338
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:23,263
So you could choose one of the locations that someone has already organized an event for, just to volunteer at it.

339
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:31,568
Or you could, if you wanted to see it in a different location, you could sign up as the sort of the organizer for that location.

340
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:37,631
And if you, yeah, so if you select as an ambassador,

341
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:44,016
on this, then it asks you what location would you like to do it?

342
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,577
Where would you like to meet everybody?

343
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:51,079
And to provide your contact information so that people can reach you.

344
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:51,179
Okay.

345
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,101
I get it.

346
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:55,681
I get it.

347
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:12,793
Any other questions about the community cleanup?

348
00:27:15,695 --> 00:27:17,436
I think this is an awesome program.

349
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,397
You said Cambridge already started this?

350
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,120
Oh, for the community cleanup?

351
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,881
I think a lot of cities and towns do this.

352
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:28,723
I think Medford has been doing this for a few years now.

353
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:31,885
That's awesome.

354
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:47,841
Charbel, I know this is the same day as the event that you're holding, but it's earlier, so there shouldn't be any conflict there.

355
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:49,122
Oh, yeah.

356
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:52,344
Tell them to come after.

357
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,585
I'm sure they'll be hungry.

358
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:55,586
That's great.

359
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:56,246
Yeah.

360
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:05,272
But it's really cool that they're doing this, like community members

361
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:09,151
actually cleaning their community.

362
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:14,494
That's awesome.

363
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:23,439
I have done one of these before near Assembly Square, the new area over there.

364
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,662
Before it was that, when it was much more neglected.

365
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:36,338
and we actually pulled so many tires out of the river that the bank was shorter.

366
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:42,821
The bank didn't go out as far into the river because it was the tires holding it in place.

367
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:43,921
How were you able to pull them out?

368
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:46,502
They were just along the shore, so we were just pulling them off the ground there.

369
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:47,442
That's crazy.

370
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,611
Um, let's see what else here.

371
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:12,778
So, um, on April 26, the day before, um, at 7 PM, um, Boston glory is holding a green fest.

372
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:20,643
And so Boston glory is a professional ultimate Frisbee team that, um, has Hormel stadium as their home stadium.

373
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:27,027
Um, and Friday, the 26th is going to be their season opener.

374
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,976
So they're holding a green fest as part of it.

375
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:40,201
So my office will be tabling, the energy committee will be helping out tabling and doing wind turbine tours before the game.

376
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:45,604
And Alicia, my boss here will actually be throwing out the first Frisbee.

377
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:49,386
She's practicing now.

378
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,362
That's so cool.

379
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:58,903
And they'll be doing things like sharing sustainable tips over the loudspeaker.

380
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:01,483
There's going to be music.

381
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:03,664
There's going to be a food and clothing drive.

382
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:08,525
There's going to be like recycling information, things like that.

383
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:12,225
So it doesn't sound like it's going to be huge, but it'll be a lot of fun.

384
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:14,986
Nice.

385
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:22,545
Brenda, if your boss is throwing out the first Frisbee, does that mean you're doing the national anthem?

386
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:25,626
You know what?

387
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:26,847
Don't tempt me.

388
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:27,988
I love karaoke.

389
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,450
Perfect.

390
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:43,246
So I dropped the link to the Boston Glory, like the information about the day.

391
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:45,407
It's a ticketed event because it's their game.

392
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:56,354
So there is that, which is why it's not the kickoff event for our Electrify Medford program, because I want that to be free and open to anybody.

393
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,376
Oh, wow.

394
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:01,677
That's awesome.

395
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:04,799
It could be football, I take it.

396
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:12,735
You have to tell your boss that it's not the power, it's like the technique.

397
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:13,815
Yeah.

398
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:15,115
How she throws it.

399
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:18,496
Are you an ultimate Frisbee player?

400
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:23,418
No, not at all.

401
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:26,439
I do remember I used to play with my friends at the school.

402
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,600
And that was really fun.

403
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,501
So I'm sure this event will be very fun.

404
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:34,321
Nice.

405
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:38,815
You know, there's going to be a hummus food truck, Charbel.

406
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:41,755
Just hummus food truck.

407
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:47,697
Maybe I should get in contact with them for the event.

408
00:31:49,077 --> 00:31:51,698
If we don't have enough vendors by then.

409
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:53,818
That'll be good.

410
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:55,599
That's cool.

411
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:05,781
And they actually, so they reached out to our office asking us to partner with them on this, and we shared with them our vendor list for the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

412
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:10,150
Which is the 1 that we have in October at the McGlynn school.

413
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:16,958
And so that's where they, they've gotten a lot of the contact information for their vendors.

414
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:21,263
So, if that's something that will help you guys out in the work that you're doing, like.

415
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:26,439
contact information for different vendors, then we can definitely share that with you too.

416
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:36,804
That would actually be very good because we're still looking for a few, especially artisan crafts, food vendors.

417
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:42,825
Like we might still need some.

418
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:47,767
So like hummus is like, you know, everybody loves hummus, knows hummus.

419
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:52,208
So if you have the information, I can contact them.

420
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:53,068
That would be awesome.

421
00:32:53,768 --> 00:32:54,748
Yeah, absolutely.

422
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:57,329
They have, I'm looking at their website.

423
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,469
They have fidefil too.

424
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,130
And tahini.

425
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,630
All the good stuff.

426
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,171
So it's not just hummus.

427
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:06,751
That's a lie.

428
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:08,898
Yeah, I know.

429
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:10,979
It is like false advertising.

430
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,260
Yeah, but sure, but at least they have options.

431
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,800
Imagine just hummus.

432
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,402
And it looks like they're based in Medford, too, on Mystic Ave.

433
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:24,642
I've never heard them.

434
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:27,943
I don't think they have a restaurant.

435
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,003
It's not a restaurant.

436
00:33:29,063 --> 00:33:33,104
It's like more of a factory, I think.

437
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:35,525
That's funny.

438
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,900
Oh, yeah, it does.

439
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,841
Oh, that's on Mystic Ave.

440
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:40,742
Yeah.

441
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:43,983
Oh, my gosh, it's crazy.

442
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:55,488
Sorry, I can I can move on unless people had any questions or comments about that.

443
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:56,328
No, no, no.

444
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,749
I just I just had one question.

445
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:04,131
Is it is this co-ed or is it all is it men or co-ed?

446
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,251
I think it's a women's Frisbee team.

447
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:14,372
Although it might be co-ed, but it's definitely not just men's.

448
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,553
Okay.

449
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:24,035
Cool.

450
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:27,456
Let's see here.

451
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:31,558
The community electricity aggregation that Medford has.

452
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:36,313
our supply contract expires at the end of the year.

453
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:42,336
And so we're looking to go out to bid for it this spring.

454
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:48,339
And we would like to increase the renewable energy content in there.

455
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:57,043
So right now, we talked about this a couple meetings ago, where there's like a default option that people get opted into.

456
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,224
And then there's like a

457
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:05,225
a level down that's like the basic amount that is required by the state.

458
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:10,088
And there's the default option is 5% more renewable energy content than that.

459
00:35:10,648 --> 00:35:14,390
And then there's another option that's 100% renewable energy content.

460
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,873
And so we're looking for our default amount to increase that to something like 10%.

461
00:35:21,514 --> 00:35:27,357
And that seems to be the level that a lot of communities around here are at right now for their aggregations.

462
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:32,079
Um, although Somerville is at 20%, so, um.

463
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:38,280
Where we're, but we're trying to when we're doing this, we're going to try to, like, balance out the cost of it.

464
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,001
With the renewables, because the idea is for it to be cheaper than the utilities rate.

465
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,161
In addition to having additional renewable content.

466
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:51,022
So, that's what we're going to be trying to balance out when we go to bid.

467
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,537
Did you have any, anybody have any questions about that?

468
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:10,442
Cool.

469
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,745
The state requirements go up every year.

470
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:20,831
So, right now, I think everyone's electricity supply is at 63% renewable.

471
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:33,364
And according to the state's definition of that, ours is a little bit stricter.

472
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:41,067
And then that goes up like 5% basically every year.

473
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:48,789
So with the idea that eventually by like 2030, it'll be like 93% renewable.

474
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,350
And so at that point, Medford having

475
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:58,495
more renewables in our aggregation.

476
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:00,876
It's not going to make that much of a difference, but for now it does.

477
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:22,260
And my last update, I held a specialized, a stretch and specialized energy code training for building inspectors at the library at the end of February.

478
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:28,048
more than 40 building inspectors came from all kinds of different towns.

479
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:29,848
So it wasn't just Medford building inspectors.

480
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,089
It was others as well.

481
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:36,912
And we had mass save contractors and to actually do the training.

482
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:41,814
And this one focused on the residential code.

483
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:46,716
And I'm now planning another one focusing on the commercial energy code.

484
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:57,195
Um, for the inspectors, and then after that, we'll hold some for more of, like, members of the public, building owners, developers, contractors, things like that.

485
00:37:57,655 --> 00:38:04,839
But I want to make sure that the inspectors have a really good understanding of this 1st, before we move on to to the members of the public.

486
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,402
And then the specialized energy code here in Medford goes into effect on July 1st.

487
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:19,756
What is that that goes into effect on July 1st?

488
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,978
So that's the specialized energy code.

489
00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:36,387
And so the energy code basically says how efficient your building has to be for new buildings and for major renovations, ones where you're essentially taking it down to the studs, right?

490
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:45,672
If you're doing more than 50% of your building, that's considered a major renovation.

491
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:59,087
Um, and so these are just more stringent efficiency requirements as well as requiring, um, in some cases, solar and electrical wiring for.

492
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,888
Electric vehicles to be able to plug in.

493
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:14,750
And so there's the, there's like the base energy code and then there's the stretch energy code, which Medford has been part of for for quite a while now, like, over more than a decade.

494
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,604
um, which was recently updated.

495
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:23,627
Um, and then there's the specialized energy code, which goes even, um, better than that.

496
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:24,908
That's even better than that.

497
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:34,994
And so the biggest thing is like for the specializes for like multifamily buildings, you have to have, um, very tight envelopes.

498
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:37,935
Essentially, you have to do lots of like air sealing and insulation.

499
00:39:39,156 --> 00:39:45,680
Um, so you don't lose, you know, the, the heated air or the cooled air out of the building as fast.

500
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,498
Yeah, those are the basics of it.

501
00:39:51,799 --> 00:40:14,085
For stretch code, for large multifamily buildings, there's something called passive house that they have to comply with, which means that, for instance, in the event of a power outage, your building would stay warm for a longer period of time because it's so sort of airtight and so insulated.

502
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:28,161
Not to throw any shade or anything like that, but does City Hall fall under this specialized energy code?

503
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:30,882
I mean, does City Hall comply to this?

504
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:39,666
It would if we were building a new City Hall or if we were doing a major renovation of it.

505
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,909
City Hall would sort of be grandfathered, so I kind of get it.

506
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,030
It's for the newer stuff.

507
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:48,708
Yep.

508
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:55,453
But for like, if we, so we're talking about doing a new high school at some point.

509
00:40:57,394 --> 00:40:59,775
And so the new high school would definitely have to comply with it.

510
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:01,296
Yay.

511
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:02,978
New high school.

512
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:04,699
No more jail.

513
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:05,899
It's about time.

514
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah.

515
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:09,582
That's going to be a long process though.

516
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,643
I'm sure you're going to hear about that a lot before.

517
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:11,743
Yeah.

518
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:12,584
Yeah.

519
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,044
No doubt.

520
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:13,725
At least like.

521
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:13,945
Yeah.

522
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:21,388
Do they temporarily transfer the students to another school or place to the school?

523
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,088
Did they like.

524
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,590
Shut down half of it constructed and.

525
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,431
I'm just curious.

526
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,372
Yeah, that depends on on where they're going to do it.

527
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:33,575
So is it going to be in a different location or is it going to be the same location?

528
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:35,336
I don't know.

529
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,977
I haven't been part of those conversations at all.

530
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:47,353
I feel like if they would want to make a new one, it should probably be like more towards like the center of the city.

531
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:53,777
Because like the the high school right now is pretty much like on the border.

532
00:41:53,797 --> 00:41:58,820
Yeah, Medford and like, and Winchester, Winchester.

533
00:41:59,021 --> 00:41:59,221
So yeah.

534
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:10,087
Because think about it, where the condos are, the old Medford High is there and where the Y is.

535
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:13,249
Yeah, Boys and Girls Club.

536
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:17,031
High school and then they built the one up on the hill there.

537
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:29,780
That was a situation where school was in session in one place and then as far as I know, the high school was built, it was new when I'm aging myself.

538
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,702
Let me just stop that conversation.

539
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:40,505
No, the building was kind of pretty new when I was there.

540
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,966
But anyway, yeah.

541
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:45,647
It's time for a new high school.

542
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:45,947
For sure.

543
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:47,187
For sure.

544
00:42:56,191 --> 00:43:00,614
So I think the other, so those are my city updates.

545
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:06,158
I think next up on the agenda was the Energy and Environment Committee update.

546
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:15,185
So basically, at that meeting, I gave them similar updates to what I just gave you guys.

547
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:18,948
And then we talked about some bills moving through the statehouse.

548
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:21,910
So this is the end of a two-year cycle.

549
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,752
So some bills that people have been looking at

550
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:30,262
a couple of years are either being voted on by August or they're waiting another 2 years.

551
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:47,466
So senator Barrett the who's the head of the telecommunications utilities and energy committee is coming to the main meeting of the energy environment committee to talk about the bills that his his committee is working on.

552
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:53,347
So that's something that you guys are all welcome to attend as is any member of the public that wants to

553
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:58,449
to hear what Senator Barrett has to say and to give him any feedback.

554
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:12,032
The May Energy Environment Committee meeting is the first Monday, May 6th.

555
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:20,054
Those start at 6.30 PM.

556
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:26,423
And where are they?

557
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,386
So those are mostly on zoom.

558
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:32,447
Yep, yep.

559
00:44:32,847 --> 00:44:43,813
They sometimes I think twice a year, or more often if they if they want to, but usually twice a year, they'll get together in person and do sort of a hybrid meeting.

560
00:44:45,874 --> 00:44:47,055
But most of them are on zoom.

561
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:56,179
So, would you send out the zoom information for anyone that, you know, if if any 1 of us were interested or something?

562
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,000
I mean, is that.

563
00:44:57,741 --> 00:44:59,262
I mean, I'm not sure how else we would know.

564
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,583
Yep, definitely.

565
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:02,184
Yep.

566
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,346
And those will also.

567
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:11,071
Just so, you just so, you know, I will definitely send it out for this and for any.

568
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:18,316
Other sort of cross pollination going on between these 2 committees, but for any other things that you're interested in.

569
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:26,031
The Medford events calendar, I just dropped the link in the chat has all of the.

570
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:34,059
Municipal committee meetings, and each 1 should have an agenda.

571
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:43,769
At least 2 days beforehand with the, with the link to the zoom meeting, if it's going to be virtual.

572
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:54,631
Let's see.

573
00:45:54,972 --> 00:46:03,339
Also, some members at the meeting, they gave an update on the tree ordinance that's going through Medford City Council right now.

574
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,802
So there are actually three tree ordinances.

575
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:11,265
There's one that focuses on public trees, like on city property.

576
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:18,852
One that focuses on private trees, on like privately owned property.

577
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:27,619
And one that establishes a tree committee to help the city to oversee this whole process.

578
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:39,508
And the goal behind it is to try to prevent trees just being cut without other alternatives being looked at.

579
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:46,914
And the tree, other tree related things that they talked about.

580
00:46:48,907 --> 00:47:03,339
April 26 is Arbor Day, and there's an annual proclamation, I think it's City Hall, declaring Medford an Arbor Day tree city, and the events around that.

581
00:47:06,162 --> 00:47:16,050
And I think the city warden has tree companies come in that day or that week, and they volunteer time to trim trees for residences.

582
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:25,382
I don't have any other information about that right now, but before that happens, I can find out and send it along to you if that's something you want to share with people.

583
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:31,043
Yeah, that sounds good.

584
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:37,885
Then on April 27th, Trees Medford will be at the library giving out free tree seedlings.

585
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:41,186
People want to get some and plant them in their own yard.

586
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:46,027
Same day as the cleanup.

587
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:53,271
There's a lot going on that week because that Monday is Earth Day and so everything just kind of gets.

588
00:47:55,172 --> 00:48:00,436
Crammed into that week.

589
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:05,619
And the energy environment committee, they also discuss what priorities they want to focus on this year.

590
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:10,503
And they, they didn't vote on it.

591
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:13,325
They were just in the process of discussing it.

592
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:13,545
So.

593
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:24,271
There was a spreadsheet that they were using to kind of communally discuss this and keep track of it.

594
00:48:24,372 --> 00:48:28,756
I dropped that link in the chat and I'll also put it in the minutes.

595
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:33,982
But if you want to look at that to see sort of what their priorities that they're thinking of for this year.

596
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:45,841
So I don't know if the Climate Equity Committee wants to do any sort of similar priority discussion.

597
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:49,724
That could be something for you to take a look at.

598
00:48:53,907 --> 00:49:04,534
And then I think the last thing that they talked about, there's a Girl Scout doing a project about invasive species for her final project, which is kind of similar to an Eagle Scout final project.

599
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,990
And she reached out to the committee for information about invasive species and they were helping her out.

600
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:12,591
Nice.

601
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:21,294
That was a lot.

602
00:49:21,454 --> 00:49:25,255
Any questions or comments about any of that?

603
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:33,978
No, just a lot going on next month.

604
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,111
Yeah, busy months.

605
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:39,432
Yep, it's gonna be crazy.

606
00:49:44,356 --> 00:50:04,029
And for folks that are focusing on, you know, the bills that are going through the state legislature, it's going to be a crazy couple few months too, because two years of work is now they're scrambling to try to finalize it all.

607
00:50:11,738 --> 00:50:16,759
So, we should have Owen the city engineer joining us.

608
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:24,200
In a few minutes to talk about the South Medford storm water updates.

609
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,681
While we're waiting.

610
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:32,982
Do we want to talk about the.

611
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:39,963
3, the make polluters pay bill that 350 mystic valley.

612
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:47,948
Sent the email about what's that about?

613
00:50:47,968 --> 00:50:50,050
I didn't read it.

614
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,091
Yeah.

615
00:50:51,852 --> 00:51:07,565
So, um, it's basically the idea is they're, they're kind of modeling it on like the super fund sort of thing where the, the companies that, um, did the polluting.

616
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:16,161
have to pay into a fund that is used to do cleanup, except in this case, the polluting is carbon emissions.

617
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:29,268
And the fund is not just, you know, to be used at specific sites or anything, but it could be used for reducing carbon emissions.

618
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:36,192
And I think they were really focusing on in environmental justice areas.

619
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:48,068
But so 350 Mystic Valley, they're looking to have the Medford City Council pass a resolution supporting this on April 2nd.

620
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:55,492
And so they're just reaching out to folks to see if that's something that you'd be interested in supporting.

621
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,054
They have an info session.

622
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:04,377
So if you want more details about this, that info session is on March 27th.

623
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:22,217
And I think they're really looking for people to, to like show up at the city council meeting on April 2nd or, um, or speak at the city council meeting.

624
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:40,624
So they, they essentially just kind of wants, um, a fund to be paid in to, for offenders of, um, pollution, polluting the environment or, okay.

625
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,520
Yeah, yeah, and then this is really focusing on on carbon emissions.

626
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:47,241
Yep.

627
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:54,864
Okay, and carbon emissions being what exactly.

628
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:03,927
So, it's the exhaust and stuff that's what I'm thinking, I guess, because of the word emission.

629
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:05,047
So that's why I'm asking.

630
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:07,648
So forgive it's a question.

631
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,640
No, it's not done, I'm just wondering how to explain it.

632
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,284
Yeah, so it's basically like if you burn anything, then you're putting carbon emissions into the air.

633
00:53:16,324 --> 00:53:25,431
So like, you know, gas heating systems and stuff, but I think they're looking at the big polluters who do a lot of this.

634
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:29,154
Okay.

635
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:36,480
I don't know who, I mean, so would the offenders, I'm just trying to get a better understanding.

636
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,081
So would the offenders be like,

637
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:50,101
you know, like stores and stuff or, you know, or is it just, you know, I don't know.

638
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:53,643
I don't know a lot about this myself.

639
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:55,704
I haven't really been following it so much.

640
00:53:57,225 --> 00:54:03,029
But I think it's more large corporations that are, yeah.

641
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:03,950
Okay.

642
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:04,590
Yeah.

643
00:54:07,192 --> 00:54:10,775
Yeah, so an info session could be helpful because I just, you know.

644
00:54:12,276 --> 00:54:16,360
I mean, sure, it sounds great, you know, make the polluters pay.

645
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:21,964
You know, but, you know, you kind of got to know what you're asking for and.

646
00:54:23,505 --> 00:54:25,447
So, yeah, definitely.

647
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:33,854
So I think if folks are interested in following up on that, you can just reply to the email that.

648
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:35,695
Chrissy.

649
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:43,752
Sent for asking for more information because I think that's something that you're going to be doing not.

650
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:47,036
As a climate equity council, but more as an individual.

651
00:54:47,056 --> 00:54:51,041
Yeah, got it.

652
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:53,765
Oh, I think we have own joining.

653
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:23,744
Owen, can you hear us?

654
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:25,625
I can, sorry.

655
00:55:25,645 --> 00:55:26,365
Ah, there you are.

656
00:55:29,186 --> 00:55:30,567
No worries, thank you for joining.

657
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:37,531
No, I just got caught up with little ones.

658
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,031
It's about that time, it's bedtime.

659
00:55:39,051 --> 00:55:41,993
Well, it's dinnertime.

660
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:43,253
Is it really?

661
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:43,934
Yeah.

662
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:47,856
All right, you guys, you can tell I don't have kids, right?

663
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:49,817
I would be like, go to bed.

664
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:51,964
All right.

665
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:54,506
So, um, I guess what?

666
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:56,628
How?

667
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:57,169
I don't even know.

668
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,209
Yeah, go ahead.

669
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,550
No, no.

670
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:04,735
So we talked last time about the grant that we're applying for to make drainage improvements in South Medford.

671
00:56:05,816 --> 00:56:07,557
Owen here is the city engineer.

672
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:12,161
And he can talk about that in a little more detail for you.

673
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:17,605
And then we can vote on whether the council wants to offer a letter of support for the grant.

674
00:56:17,946 --> 00:56:18,286
Great.

675
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:19,247
So, um,

676
00:56:20,105 --> 00:56:23,008
Oh man, I wish I had sharing capabilities, but I guess I don't.

677
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:23,949
Or maybe I do.

678
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,233
Either way, recently the city has conducted a

679
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,391
a localized flood mitigation assessment for South Medford.

680
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:42,433
It was one of five areas within Medford that we did a flood assessment study on.

681
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:50,755
And we have gotten funding for a grant to do the design for one of these locations.

682
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:52,836
It's around Bowen and Golden Ave.

683
00:56:53,696 --> 00:57:04,219
and it's in conjunction with a larger area of a whole bunch of infrastructure that we're trying to target this construction season.

684
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:14,942
We have the design funding in place and we are looking to go for the MVP grant to get funding for construction.

685
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:27,752
And so we're reaching out to the community to ask for maybe letters of support, which will hopefully boost our chances of getting an MVP grant.

686
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:30,333
Which is where you guys come in.

687
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:44,280
And Owen, I've made you co-host so you can share your screen, but I can also, I think I have an image from the localized flood mitigation assessment report that might be helpful to show the area.

688
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:44,900
Yeah, thank you.

689
00:57:47,523 --> 00:57:54,070
Um, so yeah, I don't know how closely you guys, you folks can see that this is Harvard Street right here.

690
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,874
So this would be like Oasis restaurant, right?

691
00:57:58,014 --> 00:58:00,476
On the, on this bottom left edge here.

692
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:05,982
Um, and it goes up to, so the, sorry, Owen, I'll let you talk here.

693
00:58:06,643 --> 00:58:10,188
So, um, the, I can't point.

694
00:58:10,508 --> 00:58:13,712
So the Bowen and Golden are at the top of the page in the center.

695
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:14,073
Yep.

696
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:20,200
So from there up, um, and the, this would be a drainage project essentially.

697
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:24,766
So basically the design or the report.

698
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:28,949
gave suggestions of how to mitigate these solutions.

699
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:38,095
And we are going to basically tie in the drainage, which is being surcharged.

700
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:43,439
It's not large enough to be for the whole area that it's capturing.

701
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:46,141
And we're creating a separate

702
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:57,683
design point or pipe network to the pipe network that's already in Mystic Avenue, and then we're going to increase the pipe size of that.

703
00:58:58,283 --> 00:59:14,173
So, during large storm events that are like high-intensity storm events, the added capacity will decrease the localized flooding for these homeowners.

704
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:26,557
And it's not, is it just for these two streets, Bowen and Golden, or does it, will it affect the- It will affect the whole red area, right.

705
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:30,198
But the design work is within those two streets.

706
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:35,100
So we're going to target the, that's what the analysis basically did.

707
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:42,844
They said, if you can alleviate a pipe network on these two streets, it's going to remedy the larger area.

708
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:54,779
And this area is, like I said, yeah, so it's Harvard Street down here at the bottom, where Oasis is, all the way up to, what is this, Bob's Italian Foods right here in this corner.

709
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,700
Yeah, Tindock Street, yeah.

710
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,803
Yep, and all the way around here, yeah.

711
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:07,106
So this is going to be part of, we're doing a few infrastructure projects in this area this season.

712
01:00:07,546 --> 01:00:10,449
Willis Ave is going to be getting a new water main.

713
01:00:11,189 --> 01:00:15,013
So we have funding for the design and construction of that.

714
01:00:16,274 --> 01:00:23,640
We have some sewer mitigation going on Bowen, Golden, and some of the other side streets.

715
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:32,584
which will also be, we're trying to time it up to limit the disturbance within one construction season.

716
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:38,767
So the only thing that we really don't have funding for, which is always the hard thing, is drainage.

717
01:00:39,868 --> 01:00:44,791
For some odd reason, drainage is the hard one to get funding for.

718
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:46,431
MWRA doesn't do it.

719
01:00:46,451 --> 01:00:46,992
So the MVP is one.

720
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:52,515
option that we could do it.

721
01:00:54,518 --> 01:01:04,771
And there's a few other if we can go that, but I think this is a really good, a good, you know, effort to try to get the funding for this one.

722
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:12,849
And the timing for that would be the application would go in mid-April.

723
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:15,090
Yeah, April 30th, I think, is the deadline.

724
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:19,571
So we're going to be working on it over the next month.

725
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:31,215
And then we're going to ask for a letter of support from the state so that all these little kind of hiccups that might

726
01:01:33,187 --> 01:01:36,369
Delay or put doubt in the project.

727
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:39,131
We're going to try to get all our ducks in a row.

728
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:45,115
So we're feeling pretty good about About it, but you know, it's up to them make sense.

729
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:50,378
And then if If we receive the grant that construction would start in the fall.

730
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:52,518
Yeah, probably.

731
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:58,321
I mean, the design is going to be done probably by July, so we could just put it out to procurement and then go.

732
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:03,263
The timing of that will probably be the construction season.

733
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:10,426
A lot of contractors will probably be targeting a start of the fall, but then probably wrapping up next spring.

734
01:02:10,446 --> 01:02:13,187
That's great.

735
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:15,168
Granted, that's fast track.

736
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:20,930
Everything in government is, you know, slow down, but I'm trying to get it through as fast as I can.

737
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:26,760
The delay won't be on the city side, let's put it that way.

738
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,421
We're getting pretty efficient on our end.

739
01:02:32,323 --> 01:02:33,444
Does anybody have any questions?

740
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:52,455
So I think as part of this project, we were also hoping to educate property owners about how they can help to reduce stormwater runoff, right?

741
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,044
changes to their properties?

742
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:57,546
Yeah, there's a few things you could do.

743
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:02,229
One is basically deep paving.

744
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,911
That's the big one.

745
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:16,140
If water can not run off, you know, concrete or asphalt into the drainage system and seep into the ground, that's the biggest that homeowners can do.

746
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,681
Another thing that they could do is

747
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:30,352
You know, mitigate stormwater, create maybe recharge like the roof drains into the ground, create dry wells.

748
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:34,918
Is like the rain barrel program a good.

749
01:03:36,098 --> 01:03:38,020
Yeah, I mean, it's it's fine.

750
01:03:38,160 --> 01:04:00,979
It's great for reuse you know some larger projects that are coming through the city for site plan review or Targeting rainwater reuse for you know flushing and stuff like that You can do it on a smaller scale on homeowners, but it's probably not cost-effective for most homeowners, so

751
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:08,422
But rainwater for irrigation, for gardens, those are great, great things.

752
01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:21,605
So yeah, so I think this group as the Medford Connectors, we would love for this group to help out with that resident education part of it as well.

753
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:39,871
Yeah, and I think we've provided some programming with the climate action plan as well that your office has done that we could probably provide them if they would like some documentation and some newsletter leaflets that we could distribute.

754
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:48,215
Do folks have any questions about this?

755
01:04:52,279 --> 01:05:00,245
No, I think I was just kind of curious about the property owners and, you know, what the things are that they could do.

756
01:05:00,345 --> 01:05:03,328
And I know, Owen, you had just listed some of them, depaving.

757
01:05:03,888 --> 01:05:05,569
Was it create dry wells?

758
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:13,936
Yeah, basically, it's just that, sorry, it's basically taking the rainwater and

759
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:27,934
putting it directly into the ground into a stone area that will allow the volume to, you know, the area for the volume of green water to recharge.

760
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:28,194
Yeah.

761
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:32,459
And what was there was something roof something.

762
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,039
A roof leader.

763
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:37,862
It's just your gutter.

764
01:05:38,122 --> 01:05:40,204
I call them roof leaders.

765
01:05:40,264 --> 01:05:43,247
That's it's the stance.

766
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:44,468
I'm an engine nerd.

767
01:05:44,748 --> 01:05:45,889
You know, understood.

768
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:46,790
Understood.

769
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:48,252
Here, let me.

770
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:48,712
OK.

771
01:05:52,840 --> 01:06:04,246
All right, so I'm assuming that the leaflets or whatever information you have sort of speaks to some of those things that, you know, property owners could do to.

772
01:06:04,606 --> 01:06:07,568
Let me share something with you all since I have it.

773
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:15,512
Where is it?

774
01:06:15,632 --> 01:06:16,292
Where's the chat?

775
01:06:20,973 --> 01:06:28,117
So this link in the chat window, I'm going to share my screen and I'll show you what it can do.

776
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:34,841
So Kleinfelder, who is the person that we have doing the design for this,

777
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:57,647
has created this upper Mystic River watershed tool that basically shows, it's basically analyzed all the flooding area of the properties and the EJ communities in all of northern, you know, Mystic area.

778
01:06:58,007 --> 01:07:00,309
And Medford is all upper Mystic.

779
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:04,072
So the area we're talking about is this area right here.

780
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:06,072
if you can see my cursor.

781
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:14,915
And these are all for the present day flooding, and then the 2070 year events.

782
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:22,137
So as climate change gets more impacted, it's going to get worse.

783
01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:32,880
And this website they've set up is a really good tool about showing which properties are going to be inundated and how much they're going to be inundated.

784
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:43,655
and how many of the community is going to be vulnerable to these larger storm events in the future.

785
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:47,557
So is that like the yellow?

786
01:07:48,683 --> 01:07:54,487
Is that like, that's showing like the water, I guess, going above the land?

787
01:07:55,348 --> 01:08:02,773
Yeah, that's the, I think there's a table, there's a, so that's the 2% annual chance of flood hazard.

788
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,735
So, or 0.2%.

789
01:08:05,755 --> 01:08:09,498
And that is basically, it's like a hundred year storm event.

790
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:14,642
So we're seeing like 1% or, you know, storm events.

791
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:18,178
a lot more than 1% of the time.

792
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:29,321
So this is just the modeling that they're using to show what areas are impacted now versus what will be impacted 50 years from now.

793
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:31,702
Oh, I see.

794
01:08:33,282 --> 01:08:41,564
So potentially, if nothing is done, the chances of flooding goes up every year?

795
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:41,685
Yeah.

796
01:08:45,312 --> 01:08:48,714
The chance, no, the flooding happens because of climate change.

797
01:08:48,814 --> 01:08:58,439
So we're, we are anticipating more rain events, more intense rain events, 50 years in the future versus now.

798
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:06,103
So this is the modeling that is basically putting a color code to that impact.

799
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:07,144
Okay.

800
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:07,824
All right.

801
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:25,791
And the one thing that we do have on our side, so not to be all doom and gloom here, is that, you know, the Amelia Earhart Dam is there, and that is like our main protector of Medford and most of South Medford.

802
01:09:27,592 --> 01:09:34,818
So these models, I believe, show the impact if the dam was open.

803
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:56,382
So, Owen, is this model focusing more on on like rainwater or is it focusing or is it also including flooding if the dam was was not functioning properly?

804
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:58,943
I think this is I misspoke.

805
01:09:59,523 --> 01:10:04,324
I believe that this modeling is showing the rain events with the dam working properly.

806
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:08,425
OK, so it is the dam is too low.

807
01:10:08,765 --> 01:10:09,805
It would top over that.

808
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,926
And these are the areas that would be impacted.

809
01:10:12,366 --> 01:10:14,488
during these very, very large storm events.

810
01:10:15,108 --> 01:10:17,630
Granted, these are very large storm events.

811
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:18,491
Okay, okay.

812
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:20,272
So this is with the dam being overtopped?

813
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:20,672
Yes.

814
01:10:20,993 --> 01:10:21,633
Okay, yep.

815
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:26,677
So what we're trying to do is we're trying to get ahead of that curve.

816
01:10:26,997 --> 01:10:32,542
So we want to provide mitigation now, planning for the future.

817
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,868
Do folks have any other questions for Owen?

818
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:56,695
We do have a letter of support here that Liz and Charbel has worked with me on developing.

819
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:02,319
So actually, let me share my screen for that.

820
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:10,386
Can you see the letter of support?

821
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:15,190
So I think

822
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:19,608
For some of you here, this might be the first time that you're seeing it.

823
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:25,832
So I might just, I'll just read it out loud so that everyone can hear it.

824
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:29,655
So this is to the MVP grant program.

825
01:11:30,596 --> 01:11:38,562
It just says climate change is an equity issue, since those with the fewest resources to manage its impacts are often hardest hit by its effects.

826
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:46,740
This is one of the reasons that Medford's Climate Equity Council was formed to ensure that environmental justice groups in Medford have a voice in the city's decision making.

827
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,342
One example of this is the stormwater flooding that we see in South Medford.

828
01:11:51,982 --> 01:12:03,708
The census block groups in this neighborhood are considered environmental justice census block groups by the state of Massachusetts because the minority population is 30 to 50% and the median household income is well below the state median.

829
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:12,654
Our climate change vulnerability assessment and localized flood mitigation assessment both identified significant storm water flooding in multiple areas around the city.

830
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:18,618
And Medford has prioritized improvements in this area because of the environmental justice populations they will benefit.

831
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:27,825
As the Climate Equity Council, we encourage the MVP grant program to help fund this project to upgrade the drainage on Bowen and Golden Avenues in South Medford.

832
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:34,863
First off, Owen, is all of that accurate?

833
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,584
Is there anything that you would change?

834
01:12:37,624 --> 01:12:38,444
No, that's wonderful.

835
01:12:38,464 --> 01:12:40,425
It's well better, better than I could write it.

836
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:41,725
So thank you.

837
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:45,167
We told you, Brenda.

838
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:51,729
Well done, chair and co, or well done, co-chairs.

839
01:12:52,729 --> 01:12:53,250
Well done.

840
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:59,452
So do folks have any edits to this?

841
01:13:06,372 --> 01:13:09,994
No, well, well, it sounds great.

842
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:16,898
We have to do more on that.

843
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:23,902
Yep, just a motion to, you know, to to actually support the letter not to.

844
01:13:23,922 --> 01:13:25,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:28,684
Okay, guys, so motion to approve the letter.

846
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,366
I 2nd, the motion.

847
01:13:37,318 --> 01:13:54,253
Well, thank you so much.

848
01:13:54,313 --> 01:13:55,054
I appreciate it.

849
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:59,078
This is going to, you know, it's one little piece that's going to go a long way.

850
01:13:59,298 --> 01:14:00,599
So thank you so much.

851
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,581
I've also, um,

852
01:14:07,802 --> 01:14:22,912
I also added the localized flood assessment report to which is available on the engineering website to the chat window.

853
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:27,275
So if you guys want to see what other areas that we're working on that we're trying to target.

854
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,938
That is also, you know, you can see it there.

855
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:31,518
Okay.

856
01:14:33,438 --> 01:14:33,958
Thank you.

857
01:14:34,338 --> 01:14:34,799
Thank you.

858
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:35,499
Appreciate it.

859
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:36,639
Have a good evening.

860
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:37,479
Why are you?

861
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:38,039
Thank you.

862
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,201
He's nice.

863
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:45,401
Yeah, he's great.

864
01:14:46,002 --> 01:14:47,842
And let me tell you something well informed.

865
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,543
Like, that was so interesting.

866
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:55,346
I do feel like he's speaking a completely different language sometimes though.

867
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,627
I'm like, wait, wait, explain to me what you're saying here.

868
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:07,010
I didn't really understand that 0.2% flood hazard thing, but after he explained it, it was a little bit more clear.

869
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:07,710
Yeah.

870
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:14,292
I think the point is that they, they, they used to call them a hundred year storms and that was what people would design too.

871
01:15:14,493 --> 01:15:18,554
Cause they're like, okay, each year there's a 1% chance that this storm is going to happen.

872
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:25,891
But because they're happening more often, it's not a one, it's, yeah, they're not really 100% 100-year storms anymore.

873
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:31,872
So we're just, they're like ramping up the, uh, what they're designing it to.

874
01:15:32,352 --> 01:15:33,552
They're designing it to.

875
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:44,914
Is it similar to like, like, you know, how they speak and how it happened like millions of years ago, it's like that volcanic eruption that covered the earth.

876
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,335
So it's kind of similar to that, but it's just like a rainstorm.

877
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:54,525
I don't know.

878
01:15:54,545 --> 01:16:04,067
I think a volcanic eruption like that would cool everything, because it would be such a cloud cover at that point that it would cool everything down.

879
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:07,388
This is the opposite.

880
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:08,168
Yeah.

881
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:15,210
No, I guess my point is just saying there's a low percent that something like that happens.

882
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:22,314
But the, but the moment that it happens, it could mean like, like doom, you know what I'm saying?

883
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:24,154
So, okay.

884
01:16:24,374 --> 01:16:25,275
I get it more now.

885
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:26,115
Yeah.

886
01:16:26,155 --> 01:16:34,816
So like, um, hurricane Sandy, um, that hit New York, um, years ago, that was a hundred year storm.

887
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:36,837
Oh, wow.

888
01:16:37,857 --> 01:16:38,037
Yeah.

889
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:43,058
Cause it like completely destroyed the boardwalk in New Jersey.

890
01:16:43,118 --> 01:16:43,358
Right.

891
01:16:44,078 --> 01:16:44,298
Yeah.

892
01:16:44,677 --> 01:16:47,758
It destroyed, yeah, a lot of things were really damaged there.

893
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:49,838
Boston lucked out.

894
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,600
If it had hit at high tide, Boston would have flooded really badly too.

895
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,800
Yeah.

896
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,881
And we were just a few hours off from that.

897
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:02,822
That's crazy.

898
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:02,902
Yep.

899
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:08,664
So I think that might be everything that we had on our agenda.

900
01:17:08,684 --> 01:17:12,425
Yeah.

901
01:17:12,465 --> 01:17:12,965
Was there any...

902
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,185
Like new business, anything people wanted to bring up?

903
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:29,550
I guess what is the next step now with the letter?

904
01:17:32,551 --> 01:17:39,434
So I think we would just need your signatures on that, Charbel and Liz, as the co-chairs.

905
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:44,432
And then I would give it to Owen to submit along with the grant application.

906
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:48,513
A physical signature?

907
01:17:50,634 --> 01:17:53,115
Either way, if you want to send a digital signature.

908
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,115
Okay.

909
01:17:54,135 --> 01:17:55,436
You can pop it on there.

910
01:17:56,216 --> 01:17:57,837
Electronic one?

911
01:17:58,617 --> 01:17:58,757
Yeah.

912
01:17:59,177 --> 01:18:00,958
But you're, I mean, you're in City Hall sometimes.

913
01:18:01,018 --> 01:18:05,840
So if you, whenever you're here, if you want to drop by and sign it, you can.

914
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:06,620
Yeah.

915
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,761
Oh, I might have one more update that you might be interested in.

916
01:18:16,841 --> 01:18:36,770
I was in a meeting today or a webinar today with the Department of Energy Resources, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and they're applying for federal funding this spring for retrofits, rebates for the most part affordable housing.

917
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:43,353
And it's going to be $50 million for retrofits in

918
01:18:44,142 --> 01:18:48,225
larger affordable multifamily buildings.

919
01:18:49,565 --> 01:18:59,871
And with income levels up to 80% of the area median income, and then $72.8 million for electrification assistance.

920
01:19:00,752 --> 01:19:10,918
Things like electric panel upgrades and wiring upgrades for people who are going through the mass save program, and getting like heat pumps as part of that.

921
01:19:12,565 --> 01:19:16,428
And the funding for that is a little bit higher, is higher income.

922
01:19:16,528 --> 01:19:19,130
It's up to 150% AMI.

923
01:19:23,313 --> 01:19:35,103
But that's, I'm excited seeing this come down the pike and they're going to be applying for it now and should be hearing back about it this fall, I think.

924
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,631
Who's applying for this?

925
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:41,752
It's the State Department of Energy Resources.

926
01:19:44,253 --> 01:19:54,396
So this was part of the IRA, that giant package of funding that was passed during COVID.

927
01:19:56,016 --> 01:20:01,878
And so the money is set aside for Massachusetts, but the state has to say how they're going to spend it.

928
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:04,627
So this was their proposal for how they're going to spend it.

929
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:07,028
And they're taking feedback on that right now.

930
01:20:07,108 --> 01:20:14,133
If you want to submit any comments on it, I can send along the link for that.

931
01:20:15,094 --> 01:20:26,302
So how would this, if the state were to get these, this $50 million, how would the state divvy it up?

932
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:31,706
Would it be up to the towns and cities to, okay.

933
01:20:32,513 --> 01:20:33,193
No, it wouldn't be.

934
01:20:33,794 --> 01:20:49,483
So the first part that's for larger affordable multifamily buildings, they have a program already that Department of Energy Resources has people, has building owners apply to to get grants.

935
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,346
So they would just be adding funding to that program.

936
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:58,849
And then for the other one, they would just be adding funding to the Mass Save program.

937
01:20:59,549 --> 01:20:59,750
Got it.

938
01:21:14,553 --> 01:21:15,734
Okay, now I think that's it.

939
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,735
Sorry, I was kidding before.

940
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:17,835
Okay.

941
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:34,028
So we're done with the agenda, Brenda?

942
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:37,892
Yeah, unless anybody has anything else.

943
01:21:41,956 --> 01:21:45,940
So motion to adjourn the meeting.

944
01:21:46,881 --> 01:21:48,102
I second this motion.

945
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,106
Samia, Natasha, Stacey.

946
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:52,486
Hi.

947
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:54,968
Hi.

948
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:57,791
Hi.

949
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:00,934
Natasha, I didn't hear you.

950
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,421
Hello and good night, Samia.

951
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:08,541
Hi.

952
01:22:09,121 --> 01:22:12,603
It's just so loud to be here.

953
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:17,065
Yeah, I saw your message, so, you know.

954
01:22:17,105 --> 01:22:23,868
Yeah, it's very loud to be here at midnight, but, you know, so I'm trying to hear you guys, and we are saying what we're supposed to be saying.

955
01:22:23,908 --> 01:22:24,668
Nice to see you all.

956
01:22:25,328 --> 01:22:26,309
You too, Samia.

957
01:22:26,329 --> 01:22:26,909
You as well.

958
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,510
All right.

959
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:32,772
So we will see each other in person next month.

960
01:22:34,652 --> 01:22:34,893
Yes.

961
01:22:35,413 --> 01:22:35,653
Right.

962
01:22:36,627 --> 01:22:37,631
Until then, good night.

963
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:38,113
Bye guys.
