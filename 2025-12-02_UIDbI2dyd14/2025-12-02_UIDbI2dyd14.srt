43
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:57,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to ask, we have four, I believe, Roberts writers here, and they're gonna talk to us about the school newspaper.

01:01:58,704 --> 01:02:07,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We have teacher and I think advisor, Jen Devlin, and we have principal Cabral, excuse me, principal Crowell, sorry about that.

45
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,471
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long day, but I'm gonna ask for,

46
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:13,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Principal Kroll and Ms.

47
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:18,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Devlin to come and just tee us up so that we can listen to the students.

48
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:29,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

49
01:02:29,915 --> 01:02:36,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us here tonight to showcase the work of our young scholars and educators at the Roberts School.

50
01:02:37,722 --> 01:02:47,209
[SPEAKER_01]: This past June, Owen Jetty Walsh submitted a proposal to start a student-run newspaper called the Roberts Rampage.

51
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:53,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Owen shared with me all of the reasons why we needed a student newspaper.

52
01:02:54,022 --> 01:03:08,292
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, quote, it will teach us to write better, edit and publish our work, develop leadership skills, share school news, strengthen community ties and build school spirit.

53
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,554
[SPEAKER_01]: He even spoke with Ms.

54
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:13,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Devlin to help with supervision and guidance.

55
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,377
[SPEAKER_01]: He had it all covered.

56
01:03:15,602 --> 01:03:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Reporters from the Roberts Rampage are here tonight to highlight their work and share with you their first edition.

57
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:32,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So speaking tonight, I have our publisher and editor, Owen Jetty Walsh, Mary Massa, Karen Naconear, Naima Ashour.

58
01:03:33,565 --> 01:03:38,826
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have Ruby Gearheart and Hayden Richards, which are our newspaper staff, but they will not be speaking tonight.

59
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:42,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to introduce you to Jen Devlin, who is their advisor.

60
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:45,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

61
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:45,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome Ms.

62
01:03:45,763 --> 01:03:46,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Devlin.

63
01:03:46,264 --> 01:03:46,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.

64
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:49,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for having us tonight.

65
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:55,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Owen, I've had the pleasure of having Owen in my class in second grade and in third grade.

66
01:03:56,149 --> 01:04:02,673
[SPEAKER_14]: And literally the last week in third grade, he said, can I hang up this piece of paper in the back of the classroom for a sign up?

67
01:04:02,813 --> 01:04:04,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, sure, what's it for?

68
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:06,615
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, I want to start a school newspaper.

69
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, wow, that is an amazing idea.

70
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:10,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to help you with them.

71
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:11,377
[SPEAKER_14]: with that.

72
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:20,824
[SPEAKER_14]: So we wrote a proposal, as Mrs. Crowell said, and we met actually towards the end of the summer together, just Owen and I. We generated some ideas.

73
01:04:21,364 --> 01:04:29,230
[SPEAKER_14]: We worked together for a few days in September, and we put together a first special edition, which I believe that you have a copy of.

74
01:04:31,411 --> 01:04:35,792
[SPEAKER_14]: We've gone through the process of inviting fourth and fifth graders to be part of the staff.

75
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,773
[SPEAKER_14]: We have layout and design team.

76
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:39,353
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a special features team.

77
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:40,194
[SPEAKER_14]: We have writers.

78
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:41,234
[SPEAKER_14]: We have illustrators.

79
01:04:41,874 --> 01:04:42,954
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're really excited.

80
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:45,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Our first edition should be coming out any week now.

81
01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:48,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to turn it over now to Owen.

82
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:49,756
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to come up, the editor-in-chief.

83
01:04:50,376 --> 01:04:52,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's going to come up and share a little bit.

84
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everyone.

85
01:04:56,636 --> 01:05:01,359
[SPEAKER_12]: I am Owen Jenny Walsh, and I am the editor-in-chief of the new Robbins Lampage school paper.

86
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:03,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me.

87
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:11,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I started thinking about the Lampage last year when I was in third grade because I read a lot of books where schools had student-run papers.

88
01:05:12,786 --> 01:05:13,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I studied the paper on Ms.

89
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:19,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Devlin this year in fourth grade, and I think it is a fun way for kids to know what's going on in the school.

90
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,433
[SPEAKER_12]: When the first edition came out, I felt kind of cornered when I started

91
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:27,727
[SPEAKER_12]: and I feel lucky that I have Ms.

92
01:05:27,747 --> 01:05:28,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Devlin to help me.

93
01:05:29,348 --> 01:05:31,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to seeing it grow over time.

94
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hoping other schools do this as well.

95
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:36,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, thank you for having me.

96
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:47,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name is Mary Massa.

97
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I am a fourth grader at the Roberts.

98
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I joined the Roberts Rampage because I enjoy running.

99
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:57,105
[SPEAKER_18]: I like my job more because I'm writing for kids.

100
01:05:57,765 --> 01:06:00,107
[SPEAKER_18]: I am able to write about fun stuff that I like too.

101
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:04,729
[SPEAKER_18]: For the upcoming issue, I'm writing about the student council food drive.

102
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,353
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to interview students and teachers and took photos to go along with my article.

103
01:06:10,953 --> 01:06:12,634
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a really fun experience for me.

104
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,291
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Kieran Naconeyer.

105
01:06:25,671 --> 01:06:27,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for the Roberts Rampage.

106
01:06:27,612 --> 01:06:29,734
[SPEAKER_02]: My job is special features editor.

107
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to be this job because I thought a jokes and riddles page would bring laughter to the school newspaper.

108
01:06:36,437 --> 01:06:38,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a hundred times better.

109
01:06:38,538 --> 01:06:40,960
[SPEAKER_02]: This way it would show information too.

110
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,602
[SPEAKER_02]: This would bring the school together with information and laughter.

111
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:46,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.

112
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:48,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, good job.

113
01:06:54,307 --> 01:06:55,208
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Naima.

114
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:58,150
[SPEAKER_17]: I am in fifth grade at the Roberts Elementary School.

115
01:06:58,591 --> 01:07:05,657
[SPEAKER_17]: One reason I joined the newspaper, the Rampage, is to make other students at the school feel like they can do hard things.

116
01:07:06,277 --> 01:07:11,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though writing is hard for me, I submitted an application to be part of the paper.

117
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:17,007
[SPEAKER_17]: I love art, so I put in the application to be on the layout and design team.

118
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:18,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

119
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:20,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Devlin then also asked me if I

120
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:30,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Wanted to be in charge of the random the random is a section in which teachers show something positive that has been happening in their classes.

121
01:07:32,106 --> 01:07:35,271
[SPEAKER_17]: This is other reason I joined the newspaper.

122
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:40,272
[SPEAKER_17]: to make students feel included in their community.

123
01:07:40,532 --> 01:07:45,774
[SPEAKER_17]: I can also ask students what they want in the paper so we can include everyone.

124
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:50,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so happy to be part to be part of the newspaper.

125
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it will strengthen our school's community.

126
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:03,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job, everybody.

127
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:04,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

128
01:08:05,537 --> 01:08:06,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Impressive.

129
01:08:07,757 --> 01:08:08,857
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so impressive.

130
01:08:08,957 --> 01:08:10,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

131
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:21,560
[SPEAKER_03]: What a wonderful example of why it's so important to have opportunities for student voice and for the adults to really listen to what their students are saying.

132
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:31,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really great to hear the different roles that you're all taking based on both what you think your strengths are versus where you want

133
01:08:32,423 --> 01:08:36,966
[SPEAKER_03]: to push yourself in areas that you know would be helpful for you.

134
01:08:36,986 --> 01:08:40,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so proud of the work that you're doing.

135
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:47,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone has any quick questions for our professional authors and artists.

136
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:49,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Intoppa.

137
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:51,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

138
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:57,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll keep it brief because I usually ramble about all these things, but I'm at a loss for words at just how beautiful

139
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:11,730
[SPEAKER_11]: this concept is and the support it has and just the initiative of wanting to start a newspaper in elementary school and having it and be successful and having students actually say, yeah, I want to learn this because I want to do this when I'm older.

140
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to do this for the next few years to see if I want to try it out.

141
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:22,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Having that space to just learn of, hey, if I want to do art and graphic design layout or, hey, I want to do this and I want to try writing for the first time,

142
01:09:23,824 --> 01:09:25,665
[SPEAKER_11]: No other word can describe that besides beautiful.

143
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:26,326
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

144
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:27,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for doing all you're doing.

145
01:09:28,027 --> 01:09:31,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for doing that for your peers and also for yourselves.

146
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:34,411
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a really cool thing and I hope you take advantage of keeping this going.

147
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:35,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

148
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:41,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Brinley.

149
01:09:41,895 --> 01:09:43,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to give a round of applause to Ms.

150
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:46,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Devlin because without teachers like you, stuff like this does not happen.

151
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:49,820
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for taking the time, going the extra mile for these kids.

152
01:09:57,982 --> 01:09:58,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld.

153
01:10:01,595 --> 01:10:03,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say thank you to all the Roberts students.

154
01:10:04,036 --> 01:10:06,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of you know that I am a Roberts parent.

155
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:10,139
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my final year, my 10th year at the Roberts School.

156
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the most wonderful things that I've seen is the connections between classes and across grades.

157
01:10:16,723 --> 01:10:20,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually wrote for the student newspaper when I was in elementary school.

158
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I did the advice columnist.

159
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:29,809
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love the connections here across disciplines and across the community.

160
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:39,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to give a shout out to the RAM page, because I know this school worked really hard to choose their new logo and chose the Robert Rams.

161
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:41,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's a great name.

162
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,253
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love seeing what's on the page.

163
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: The communication is one of the things that I think we've really been working on in Medford and at the Roberts in particular.

164
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:55,536
[SPEAKER_10]: And seeing the student voice take that on is really special and really exciting.

165
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:59,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to try to sneak copies even after I leave the Roberts.

166
01:10:59,497 --> 01:11:00,177
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you all.

167
01:11:00,217 --> 01:11:01,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And thanks for being here.

168
01:11:06,404 --> 01:11:07,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful, thank you.

169
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:12,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make sure I don't unsubscribe since my students just left Robert so I can read the newspaper.

170
01:11:13,953 --> 01:11:17,818
[SPEAKER_07]: If you all want to come up, we'll take a picture and highlight the awesome job you've done.

171
01:11:30,448 --> 01:11:47,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

172
01:11:47,361 --> 01:11:48,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Not all of them.

173
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:56,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next up we have the McGlynn and Andrews Solar Projects presentation.

174
01:12:57,023 --> 01:13:00,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have Mr. Ken Lord, Chief Operations Officer and Ms.

175
01:13:01,004 --> 01:13:07,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Brenda Pike, our Staff Planner for the City, Climate Policy, Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

176
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Brenda, for joining us.

177
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:11,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Lord.

178
01:13:13,027 --> 01:13:13,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll turn it over to you.

179
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:22,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So the.

180
01:13:29,897 --> 01:13:31,037
[SPEAKER_16]: He's this topic.

181
01:13:31,097 --> 01:13:38,720
[SPEAKER_16]: The last time we were here talking about the Anderson McGlynn HVAC projects, but we have a proposal now to talk with you about.

182
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:52,884
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's for a power purchase agreement for a 360 kilowatt system that would generate about 48% of the McGlynn's current electricity usage.

183
01:13:54,372 --> 01:14:03,223
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would be at a flat rate of about four and a half cents per kilowatt hour that would be for 20 years no escalation.

184
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:09,131
[SPEAKER_16]: And we it's projected that we'd be saving about $64,000 in year one from this project.

185
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:20,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And the installation will start in the fall after the HVAC project and the McGlynn roof refurbishment project is done.

186
01:14:20,966 --> 01:14:26,411
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do have to sign the contract by the end of this year in order to meet federal tax credit requirements.

187
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:32,716
[SPEAKER_16]: While we won't own the system, the installer would be applying for those tax credits, and that's reflected in the rate that we have.

188
01:14:33,757 --> 01:14:39,322
[SPEAKER_16]: If we didn't get those tax credits, the rate would be about twice as much as is shown right there.

189
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:46,342
[SPEAKER_16]: we're going to City Council later this month to get their approval because it's a contract longer than three years.

190
01:14:49,345 --> 01:14:50,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Miss Pike.

191
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:58,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

192
01:14:58,252 --> 01:14:58,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

193
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very, very exciting.

194
01:15:00,073 --> 01:15:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: The 48% it I am I correct that

195
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:11,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, how much electricity is the turbine producing?

196
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:14,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that already kind of being deducted from the current amount?

197
01:15:15,634 --> 01:15:22,240
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the turbine is about, when it was first installed, it was about 10% of the school's usage.

198
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,883
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's somewhat less than that now, probably in the 7% to 8% range.

199
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:27,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And is 48% of the total usage or the?

200
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,386
[SPEAKER_04]: minus that 10% first or whatever it is.

201
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:35,708
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's 48% of the total usage.

202
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:36,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wow.

203
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:40,630
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been over the halfway mark of usage.

204
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful.

205
01:15:41,311 --> 01:15:41,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

206
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:45,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we get to it, I don't know if there's specific language we have to approve.

207
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:49,475
[SPEAKER_04]: We often have set language for these types of things.

208
01:15:50,515 --> 01:15:57,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the city council will have very specific language, but if anybody has that language, when we get to the point where we make a motion,

209
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry members so it's hard to hear.

210
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:04,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me now.

211
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, little better.

212
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

213
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

214
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:15,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this was an honor I didn't have a close enough, but I just want to say if there's any specific language that we have to provide approval for.

215
01:16:15,545 --> 01:16:20,028
[SPEAKER_04]: We should get that before the meetings over tonight.

216
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:34,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I believe it's the December 18th meeting that will present this before the city council just for a vote in favor of hopefully allowing us to go out to contract for longer than three years.

217
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:41,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if there's additional language the council will talk about, but please feel free to comment now, although I think it's pretty straightforward.

218
01:16:43,314 --> 01:16:46,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Olapade and then member Graham.

219
01:16:48,356 --> 01:16:48,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

220
01:16:49,757 --> 01:16:55,038
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the timeline, I know you mentioned fall of 26, is there a general idea about how long this project will take?

221
01:16:55,058 --> 01:17:01,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I expect it will probably take two to three months from start to finish.

222
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:16,643
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is there going to be any, and this is where I'm dealing with this a little bit with HVAC and the roof refurbishing, generally being somewhat during school hours and somewhat being after the fact, is there going to be any type of student impact to classes or things like that, other than just general noise?

223
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,581
[SPEAKER_16]: don't expect that it would.

224
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:27,945
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there are things that would be more impactful, like having a crane, for instance, moving things onto the roof, we would be scheduling that outside of school hours.

225
01:17:28,726 --> 01:17:29,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

226
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:32,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

227
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:36,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

228
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:41,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had one question about the December 31st, 2026 timeline.

229
01:17:41,212 --> 01:17:43,033
[SPEAKER_15]: So between now and December 31st,

230
01:17:46,808 --> 01:17:48,129
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to vote to approve.

231
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:53,415
[SPEAKER_15]: The council has to vote to allow you to enter into a longer contract than three years.

232
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:57,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there other steps that have to happen between now and December 31?

233
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:04,145
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to finalize the contract and get the signatures on it.

234
01:18:04,205 --> 01:18:05,847
[SPEAKER_16]: But other than that, that's it.

235
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:06,488
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

236
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:33,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we haven't talked about it too much in this forum, but we were notified by the MSBA that we got awarded our three statement of interest, statements of interest, I don't exactly know how to make that plural, for roof replacements or refurbishments at Roberts, Missituk, and Brooks in the coming like two years, essentially.

237
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:35,808
[SPEAKER_15]: And my question is whether,

238
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:43,933
[SPEAKER_15]: We should be pursuing a power purchase agreement in advance of the December 31 deadline for those three projects as well.

239
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:51,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this like just the savings alone of the rate of 4 cents versus 13 cents is

240
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:54,364
[SPEAKER_15]: huge savings.

241
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:57,106
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know we couldn't do it until there's like new roofing in place.

242
01:18:57,186 --> 01:19:06,856
[SPEAKER_15]: But those three projects are all like heading, you know, down the fast path, so to speak, with MSBA providing partial reimbursement.

243
01:19:07,316 --> 01:19:14,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, there is an installation timeframe for those tax credits, as well as the contract timeframe.

244
01:19:15,904 --> 01:19:18,807
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think with the roof refurbishment

245
01:19:19,395 --> 01:19:24,140
[SPEAKER_16]: timelines as they're going to be that it would meet the requirements for those tax credits.

246
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:28,504
[SPEAKER_16]: But we can take another look at that.

247
01:19:29,224 --> 01:19:34,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think we have some rough timing of what those projects will look like.

248
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,052
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we also have some like

249
01:19:37,778 --> 01:19:40,860
[SPEAKER_15]: wiggle room in terms of how we sequence those projects out.

250
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:49,127
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there was an opportunity for us to capitalize on this too, I would just want us to know that so that we can move on that quickly if we need to.

251
01:19:50,107 --> 01:20:04,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe if you can just check and let Ken know, we can figure out like if it lines up, great, because then we can do more than one school at this reduced energy cost.

252
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:06,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, absolutely.

253
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:07,395
[SPEAKER_16]: We should talk about that.

254
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:08,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

255
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:09,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

256
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just on that point, Member Graham, I would just ask the council to maybe take a bee paper or a side vote that if by chance we can enter those contracts that you want us to do that versus having Ms.

257
01:20:23,472 --> 01:20:27,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Pike come back around the holidays when our last meeting is.

258
01:20:28,952 --> 01:20:30,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's totally fine.

259
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:30,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

260
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:42,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So and just to sort of follow up, there's no, there's no specific language that you need us to vote on to be able to enact this contract.

261
01:20:42,322 --> 01:20:43,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

262
01:20:43,603 --> 01:20:52,109
[SPEAKER_16]: My understanding is that we that we don't the only real requirement is that we have approval from from you and the approval from the city council for the three year contract.

263
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:52,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

264
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:53,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

265
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:56,412
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to make a motion to approve.

266
01:20:57,693 --> 01:21:13,519
[SPEAKER_15]: entering into this agreement for the McGlynn Solar, and if possible, expanding the scope of this to include our three buildings that are currently in the MSBA roof refurbishment pipeline.

267
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:21,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just didn't know if we need a clean vote, but I don't think we do.

268
01:21:21,703 --> 01:21:27,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll call the roll on Member Graham's motion and seconded by Member Reinfeld.

269
01:21:31,455 --> 01:21:31,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was first?

270
01:21:32,015 --> 01:21:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

271
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:34,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham and Member Reinfeld.

272
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:35,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

273
01:21:35,716 --> 01:21:43,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of time.

274
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:44,779
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

275
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:45,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

276
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:46,800
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

277
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:47,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

278
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

279
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

280
01:21:49,301 --> 01:21:49,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Pike.

281
01:21:49,481 --> 01:21:50,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Lord.

282
01:21:54,102 --> 01:21:55,182
[SPEAKER_07]: We need your microphone back on.

283
01:21:55,222 --> 01:21:55,703
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, go ahead.

284
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:56,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, plug.

285
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:57,183
[SPEAKER_16]: One small plug.

286
01:21:57,443 --> 01:21:58,984
[SPEAKER_16]: There are some differences between municipal

287
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:01,753
[SPEAKER_16]: and residential solar.

288
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:15,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So if there's anyone watching from home who's thinking about installing solar on their own home, we have an Electrify Medford program where you can talk to one of our energy coaches one-on-one about your specific situation and get recommendations.

289
01:22:16,977 --> 01:22:17,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Miss Pike.

290
01:22:17,797 --> 01:22:22,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, my husband and I talked to you and now we have a new heating system, which is environmentally friendly.

291
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:27,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So we used your service and we got the tax credits just in time.

292
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So please call our office if you need that help.

293
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:31,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

294
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:44,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, I'm going to turn it over to Superintendent Galusi for a community input in space utilization presentation.

295
01:22:44,054 --> 01:22:50,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're going to break down some of the data from the survey that was given a couple of weeks ago.

296
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:50,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

297
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:52,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

298
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so I am going to start the previous school committee meeting.

299
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:03,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It was discussed by this body to open this up for community input.

300
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:12,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to begin with a little bit of framing as to the work that's been done so far in case there are people listening that might need a little bit of a recap.

301
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,591
[SPEAKER_03]: So during the November 17th meeting,

302
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:30,785
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed part of the work that's been done with last year's resolution around overcrowding initiatives at the elementary, which resulted in the space utilization study.

303
01:23:31,686 --> 01:23:36,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the slide, you will see the work that we have done so far and a recap of that meeting so.

304
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:56,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Last summer, the district worked with HMFH architects, and they conducted a space utilization study of the Brooks, the Missituk, the Roberts, the McGlynn, and the Andrews, and they looked at the way that the classrooms have been used, and they identified spaces that could

305
01:23:57,437 --> 01:24:03,924
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly use another view to see how the district is using those.

306
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: The criteria that they used were classrooms that based on their size, their natural light, their accessibility to pathways of transport within the building.

307
01:24:17,139 --> 01:24:27,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They presented multiple capacity increasing scenarios with a particular focus on the Brooks and the Roberts due to the overcrowding nature of those two schools.

308
01:24:28,284 --> 01:24:38,428
[SPEAKER_03]: The district in response to this study conducted an internal walkthrough of some of the schools, specifically the Andrews.

309
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:46,631
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at usable spaces within the schools to see how they were identified in the study

310
01:24:47,312 --> 01:24:57,730
[SPEAKER_03]: how they are currently being used right now versus how they were intended to be used way back when the schools were first opened in 2003.

311
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:12,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the recommendation that we made during this meeting, MPS, was to review option two a little bit further, just to see the viability.

312
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:28,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Option two, as communicated to the community, both in the correspondence as well as in a survey, was looking at the viability of having the elementary schools follow a K to four model.

313
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:36,075
[SPEAKER_03]: making the McGlynn middle school five to six model and the Andrews a grade seven and eight model.

314
01:25:36,835 --> 01:25:39,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, no decision has been made.

315
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:46,600
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just constructing a task force to look further at that option.

316
01:25:48,557 --> 01:26:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for the recommendation to review option two further was that it would meet immediate need at the elementaries for overcrowding and some long-term space capacity.

317
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It would provide a balanced cost effective and operationally viable solution.

318
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:18,724
[SPEAKER_03]: and it would enable at the middle school level, it would eliminate the need for a lottery for school assignment.

319
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:33,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It would address some of the demographic disparities that is happening and real at both of the middle schools, and it would ensure that specialized programming is equitable at both the McGlynn and the Andrews.

320
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It was communicated that this

321
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:47,614
[SPEAKER_03]: view or work through the task force would be to see if this was able to happen.

322
01:26:47,914 --> 01:26:55,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it were determined to be, we're not really even looking at it until school year 27, 28.

323
01:26:58,978 --> 01:27:03,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So two weeks ago, we put out a correspondence to the community

324
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: recapping what happened at the school committee meeting on November 17th, and also attaching a survey for people to provide input.

325
01:27:14,748 --> 01:27:19,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one way that we were initiating some community input.

326
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:30,773
[SPEAKER_03]: To date, and I'm sure maybe since we finalized some of this, there have been more respondents, but to date, 160 people have participated in the survey.

327
01:27:31,473 --> 01:27:34,041
[SPEAKER_03]: The breakdown is 115 caregivers, parents, 44 educators, and one student.

328
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:52,774
[SPEAKER_03]: The overall themes that emerged from the survey thus far were centered on student experience, program continuity, staffing, and just overall logistics and nuts and bolts of what this would look like.

329
01:27:53,595 --> 01:28:05,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions that participants reflected strong interest in understanding how this plan supports students, families, and long-term district goals.

330
01:28:07,831 --> 01:28:16,304
[SPEAKER_03]: All in all, there were about five overarching themes that are represented in this participant breakdown.

331
01:28:17,045 --> 01:28:21,932
[SPEAKER_03]: The first was student transitions and developmental fit.

332
01:28:22,773 --> 01:28:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: These were all in response to the first question on the survey, which was what topics would you like the task force to focus on as they study the possibility of this plan.

333
01:28:32,695 --> 01:28:36,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We did provide some topics for people to select from.

334
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:43,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second question was open ended and people could expound upon those topics.

335
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:48,041
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced their own topics, also introduced questions.

336
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:52,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So these themes came out of those two questions on the survey.

337
01:28:53,165 --> 01:29:05,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So 85% of the respondents said that they would want the task force to focus on what the transitions would look like in the developmental fit of said plan.

338
01:29:06,015 --> 01:29:10,598
[SPEAKER_03]: 75% of respondents really want the task force to look at the specialized programming.

339
01:29:11,459 --> 01:29:22,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, at the middle school level, we have specialized programming, certain programming at the McGlynn, and certain programming at the Andrews.

340
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:28,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That's both English learner specialized programming, as well as special education programming.

341
01:29:29,437 --> 01:29:34,662
[SPEAKER_03]: And so 75% of the respondents would want us to really look at what that means for the programming.

342
01:29:35,623 --> 01:29:46,929
[SPEAKER_03]: About 70% of respondents highlighted really making sure we understand what the capacity is of the long-term enrollment and the space.

343
01:29:47,169 --> 01:29:55,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So in actuality, can both the McGlynn Middle School and Andrews Middle School actually handle this?

344
01:29:56,494 --> 01:30:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would it mean for possible inflections of enrollment?

345
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: 60% of respondents really talked about the logistical pieces.

346
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So what will this mean for transportation?

347
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:21,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we look at the eligibility of transportation and the walk to school ratios, mileage capacity?

348
01:30:22,152 --> 01:30:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we look at changing and staggering start times so that families if they want to be transporting their students to elementary as well as 5, 6, 7, 8 in high school.

349
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:41,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they also want to know what we would be doing for after school care, specifically for fifth grade and sixth grade.

350
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:54,435
[SPEAKER_03]: This last section was not one of the listed topic areas, but it emerged in a number of respondent input.

351
01:30:54,775 --> 01:30:59,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have it here as equity, community, and ending the lottery.

352
01:31:00,457 --> 01:31:08,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So 10% of respondents, there was a range in terms of their responding, in terms of their input, but it all fell within this category.

353
01:31:08,679 --> 01:31:09,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Some examples were,

354
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: really happy about ending a lottery and the stress and anxiety that it causes students and family, but also wanting to maintain the identity of school communities and PTO organizations and making sure that we're mindful of that.

355
01:31:28,613 --> 01:31:38,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the equity part of resourcing both middle schools the same, because there's a feeling that right now it is not.

356
01:31:39,566 --> 01:31:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Diving a little bit deeper into these five categories on the next slide, these are just some highlights that came out of survey results.

357
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:54,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So under student transitions and developmental fit, a lot of the

358
01:31:54,850 --> 01:32:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces talked about how will additional school transitions impact student belonging, their mental health, and their learning, they want the task force to really be answering that question, as well as what will fifth grade look like if we were to move it to the McGlynn Middle School.

359
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:15,362
[SPEAKER_03]: what would it look like academically and socially?

360
01:32:16,603 --> 01:32:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, they spoke about would it be homeroom based?

361
01:32:20,424 --> 01:32:23,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be interdepartmental?

362
01:32:24,444 --> 01:32:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something for the task force, as well as just overall the developmentally appropriate piece of moving fifth grade from elementary to a different setting.

363
01:32:34,926 --> 01:32:42,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were a couple comments about making sure that we are looking at what are the transitional supports that will be needed for students?

364
01:32:43,749 --> 01:33:05,462
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go over to special education, EL and specialized programs, specifically the pieces that emerged that they want the task force to look at is the need to understand how the specialized programs will function in both separate models, as well as the need to account for space, staffing,

365
01:33:06,026 --> 01:33:11,230
[SPEAKER_03]: and program continuity if a program is to exist in both schools.

366
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:20,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on enrollment, that is definitely going to be an area that the task force will need to look into.

367
01:33:21,677 --> 01:33:40,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving to space capacity and long-term enrollment, some of the pieces that really resonated to have the task force look into are questions about whether the Andrews can actually truly house all 7th and 8th graders for the district with full programming and influx in enrollment capacity.

368
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The desire for clear long term enrollment projections, especially with potential new housing developments in the city of Medford.

369
01:33:50,108 --> 01:33:58,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are some potentially maybe coming to Wellington and that surfaced in this survey, as well as what are the staffing implications for doing something like this.

370
01:34:00,482 --> 01:34:06,727
[SPEAKER_03]: The logistical pieces around transportation, start times, and afterschool opportunities.

371
01:34:07,568 --> 01:34:13,372
[SPEAKER_03]: The specific questions were, will the start times be staggered to assist families?

372
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Bus routes and eligibility for younger fifth and sixth graders and families having to get to two or three schools.

373
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Really looking at what the eligibility will and can be.

374
01:34:26,183 --> 01:34:28,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, will there be afterschool options?

375
01:34:29,973 --> 01:34:33,475
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can provide for especially fifth and sixth graders.

376
01:34:34,914 --> 01:34:48,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And then under the equity community and ending the lottery, the specific pieces that were mentioned were opportunity to eliminate the middle school lottery, which was viewed as a stressful and socially disruptive to students and families.

377
01:34:49,078 --> 01:34:53,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Stakeholders want both middle schools to be equitably resourced and demographically balanced.

378
01:34:54,759 --> 01:35:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as previously said, desire to preserve a sense of community and the strength of the PTO at each level.

379
01:35:04,898 --> 01:35:09,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So that brings us to this opportunity for public comment.

380
01:35:12,059 --> 01:35:25,822
[SPEAKER_03]: This evening, I just recapped the findings briefly that were discussed at the November 17th meeting, identified those key areas that the survey has yielded thus far for the task force.

381
01:35:26,562 --> 01:35:33,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a reminder, this task force is just going to view the viability of it and recommend

382
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:40,372
[SPEAKER_03]: a plan, if possible, with a potential start of anything in the 27-28 school year.

383
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:50,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all I did on this slide was list these were the topics that were suggested in the survey that people were responding, they could click all that apply.

384
01:35:51,667 --> 01:36:04,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second question was open ended for people to put in additional topics of interest as well as any questions that they have that they want the task force to be responding to.

385
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:11,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the part for public comment in which I'm going to be actively listening so that

386
01:36:12,745 --> 01:36:22,176
[SPEAKER_03]: the information that we have from the survey around topics and questions that people would like the task force to entertain and really dig into.

387
01:36:22,196 --> 01:36:24,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be making note of that.

388
01:36:24,298 --> 01:36:24,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

389
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Allen will help me make note of that so that we can add it to the data that we already have been compiling.

390
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Galussi.

391
01:36:34,702 --> 01:36:36,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good presentation.

392
01:36:36,103 --> 01:36:37,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I love hearing what the data showed.

393
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:41,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we had 170 respondents, like you said, or so, which is great.

394
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:48,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And the task force will be created in January, and I'm assuming start meetings sometime in the February time range.

395
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:53,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anybody in the audience that is here to comment.

396
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:59,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if anybody's online, but I think this is a great start

397
01:37:00,895 --> 01:37:02,357
[SPEAKER_07]: exploring this option.

398
01:37:02,457 --> 01:37:03,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for the presentation.

399
01:37:03,879 --> 01:37:10,707
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no comments from the school committee members, we can move on to the agenda.

400
01:37:15,573 --> 01:37:16,574
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not that I can see.

401
01:37:16,734 --> 01:37:17,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld?

402
01:37:21,504 --> 01:37:36,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for this and thanks for summarizing the data I just wanted to add to this, that I definitely saw in the data, a request that the task force look at some case studies of other schools that have made similar transitions I know Boston was mentioned.

403
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:42,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Arlington, Salem, and Andover, I think, were the ones that I saw or heard from people.

404
01:37:42,792 --> 01:37:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: So making sure that that's part of it.

405
01:37:45,175 --> 01:37:48,999
[SPEAKER_10]: And then really looking at some of the through lines across these buckets.

406
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:52,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate these buckets in the summary, but things around

407
01:37:53,103 --> 01:38:00,169
[SPEAKER_10]: continuity around student development and continuity for like the special programs.

408
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:07,976
[SPEAKER_10]: So could an IEP team or support team move with the students across the schools to help ease that transition in the middle?

409
01:38:08,337 --> 01:38:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So things like that.

410
01:38:09,638 --> 01:38:17,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I would just also encourage the task force to look at multiple sides of the coins of a lot of these questions.

411
01:38:17,405 --> 01:38:19,046
[SPEAKER_10]: So an example that I would give there

412
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:36,747
[SPEAKER_10]: the opportunity to eliminate the lottery I know there was some eagerness to eliminate the lottery, so that social groups would not be broken up, but I also know plenty of kids for whom breaking up the social group was actually a chance for a fresh start and new friends.

413
01:38:37,227 --> 01:38:53,077
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think a lot of the questions that people are asking have those have both of those sides, and to consider and I know in going through data like this, it's a fantastic spreadsheet I'm so grateful to everyone who responded that questions that people are asking are so thoughtful and so important.

414
01:38:55,168 --> 01:39:02,437
[SPEAKER_10]: But to really encourage the task force, not just to gravitate to the things that confirm what they think should happen.

415
01:39:03,178 --> 01:39:09,206
[SPEAKER_10]: So just watching out for that confirmation bias, I think is going to be really important.

416
01:39:10,467 --> 01:39:29,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and these questions of, you know, the lottery solved a very specific problem that we had in the district, and it did a great job of that but it introduced these other concerns and so really trying to work through those, you know, are we passing on the overcrowding to a middle school scenario what

417
01:39:30,658 --> 01:39:45,898
[SPEAKER_10]: what new factors are being introduced and what new opportunities and just to be doing this in parallel with the strategic planning that's going to be happening, certainly what's happening around looking at enrollment with potential new housing.

418
01:39:46,699 --> 01:39:47,140
[SPEAKER_10]: any of that.

419
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So that alignment I think is really important.

420
01:39:51,284 --> 01:39:53,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And just looking.

421
01:39:55,027 --> 01:40:03,334
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really glad to see these buckets because there was a comment that said, you know, a lot of the factors that we gave people were very, very operational.

422
01:40:03,995 --> 01:40:09,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And those questions are really concrete and in many ways a lot easier to answer than some of the cultural

423
01:40:11,101 --> 01:40:11,621
[SPEAKER_10]: questions.

424
01:40:11,802 --> 01:40:27,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And so really making sure that we get into those and talk to students, potentially older students of what's been happening and then coming back to those case studies of what's happened in districts and what were the intended and unintended consequences of those changes.

425
01:40:27,728 --> 01:40:30,349
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think this is a really great foundation to build on.

426
01:40:30,429 --> 01:40:32,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited to get a report

427
01:40:33,781 --> 01:40:38,023
[SPEAKER_10]: hopefully in the spring from this task force to say, what could we do?

428
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:38,983
[SPEAKER_10]: What should we do?

429
01:40:39,163 --> 01:40:40,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Because those are different questions.

430
01:40:40,544 --> 01:40:43,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because we can do something doesn't mean it's the thing to do.

431
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:45,666
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think there's a lot of possibility here.

432
01:40:45,766 --> 01:40:51,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am excited to hear what the task force recommends.

433
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:53,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

434
01:40:53,389 --> 01:40:54,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Member Reinfeld.

435
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:56,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

436
01:40:56,023 --> 01:40:56,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I add on?

437
01:40:56,663 --> 01:40:57,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dr. Galussi.

438
01:40:57,844 --> 01:41:01,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you brought up the point about the research.

439
01:41:01,044 --> 01:41:01,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

440
01:41:02,685 --> 01:41:13,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I have already reached out to the districts that were, most of them, not all of them, but the districts that were mentioned so that we make sure we have that data for when the task force does the work.

441
01:41:14,427 --> 01:41:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.

442
01:41:17,928 --> 01:41:18,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

443
01:41:18,728 --> 01:41:19,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Galussi.

444
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:23,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll move on.

445
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:23,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

446
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the presentation.

447
01:41:26,306 --> 01:41:27,367
[SPEAKER_07]: We look forward to hearing more.

448
01:41:29,027 --> 01:41:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no presentations of the public nor the council.

449
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Continued business.

450
01:41:37,891 --> 01:41:41,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to turn it over to Member Graham for an MSBA update.

451
01:41:42,092 --> 01:41:42,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

452
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:43,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

453
01:41:43,733 --> 01:41:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I am excited to update you all.

454
01:41:49,635 --> 01:41:51,936
[SPEAKER_15]: As you know, SMMA was selected

455
01:41:52,776 --> 01:42:01,202
[SPEAKER_15]: via the MSBA designer selection panel process back in October to be our designer.

456
01:42:01,222 --> 01:42:10,267
[SPEAKER_15]: At our meeting last week, the school building committee approved the contract with SMMA, and that was subsequently signed by the mayor last week.

457
01:42:11,328 --> 01:42:13,209
[SPEAKER_15]: We have an official kickoff meeting with MSBA.

458
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:18,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow, in fact, although the work has already begun.

459
01:42:18,752 --> 01:42:24,614
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to give you a little bit of an update on like what you can expect in the coming couple of months.

460
01:42:24,934 --> 01:42:31,697
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we have, we are in the throes of what they call educational visioning, which is a

461
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:47,580
[SPEAKER_15]: process where we get to say what should be happening in the building, and how should it happen in the building that work is underway right now, primarily by educators who work at Medford High School department heads and that kind of thing.

462
01:42:48,982 --> 01:43:07,098
[SPEAKER_15]: There'll be two visioning sessions upcoming in the next two weeks where that group will expand slightly to include folks from the community who applied and expressed interest who work in other districts or have served on MSBA related projects in the past.

463
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:13,259
[SPEAKER_15]: So all of that will wrap up before the holiday break in December.

464
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:20,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will also be putting out a call probably tomorrow to form what we're calling advisory teams.

465
01:43:21,266 --> 01:43:34,298
[SPEAKER_15]: And these teams will be people from the community ideally have specific skill sets, for example, sustainability and mechanical, electrical, power,

466
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:38,085
[SPEAKER_15]: things all together right as one group.

467
01:43:39,085 --> 01:43:40,446
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be on the on that group.

468
01:43:43,548 --> 01:43:56,314
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's there's four so one is interior and exterior design, one is site safety and security, one is educational planning, and the other is the mechanical electrical, maybe plumbing is the other P is the P.

469
01:43:58,155 --> 01:43:59,096
[SPEAKER_15]: and sustainability.

470
01:43:59,216 --> 01:44:15,591
[SPEAKER_15]: So those advisory groups, the ask is for people who have maybe particular skill sets in those areas to join us for one meeting in December, a meeting in January, and then a meeting to be scheduled in March and in September.

471
01:44:16,072 --> 01:44:17,894
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be looking for community input that way.

472
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:31,541
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be a building committee meeting in December and then there will be several building committee meetings between January and February because our first deliverable to MSBA will be due at the end of February.

473
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:41,689
[SPEAKER_15]: So during that time, we will see things like a big behemoth spreadsheet that says this is how many classrooms we need of all of these different types and sorts.

474
01:44:43,371 --> 01:44:46,994
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll start to sort of marry our educational

475
01:44:49,487 --> 01:44:56,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Our educational enrollment which certified at 1395 for the high school which is about 200 students more than we have today.

476
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:07,875
[SPEAKER_15]: To the space programming that will happen so that when they start thinking about what does the building look like they know that they need X number of classrooms and they need you know.

477
01:45:09,095 --> 01:45:14,399
[SPEAKER_15]: this many vocational spaces that look like these particular shops and meet certain requirements.

478
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:17,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And that all helps inform things like how big is the building?

479
01:45:18,102 --> 01:45:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it bigger than it is right now?

480
01:45:19,323 --> 01:45:20,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it smaller than it is right now?

481
01:45:20,844 --> 01:45:27,649
[SPEAKER_15]: All of those things are driven out of the formulas that are created by this like master spreadsheet.

482
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:37,296
[SPEAKER_15]: But the more exciting news is that in January, we will start to see two dimensional ideas of what this building could look like.

483
01:45:38,017 --> 01:45:43,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's still coming into focus for me like what that visual thing will be.

484
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:52,947
[SPEAKER_15]: But what they talked about is when we think about the high school property, there's many places where a building could go on that property because there's 30 acres.

485
01:45:53,027 --> 01:45:53,167
[SPEAKER_15]: So

486
01:45:54,230 --> 01:46:16,935
[SPEAKER_15]: it could be a set of like, here are, you know, here are 15 options of how we might situate different configurations of this building, so that then they can get feedback from the building committee, from the community who attends the meetings, so that the cost estimators start to work from those like 2D sketches on like

487
01:46:18,756 --> 01:46:25,745
[SPEAKER_15]: what would these different buildings look like from a cost estimating perspective because all that is due by the end of February.

488
01:46:25,765 --> 01:46:33,714
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be a meeting, there will be two meetings where we will review the educational plan

489
01:46:34,355 --> 01:46:35,415
[SPEAKER_15]: here with this committee.

490
01:46:35,535 --> 01:46:39,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So the school building committee will sign off on the deliverable at the end of February.

491
01:46:40,316 --> 01:46:49,039
[SPEAKER_15]: The school committee signs off on the educational plan because the school committee retains the authority over the actual educational plan that will get executed in the building.

492
01:46:49,639 --> 01:46:52,800
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the end of January, we'll see a draft of that.

493
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,720
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the beginning of February, we'll be asked to vote on that.

494
01:46:57,301 --> 01:47:00,942
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of that will feed the deliverable, which they call it the preferred

495
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:09,286
[SPEAKER_15]: preliminary design plan, preliminary design plan, PDP, PDP, right?

496
01:47:10,768 --> 01:47:20,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's two deliverables, both that start with P that keep tripping me up, but they, thank you, Ken.

497
01:47:21,696 --> 01:47:24,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you PSR comes next.

498
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:40,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the, the idea in February is that we can paint a clear enough picture for MSBA about what the education will look like in the building and what we are pursuing from a more in depth feasibility analysis, including

499
01:47:42,841 --> 01:47:51,746
[SPEAKER_15]: whether we're looking at what they call a code update, which is a requirement to look at under MSBA, which is they'll just bring the building up to code and call it a day.

500
01:47:54,147 --> 01:48:00,771
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any high school has ever gone down that road because it would essentially not really be eligible for MSBA funding at that point anymore.

501
01:48:02,072 --> 01:48:10,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Then there's like many iterations of like reno slash add reno and then there's new buildings and so

502
01:48:10,737 --> 01:48:20,265
[SPEAKER_15]: in January we will start to see what those options look like and the public is welcome to join us as we as we start to have those conversations.

503
01:48:20,325 --> 01:48:30,413
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're deep in the throes of planning what those community engagement meetings will look like and how they fit with the strategic planning conversations that also are happening in that same timeline.

504
01:48:30,453 --> 01:48:39,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a we're trying to put the puzzle together so that people can participate in lots of things and not get exhausted by the amount of feedback that we're asking people for.

505
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:47,303
[SPEAKER_15]: But all of that will happen in January and in February in advance of this deliverable.

506
01:48:47,383 --> 01:48:56,866
[SPEAKER_15]: And then between February and June, we will take what might be many options in February and we will ultimately narrow down to one option.

507
01:48:56,886 --> 01:49:01,928
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is what will be submitted at the end of June to MSBA.

508
01:49:02,048 --> 01:49:06,170
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is the one we'll go forward with to like really dive deep

509
01:49:06,744 --> 01:49:21,745
[SPEAKER_15]: go through all the ins and outs, really start talking about schematic design and the real cost estimation around that one choice that we make at the June deliverable.

510
01:49:22,646 --> 01:49:25,207
[SPEAKER_15]: And MSBA will agree with that and then we'll move forward.

511
01:49:25,247 --> 01:49:29,948
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's like a lot happening between now and June.

512
01:49:29,968 --> 01:49:37,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Many opportunities for input and be on the lookout for the call for the advisory teams.

513
01:49:38,631 --> 01:49:43,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there'll be a series of public meetings and places where we'll be asking the

514
01:49:43,892 --> 01:49:57,259
[SPEAKER_15]: the combined team to go and demonstrate, particularly as we get closer to June, what that option looks like to collect input from people and feedback about what they like and what they don't like about what they're seeing.

515
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:07,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So things are moving incredibly fast and I thank the team that is working with us because we've given them a really demanding

516
01:50:08,155 --> 01:50:10,676
[SPEAKER_15]: charge and we are working through it together.

517
01:50:10,776 --> 01:50:19,580
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are we are moving like lightning fast and all these pieces are falling into place so that we can start to give people a little bit of advance notice.

518
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:26,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you so much member Graham and I think our next meeting is.

519
01:50:29,004 --> 01:50:30,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I must be able is that.

520
01:50:32,805 --> 01:50:37,107
[SPEAKER_15]: The 22nd 22nd and that meeting will be virtual only.

521
01:50:39,019 --> 01:50:59,669
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing that we will do is put out some clear information about the January meetings about whether not that we wouldn't host the virtual meeting in addition to an in person meeting, but whether the content being covered in those meetings really lends itself to participating virtually or if you really want to be able to see

522
01:51:00,589 --> 01:51:07,375
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, whatever the 9, 10, 15, however many options they're putting in front of us, whether that is recommended to be in person or not.

523
01:51:07,475 --> 01:51:12,299
[SPEAKER_15]: So a little bit more to come about like the best ways to engage in those future meetings.

524
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:13,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely.

525
01:51:13,981 --> 01:51:14,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

526
01:51:14,661 --> 01:51:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld?

527
01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:18,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

528
01:51:18,498 --> 01:51:33,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple questions so the advisory teams, is that an MSBA requirement or is that an architect, is that an SMMA process what that's an SMMA process, and it is not an MSBA requirement, but they.

529
01:51:34,845 --> 01:51:40,470
[SPEAKER_15]: They have been working with us to sort of scope out what those groups would do.

530
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:49,957
[SPEAKER_15]: And what they said is they find that it is another helpful point of input for the building committee to hear from different groups of people with particular special needs.

531
01:51:49,977 --> 01:51:54,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that was definitely something that we discussed when we first approved the building committee's creation.

532
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:59,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're thinking about who was on it and saying there would be this opportunity for advisory.

533
01:51:59,845 --> 01:52:01,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there potentially an opportunity

534
01:52:04,209 --> 01:52:14,877
[SPEAKER_10]: For other other groups are these are you listed for I can see right educational planning that's a huge thing we definitely wanted to have some representation for.

535
01:52:17,539 --> 01:52:20,742
[SPEAKER_10]: groups with disabilities for special needs yeah that kind of.

536
01:52:21,182 --> 01:52:23,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Accessibility there.

537
01:52:23,463 --> 01:52:36,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the four that they needed us to move on urgently so that their input can be part of these like 2D designs and to help inform like where those things go.

538
01:52:37,672 --> 01:52:51,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Having said that, once we get through this phase and we move into the next phase where we're narrowing down, there certainly could be another set of advisory teams that are looking at something on these teams, because I can see that place there.

539
01:52:51,924 --> 01:52:53,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other question I have is when

540
01:52:55,227 --> 01:53:15,242
[SPEAKER_10]: When will the community have an opportunity to learn about some of those constraints that MSBA does put on things because I know people have questions about things like the pool and how big an auditorium can be and all of these things that we would love to have complete control over and, but it will qualify or disqualify us for certain aspects of funding.

541
01:53:18,036 --> 01:53:29,463
[SPEAKER_15]: My best guess is that that will start to unfold as we are talking about these 2D designs, because people will say things like, well, that theater is not big enough because the whole school can't go in there.

542
01:53:29,663 --> 01:53:42,090
[SPEAKER_15]: And then SMMA will quickly sort of educate in that moment about what the rules are, which is that you cannot build a theater bigger than 1,000 student capacity.

543
01:53:43,298 --> 01:53:46,380
[SPEAKER_15]: in this project with MSBA, period.

544
01:53:47,681 --> 01:53:50,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if we were willing to pay for it, it cannot be part of this project.

545
01:53:50,422 --> 01:53:57,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the things that I think people really need to know as we think about what we're asking the taxpayers to fund.

546
01:53:57,786 --> 01:54:12,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I think there'll be a number of layers of information like that, but the list of rules is so long that I think it would be really hard to make that resonate for people.

547
01:54:13,035 --> 01:54:16,176
[SPEAKER_15]: until they start seeing something or having particular questions.

548
01:54:16,816 --> 01:54:35,742
[SPEAKER_15]: When we view the ed plan here in January and then are asked to vote on it in February, that's potentially another time to be asking some of those questions because there will be some there will be parameters of like how big something can be that will be informing the that big master spreadsheet that they're

549
01:54:36,728 --> 01:54:37,529
[SPEAKER_15]: having to create.

550
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:42,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So all of that is going to like unfold over time.

551
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:54,437
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I think where it will really happen is when we start narrowing down on options where we're not talking about nine or 10 or 15 or 18 options, but we're talking about, do we like option one or two or three?

552
01:54:54,938 --> 01:55:04,763
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where those conversations I think will be most impactful because that's where you'll be able to see something a little bit more three-dimensional in the process.

553
01:55:05,287 --> 01:55:05,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

554
01:55:05,867 --> 01:55:08,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure I have a million more questions, but that should do it for now.

555
01:55:10,271 --> 01:55:10,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Me too.

556
01:55:10,671 --> 01:55:12,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm learning something new every day.

557
01:55:14,134 --> 01:55:14,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, great.

558
01:55:15,235 --> 01:55:15,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

559
01:55:15,595 --> 01:55:16,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Intoppa?

560
01:55:17,837 --> 01:55:18,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

561
01:55:18,918 --> 01:55:19,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Member Redfield.

562
01:55:19,758 --> 01:55:21,319
[SPEAKER_11]: This meant FAQ sheet.

563
01:55:21,359 --> 01:55:23,541
[SPEAKER_11]: We need some kind of key for this.

564
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:25,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that your microphone was too high.

565
01:55:26,323 --> 01:55:26,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

566
01:55:26,724 --> 01:55:30,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really excited to hear that we're entering the iterative phase so quickly.

567
01:55:30,987 --> 01:55:34,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Come January, the iterative phase being the 2D thumbnail sketches.

568
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:51,537
[SPEAKER_11]: of you know what's happening and for those who don't know and those who haven't you know worked in that creative iterative process behind those 15 or thousands of other thumbnail sketches that come into what this looks like and considering the plot of land we have I'm assuming the number is in 2000.

569
01:55:52,398 --> 01:56:03,603
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is those out of those the iterative process with those two-dimensional sketches is it 15 of a new building or is it like 10 new building 5 Reno or is it like

570
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,220
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be any mix.

571
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:12,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's no formula in that particular part that I'm aware of, at least at the moment.

572
01:56:12,303 --> 01:56:16,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just curious to see if it would be like, all right, we have 15 completely renovated.

573
01:56:16,284 --> 01:56:18,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Because sometimes they'll do that where it's like, all right, we've done 5, 5, 5.

574
01:56:19,265 --> 01:56:21,105
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 5 completely renovation, 5

575
01:56:23,885 --> 01:56:26,946
[SPEAKER_11]: bring up to code and then five, you know, Reno had destroyed.

576
01:56:26,966 --> 01:56:33,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we don't know, we don't know, but still that's great to hear that we're getting into that phase so quickly because it takes a while.

577
01:56:33,407 --> 01:56:41,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I should mention that they, you know, they talked about like the getting to know you phase and I think they have gotten to know us very rapidly.

578
01:56:42,808 --> 01:56:50,510
[SPEAKER_15]: They have already completed more than 60 meetings with various departments at the high school in like a few short weeks.

579
01:56:51,911 --> 01:56:56,994
[SPEAKER_15]: They are, they are really working quickly every department.

580
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:14,184
[SPEAKER_15]: I happen to see them at yeah I happen to see them at the bistro and I was peppering our lead architect with questions about a particular space and he was like right there with me so they really have done their due diligence to understand.

581
01:57:15,765 --> 01:57:28,310
[SPEAKER_15]: what we do in the building and they followed students around for a day to understand like how students experience the building and they really got a lot out of that too.

582
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:40,015
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some visits to other schools happening on Friday and then the visioning sessions start next week where all of this input that they've been collecting starts to

583
01:57:40,675 --> 01:57:47,000
[SPEAKER_15]: come out in what will we look like in this future building, which is exciting.

584
01:57:49,022 --> 01:57:49,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

585
01:57:49,683 --> 01:57:49,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

586
01:57:49,983 --> 01:57:50,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

587
01:57:52,865 --> 01:58:02,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up is our, offered by member Reinfeld, 2025-27, which is the second reading of the AI use of generated AI in Medford Public Schools.

588
01:58:04,537 --> 01:58:11,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to waive the reading and for all the members, the changes since the first reading are indicated in bold.

589
01:58:11,659 --> 01:58:13,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll just go over those changes.

590
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:25,103
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to page four, member, motion to waive the reading by member Reinfeld, seconded by?

591
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,502
[SPEAKER_07]: You pick member Ruseau.

592
01:58:30,664 --> 01:58:35,934
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of those opposed motion to waive the reading is approved.

593
01:58:36,334 --> 01:58:40,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just go over the changes on the second page of the policy.

594
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:57,929
[SPEAKER_07]: the paragraph in bold, all gen AI use must be linked to one or more specific educational relevant objectives and take into account current research about the impact of such tools on critical thinking, cognitive loss and the natural environment.

595
01:58:58,710 --> 01:58:59,731
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good one, thank you.

596
01:58:59,751 --> 01:59:08,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And now on the third page of the policy, all AI generated content should be checked by both students and teachers for accuracy.

597
01:59:08,657 --> 01:59:10,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that needs to be changed to for,

598
01:59:11,993 --> 01:59:15,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, for accuracy bias misinformation and potentially negative content.

599
01:59:16,558 --> 01:59:29,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Students should understand the limitations of AI generated information, the importance of using trusted sources for information verification and the impact that AI tools can have on cognitive development and critical thinking skills.

600
01:59:31,923 --> 01:59:37,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Page four of the policy, all Gen AI content should be critically reviewed before use.

601
01:59:37,768 --> 01:59:46,437
[SPEAKER_07]: All AI generated content should be checked by both students and teachers for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

602
01:59:47,297 --> 01:59:50,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And students should also consider the impact of AI tools in the natural environment.

603
01:59:51,421 --> 01:59:52,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Next page.

604
01:59:54,168 --> 01:59:59,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Teachers must allow the limited use of generated AI on entire assignments or parts of assignments.

605
01:59:59,972 --> 02:00:11,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Educators should identify when and how gen AI can be used and why, and discuss with students the impact of AI tools on cognitive development and critical thinking skills.

606
02:00:13,621 --> 02:00:20,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And added a sentence, under ethical use, educational staff should also consider the impact of AI tools on the national environment.

607
02:00:21,821 --> 02:00:30,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the last page of the policy, in addition, MPS staff will consider the impact on the national environment before employing AI tools.

608
02:00:32,245 --> 02:00:43,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Same in the last paragraph of the policy, where you added in the latest research into how AI tools impact student learning, cognitive development, and the natural environment.

609
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:47,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld.

610
02:00:48,522 --> 02:00:51,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a very long discussion about the policy last meeting.

611
02:00:51,906 --> 02:01:01,777
[SPEAKER_10]: This is taking in, this is adding in the requested changes from students and others about natural environment, cognitive loss, and

612
02:01:03,438 --> 02:01:09,602
[SPEAKER_10]: and the checking that it is both the students and the teachers responsibility to check this content.

613
02:01:09,942 --> 02:01:15,065
[SPEAKER_10]: There will continue to be follow up with students and educators and caregivers.

614
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:20,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that rollout plan is going to be kicking off next week.

615
02:01:20,509 --> 02:01:23,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a meeting to discuss and then from there we'll

616
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:27,904
[SPEAKER_10]: it'll be integrated into appropriate meetings from there.

617
02:01:27,984 --> 02:01:36,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is taking into account the requested changes and happy to answer questions, but this tried to.

618
02:01:36,052 --> 02:01:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

619
02:01:37,233 --> 02:01:38,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Incorporate the feedback we got last time.

620
02:01:39,352 --> 02:01:40,332
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we appreciate that.

621
02:01:40,352 --> 02:02:02,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know in the policy, it also says, which is part of it, and I know I didn't read the whole policy, but important for me is students should not use any generative gen AI tools without prior approval from educators or educational teams, and students must also properly cite all AI-generated content.

622
02:02:03,017 --> 02:02:03,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to point that out.

623
02:02:04,378 --> 02:02:05,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Intoppa.

624
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

625
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:21,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate, again, I just want to reiterate, I appreciate all the work that has gone into writing this policy, all the various meetings, the changes, but I personally still can't get behind this.

626
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:33,373
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about, I'll say it again, like I said a few weeks ago, citing an AI search is the same thing as I was told going through the Medford Public Schools, you can't cite Google.

627
02:02:33,433 --> 02:02:37,294
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to do an in-depth research on Chicago MLA formatting and all this and that.

628
02:02:37,954 --> 02:02:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And AI formatting is just your prompt and the machine learning tool.

629
02:02:41,655 --> 02:02:46,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives no credit to anyone who's done any of the actual work behind the scenes.

630
02:02:47,638 --> 02:03:01,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of this, you know, the goal is to teach processes and critical thinking, and this helps promote shortcuts that may build unhealthy habits.

631
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:21,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I see the only way, and I've said this in the meeting and I said it online when I talked about it, and I've spoken to people about it, the only ethical way I see generative AI being used is to teach people how to identify it, to make sure they are not swayed with misinformation, to make sure it is not used in a malicious way.

632
02:03:21,531 --> 02:03:25,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never seen it used in an ethical way in the arts.

633
02:03:26,034 --> 02:03:29,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I refuse to admit that, I refuse to acknowledge generative AI in the arts.

634
02:03:30,036 --> 02:03:30,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it is,

635
02:03:32,398 --> 02:03:37,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Not stealing like an artist in terms of the terms when we talk about, you know, how we take inspiration, how we do things.

636
02:03:38,923 --> 02:03:48,951
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, not comparing this to other things, you know, not comparing to, I don't even know, like microwaves taking over the culinary industry, you know, AI is taking people's jobs.

637
02:03:50,329 --> 02:03:55,216
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a threat to my field of work, and it will always be a threat to my field of work.

638
02:03:55,236 --> 02:04:04,949
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about the iterative process a moment ago, and it is being used in the iterative process in my line of study to steal my job or to steal the job of others.

639
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:08,511
[SPEAKER_11]: And we talk a lot about ethics.

640
02:04:08,771 --> 02:04:11,531
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk a lot about what we see in values.

641
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:15,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand that this is still giving the power to the people.

642
02:04:15,832 --> 02:04:19,713
[SPEAKER_11]: This policy could pass, and no faculty member could ever use generative AI in the classroom.

643
02:04:20,273 --> 02:04:21,314
[SPEAKER_11]: That's entirely possible.

644
02:04:21,734 --> 02:04:23,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's entirely possible that that happens.

645
02:04:24,174 --> 02:04:25,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a world that I would love.

646
02:04:27,582 --> 02:04:31,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And I trust that our faculty and staff will, you know, do the right thing.

647
02:04:31,523 --> 02:04:34,383
[SPEAKER_11]: But to me, this is the district promoting this tool.

648
02:04:34,503 --> 02:04:38,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't really see that as a tool that belongs in the classroom as a part of the learning process.

649
02:04:39,044 --> 02:04:40,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see a way that it works.

650
02:04:43,025 --> 02:04:51,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at to make sure I'm not forgetting anything in terms of citing sources, in terms of, you know, I'm happy to see that we're talking about the,

651
02:04:53,427 --> 02:04:55,408
[SPEAKER_11]: aspect of it impacting critical thinking.

652
02:04:55,989 --> 02:05:03,753
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact that it's written in the policy that says, hey, man, this might negatively impact cognitive development, or this might impact the environment.

653
02:05:04,253 --> 02:05:05,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, how do we do that?

654
02:05:06,214 --> 02:05:11,497
[SPEAKER_11]: We just sit here and we go, OK, my search is going to negatively impact the environment.

655
02:05:12,158 --> 02:05:14,439
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't undo the harm that happens.

656
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:17,961
[SPEAKER_11]: And while it may be minuscule, we're talking about going to nuclear power.

657
02:05:18,673 --> 02:05:20,536
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, we're not at nuclear power.

658
02:05:20,977 --> 02:05:23,000
[SPEAKER_11]: And it may be like, oh, it's only half a water bottle.

659
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:25,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Or hey, it's only like 10 milliliters of water.

660
02:05:26,999 --> 02:05:28,200
[SPEAKER_11]: it's still using energy.

661
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:33,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And nevermind the energy that it takes to generate this, it's also using energy to cool it.

662
02:05:34,223 --> 02:05:40,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the whole part that we talk about is when we talk about the negative impact, it's like, how can a Google search or how can a JAT GBT search impact the environment?

663
02:05:40,627 --> 02:05:44,529
[SPEAKER_11]: We have huge data centers that need to be cooled via water and hydration.

664
02:05:44,549 --> 02:05:50,273
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about, you know, going to a net zero high school, net zero, is that the correct phrase?

665
02:05:51,917 --> 02:06:01,140
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're not accounting for the fact that we're putting forward policies that kind of promote behavior that would be against it.

666
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:07,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe my tinfoil hat is a little too tight when it comes to generative AI.

667
02:06:08,222 --> 02:06:11,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a sensitive topic because I represent a lot of artists and designers.

668
02:06:11,603 --> 02:06:12,943
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went to art and design school.

669
02:06:13,163 --> 02:06:18,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And I acknowledge my own implicit bias and an implicit bias system.

670
02:06:20,875 --> 02:06:30,361
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want my sort of warnings and my cautionary tale and my thoughts to be heard with the committee when we take a vote on this to become policy.

671
02:06:32,242 --> 02:06:36,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Because while a lot of these things are great, AI is plagiarism.

672
02:06:36,184 --> 02:06:39,146
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about the academic honesty panel using it without consent.

673
02:06:39,646 --> 02:06:42,107
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it should be used in the classroom to begin with.

674
02:06:42,508 --> 02:06:45,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll yield my time if anybody has any other questions.

675
02:06:45,449 --> 02:06:48,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to drag things out and keep talking in circles like I already am.

676
02:06:49,572 --> 02:06:49,932
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you.

677
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:51,214
[SPEAKER_07]: You're fine.

678
02:06:51,274 --> 02:06:52,555
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we appreciate your comments.

679
02:06:52,595 --> 02:06:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

680
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:54,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

681
02:06:58,556 --> 02:06:58,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

682
02:06:59,477 --> 02:07:12,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to make a motion to approve amended with the fix from or accuracy to for accuracy to change the first adopted to December 1st, 2025 last amended to NA and next review to be December 2026.

683
02:07:12,441 --> 02:07:16,562
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously there's other people who want to talk.

684
02:07:17,343 --> 02:07:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So I make that motion.

685
02:07:23,683 --> 02:07:28,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you could just repeat the motion one more time approval of the second reading.

686
02:07:28,646 --> 02:07:37,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, motion to approve the policy, fixing that or accuracy to before accuracy and then the rest of it is just the metadata at the bottom.

687
02:07:38,373 --> 02:07:39,393
[SPEAKER_04]: When it was adopted, etc.

688
02:07:39,413 --> 02:07:44,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and accepting all the updates from member Reinfeld.

689
02:07:45,221 --> 02:07:50,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion on the floor by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

690
02:07:51,068 --> 02:07:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Elijah, yes, please.

691
02:07:56,192 --> 02:07:57,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just give it one second.

692
02:07:57,654 --> 02:07:59,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you.

693
02:07:59,355 --> 02:08:00,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.

694
02:08:00,956 --> 02:08:06,501
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a secondary review of the policy last meeting, I believe.

695
02:08:07,162 --> 02:08:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that I wanted to just quickly bring up was there's a clause in the ethical use section under students.

696
02:08:18,732 --> 02:08:30,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It says users may not use, sorry, any form of communication with or through AI tools, including chatbots or virtual assistants, must adhere to the same standards of respect expected in human interactions.

697
02:08:31,004 --> 02:08:52,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that as these are statistical algorithms that are going to sort of attempt to predict future speech based off of correlation between texts that they've observed in their training, I think that it's a harmful sentiment to normalize the personification of these models.

698
02:08:52,556 --> 02:08:56,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we've talked a lot about in this policy that

699
02:08:57,879 --> 02:09:08,141
[SPEAKER_05]: about the dangers and all of the disparities between these systems and real authentic human beings.

700
02:09:08,241 --> 02:09:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it's problematic at a societal level to try and... I think that the personification of these agents can do nothing but harm

701
02:09:27,032 --> 02:09:34,536
[SPEAKER_05]: to ethical use if that's what we're aiming for in this proposal.

702
02:09:35,817 --> 02:09:36,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

703
02:09:50,565 --> 02:09:52,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the students can't make amendments.

704
02:09:53,487 --> 02:09:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a specific amendment requested?

705
02:09:58,845 --> 02:10:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, suggested, of course.

706
02:10:01,646 --> 02:10:02,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Requested, suggested.

707
02:10:02,687 --> 02:10:04,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

708
02:10:06,348 --> 02:10:12,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think a lot of the other content in this section is very helpful.

709
02:10:12,751 --> 02:10:18,054
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want students to use AI to disseminate harmful content.

710
02:10:18,094 --> 02:10:26,237
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want students to sort of use these platforms by proxy, as it seems to be insinuated.

711
02:10:28,566 --> 02:10:36,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that this particular section is harmful in of itself.

712
02:10:37,030 --> 02:10:42,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't see a lot of other utility other than it seems pretty singular in its intent.

713
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:49,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that a suggestion to remove the whole paragraph?

714
02:10:49,336 --> 02:10:50,597
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just that sentence.

715
02:10:51,837 --> 02:10:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: The other parts about dissemination of harmful content is,

716
02:10:55,788 --> 02:11:00,350
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion, aligns with the goals outlined by the proposal.

717
02:11:04,652 --> 02:11:05,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld.

718
02:11:07,453 --> 02:11:24,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Comfortable removing it, having this body do that removal simply because this was language that was given to us specifically by teachers in the working group in regards to how they, which AI tools they thought students would be using or likely to use.

719
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:35,363
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I would like to bring that back to the staff and the technology, the head of technology who worked on this.

720
02:11:36,383 --> 02:11:37,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to raise the concern.

721
02:11:38,264 --> 02:11:39,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate that.

722
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:39,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

723
02:11:40,064 --> 02:11:40,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

724
02:11:40,405 --> 02:11:43,406
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that a motion to table?

725
02:11:43,426 --> 02:11:46,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think our student members can't actually formally amend things.

726
02:11:46,546 --> 02:11:51,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to hear what the recommendation was or what the suggestion was.

727
02:11:51,268 --> 02:11:53,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate it.

728
02:11:53,329 --> 02:11:54,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to bring that

729
02:11:55,049 --> 02:12:07,531
[SPEAKER_10]: to Director Layden and the rest of the team, but I would like to keep this as written because this did come out of this group of educators that specifically wanted these

730
02:12:08,948 --> 02:12:09,749
[SPEAKER_10]: tools included.

731
02:12:10,909 --> 02:12:11,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

732
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:17,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to bring that to them and then vote for the second reading at the next meeting?

733
02:12:17,074 --> 02:12:29,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I think given that this is likely to be amendments after these focus groups happen, I think doing those all together makes sense if we're looking at a one-year review policy.

734
02:12:30,063 --> 02:12:36,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like us to vote on this tonight.

735
02:12:37,649 --> 02:12:38,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, yes.

736
02:12:41,194 --> 02:12:43,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we should push this to another meeting.

737
02:12:43,176 --> 02:12:44,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should.

738
02:12:45,339 --> 02:12:51,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask a quick question about the process for this proposal going forward?

739
02:12:51,507 --> 02:12:54,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you said that you're breaking out into focus groups.

740
02:12:55,974 --> 02:12:58,475
[SPEAKER_05]: after this vote after this vote is that correct.

741
02:12:59,075 --> 02:13:08,860
[SPEAKER_10]: If that is, that is the plan that is what the so the task force so I mentioned this when we did the first reading the task force said that they were, this was moving.

742
02:13:09,978 --> 02:13:37,495
[SPEAKER_10]: This was moving into the handbooks, which have been approved, and this language, the same language is in the handbooks, and then that they wanted to set up focus groups with educators in department meetings, also talk to the student council, partly at your recommendation, or a larger group that the student council brings together, and also do conversations with caregivers, and then also talking about what training is needed for educators to really bring

743
02:13:39,364 --> 02:13:40,985
[SPEAKER_10]: make wise decisions.

744
02:13:41,325 --> 02:13:44,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the sentiment expressed is very valuable there.

745
02:13:44,227 --> 02:13:48,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get too far into the questions, because I know we're a little deep.

746
02:13:48,289 --> 02:13:55,853
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there a particular reason why you prioritized doing these work groups after the approval of the proposal?

747
02:13:58,274 --> 02:14:01,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So this, I'll just say it.

748
02:14:01,136 --> 02:14:03,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I was surprised that this went into the handbook as soon as it did.

749
02:14:05,838 --> 02:14:08,500
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thought once it was in the handbook, we needed to codify it.

750
02:14:11,333 --> 02:14:12,194
[SPEAKER_10]: in a public forum.

751
02:14:12,814 --> 02:14:16,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, I can't speak to the exact timing.

752
02:14:17,557 --> 02:14:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that in mind, you still want to vote on it tonight, correct?

753
02:14:21,899 --> 02:14:22,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

754
02:14:22,259 --> 02:14:22,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

755
02:14:36,307 --> 02:14:38,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remind me who motioned for approval and then seconded.

756
02:14:44,948 --> 02:14:46,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, is all those in favor?

757
02:14:48,051 --> 02:14:48,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

758
02:14:49,272 --> 02:14:50,052
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

759
02:14:52,635 --> 02:14:52,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

760
02:14:55,457 --> 02:14:55,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Nay.

761
02:15:09,168 --> 02:15:10,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call has been requested.

762

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

764
02:15:14,866 --> 02:15:15,287

[SPEAKER_04]: No.

768
02:15:17,627 --> 02:15:18,208
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

769
02:15:18,888 --> 02:15:19,608

770

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

775
02:15:22,889 --> 02:15:23,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longovern?

776
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:36,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, although I wish from the chair that the student's request could be looked into before we moved approval, but I understand we'll be re-looking at that paragraph.

777
02:15:36,174 --> 02:15:40,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, that's six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

778
02:15:48,303 --> 02:16:06,436
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any new business or reports requested, but we do have to condolences unfortunately, members of the Medford school committee, express their sincerest condolences, the family of Anna M front a vendor retired Medford public school teacher who started her career at the Forest Park School in Medford.

779
02:16:07,655 --> 02:16:18,174
[SPEAKER_07]: and the members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Janice Rumley-Ahearn, mother of Kelly Molloy, computer teacher at the Roberts Elementary School.

780
02:16:18,234 --> 02:16:20,358
[SPEAKER_07]: If we all might rise for a moment of silence, please.

781
02:16:34,281 --> 02:16:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

782
02:16:35,782 --> 02:16:38,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday night is the winter extravaganza here at City Hall.

783
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:39,826
[SPEAKER_07]: All are welcome.

784
02:16:40,287 --> 02:16:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 4.30 to 6.30.

785
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:49,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And our next regular meeting is December 15th here in the Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

786
02:16:49,275 --> 02:16:51,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

787
02:16:51,538 --> 02:16:54,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I move to adjourn.

788
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:55,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I, member Intoppa, seconded by?

789
02:16:55,542 --> 02:16:55,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

790
02:16:58,645 --> 02:16:59,285
