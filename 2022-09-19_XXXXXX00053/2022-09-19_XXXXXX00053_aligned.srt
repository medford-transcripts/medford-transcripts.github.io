00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,179
Thank you so much for joining us today.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,864
If you don't mind just introducing yourself to us with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:54,506
All right, well, thank you for having me.

12
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:55,667
I am Kate Quinn.

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:04,094
My pronouns are she, her, hers, and I am the program manager here for Medford Recreation.

14
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:10,500
I help structure programs, create programs, and even coach some of the programs myself.

15
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:12,252
Thank you.

16
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:14,492
And we'll get into more of that.

17
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,693
I think there's some certain programs that we're excited to hear about today.

18
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:24,534
But we're going to start with just the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

19
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:25,534
And what do you like to eat there?

20
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,175
Okay, so I couldn't pick one place.

21
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,555
So I have a top three.

22
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,996
I really enjoy Chili Garden.

23
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:39,837
And their pineapple fried rice is one of my favorite dishes there.

24
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:39,897
Or

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,031
The pork belly is also another really good one.

26
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,472
Yes.

27
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:52,253
I also really enjoy a chicken salad sandwich from Lakasha's.

28
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:53,573
OK.

29
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:59,515
And my last would be buttermilk chicken from Snappy Patty's.

30
00:01:59,535 --> 00:01:59,575
OK.

31
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:00,315
Doing it right.

32
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,196
I love all of those answers.

33
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:03,776
Yes.

34
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,997
I definitely enjoy the food in Medford.

35
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,118
And it was hard for me to decide which three.

36
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,092
I could talk about.

37
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:13,493
Sometimes it's the hardest question.

38
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:17,975
And I think it can change depending on your mood and the day and what meal you're thinking about.

39
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:22,538
But I don't think lakashas has come up, so I'm glad that you brought that one up.

40
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:33,665
So we're really interested to hear anything that you want to share about Medford Rec, especially I think we were kind of put in touch with you to talk about the adaptive programs that Medford Rec offers.

41
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:37,327
So I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about any of those.

42
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:48,219
Yeah, so Medford Recreation, we strive to be like an inclusive department, like no matter what program we're trying to be accommodating for all, right?

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,783
So to make that happen, we started offering an inclusion request form.

44
00:02:55,364 --> 00:03:04,550
This is something that anybody can go online and fill out to ask for any type of accommodations for all of our programs.

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:19,658
We also have an intake form that can help me and the rest of my staff get to know the participant, maybe what works best, what doesn't really work for them, and or the best way to reach their goals, right?

46
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:31,204
So, and so once we started doing all that, adding in our adaptive program, so we decided, you know, sometimes not everybody's ready for a certain program, and

47
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:55,589
All our participants, you know, who may have special needs or physical or cognitive disabilities, we decided to add in one adaptive program per session to help meet the needs of people who may not be ready to participate in, you know, Medford youth sports or even just, you know, our non-adaptive programs, right?

48
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:03,371
And what I've noticed from a few of our participants is this, this adaptive program has kind of transitioned

49
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:13,423
these patrons or participants into feeling comfortable, into feeling ready to participate in our non-adaptive programs.

50
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:21,949
And it's really kind of a great feeling just to see, you know, the families and the participant just to feel comfortable and excited to start a program.

51
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:29,735
And maybe they didn't need a one-to-one in the adaptive program, but maybe adding a one-to-one for the beginning of

52
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:44,453
non-adaptive program was the way to get them to transition and the way to get them in and using that inclusion request form really helps us figure out what that child needs to be successful.

53
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:48,275
So I want to make sure I'm understanding.

54
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:52,157
So if you, it works like if you had a child who

55
00:04:53,807 --> 00:05:10,195
needed an accommodation to be able to participate in sort of like a non-adaptive program, you could fill out this request form, or is it also to request a specific program for a child who might not be ready for those non-adaptive programs?

56
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:17,398
So it's not to request a program, it is to request accommodations to help assist with the program.

57
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:18,857
Okay.

58
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,138
And you said you gave an example of like a one-on-one.

59
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,021
So like, can you explain more about what some of those accommodations might look like or what are sort of reasonable requests?

60
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:26,682
Yeah.

61
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:28,203
So like a one-on-one, right.

62
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:39,109
Might be just a volunteer partnered up with the participant to help them stay focused or repeat the instructions, you know, possibly go hand over hand if necessary.

63
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:40,310
We have.

64
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:46,652
visual cues, I can make communication boards that I've used in the past.

65
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:51,977
We did also just work with Merge Consulting and had a really good training this summer.

66
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:56,181
So I've gotten a few more tools that I can access as well.

67
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:05,379
There's also accommodations if you need large writing and, you know, if you have sight issues, if you need an interpreter, you can request that.

68
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:13,263
We do ask, you know, that you give us at least two weeks notice so we can try to make our best at getting those accommodations for you.

69
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,153
I wonder, have there been any barriers to like expanding this program or like initiating?

70
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:27,238
So honestly, for me, the biggest barrier has been finding volunteers, right?

71
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:33,183
We've gotten some really, really great, passionate and driven volunteers, but in order to

72
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:38,890
bring enrollment up, I need more staff and volunteers.

73
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:45,241
And to keep the price down, we try not to use as much staff as we do volunteers.

74
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:53,517
I haven't even occurred to me, like how, yeah, the, the idea of like, where are you getting these people to help out with these accommodations?

75
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:56,238
So it's, it is like a volunteer program.

76
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:57,899
Like, how do you like recruit people?

77
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,861
Is it just kind of like, if you know about it, you show up, like what's the.

78
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:02,581
Yes.

79
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:14,707
For the volunteering, we have had a range of, you know, people we've had high school students, we've had local parents we've had, you know, retired OT and PT or.

80
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,662
a special ed teacher, things like that.

81
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:25,785
We, for the adaptive program, that is when I'm really looking for backup with volunteers.

82
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:33,829
And we send out flyers in our newsletter, reach out to some of the teachers and guidance counselors at the high school.

83
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:38,451
Cause I know a lot of the students, you know, they also need hours to graduate.

84
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:42,653
So it's a nice way to come down, help, help out, get the,

85
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:53,436
the participants to really have fun with not just like me or like these moms, like peers their age, you know, which is also really nice.

86
00:07:54,436 --> 00:08:03,919
But we also had, when we had the merge consulting, we also had a few of our volunteers who came and did the whole training with us, which was nice also.

87
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:14,430
I feel like there's a benefit to both participants, like, you know, the person who's participating and then also the volunteer like that, especially when we're talking about youth and other teens.

88
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,075
I think that's a really, that could be, I think, a really beneficial experience for them as well.

89
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:23,198
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

90
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:39,861
I'm wondering, once you are able to recruit volunteers, is there some sort of a training or like a space where folks are learning about what potential needs participants might have and how to create the best sort of experience possible?

91
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:45,974
Yeah, this past summer was the first time we had, you know, a professional training.

92
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:57,978
Having more of those in the future is definitely something that I'm looking forward to, because it's a volunteer based thing it's mostly if they can't come to the training.

93
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:14,592
It's mostly me explaining things we've done in the past, things I've learned, you know, through Merge Consulting, things I've learned from my experience from working in a special needs school, you know, just trying to make sure that everyone is

94
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:21,278
understanding of what I'm expecting and comfortable with, with what I'm requesting them to do.

95
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:35,861
Since we've started, I'd have to say with a lot of our volunteers, the consistency with our participants, like these guys are just looking forward to seeing these volunteers coming in, you know, and remember your name.

96
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:38,561
If we're at Tufts pool, they see you.

97
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,442
No, everybody's so excited.

98
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:40,942
So it's.

99
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:51,307
I thought that crosses my mind, given the work that you're doing, what are your thoughts on sort of the built environment for something like the adaptive program?

100
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,588
And you mentioned Tufts Pool.

101
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,308
There are so many parks in Medford.

102
00:09:56,488 --> 00:10:07,671
Just wondering like what your sense of access and equity and how is the city sort of responding to like various needs as far as like mobility and etc.

103
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:15,369
Yeah, the adaptive programs, you know, have definitely helped contribute to equity by allowing participants to access programs, right?

104
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:25,617
Like I said before, maybe they've never tried before or hoping to transition from non-adaptive to non-adaptive or youth athletics within our community.

105
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:32,442
But also like how I've mentioned, you know, Tufts pool, we have, because we have that facility.

106
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:45,750
like allowing to teach swim lessons, not only adaptive, right, but non-adaptive swim lessons at a very affordable price has definitely, has definitely contributed to the equity.

107
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,493
I mean, that's definitely one of our most affluent programs that we offer for $35 when, you know, it's usually up to $200.

108
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:53,794
And when I started working here, when

109
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,054
My boss Kevin mentioned swim lessons and then said $35, my jaw dropped.

110
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:10,277
I thought it was like the most amazing thing like I've ever heard.

111
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:18,623
Allowing people to access just to get in the pool and, you know, learn basic skills and safety about the pool.

112
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:22,326
It sounds like what you're saying is like, because some of these programs are

113
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:33,251
like, housed by in-city programs, it makes them more accessible to folks, like, because of cost, and just, like, being able to use city equipment and city facilities.

114
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:50,338
I have heard, though, that some of the parks, maybe this is what Shelly was saying, like, could be better set up for people that maybe have, like, physical limitations or, like, use a wheelchair, like, couldn't get, can't get, like, in and out of the parks, like, somebody who doesn't have those needs might have.

115
00:11:51,173 --> 00:12:00,016
Yeah, I think, you know, there are definitely, definitely some parks that are better than others, you know, getting Medford does have a lot of parks.

116
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:08,719
So getting around and making them all accessible is definitely going to take a little while, but we, you know, we have been.

117
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:34,423
Getting there with other facilities, like, you know, we've recently added the handicap accessible doors and the pool, you know, having the elevator for our rec center has really helped out for some of these things, even, even not even, you know, just for wheelchairs for parents with children and strollers, you know, at Lakhani rink, we just, we got some,

118
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:42,898
Ice sleds, as well as skate walkers that are also able to be accessible.

119
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:50,844
If anybody goes and asks for them, they can, you know, use them while they're at the ice rink, which is pretty cool.

120
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:57,148
I got to test out in one of the sleds, which was really a fun experience.

121
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,030
I mean, we've even used those.

122
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:02,359
walkers for our little skaters program.

123
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:17,968
And I really think, you know, we are, we are taking strides to get, you know, as inclusive as we possibly, as we possibly can, you know, it's just, there's a lot in there, you know, there, there's a lot of parks, there's a lot of facilities.

124
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:22,191
But I think, you know, I think we're doing, I think we're doing a great job.

125
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,773
And we're, we're really working hard to get to get there.

126
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:26,534
Yeah.

127
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:33,825
I so you've talked a little bit about what it's like for like sort of this connection between volunteers and participants.

128
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:40,509
And like, I can hear that that's that sounds like a pretty like, lovely thing to be able to witness and be a part of.

129
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:43,170
I wonder, is there like, so two questions?

130
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,512
Is there like a most popular program within the adaptive programs?

131
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:52,575
And is there one that maybe needs the most in terms of support and volunteers and like awareness?

132
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:55,096
So most popular, or

133
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:00,495
My participants are most popular for my volunteers.

134
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,857
I was thinking participants, but maybe the answer is participants.

135
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:04,058
Okay.

136
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,019
I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.

137
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,243
So it's probably a tough one, right?

138
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:19,090
I have had a lot of the participants, parents, guardians, caregivers, really, really love the swim lesson.

139
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:37,833
right and that's a big one you know it's hard to find some lessons getting you know getting a one a one-to-one or somebody who's willing to go in the water with you you know every every class you know sometimes rain or shine can can be tough but

140
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:46,605
We had eight last summer and this summer I had 14 in my adaptive swim lesson program.

141
00:14:47,266 --> 00:15:02,310
So I'm saying that's the most popular for parents, caregivers, guardians, but I think my kickball program ended up being one of the most popular for the participants themselves.

142
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,992
I started a kickball program last spring up at Carr Park.

143
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:27,988
And it ended up not only just the people who registered, but some local kids at the park noticed we were playing and ended up coming in and playing with us, who may have been in some of our participants' classes in school and didn't hear about it.

144
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:41,791
You know, I think that ended up being one of the most fun and parents wanted to get involved so we were able to like really, you know, teach the game itself of kickball but then also at the end kind of have like a fun.

145
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:52,032
parent, volunteers, staff, participants game, you know, and it really definitely, I think everybody had a great time.

146
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:58,735
The only downfall to that class was we had to cancel for a couple of thunderstorms, you know, it was outside.

147
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:08,240
But yeah, I think that was probably, probably one of the most, most popular, but we also run for hockey.

148
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:10,483
basketball and soccer.

149
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,304
And they know soccer was a big one that everybody loved to do.

150
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:35,229
Yeah, the imagery of that kickball class, though, it seems like, I think like, there can be this goal when you're thinking about like, adaptive sports and making things more accessible, of like, I think sometimes that can be mis- misused to sort of create this separate space for people who like, you know, aren't able to, to like participate in the more like,

151
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,711
typical ability sports, right?

152
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:57,568
And like, I think that that can get, you know, it can seem like these two separate things, but that image of that kickball game, it sounds like it both created awareness for these other students that like, these are things that everybody can participate in and sort of worked up to this more like inclusive, like this is a game we can all play together and like create that space.

153
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:58,989
I think that sounds beautiful.

154
00:16:59,049 --> 00:16:59,250
Yeah.

155
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,730
Yeah, absolutely.

156
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:28,215
And that's really the goal, not only for, like you said, people who are participating in the adaptive program, but people who are participating in non-adaptive programs and just not thinking anything when everybody's playing together, just being one and having fun and enjoying themselves and learning something new.

157
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:30,841
you

158
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:46,339
While you're speaking, and I love this sort of notion of like one people, I too appreciate the Tufts pool and love that like swimming is like a program that feels like everyone's clamoring to get a spot.

159
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,702
I voyeuristically saw on Facebook that the pool is getting some sort of maybe much needed renovation.

160
00:17:54,323 --> 00:18:01,506
Do you know if there was space for like Medford Rec and maybe other sort of stakeholders or community members to comment on what

161
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,193
whatever new look was coming.

162
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:08,474
So we needed the deck redone.

163
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:09,575
Yeah.

164
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,537
So it's not necessarily like a re... Okay.

165
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,197
So it's not as much of a revamp.

166
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:15,677
Yeah.

167
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,559
It's not really like the pool will be the same.

168
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:27,202
We just will have a nicer, safer deck and fencing around the pool.

169
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,323
We may have, you know,

170
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:35,054
Like a special feature that's coming, you know, into the waiting pool for the children.

171
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:37,056
Sounds like that.

172
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:43,161
You're all putting a lot of thought in it and into this, into this program and that there's like some careful planning going on there.

173
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:52,549
Anything that like any like hopes that you have for like expansion of the program or like, if you think about like where it's going, anything that you are hoping for?

174
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:52,649
Yeah.

175
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,492
I mean, I would hope to not have to.

176
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:11,570
Like limit my I mean I limit my intake know obviously there's always going to be a capacity of people I can bring into my programs, but I usually start off with about eight or 10 participants.

177
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:29,241
In hopes that I can find volunteers and staff, but I could end up with eight or 10 or more on my waitlist and, you know, having to turn people away because I don't have, or we don't have the access to volunteers or staff.

178
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:31,503
can be a little disheartening.

179
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:44,172
So, you know, I'm hoping, you know, as we progress and as, you know, people hear more about these programs that we can continue to increase enrollment for our adaptive programs.

180
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:51,958
And so what's the best way both for participants to like to, you know, kind of navigate the system of like making this request?

181
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:57,001
And what's also what's the best way for folks that might want to volunteer to become involved?

182
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:58,763
So there's

183
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,406
There's two ways you can go about it.

184
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:14,431
You can one, reach out to me personally at my Medford rec email, or if you go onto our website itself, you can register yourself as a volunteer.

185
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,452
We have two links.

186
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:24,335
We have like a special event volunteer link that you can register for that, or you can register for like adaptive program.

187
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:38,649
programming and then I can, each session, I can reach out via email to the people who have registered for these volunteer positions online and see if they're interested or available during that time.

188
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:46,172
And participants, the same thing, the inclusion request form is also on our website.

189
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:50,574
It's a PDF that can get filled out and emailed directly to me.

190
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,415
When you register for our programs,

191
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:58,397
Before you can pay, you get asked a question that you need to fill out.

192
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:03,198
Does the participant require any accommodations?

193
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:08,520
And if so, please go and fill out the inclusion request form.

194
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,482
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

195
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:18,984
Anything else that you were hoping to be able to share about your work or the program before you wrap up?

196
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:31,129
I mean, honestly, all of the programs that we've run in Medford, I have just had a great experience.

197
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:51,102
Seeing children in any of our programs go from, you know, sitting in the back corner, possibly not comfortable, to the third class, you know, running in, grabbing their soccer ball and showing, you know, showing their parents

198
00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:02,127
what they can do or, you know, being at the hockey rink and seeing somebody who's never ice skated before, right?

199
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:10,493
Get out on the ice during our open skate times or our, you know, our half day free skate for the kids.

200
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:13,876
You know, it's really just,

201
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:23,795
Very nice to come to work and see a lot of happy people and people transitioning out of their comfort zone.

202
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:27,580
It's, it's been, it's been a great experience so far.

203
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,801
Sounds great.

204
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,983
And it's really nice to know about all these programs.

205
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,546
I don't think I did know so much about them before this.

206
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,949
So thank you for, thank you for doing it.

207
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,090
And thank you for sharing with us.

208
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:41,549
Well, our, our programs actually begin September 19.

209
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:48,193
There's a few that are in fact sold out but we definitely still have a few more available from adult.

210
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:58,939
basketball to puddle stompers and inclusion sports, which is another great vendor that we bring in.

211
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,808
So if anybody is still trying to register for programs, you've got till September 19th.

212
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:08,910
Sounds good.

213
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,110
Yeah.

214
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:14,856
Okay, thank you so much and I look forward to seeing some of this stuff in action.

215
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:23,005
I would also like to thank all of my participants, volunteers, and staff that have also helped make our program so successful.

216
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,688
Great, well thanks so much.

217
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,330
Yeah, thank you.
