President Caviello?

00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,189
All rise and please salute the flag.

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:50,455
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,896
Thank you everybody for being here tonight.

20
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:58,738
Tonight, I'm going to let you know right up front, we are going to enforce council rules of ten minutes of speaking.

21
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:02,419
And no more than twice coming up to speak on the same subject.

22
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:08,140
We have a lot of people here, so everyone that wants to speak will get an opportunity to speak.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,260
Thank you.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:22,042
And we have some quicker things we want to do first, a couple of common pictures, small things, so we can get those people out of here and concentrate on what the bigger crowd is here for.

25
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:23,462
All right.

26
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,583
Motion to suspend on the rules?

27
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:27,663
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up

28
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:34,251
17570, 17571, convictionless petitions.

29
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,372
That's it.

30
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:45,697
Okay, petition, common evictor license by Christina Pianfanas, 1776 Hudson Street, number one, Summerville, Mass.

31
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:50,879
Doing business at Semolina, 572 Boston Ave, Medford, Mass.

32
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,000
The petition is present.

33
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,113
Councilor Scott Pelli, who is the licensing chairman.

34
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,155
Thank you, Mr. President.

35
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:03,897
Welcome.

36
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:08,399
I see that all the paperwork is in order.

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,064
Can you just give us a brief description of the business that we're presenting to us tonight?

38
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:21,808
It's a restaurant, but we also, our business in

39
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:39,104
Davis Square is a market, a specialty grocery, so it's gonna be a small market, but also we have a full liquor license with a full bar, so at Dave's, we have a wine shop, so instead of that, we're gonna have a bar and a restaurant.

40
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:50,468
We're gonna be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, open at seven in the morning, Monday through Friday, until 10 or so at night, and then closed on Sundays.

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,446
Okay, so the report calls that you're closing out, your hours are from what time to what time?

42
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:05,913
We're gonna be open at seven in the morning, and then we'll probably close somewhere around nine or 10, depending on the night, maybe.

43
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,094
Okay, but the permit reads.

44
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:10,918
You're allowed 11.

45
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,419
The hours of operation is 11, so.

46
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:13,600
Right.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,920
Yeah.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,382
Okay, so you know that.

49
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,963
Read that along.

50
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:17,363
Yeah.

51
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:25,851
Okay, I see all the departments have checked off, Mr. President.

52
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:28,072
Everything looks like it's in order.

53
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,895
I move to accept and place on file.

54
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,036
Mr. President.

55
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:33,457
Councilor Naito.

56
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:37,870
Mr. President, this is something I'm very excited about this evening.

57
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:47,139
This is something that's been in the works for quite a bit of time when the Brown and Blue coffee shop was removed and we've seen Dave's Fresh Pasta on Holland Street that's been very successful.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,682
That's a very successful business over there in Somerville.

59
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,645
They run for their money, but I don't want to let anybody know that out here.

60
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:58,587
But I think that this is going to be a great addition to the community, Mr. President.

61
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,289
And I, for one, feel as though this is something that should be supported this evening, and I'll move for approval to pay for it.

62
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,629
Thank you.

63
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,750
Councilor Del Rosso.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,113
Mr. President, there was great enthusiasm with the significant outpouring of support.

65
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:17,705
on various phases of this project and for the licensing that was granted as well, Mr. President.

66
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,151
So I also lend my voice of approval to this.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,300
Council Member Kern.

68
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,081
Thank you President Caviello.

69
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:28,464
Could you just let us know how many people, patrons, you'll be able to serve at one time?

70
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,085
How many seats are there?

71
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:36,968
We have about 60 to 63 seats inside as of now.

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,210
We don't want it to be too crowded, so we're keeping it comfortable.

73
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:45,333
And we will have some outdoor seating eventually, but we're not quite there yet.

74
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,774
We've got to get it open first.

75
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,889
And can you give us a time frame of when you think you'll be open?

76
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,270
The outdoor?

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,132
Oh, just when you'll be open in general so the public knows.

78
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:56,578
Well, we wanted to open tomorrow morning, but we're not quite ready.

79
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:57,879
So we're thinking Thursday morning.

80
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,461
We're going to open in stages.

81
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:03,206
We're going to start with breakfast and then add the other things as we get comfortable.

82
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:11,593
We're hoping to be fully running before the students come back, because Tufts is our landlord, and they will come, so we want to be ready for them.

83
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,335
Do you have the voucher program with Tufts University?

84
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:14,856
No.

85
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,658
We're not part of dining services or anything.

86
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:18,719
They're just our landlord.

87
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,961
I wish you good luck.

88
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,041
Thank you very much.

89
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,503
Appreciate the support.

90
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,293
Move the motion by Councilor Scott Pelly.

91
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,074
Seconded.

92
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:28,636
Seconded by Councilor Locario.

93
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,277
All those in favor?

94
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:29,737
Aye.

95
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,079
Motion passes.

96
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:31,940
Congratulations.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,183
Hope to see you one day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner or all of the above.

98
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:36,965
Thank you.

99
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,551
Okay, 17571, petition for a common fixture license by Deepak Kachayapati.

100
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:51,652
50 Barrett Street, Malden, Mass.

101
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:57,393
02148 for Malden Bazaar, LLC doing business as City Bazaar.

102
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:58,693
Counselor Scott Pelly.

103
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,614
Is the petitioner here?

104
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:05,574
I thought I saw him here.

105
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:16,668
He's in room B. They can hear you in there, so may I call his name?

106
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,590
Larry, can you just go in there and see if he's there?

107
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,671
I thought he said he was here.

108
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:38,743
Also, I want to inform everybody that this meeting is being taped for a later broadcast, but it is also being filmed by another private person, so if anyone has any objections to that, please let me know.

109
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,145
Okay, motion to table.

110
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:40,945
All those in favor?

111
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,026
Aye.

112
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:41,786
Motion is tabled.

113
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:53,470
Which one are we doing next, the science?

114
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:53,670
PPA.

115
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:53,951
PPA.

116
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,251
Okay.

117
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:54,931
Mr. President.

118
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,972
Hold up.

119
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:59,274
Yeah, we have one person here for the monopole.

120
00:06:59,294 --> 00:06:59,834
We'll get to you.

121
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:04,077
There may be a few people there.

122
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:04,557
Yeah.

123
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:11,141
17567, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the MBTA proposed cellular towers be discussed.

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:11,801
Counselor Mox.

125
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,663
Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,884
I offered this resolution several months back.

127
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:27,711
When I found out of the proposal, the MBTA was looking to install 375-foot towers throughout 60 communities along the rail line.

128
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:41,637
And at that time, Mr. President, the council asked that we have a meeting with the MBTA to discuss some of the issues that naturally we would know residents would have.

129
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:50,463
One of the polls — actually, both of the polls are located in residential neighborhoods that abut railroad lines.

130
00:07:51,323 --> 00:08:08,835
And knowing that, Mr. President, the council asked that we meet with the MBTA to look at whether or not the MBTA can cancel the contract they have currently now with BAI Communications and allow for public input.

131
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:13,098
which, to date, there has been very little, if any, public input.

132
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:30,872
And I know some residents from the Tyler Ave area reached out to this council and requested that we give them the ability to speak before the council with some of their concerns, and I requested City Solicitor Mark Rumley, who I believe is here tonight,

133
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,854
He is here tonight to be present if he can answer any questions.

134
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:49,884
But as of Friday, June 30th, the T did announce that they were going to take a step back and conduct a 30-day assessment of the project, which involved, as I mentioned, 375-foot towers in 60 communities.

135
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:56,368
The T also went on to say there will be no construction of poles or other infrastructure during this review.

136
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:02,472
which will include comments and other feedback from customers, elected and appointed officials, and residents.

137
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:10,058
A presentation of the status of the project will be given to the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board at an upcoming meeting.

138
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,764
And I would ask, Mr. President, at this time that we hear from residents that are here regarding this particular poll.

139
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,226
and the impact it's going to have on the neighborhood.

140
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:34,177
I also wanted to mention that this council did write a letter regarding historic property that are located within this, I forget the distance, I think it's a half a mile or one mile from the pole.

141
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:42,084
And we did write a letter stating that we were in opposition of these particular sites, Mr. President.

142
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,245
But at this time, I know there's a few residents here.

143
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,987
If you'd like to come forward.

144
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:01,652
Good evening.

145
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,253
Name and address of the record please.

146
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,154
Good evening.

147
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:05,495
My name is Carol Brown.

148
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:11,581
I'm on 67 Tyler Ave and I want to thank the members of the City Council for

149
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:21,348
Taking all of my emails and responding and I want to thank you again I've done it a couple of times and you're all really great about it, especially for the files.

150
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:27,913
I thank you I've been a 33 year resident of Medford in West Medford.

151
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:34,658
It's a wonderful community I can tell you from the the price of houses.

152
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,100
Everybody loves our community and

153
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:50,889
I know the T and the commuter rail are a big important part of our community and the value of the houses, but I have to say that I have a few concerns.

154
00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:03,317
First and foremost, I know there's a need for technology, but I feel that the T kind of snuck everything in through the back door.

155
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,999
I only learned about this maybe

156
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:22,073
20, 30 days ago, and it was from a neighbor who was approached by a person who offered money for them to go down their property to put up the pole, which everybody in the neighborhood then started to hear about it.

157
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,535
So that then gets me a little concerned.

158
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:31,261
And I know Manchester-by-the-Sea and Andover are other communities who are being impacted by this.

159
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:40,106
It just seems that Medford is, you know, I hate to say it, but we're the poor relation, and they're going to just kind of barrel it through.

160
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:50,232
And the concerns of some of the people that are on vacation that I'm also speaking for, one, of course, is health concerns, because we're not sure what all of this is going to do or be.

161
00:11:52,593 --> 00:12:07,278
And then I walked the neighborhood and Saltonstall and Grove Street, right at the bridge that goes over the T line, all the trees have just been, they're bald.

162
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,780
So they're moving forward, whether they say they are or not, they have just taken line of sight limbs down.

163
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,481
There's mounds of fresh,

164
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,723
sawdust from when they took the limbs.

165
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:27,009
They put up a meter machine, but they haven't put the meter in yet.

166
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,252
They put in a new gate, some new locks.

167
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:34,215
So there's a lot going on that nobody else is apparently telling you.

168
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:45,364
So from that point of view, if they've taken down all those trees, my question is, if they put up this 70-odd foot pole, are they going to wipe out all the trees that are the only

169
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:53,207
small amount of hiding an enormous tree, which is like two telephone poles tall, which is really big.

170
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,047
So if you take out all the trees, it's much more obvious.

171
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,388
Is it a health concern?

172
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:04,569
And what's it going to do for the property value of us in that area with this giant pole?

173
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,750
You know, it's a question.

174
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,472
So, those are my concerns.

175
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:14,157
And if they're going to put up a tree or a pole, can they make it look like a tree?

176
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:19,162
You know, some of the highways, you see those poles and they've got all the little limbs coming out of it.

177
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:22,485
Can they at least, you know, kind of sort of pretend it isn't what it is?

178
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:26,488
So I appreciate your time and looking into this.

179
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:33,833
And I think the 30 days all well and good, but I think they're moving forward given all the limbs they've taken down.

180
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:36,375
So that's our concern.

181
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:37,736
Thank you very much.

182
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:38,517
Thank you.

183
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,960
Council Member Kern.

184
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:43,335
I'm not sure.

185
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,436
Thank you, President Carviel.

186
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:52,318
I'm not sure if Councilor Marks or our city solicitor who has been involved with this, thankfully, can give us a little bit more detail with regards to the 30 days.

187
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,439
I know- Mr. Rumbly, I see you in the audience here.

188
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,420
Would you like to lend us your input?

189
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:03,381
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,142
Kind of like a grand jury, you get a chair.

191
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:23,709
There's really, what was just spoken, what was just stated by the citizen, I'm sorry I didn't get your name, is quite accurate, actually.

192
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:34,651
There's a 30-day period which the management board of the T has decided to react to the groundswell of opposition, which is coming not only from Medford, but from many different cities and towns.

193
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:39,652
And whether or not that will be continued or not, right now, would be a matter of speculation.

194
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:40,892
We don't know.

195
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:47,514
But the points that were being made about property value, about placement, they're all relevant and they're all prudent concerns.

196
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:59,079
For example, just to take the last one first, there are poles that are erected at various places around greater Boston that are made to masquerade other things, one of which is a tree.

197
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,640
That would be a good idea.

198
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,102
But you're not going to get to the good idea unless you have some dialogue with the people whose property it affects.

199
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:10,425
The second thing is the placement of the polls.

200
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:18,273
As Councilor Marks has stated, they are at least in two residential areas, but there are actually three in Medford.

201
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,194
The other one is in the Wellington area.

202
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,436
So the placement of the polls, is it

203
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:28,021
necessarily so that the places that they've chosen are the best places.

204
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:37,770
Are there other places that maybe are not owned by the MTA that might serve the purpose just as well, which wouldn't have the same impact on residential areas?

205
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,732
And there are a number of other concerns.

206
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:54,837
For example, the initial plan, as I know the council knows and maybe the citizens don't, the initial plans were for poles that were not as high as the 73-foot poles that are presently planned.

207
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,778
The original ones were much smaller than that.

208
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:00,239
And it begs the question, why was that abandoned?

209
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:16,737
So, in the time that the council has generated concerns and questions about this, which they have, and the mayor has also, her communication to the T went out on that very day that Councilor Marks talked about, June 30th.

210
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:27,460
With all of the groundswell of opposition to this, there is a necessity for dialogue and conversation, because otherwise, the first statement that was made by the resident is the accurate one.

211
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,903
It would seem to be something that's simply being forced on people.

212
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:39,611
And something which is forced on people runs against the grain of not only good government, but also courtesy and good citizenship.

213
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:47,338
So there's not a lot to report because we're in that window, but I would encourage anyone who has some interest in voicing their

214
00:16:47,838 --> 00:17:06,807
opinion or voicing their concerns about this to contact especially the state delegation so that they can also relay that to the officials at the T and that there can be a higher level of communication and dialogue than there has been to date, because that's what's necessary in order for there to be any progress on this issue.

215
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,928
Thank you, Mr. Solis.

216
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:16,451
Through the chair, you said there is need and they realize the need for a conversation with the neighbors in the city.

217
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:22,019
So within that 30-day period, is there any meeting scheduled, or we just don't know yet?

218
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,280
There aren't any meetings scheduled in Medford.

219
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,081
I know that much.

220
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,103
And that hasn't been for lack of trying.

221
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:37,711
This council and the mayor have made, and I have, for the council, made repeated inquiries to the T to have a representative talk to us in any form they'd like.

222
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:41,794
Not necessarily at a council meeting, but in any form, if they'd like to come out to Medford.

223
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,195
And honestly, the response hasn't been no.

224
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:45,977
There's been no response.

225
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:50,078
I want to thank the solicitor for listening to our concerns.

226
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:58,385
I know he's very busy, but I've seen the dialogue back and forth with you and the TEA, and I've gotten a number of complaints, especially from the Tyler Ave.

227
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:08,082
residents and you know it's a concern of ours and hopefully we can get a seat at the table with our residents to discuss the concerns that they have.

228
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:08,762
I agree.

229
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:09,143
Thank you.

230
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:10,003
Counselor Knight.

231
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,546
Mr. President thank you very much and Mr. Solicitor thank you for being here this evening.

232
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:24,614
If you'd be so kind to explain a little bit about the background and why the MBTA has taken the position that local zoning laws won't control the height of the tower and so on.

233
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,776
I'd be happy to explain that and I know that many of you be

234
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:29,477
I was going to say behind the rail.

235
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,237
I know what the answer to this is.

236
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:35,419
But part of it goes back to a case that came out of Somerville a few years back.

237
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,921
If you drive down the 93, you'll see a billboard which is on top of or placed on MBTA property.

238
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,142
There was objection to that billboard when it was constructed.

239
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:56,006
The matter went through court and the courts decided that in that instance that the MBTA on their own property would be exempt from local zoning regulations.

240
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,267
Now, that would still be true if they were to build on their own property in Medford.

241
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:08,548
However, that denies the issue of whether or not there are better places to put these poles which may not be on MBTA property.

242
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:20,391
For example, and I haven't done any homework on this, is there property owned by the City of Medford where it would be better placed as opposed to right along the tracks on MBTA property that could serve the same purpose?

243
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:25,312
Because the purpose of these poles is to benefit their ridership with Wi-Fi and all that.

244
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,453
But there are other concerns, too.

245
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:31,934
And this one is also one that's relevant to the billboard case in Somerville.

246
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:44,939
These towers, these towers always have a placement for other companies to put their, I don't know what they're called, radio equipment, wireless equipment on the tower.

247
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,059
And they would be doing that for profit.

248
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,022
Now, that argument came up in the Somerville billboard case, and the opponent said,

249
00:19:54,722 --> 00:20:05,353
If the T is going to have a billboard and they're going to make a profit from the billboard, then that should affect negatively, that is, it should affect their ability to have a zoning exemption.

250
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:11,460
In other words, if they're going to engage in a for-profit activity, they should lose the benefit of the zoning exemption.

251
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:16,785
However, the court said, in so many words, we all know that the T needs money.

252
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,508
So, but there's a concern there, too.

253
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:31,197
Now, if they were to construct a tower, which maybe looked like a tree or something like that, it would be less onerous if they were selling spots on that to private companies for Wi-Fi purposes.

254
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,059
But those are issues that came up in the Somerville case.

255
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,880
Vice President Mox.

256
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,201
Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:46,886
And the council, as you know, Mr. Solicitor, is currently working on a city ordinance to address the cell tower issue.

258
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:47,226
Yes.

259
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:56,411
I agree with you that because the MBTA has their own private property, city ordinance or regulation will have no bearing on what they do on their own property.

260
00:20:56,952 --> 00:21:01,675
However, in the community right now, we only regulate TV and radio antennas.

261
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:10,138
So, under the city ordinance right now, if someone wanted to erect a cell tower, there are no provisions within our regulations that would govern that.

262
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:27,405
And I'm hoping that this body, and I know we've already drafted and met with you and so forth, that we put in a regulation that governs cell towers and prohibits them in any area but industrial and commercial zoned areas.

263
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:40,773
And I think that will go a long way to ensure residents that someday a cell tower won't pop up on private property, could be your next door neighbor, without having some oversight by this government.

264
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:46,337
And I know that's hopefully within the next several months will be ordained by this council.

265
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:53,289
Yes, and just to speak very briefly on that, this council has brought forth that draft which had been done at a prior time.

266
00:21:53,709 --> 00:22:15,657
We've already had one meeting on it, and it would fill a hole which presently exists in our zoning ordinance in a very beneficial way, because without this proposed ordinance, there's a possibility that this same type of concern could rise up in different incarnations throughout other areas of Medford, and this proposed ordinance would go a long way to address that.

267
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:16,932
Thank you.

268
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:17,793
Thank you for coming tonight.

269
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:18,954
Thank you.

270
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:19,695
Any further questions?

271
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:21,556
Thank you, Mr. President.

272
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:25,099
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place in file.

273
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:25,880
All those in favor?

274
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,220
Aye.

275
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,363
Motion passes.

276
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:39,691
17-580, request for an expenditure from the Law Department claims over $1,000 from accounts 1010151572.

277
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:43,995
Present members of the Honorable City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

278
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:51,798
We have, is the solicitors here, if you could stay while you're here?

279
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,379
We have a claimant.

280
00:22:53,819 --> 00:23:02,182
Claimant's name is J. Craig and Charity Roddy, file 69, date of accident was June 7th, 2016, date of settlement June 28th, 2017, request 7500.

281
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:04,804
And Mr. Clerk, would you like to elaborate on that?

282
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,348
Just very briefly, this is a water claim.

283
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,789
There was a blockage in the city line.

284
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:24,133
It caused some damage to property owned by the claimants on Sylvia Road.

285
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,755
You can see that their damages were actually in excess of $7,500.

286
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:33,718
That's because there were some elements of what they were claiming which really weren't part of the water claim.

287
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,683
The DPW water department went out to quell the rising water.

288
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,645
They weren't able to do it at the first manhole that they got to.

289
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:46,488
They were at the second, but by that time, substantial damage was done.

290
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:51,592
So we reached an accord on a $15,000 claim to settle it for $7,500.

291
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,934
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

292
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,355
Any more questions for the clerk on this?

293
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:57,497
Okay, Mr. Clerk.

294
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,858
Move approval.

295
00:23:59,018 --> 00:23:59,539
Move approval.

296
00:23:59,819 --> 00:23:59,959
Second.

297
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,081
By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

298
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,582
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

299
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,383
Councilor DelaRusso?

300
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:06,863
Yes.

301
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,204
Councilor Falco?

302
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:08,564
Yes.

303
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:09,625
Councilor Knight?

304
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:10,666
Yes.

305
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:12,287
Councilor McKern?

306
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:12,547
Yes.

307
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:13,808
Vice President Marks?

308
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:14,108
Yes.

309
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:15,429
Councilor Scott Kelly?

310
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:15,830
Yes.

311
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,271
President Caviello?

312
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:17,791
Yes.

313
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,774
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

314
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,417
17-583, to the Honorable President of Memphis City Council.

315
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:41,019
Dear Mr. President of the City Councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve on the recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee of the Community Preservation Fund Revenue with the amount of $1,428,649.

316
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:56,811
In addition, I respectfully request that your honorable body approve the recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, the Community Preservation Fund Expenditures in the amount of $1,428,649.

317
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:01,334
Open space, 142,865.

318
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,054
Community housing, 142,865.

319
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,075
Historic preservation, 142,865.

320
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,175
Administration, 71,433.

321
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:07,156
General remainder of the fund will be 928,621 dollars for a total of 1,428,649.

322
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:07,796
Questions?

323
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,510
To the chair.

324
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,791
Councilwoman, go ahead.

325
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:40,377
I just want to point out that we did meet in Committee of the Whole this evening to discuss with the commission, the Community Preservation Commission, the details of this.

326
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:50,225
I know that a lot of it's formulated through state law, so I don't know if anybody wants to just give a brief synopsis before we take a vote.

327
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,306
I think Roberta Cameron's here?

328
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:51,826
Yes.

329
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:58,972
Thank you very much.

330
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:18,557
So what we are asking for this evening is to appropriate the budget for fiscal year FY18, and we are asking for the minimum appropriation to be placed in reserve for each of the program areas.

331
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:24,259
That is affordable housing, open space and recreation, and historic preservation.

332
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:42,454
And the maximum amount that can be set aside for administrative expenses, which is 5% of the annual revenue, and the remainder to be transferred to the undesignated reserve, that is that it can be spent in any of the program areas.

333
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:50,120
And the administrative funds, if they're not used in this fiscal year, will be returned to the program area fund.

334
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:59,014
And then, if I could just follow up, I asked in Committee of the Whole, but I think the public would like to know the time frame, so go over it, or you probably have an answer.

335
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:14,940
So the Community Preservation Commission has been meeting now for two months, and we are in the process of preparing a plan that will enable us to know what the needs, opportunities, and priorities are for the city of Medford.

336
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:20,767
The planning process entails a significant outreach process.

337
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:31,480
We're looking at visiting approximately 30 boards and commissions and stakeholder groups individually, as well as holding two public forums that will take place in October.

338
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:45,093
We will provide as much publicity as we can to try to get as much input as we can from the people of Medford about what we would like to see the CPA funds going toward.

339
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:53,881
And the community preservation plan is supposed to, we aim to have it completed in November.

340
00:27:54,622 --> 00:28:11,831
so that we can begin to set up a grant application process over the winter and be able to receive grants, consider the different options, and provide a set of recommendations for the first funding round in spring next year.

341
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:13,912
Thank you.

342
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:15,193
Councilor Scarpelli.

343
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,474
I'm also, thank you.

344
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:18,355
Any further questions?

345
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:21,964
On the motion by?

346
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:26,366
Just publicly thank the committee for their hard work.

347
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:30,928
Meeting every other week for a few months takes a lot from your families and we appreciate it.

348
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:35,611
Whether for or against the CPA, you've worked very hard and it doesn't go unnoticed.

349
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:36,411
Thank you.

350
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:37,632
On the motion.

351
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,834
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

352
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:42,495
All those in favor?

353
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:42,875
Aye.

354
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,676
Roll call is required.

355
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:48,406
Councilor DelaRusso?

356
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:48,827
Yes.

357
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:50,288
Councilor Falco?

358
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:50,549
Yes.

359
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:51,590
Councilor Knight?

360
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,950
Yes.

361
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:53,372
Councilor Long-Term?

362
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:53,672
Yes.

363
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:54,874
Vice-President Montz?

364
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:55,194
Yes.

365
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:56,356
Councilor Scarpelli?

366
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:56,616
Yes.

367
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:57,897
President Caviello?

368
00:28:57,998 --> 00:28:58,238
Yes.

369
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,541
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

370
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,943
Motion passes.

371
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,906
17-572, petition for a sign denial.

372
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,247
Reversal by Brian.

373
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:21,821
Dugdale, Goulston and Sturs for a Methodist Associates LLC, owner of Meadow Glen Mall 3850, Mystic Valley Parkway, OCD Applications, 201710A-201710P, excessive signage number inside.

374
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:25,284
Vice President Mox, who is the chairman of the signing committee.

375
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:30,184
Mr. President, I believe we have the petitioners before us tonight.

376
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:31,024
I believe we do.

377
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:33,486
If they can give a brief presentation and a synopsis.

378
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,786
Name and address of the record, please.

379
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:35,267
Certainly.

380
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,829
John Tuig, New England Development, 75 Park Plaza, Boston.

381
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,950
I'm going to speak just for a minute.

382
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,752
Brian Dugdale, who filed the petition, is to my left.

383
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,993
Paul Sincotta from New England Development.

384
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:50,155
Just because of the tightness of the room, we do have a few plans we'll set up.

385
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:53,257
And maybe I'll just give a very brief overview before we

386
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:59,962
We are enforcing the council rules of ten minutes, so if you could keep your time in ten minutes, I'd be appreciative.

387
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:00,543
Absolutely true.

388
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:01,944
We certainly will.

389
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:03,245
We're very excited.

390
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:07,128
I think as people know, Medical Inn Mall has been proceeding in redevelopment.

391
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:10,111
Just a little bit of background on the signage.

392
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:12,772
We looked at all the signage that was on the mall today.

393
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:18,674
We thought about opportunities to be able to keep it within that sort of total square footage.

394
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:26,938
The mall is significantly, I think as you know, set back from Locust Street, and it is a corner parcel.

395
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:31,060
So I think, Paul, they're motioning for us to bring it up towards the front.

396
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,642
A little bit of the history, I think everybody knows the council did approve this in the 1970s.

397
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,183
We are bringing in a Wegmans and a Dix.

398
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:44,525
What our thought would be, would very briefly touch on what the existing mall signage and what we've proposed.

399
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:48,107
We're going to show it, there are 16 total signs if you have all the tenants.

400
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:58,849
Rather than go sign by sign, item by item, we'll never finish in ten minutes, we're going to try to show it to you in a comprehensive way, where the signs are, how the package comes forward.

401
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:05,251
Just by a little bit of background, we expect that the Dicks and the Petco will be opening in September and the Wegmans in November of 2017.

402
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:12,012
So the picture that you see up there is what we're proposing to show for the Wegmans.

403
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,113
You'll see the Dicks on the left, the Coles on the right.

404
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,095
And that is our proposed signage.

405
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:24,659
And the plan that Paul has underneath him is one of the plans that we filed, which showed actually all of the signs.

406
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,202
If you start on the left, the Marshalls sign, the Petco.

407
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:33,145
We were before, Mr. President, the council to get the Petco for the use allowed a while back.

408
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,927
There's the Dick's next door, the Wegmans sign, and then the Coles.

409
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:43,750
And then on the side, on the Parkway side, we have one sign, which is Coles, and then signs for the others.

410
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:50,774
But just to give you a sense of how we approach this, the Meadow Glen Mall sign, for example, on the Parkway, is about 1,530 square feet.

411
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:55,097
When you add all the signs up that we're putting on that side, we're a little over 400 square feet.

412
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,338
So we did approach it with a sensitivity to

413
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:04,705
the amount of signage, but also remembering we're anywhere from 250 to 400 feet off of the roadway.

414
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:11,551
And these are all signage that are typical for this type of tenant, typical for this type of location.

415
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:14,835
And underneath, and Paul's going to run out of hands,

416
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:37,754
that he has, but a little bit of the detail where you can see, again, Marshall's on the left, appreciate the fanning, the Petco in the middle, then over to Dick's, the Wegmans sign, and then you can see along the parkway, what Cole's sign exists there today, the Meadow Glen Mall sign will go away, which was a large sign, and then just have some directional signs, because we are in the corner.

417
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:40,414
And that's how it is situated.

418
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:41,835
So we'll stop there.

419
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm certainly available to answer any questions from the council or any of the members or certainly the chairman of the subcommittee.

420
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,017
Thank you.

421
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:53,457
Councilor DelaRusso.

422
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:54,557
Mr. President, thank you.

423
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:06,360
Are you aware of anybody expressing any opposition to this schema other than that it's in some spots not conforming according to our code?

424
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:06,980
We are not.

425
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:09,654
Mr. President, are you, if I could?

426
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:11,000
I am fine with that, Mr. President.

427
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,004
Thank you, Mr. President.

428
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:24,454
With regards to the lighting in, you know, the residence, I guess you're not really hitting any residence, but is there a time frame where the lighting will be shut off?

429
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:31,058
It certainly, the advantage we have in this site is because, again, we're anywhere from 250 to 400 feet back off of Locust.

430
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,219
We don't really impact residences.

431
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:39,142
I mean, certainly there are some condominium folks behind us, but they're behind us.

432
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,864
And the only things we have in the back are a couple of small packet lights at the loading docks.

433
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:50,026
There's no signage there, so we are uniquely situated here from a neighborhood perspective.

434
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:54,107
We really aren't near residents and certainly not single family or multifamily.

435
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:54,847
Thank you.

436
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:55,788
Counselor Knight.

437
00:33:56,508 --> 00:34:01,289
Mr. President, I certainly feel comfortable supporting the majority of the signs here this evening.

438
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,771
I think that this falls in line with some of the work that we've done in the past at the Felsway Plaza.

439
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:10,312
We've approved some signs at the Felsway Plaza that actually enhanced the way that the

440
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,198
And I think that these signs will do the same thing.

441
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:19,551
I certainly have no problem with the signs that are advertising particular businesses, Mr. President, but I do have a problem with sign K.

442
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:22,687
And Sign K isn't advertising a particular business.

443
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,009
Sign K is advertising wine, liquor, and beer.

444
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:33,214
It's going to be located directly across the street from our skating rink, directly across the street from Honell Stadium, and directly across the street from the campus of the McGlynn Andrews School.

445
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:42,800
So with that being said, I certainly would support this evening approval of the 15 signs, but I myself personally can't support Sign K. It's not something that's advertising a store.

446
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,801
It's advertising a product that's sold inside a store.

447
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:49,564
And I think that that is really not the intent of our sign bylaw.

448
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:58,108
So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem supporting the 15 other signs, but I'd move for approval of all signs except the sign K at this point in time.

449
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,329
Mr. President, through you, just to speak to that.

450
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:10,353
As you see often in even stop and shop signs, you will see that they'll have five or six signs along which advertise whether it be a bakery, pharmacy, other activities.

451
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:16,296
I think the council's aware and certainly gone through licensing that Wegmans does and it's a big part of their business.

452
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:18,938
They provide alcohol.

453
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,240
It's anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet.

454
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,025
They provide at very advantageous prices, and it's a big point in selling the Wegmans experience.

455
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:30,527
We do advertise in a store that size.

456
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,749
We have over 100,000 square feet.

457
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:39,795
The amount of activities and the different offerings, that's why all of the major folks who have that size store do have the smaller size.

458
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,236
You have it existing here in Medford.

459
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:44,757
We would ask that the council consider that sign.

460
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:46,118
It's a very big part of their business.

461
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,320
They have gone through the processing here.

462
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,522
For the licensure to have that ability to be able to sell that, so we would ask the council's support on that sign.

463
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,443
Certainly, respectfully, I understand.

464
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:58,563
I understand where I'm coming from.

465
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:01,184
It doesn't say turkey, steak, and potatoes either, you know what I mean?

466
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,745
That's a big part of Wegmans business too.

467
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:05,266
Absolutely, I understand.

468
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,687
But I did want you to know that that was a

469
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:13,370
a very significant part of what they're doing, and why they do it, and why, for example, if you go to the Stop and Shop here in Bedford, you'll see those signs too.

470
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:17,692
Mr. Chairman?

471
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:26,456
Mr. President, past practice would indicate that this be sent to the Subcommittee on Business, Economic Development, and Science.

472
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:36,080
You know, if the Council has a problem with one particular sign, I have no problem sending that one particular sign, or if the Council wants to review the entire project.

473
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,726
Like I said, I can live with 15 out of the 16 in 30 seconds, but 16 out of the 16, I can't do.

474
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,067
So if we want to exclude a particular sign.

475
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:57,002
So I would make a recommendation, Mr. President, that all signs be approved except for the sign that indicates beer and wine, and that that sign be sent to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee for further discussion.

476
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:03,500
On the motion by Vice President Mox, Chairman of the Sine Committee, seconded by?

477
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,781
Second.

478
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,183
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

479
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,344
All those in favor?

480
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,004
Aye.

481
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,285
Motion passes.

482
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,526
Mr. President, thank you very much.

483
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:15,249
We'll send you a notification for that, for the Sine Committee.

484
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,610
Thank you.

485
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:16,990
Thank you.

486
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,271
Thank you.

487
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:25,700
15, 573, petition for signed denial of reversal by Rafael Batista for global health care services.

488
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,923
5 High Street, Medford, OCD application, 2017 9A.

489
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:37,246
Number of signs in 2017 9A exceeds allowable number of signs.

490
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:40,987
Vice President Mox, Chairman of the Signing Committee.

491
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,468
Thank you, Mr. President.

492
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,689
Is Rafael Batista here tonight?

493
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:45,169
Yes, I am.

494
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,309
Mr. President, if I could.

495
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,332
The Subcommittee of Business, Economic Development, and Science met on Thursday, July 13th at 5 p.m.

496
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:16,258
for the purpose of discussing three signed denial petitions, of which one, paper 7-450, was one that was brought up by the committee, and there wasn't a representative there at the time from Global.

497
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:21,001
And, um, we ask that we receive this paper and place it on file.

498
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:34,049
So, at this time, Mr. President, I would recommend that, uh, this particular paper be sent back to the Business and Economic Development, right, the new one, correct, uh, for review of the, uh, Business and Economic Development and Assignment Committee.

499
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,371
On the motion by Councilor Max, Vice President, uh, Councilor De La Ruza.

500
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:40,673
On that motion, Mr. President, I'm particularly concerned about this.

501
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:50,339
new configuration that seems to be contrary to the hearsay we have received regarding the policy of the landlord.

502
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,325
The landlord has never materialized or participated in any of our discussions regarding these signs which are non-conforming.

503
00:38:58,825 --> 00:38:59,686
on this property.

504
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:09,053
I respectfully request that in addition to the petitioner that the landlord, the person who makes the decisions about that property, be present at the meeting.

505
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:14,517
Mr. Clark, could you please note that and have and make sure that he is invited to the next meeting.

506
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:16,018
On the motion by

507
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:21,725
Vice President Mox, that it be sent to subcommittee, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

508
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:23,766
Before the roll is called, may I ask a question?

509
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:28,569
Through the chair, can you tell me when you opened or when you plan on opening?

510
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,251
Global Healthcare?

511
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:30,551
Yes.

512
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:35,414
Actually, we have Mr. Enoch, he is the owner of Global, he is here with us tonight.

513
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,676
They are open right now.

514
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:38,556
They are open.

515
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:40,518
They are open.

516
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:48,791
I mean, I feel like they've, just personal opinion, I think they've changed the scheme to make it conform.

517
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,333
The landlord has asked not to above that line.

518
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:55,154
So we need the landlord.

519
00:39:55,214 --> 00:40:00,357
Otherwise I think the signs look good and hopefully we can get this done for the petitioner sooner than later.

520
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:07,082
On the motion by Vice President Mock, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

521
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:07,802
All those in favor?

522
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:08,202
Aye.

523
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:08,623
Aye.

524
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:09,803
Motion passes.

525
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:12,045
This has been referred back to the subcommittee.

526
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,187
You will be notified of that meeting.

527
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:21,391
So we're not allowed to, excuse me, we're not allowed to do the signing yet until we get the meeting, is that correct?

528
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:21,871
That's correct.

529
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:24,212
Thank you.

530
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:24,212
17, 576.

531
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:48,864
Dear Mr. President, members of the city council, the city of Medford intends to enter into a power purchase agreement with Select Energy Development LLC to purchase the electricity produced by the solar panels that it will install and maintain on the Medford DPW building located at 21 Jane Street.

532
00:40:49,284 --> 00:41:01,453
It is the intention of the city to enter into a 20-year agreement, General Laws Chapter 30B, Subchapter 12, that requires city approval for a contract that exceeds three years.

533
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:06,976
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to the provisions of General Laws,

534
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:14,701
Chapter 3RB, subsection 12, approve and authorize the same effort into an agreement with the term of up to 20 years.

535
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,663
Alicia Hunt is here, will be in attendance to answer your questions.

536
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:23,445
Earlier this evening, we did have a subcommittee meeting in regards to this.

537
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:25,266
Name and address of the record, please.

538
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,408
Alicia Hunt, 41 Wasson Street, Medford.

539
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:58,862
So one thing that was asked earlier this evening that I wanted to make sure we were clear about was I was asked the Consultant was asked how long it would take to construct the project and they answered well It would take about four to five weeks to put the panels on the building But the actual process from the time we sign the contract till it's operational with all the lead time on purchasing the equipment the final designs the engineering

540
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:04,101
And then the installation and all the inspections to operational can be five to six months.

541
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:14,086
We had discussed how the current financing was somewhat contingent on it being operational by December 31st.

542
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:26,053
And one of our concerns is that we don't want them to be rushing for the installation during the winter months and to be pushing to get this completed at the end of December.

543
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:27,874
We're concerned about safety for workers.

544
00:42:28,414 --> 00:42:41,194
So we are very interested in getting everything signed as quickly as possible so that we can get the, we can not be rushing and have people trying to make that deadline during the installation at the end of it.

545
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:42,929
in the middle of the winter.

546
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:44,129
So.

547
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,970
Mr. President.

548
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,070
Councilor De La Rosa.

549
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,191
Mr. President, first I want to apologize for my absence at the Committee of the Whole meeting.

550
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:57,973
Obviously, had I been there, some of my questions that I'm going to ask would have been answered.

551
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:58,633
Thank you.

552
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:00,013
If I could, for the chair, to Ms.

553
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:03,274
Hunt, ask, why the 20-year contract?

554
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,474
Could you explain that to me?

555
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:08,775
Could you explain what or if there is a reason for doing that?

556
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:10,060
Sorry.

557
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:18,615
So the answer is that 20-year contracts for solar purchase agreements is the industry standard.

558
00:43:18,715 --> 00:43:21,440
That's what the industry needs in order to

559
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:24,357
make their financing on the project work.

560
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:32,122
I do have with me, the city has hired a solar owner's agent, which is a consultant that we hire to advise us on this.

561
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:38,005
He's an expert in the industry, so he could actually speak to that in any more detail if that's helpful.

562
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:53,446
So this is Paul Lyons with Zapotec Energy, and he is the consultant that the city has hired to advise us on these matters.

563
00:43:54,481 --> 00:44:03,490
Yeah, these deals are typically structured 20 years because the equipment itself lasts 20, 25 years.

564
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:12,138
And you lock in the savings for the electricity cost for the DPW essentially hold it at nine and a half?

565
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:12,138
9.8.

566
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:12,879
9.8 cents for 20 years.

567
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,317
What if the technology changes so rapidly in that field?

568
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:23,679
It will change.

569
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,762
How does that affect this thing?

570
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,797
Yeah, the panels will be pretty much the same.

571
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,497
That's where most of the work goes.

572
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:35,678
The efficiency is around 16, 18% now.

573
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:40,459
Some projects I did 18 years ago, the efficiency was around 11%.

574
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,940
So it's creeping up gradually, but these will work fine for 20 years.

575
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,022
The inverters that do the converting, that technology is advancing.

576
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:54,162
The inverters that they put in, they will probably,

577
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:07,470
will probably replace in about 10, 12 years and you'll get a better inverter at that point in terms of reliability.

578
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:10,312
Thank you.

579
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,553
Councilor Del Rosso, you happy with that answer?

580
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:15,272
Thank you.

581
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:16,873
Councilor Lococo.

582
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:18,194
Thank you, through the chair.

583
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:23,358
If you could go over, I think it's important with regards to the savings.

584
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:35,648
I know it's like 11,800 that we'll be saving the first year, and then if you maybe want to give a synopsis of the overall savings that has been estimated for the full 20 years.

585
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,470
I think that's important for the community to know.

586
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,414
Most people are for this project, but I think that's an extra bonus of what we could be saving.

587
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:50,191
So we pay on approximately 15 cents a kilowatt hour at DPW now.

588
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:54,333
And what they are offering us is 9.8 cents a kilowatt hour.

589
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:57,253
So that would be the full price.

590
00:45:57,513 --> 00:46:03,495
There would be no other electricity charges to National Grid and for the electricity.

591
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:16,720
Based on the amount of electricity, this would cover 100% of the electricity used at the DPW, and so in the first year, the estimated savings is $11,800.

592
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:31,566
We have estimates for the full life of it, but I do like to caveat that in that it makes assumptions as to what the price of electricity will be in 20 years, because the way you know your savings is what would you have paid and what are you paying.

593
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:36,488
We would lock in 9.8 cents for the 20-year term.

594
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:40,270
We assume there would be an increase in electricity over the 20 years.

595
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:49,075
There is also a very slight degradation in the panel, so how much electricity that is produced goes down every year a small amount.

596
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:55,058
There is a guarantee that on year 20, that will be making no less

597
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:59,699
No less than 85, so whatever it's making today, at least 85%.

598
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:04,981
Maybe they'll make 90 or 95%, but at least 85% is guaranteed.

599
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:09,942
So you can't just take 11,800 and multiply by 20.

600
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:12,223
That would be a lovely number.

601
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:21,106
The number that they've come up with, assuming price of electricity increase and the decrease in electricity output is $455,000 over the life of this contract.

602
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:26,302
Thank you.

603
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:38,956
With regards to, I think it's important just to point out that Select Energy Development LLC, who we're going to be contracting with, has done over 400 projects in Massachusetts.

604
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,456
Is he present tonight as well?

605
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,278
He was not able to stay.

606
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,941
But he was here to answer questions for us at the subcommittee meeting.

607
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:51,082
I have solar panels on my house.

608
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:52,103
I'm in full support.

609
00:47:52,203 --> 00:48:04,971
And I thank you again for the detailed outline of all our other municipal and school buildings that potentially down the road could as well get solar panels to help with energy costs throughout our schools and municipal buildings.

610
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:05,852
Thank you.

611
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:06,492
Councilor Falco.

612
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:11,223
Right, so the

613
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:35,833
If we sign the contract now, that gives us, there are many steps in part of the process.

614
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:41,838
Some of it is that they will not incur the capital cost of purchasing the panels unless there's a contract in place.

615
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:44,380
That's good business sense.

616
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,983
And then there's the installation and then the inspections.

617
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:52,006
So those are pieces that sort of, they take the amount of time they take.

618
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,931
and it's not a short amount of time.

619
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:57,152
We also need permissions from the utilities.

620
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:01,215
I do think that we can get to move along fairly quickly.

621
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:11,581
We all believe that if we did this now, we could get this complete by the end of December.

622
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:22,928
I might have to smile and thank the building inspectors a lot to get out there before December 31st to get everything inspected and signed off on.

623
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:29,632
We may have to buy them some pizza to make sure they get out there quick.

624
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:32,694
But we do think that we can get it done.

625
00:49:33,214 --> 00:49:36,797
We would like to not be rushing any more than we are.

626
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:47,784
Their financing for this project is based on it being part of the current Massachusetts State Solar Incentive Program, which is well-defined and well-known.

627
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:49,045
We know exactly what it is.

628
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:50,406
They have financing.

629
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,287
They're ready to go on this project.

630
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:10,083
There are the financing system in the state, the incentive program is changing, and it is still not certain enough for any company to be willing to give me locked in pricing to do any project, including as good as this one is, next spring.

631
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:17,331
There are many companies that have said, we want to do solar on Medford Municipal Buildings.

632
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:27,784
And when I asked them for pricing, well, we'll have to wait until the program is fully defined in, we believe it's going to be November.

633
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,341
Councilor Knight.

634
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:44,210
I think it's also important to point out one of the things that was discussed at the Committee of the Whole earlier this evening was the regional bulk purchasing of the electrical load.

635
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:48,914
Maybe you can talk a little bit about that and how that had an impact on being able to secure such a low rate.

636
00:50:49,134 --> 00:50:49,374
Right.

637
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:54,619
This is an excellent rate for electricity for commercial solar.

638
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,562
We are a member of Power Options, which is a non-profit

639
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:05,582
purchasing cooperative for electricity, natural gas, and solar in the region.

640
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:11,947
And it is open to state entities, municipal, other non-profits.

641
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:15,589
Tufts University happens to be a member as well and uses their services.

642
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:23,415
They did a solicitation for solar, so it is through this very large purchase.

643
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:28,219
that Power Options members are making that this good of a rate has gotten.

644
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:36,907
The company has informed me directly, as my consultant has also told me, that they would never have given this good of a rate for a one-off project.

645
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,730
It's because it is part of a group solicitation.

646
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:41,330
So that.

647
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:54,554
Mr. President, so it sounds like this past year in our budget hearings we learned that we were able to save about $300,000 in the provision of our electricity to Esquiz by taking over the maintenance of the poles, right?

648
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:55,015
Yeah.

649
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:58,436
And now with the approval of this, we're going to be saving another, what did you say, $422,000?

650
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:03,100
That would be over the life of the contract.

651
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:12,949
So in the last three months, say, it's almost close to three quarters of a million dollars that we could save on just the cost of electricity by these two boats.

652
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:13,890
Yes, within 20 years.

653
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,572
It's still the same amount of money.

654
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:16,573
Mr. President.

655
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:19,636
Mr. President.

656
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,220
You'll have the opportunity to speak.

657
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:29,502
Okay, thank you.

658
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:30,983
Councilor Scott Pelley.

659
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:35,368
Again, I thank some of the other points that Ms.

660
00:52:35,388 --> 00:52:39,532
Hunt brought up and I appreciate all your hard work because this is the innovation and

661
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:45,446
the progress that we see that we need in the progressive community.

662
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:57,142
So I think that talking about the carports, I think that that being, when you look at other land use and other community buildings that

663
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,257
that spend so much money in electricity.

664
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:13,725
I used, in the earlier meeting, we used the ice hockey rink and the money that it costs to run an ice hockey rink or the lit fields and looking at different ways down the line that I know that Alicia's looking for.

665
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:17,268
A carport, if you can just quickly just go over there real quick.

666
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:20,930
So right, we would very much like to do carports in Medford.

667
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,493
I've actually had this parking lot pointed out to me as one that would be good for solar.

668
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:34,097
I'm also interested in the lot between the McGlynn and Andrews schools because of how close it is to the wind turbine, it would have such great visibility.

669
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:53,728
When you do carports, the financing is somewhat different, the incentives are somewhat different, and there is also the construction concerns of the fact that you do have to do very, you have to dig deep holes to put good foundations in so that they don't get

670
00:53:54,188 --> 00:54:00,531
blown away with wind shear, the same wind that makes the turbine good, we don't really like on the solar panels.

671
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:05,794
That dirt then has to be carted away and has to be tested.

672
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:16,240
And so we do have some concerns about where we are comfortable testing soil in Medford, digging out stuff and opening up additional problems.

673
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,503
That said, it is something that we are looking at and we're looking for good projects.

674
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:38,997
It is hopeful that under the new structure that's coming out, there will be good incentives for carports that will make it worthwhile, that would be better than doing it now, not to mention it's a more complicated project because of those structural issues.

675
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:40,838
Again, I just point out the innovation.

676
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:41,939
I appreciate the hard work.

677
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,520
We've been looking into that as well.

678
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:43,880
Thank you.

679
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,420
Thank you.

680
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:45,841
Thank you.

681
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:46,622
Mr. President.

682
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:48,483
Vice President Marx.

683
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:50,183
Thank you, Mr. President.

684
00:54:50,484 --> 00:55:03,010
And Alicia, knowing that the DPW building was built several years back with the ability to take on solar, and it's taken us this many years to get to that stage,

685
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:23,272
The addition of a new police station, the addition that we just heard with grant funding from the state for a new public library, is that the intent of the city to, when we build these facilities, to build them not just only with the capability of housing solar, but actually building them with the solar.

686
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:27,837
So that is something that I have been discussing with the architects of both projects.

687
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,140
I am on the building committees for both projects, or I'm being consulted on both projects.

688
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:44,510
And it is simply a matter of, it's not, while I would always advise a homeowner to purchase solar because they can take tax credits, the city cannot take.

689
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:50,098
It does not make financial sense for us to purchase it because of the tax credits.

690
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,341
It makes sense for us to lease it.

691
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:56,005
Therefore, it is not literally part of the construction project.

692
00:55:56,045 --> 00:56:00,310
We have to enter into this separate agreement with somebody to do the solar panels on the roof.

693
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:11,293
I would prefer that we have those negotiations and as the construction of the building is completed, we're then coming in and putting the solar panels on top immediately.

694
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:12,974
That is my preference.

695
00:56:13,595 --> 00:56:21,141
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do that through the help of perhaps power options, having the right consulting on board to help with that.

696
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:24,844
It would not literally be part of the project because of

697
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,087
between contractors.

698
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:32,690
You'll want one contractor to close out and then the other to come in and put the solar on the roof.

699
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:38,113
But I would like to have those agreements in place and ready to go as those buildings are complete.

700
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:45,398
And when I did actually discuss it with the police chief, I assured him that my putting solar on the building would not delay his opening.

701
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:52,663
It would simply come on and offset his electricity once that building is open.

702
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:53,323
Thank you.

703
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:00,202
I mean, we just built this facility, there's no air conditioning.

704
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:05,489
All the bodies absorb the air conditioning, I don't know if you know how that works.

705
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,450
It's the lights.

706
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,451
It may be the lights.

707
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:09,594
The lights, yeah.

708
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:16,081
Alicia, regarding solar farms.

709
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,795
I know we mentioned the carports.

710
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:41,792
Has there been any discussion regarding solar farms and the ability to use these farms to, I mean, the DPW building is great, but as you know, we're in a large facility, this is the largest facility in the city, and there are a number of other city-owned buildings that solar would be great, and are there any way we can use solar farms?

711
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:54,290
So, to be clear, by a solar farm, are you referencing the idea of a whole lot of ground mount solar that's like next to the building, or are you talking about just larger arrays on the buildings?

712
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,590
Either or.

713
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:00,092
Okay, so we definitely want to do larger arrays on the buildings.

714
00:58:00,372 --> 00:58:07,235
The roofs of the schools need, they're 17 year roofs, 17 year old roofs.

715
00:58:07,415 --> 00:58:08,316
We've had some,

716
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:16,123
Consultants looking at them and you need to have a roof that's good for 20 years before you put solar on it.

717
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:19,927
The current roofs need to be replaced before we can put solar on it.

718
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:23,270
That is an active project in the city.

719
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:27,475
The facilities director for the schools and I are meeting with a consultant on that tomorrow actually.

720
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:30,129
So, we need to do the roofs.

721
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:34,453
It is our hope to then follow that with solar as soon as the roofs are ready.

722
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:40,077
We, however, will need refreshed proposals and new pricing.

723
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:44,802
Power options will have new pricing once the new incentive structure is in place.

724
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:46,883
So, we'll need to look at that.

725
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:55,048
For ground mount solar, it's either a carport and then you have sort of the structural concerns and the passing and we're looking at what parking lots work.

726
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:59,190
We don't have room for what is technically considered a solar farm in Medford.

727
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:10,056
Typically, and correct me if I'm wrong on this, but that's a whole bunch of ground mount that is surrounded by a fence and that land is not used for anything else.

728
00:59:10,752 --> 00:59:16,875
And we don't have open space in Medford that we are willing to give up for just solar.

729
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:22,157
We need the ball field space, the soccer fields, the woods.

730
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:25,479
So there isn't that kind of open space in the city.

731
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:26,619
Thank you.

732
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:27,320
Thank you.

733
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,540
Thank you.

734
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,722
Do we have anybody that, did you want to speak?

735
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:36,904
Alicia, thank you very much.

736
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:51,762
Thank you for letting me speak.

737
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,343
Name and address for the record, please.

738
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:54,624
Jean Neuzil, 35 Parris Street.

739
00:59:56,085 --> 01:00:08,355
So while I think solar is a wonderful thing and renewable energy is great, I take exception with having an argument that we're going to save $455,000 by spending $600,000.

740
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:09,356
I take umbrage with that.

741
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,942
Right, but I don't have information Gina.

742
01:00:18,003 --> 01:00:18,643
I just saw you.

743
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:20,144
We're not spending anything.

744
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:22,987
They are occurring all of the cost Who is they?

745
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:27,691
600 thousand dollars outweighed by whom they get the tax benefits the city couldn't so we're contracting through them and

746
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:36,398
We get the savings.

747
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:38,460
It's a 20-year contract.

748
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,542
And how do we arrive at $455,000?

749
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:44,926
Is that because of the energy that we're not going to have to buy?

750
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:47,108
Because of the rate we're going to...

751
01:00:50,696 --> 01:00:52,558
That number may vary a little bit.

752
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:55,101
That calculates the increase as well.

753
01:00:55,562 --> 01:00:56,202
Right.

754
01:00:56,442 --> 01:01:01,488
So we're saying we're going to save $11,000 a month.

755
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:02,088
$11,800 the first year.

756
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,009
For the first year.

757
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,274
Because instead of spending how much per kilowatt hour?

758
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:08,315
15 cents.

759
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:09,436
We're going to spend 9.8. 9.8.

760
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:19,185
The solar company is buying on our behalf and we're contracting them.

761
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:23,028
They will offset the $600,000 by the tax credit.

762
01:01:23,348 --> 01:01:25,250
So it's zero out of pocket for us.

763
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:25,510
Correct.

764
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:25,690
Exactly.

765
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:25,890
Thank you.

766
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,951
Appreciate that.

767
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:27,332
Thank you.

768
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:34,690
Well, we have one more resident in.

769
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,431
Name and address of the record, please.

770
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:37,671
Thank you, Mr. President.

771
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:40,552
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

772
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:44,054
I just have one question through the chair.

773
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:50,096
That fixed rate that's being offered per kilowatt hour, is that locked?

774
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:54,558
Like, what happens if something comes up in the future where they could get a lower rate?

775
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,259
Could we opt for the lower rate?

776
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,359
Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:58,620
Ms.

778
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,420
Hunter, could you answer that?

779
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:09,578
So the 9.8 cents is locked in for the life of the contract.

780
01:02:10,038 --> 01:02:18,203
They can't raise the rate because they suddenly have higher expenses and we can't lower the rate because we could have gotten a better deal somewhere else.

781
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:18,984
Thank you.

782
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,366
On the questions.

783
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:29,211
Motion approved by Councilor Lococo and seconded by Councilor Falco.

784
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,172
All those in favor?

785
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:30,752
Aye.

786
01:02:31,172 --> 01:02:31,873
Motion passes.

787
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:36,051
Thank you.

788
01:02:36,071 --> 01:02:36,051
17, 577.

789
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:59,220
Dear Mr. President, city council members, I respectfully request or recommend that your Honorable body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court to allow the licensing committee, commission of the city of Medford to grant licenses for sale of alcohol at Chevalier Theater to an entity that operates the theater by way of a contract lease or other agreement with the city of Medford.

790
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,328
Mr. President, motion to waive the additional reading and have a brief synopsis by the city solicitor representative of the administration.

791
01:03:04,568 --> 01:03:04,929
Thank you.

792
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,651
Motion by Councilor Knight to waive.

793
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,296
Seconded by Councilor Del Rose.

794
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:10,077
All those in favor, aye.

795
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,521
Mr. Solicitor, could you please give a brief synopsis, please?

796
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,981
Thank you, Mr. President.

797
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,583
I didn't get my address.

798
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:21,586
Mark Rumley, City Solicitor, 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

799
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:28,954
As the Council knows, the City crafted an RFP for Chevalier Auditorium a few months back.

800
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:39,161
And there have been a couple of responses to that RFP that are presently in the process of being fully reviewed and recommendations made to the mayor.

801
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:46,504
In any event, one of the things that's come up is the benefit that Chevalier Auditorium would have if there were a single

802
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:50,126
liquor license that applied to Chevalier.

803
01:03:50,666 --> 01:04:07,438
What occurs right now is that when the Chevalier Commission books an event, generally speaking, if that event wants to offer alcohol to its patrons, it will apply for a one-day license before the Liquor Commission, and it's done on a singular basis.

804
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:27,483
If we had a management company under contract with the city to manage Chevalier and Axe and all the rest, it would be very wise to have a liquor license available for them to receive on their application to the licensing commission.

805
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:32,645
So really what it would do is to make it singular, but only for that building.

806
01:04:33,685 --> 01:04:42,592
It wouldn't be a liquor license that could be used anywhere else and could only be used by the entity that was designated by the city as the manager for that auditorium.

807
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,513
So that's the purpose of this.

808
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:56,021
In addition, there's language in this home rule petition that deals with common vigilance license because as this council knows better than any other body, there are steps to get a common vigilance license that brings a petitioner to you.

809
01:04:56,802 --> 01:05:06,424
it would be efficient and economical for a manager to be able to receive from the licensing commission, if they get a liquor license, also a common vitualist license.

810
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:11,765
That way, if there was any type of food that was going to be offered to patrons, it can all be done at once.

811
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:21,607
And the wisdom of that is that they wouldn't have to break the petitioning process to go to the licensing commission for a liquor license and then to the city council for

812
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:23,527
a common vigilance license.

813
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:36,251
Also, analyzing this in the most conservative way, if the manager wasn't a good manager, whatever it is, and we wanted to revoke their agreement, then the liquor license and the common vigilance license would be revoked at the same time.

814
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,551
So it's a much more swift and economical way to go.

815
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:43,753
And the council understands what a home rule petition is.

816
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:48,514
If you pass this, it would go to the state legislature for its action.

817
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:49,274
Thank you.

818
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:50,407
Councilor Knight.

819
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,088
Mr. President, I think this is a step in the right direction.

820
01:05:53,749 --> 01:06:04,094
It's another really building block to the long-term success of the Chevalier Theater and also helping revitalize Medford Square and, you know, kind of bringing Chevalier Auditorium up with the times.

821
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:10,436
You know, you go to the Somerville Theater in Arlington, both of those theaters over there have the ability to serve alcoholic beverages on premises.

822
01:06:10,617 --> 01:06:13,578
And in order for us to compete, I think that this is something we need to do.

823
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:15,239
I support it wholeheartedly and I move for approval.

824
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:15,759
Thank you.

825
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,820
On the motion by Councilor Knight for approval.

826
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:20,034
Vice President Mox.

827
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,995
Mr. Solicitor, was this supported by the Chevalier Commission?

828
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:24,996
Yes, as a matter of fact.

829
01:06:25,256 --> 01:06:34,239
I did give the language of this to the head of the Licensing Commission, but the members of the Chevalier Commission were on the evaluation team, and there are three.

830
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:41,822
I can't speak for all of them, but I'm very confident in saying that they are in favor of this license and this Home Rule petition.

831
01:06:42,482 --> 01:06:46,524
And also, it's my understanding a new management company will be on board.

832
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:49,045
Shortly, is that your understanding also?

833
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:52,648
Yes, the use of the word shortly is always a very treacherous.

834
01:06:54,489 --> 01:07:03,476
But the reason I say that is there hasn't been a, the committee hasn't made a final recommendation to the mayor, although there are only two, not only, but there are two good proposes.

835
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:12,362
And when that recommendation is finally made to the mayor and then she makes a determination as to which one, then it'll move forward.

836
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:15,464
I hope that it's shortly also, Councilman.

837
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:16,145
Thank you.

838
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:20,806
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

839
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:22,607
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

840
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:26,928
Councilor DelaRusso?

841
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:27,168
Yes.

842
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:28,528
Councilor Falco?

843
01:07:28,568 --> 01:07:28,648
Yes.

844
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:29,788
Councilor Knight?

845
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:30,088
Yes.

846
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:31,369
Councilor Lonen-Kern?

847
01:07:31,409 --> 01:07:31,689
Yes.

848
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:32,989
Vice President Marks?

849
01:07:33,089 --> 01:07:33,409
Yes.

850
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:34,570
Councilor Scott Pelli?

851
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:34,870
Yes.

852
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,290
President Caviello?

853
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,730
Yes.

854
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,891
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

855
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:39,691
Motion passes.

856
01:07:39,711 --> 01:07:41,291
Thank you, Mr. President.

857
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:41,291
17, 578.

858
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:43,772
Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council,

859
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,596
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a brief synopsis by the State Solicitor.

860
01:07:47,676 --> 01:07:52,042
Mr. Solicitor, if you could please give a brief synopsis on this one also.

861
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:53,463
578 is, yes.

862
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:57,008
This is kind of a cousin to the Home Rule petition, and it's this.

863
01:07:57,749 --> 01:08:02,234
As I just said, we have two responders to the RFP that was crafted by the city.

864
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:12,245
And it just so happens that both responders said that they would prefer a five-year contract initially.

865
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:21,875
Now, as you just heard with solar panels, there's a requirement that the city council approve any term which is longer than three years on a lease or an agreement.

866
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:24,278
And that's the purpose of this being before you tonight.

867
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:26,473
Questions for the solicitor?

868
01:08:26,913 --> 01:08:27,373
Move approval.

869
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:29,654
Motion by Councilor Nathan, move approval.

870
01:08:29,674 --> 01:08:30,054
Mr. President?

871
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:31,934
Vice President Mox.

872
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:37,595
I just think it's appropriate to point out the good work that was done by members of the commission.

873
01:08:38,355 --> 01:08:50,417
They did appoint an evaluation team made up of John Costas, Mike Oliver, John Veneziano, Allie Fisk from the Mayor's Office, Ann Marie Irwin from the Mayor's Office, and City Solicitor Rumley.

874
01:08:50,777 --> 01:08:52,378
So I appreciate their due diligence.

875
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,698
This is what the people have been asking for.

876
01:08:53,718 --> 01:08:54,258
Thank you, Councilor.

877
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:54,558
Great job.

878
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:57,102
Thank you Mr. President.

879
01:08:57,142 --> 01:08:57,482
Thank you.

880
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:01,127
Name and address of the record please.

881
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:07,276
John Costas, 25 Salem Street, president of the Chevalier Commission.

882
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:14,014
I kind of wrote this down so I could be brief, and I thought it was going to be at City Hall, so I'm just going to read it.

883
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,758
When I was 23, I stood in this very spot.

884
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:19,600
Well, it wasn't this very spot.

885
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,666
It was that very spot, requesting the City Council save Chevalier Auditorium.

886
01:09:25,367 --> 01:09:31,229
And if you asked me then, at that time, would I be standing here almost 40 years later, I would have laughed.

887
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:32,669
It's amazing.

888
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:41,933
In the fall of 1980, the City Council gave Chevalier its first major milestone by voting to retain Chevalier Theatre and GMAC Gymnasium.

889
01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:45,954
And now it's before you again for another major milestone.

890
01:09:46,794 --> 01:09:51,456
This vote will move Chevalier to its rightful place as a professional performing arts center.

891
01:09:52,527 --> 01:10:06,630
In the last 40 years, the Chevalier Commission has invested hundreds of thousands of hours and has executed over $3 million in the restoration of Chevalier Theater to create a first-class facility that will be attracted to professional management company.

892
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:08,470
We have met our goal.

893
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:20,033
This decision will have a tremendous economic impact on Medford Square, not to mention the millions of dollars of revenue that will be generated from the meal and hotel tax that will benefit the taxpayers.

894
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,450
And here's the important part.

895
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:32,495
It is unfortunate that some of the key players that made this possible, like General Dean Grandy and Dick Ober, are no longer with us to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

896
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,157
Approving this paper would be one of the biggest things that could happen to the Chevalier Theater.

897
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:38,017
Thank you.

898
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:38,638
Thank you.

899
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:39,658
Thank you.

900
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,319
On to motion by Councilor Knight.

901
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,200
Roll call.

902
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,480
Oh, excuse me.

903
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:47,922
Name and address of the record, please.

904
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,863
Jean Neuzil, 35 Parr Street.

905
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,005
Sorry, I just want to take a moment.

906
01:10:52,806 --> 01:11:05,896
I can remember being a young girl, and John and Dick, when we were working on one of the shows for the Mystic Players, brought us young folks in there, and it was nothing like what it is now.

907
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:10,439
It was loaded with mold and dust and debris.

908
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,120
Nothing worked right.

909
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:17,345
Rat droppings everywhere, and they stood us in the middle of the stage.

910
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,346
and they told us their vision.

911
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:24,909
And I just think that where they've brought it, I think they should be acknowledged for that.

912
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:35,935
And I hope and trust that they will pick the right representative to really bring breath back into this theater because it really is a gem for the industry.

913
01:11:35,995 --> 01:11:41,618
So, just wanted to let people know that my observations way back then and how far it's come.

914
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:42,538
Thank you.

915
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:46,942
On to motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

916
01:11:48,023 --> 01:11:48,383
I'm sorry.

917
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:50,345
Mr. President.

918
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:51,566
Name and address of the record, please.

919
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:53,708
May Markybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave.

920
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,110
It's going to be very, very brief.

921
01:11:58,572 --> 01:11:59,452
In 1946, Irving Perlman.

922
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:04,737
I didn't know that was a joke. 1946.

923
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:16,989
Irving Berlin wrote music for Annie Get Your Gun.

924
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,434
I'm sure a lot of you have seen that production.

925
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:21,716
It's been very, very popular.

926
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,522
And there was a song there called There's No Business Like Show Business.

927
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:33,145
So, I just wanted to say, mention that, because the words go something like this.

928
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:35,386
I'm not going to sing it because I don't want to interrupt you.

929
01:12:35,406 --> 01:12:36,927
Come on, you can sing it.

930
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:37,468
No, please.

931
01:12:37,488 --> 01:12:41,330

So please keep that in mind.

01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:55,470
Thank you.

1106
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,810
Thank you.

1107
01:23:04,032 --> 01:23:06,374
Oh, I'm against it.

1108
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:10,796
You'll have an opportunity to speak at a... You want me to talk about it now?

1109
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:11,577
Not at this time.

1110
01:23:11,657 --> 01:23:12,357
All right, buddy.

1111
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:13,658
Not at this time.

1112
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,221
Okay.

1113
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:37,044
Can we hold on a second?

1114
01:23:37,104 --> 01:23:38,924
I didn't catch that.

1115
01:23:45,227 --> 01:23:45,627
Thank you.

1116
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:46,988
I didn't catch your name.

1117
01:23:47,028 --> 01:23:48,669
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your address or your name.

1118
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:52,351
Christina Gibbons, 28 Doonan Street, Medford, Mass.

1119
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:53,131
Thank you very much.

1120
01:23:57,295 --> 01:23:59,357
I'm Palmezano, 43 Brackett Street.

1121
01:24:00,237 --> 01:24:00,717
In which city?

1122
01:24:01,258 --> 01:24:01,578
Medford.

1123
01:24:02,318 --> 01:24:03,099
Medford, thank you.

1124
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,282
Sean Givens, 28 Doonan Street, Medford, Mass.

1125
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:08,062
Thank you.

1126
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:13,065
Leonard Guayona, 86 Chandler Road, Medford.

1127
01:24:13,505 --> 01:24:13,926
Thank you.

1128
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:18,288
Jerry Bolton, 7 Robinson Road, Medford.

1129
01:24:18,489 --> 01:24:18,889
Thank you.

1130
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:20,970
C.J.

1131
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,911
Daugherty, 14 Rowling Pond Road, Lincoln.

1132
01:24:23,472 --> 01:24:23,752
Thank you.

1133
01:24:25,912 --> 01:24:28,313
Greg Gallinopoulos, 24 Marston Street, Medford.

1134
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:28,913
Thank you.

1135
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:32,835
Anyone else in opposition?

1136
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,796
Michael Lewis, 133 Pine Ridge Road.

1137
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:36,817
Thank you.

1138
01:24:38,357 --> 01:24:39,858
Do we have anyone else in opposition?

1139
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,159
Please step forward.

1140
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:48,622
Sheila Grant, 92 High Street, Medford.

1141
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:49,663
Thank you.

1142
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:55,887
And last call, anyone else in opposition here in the other room?

1143
01:24:56,148 --> 01:24:56,468
Hold on.

1144
01:25:02,312 --> 01:25:04,253
Colleen Ray, 358 Broadway, Lynn.

1145
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:05,454
Thank you.

1146
01:25:12,839 --> 01:25:14,740
Collin McGowan, 173 Medford Street.

1147
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:15,830
Thank you.

1148
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:17,351
Last call.

1149
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,652
Any that are speaking that are not in favor?

1150
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:24,133
At this point, we'll close that part of the meeting.

1151
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:26,294
And we'll open it up for discussion.

1152
01:25:26,314 --> 01:25:27,395
Thank you.

1153
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,055
City Clerk Flynn, we request permission to hand out to City Council.

1154
01:25:29,075 --> 01:25:36,098
Would that be okay?

1155
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:36,438
That's fine.

1156
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:50,120
Anybody in the audience?

1157
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,840
Thank you, Larry.

1158
01:26:13,656 --> 01:26:15,136
All right, thank you.

1159
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:20,018
If I could remind you that the ten minute rule is in effect.

1160
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:20,998
Absolutely.

1161
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:21,919
Thank you very much.

1162
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:23,799
Name and address of the record please.

1163
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:26,520
Michelle Legler, 21 Inglewood Road, Winchester.

1164
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,881
Nick Cavazzo, 74A Pleasant Street.

1165
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:29,621
Thank you.

1166
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:33,142
Thank you Mr. President Carviello for allowing us to be here this evening.

1167
01:26:33,582 --> 01:26:37,307
Before we get started, please allow me to start with a personal message.

1168
01:26:37,808 --> 01:26:39,770
This process has not been an easy one.

1169
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:45,537
It has been a tremendous learning experience filled with both immense joy as well as huge regrets.

1170
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,241
And given the chance again, there are many things we would like to do over.

1171
01:26:49,982 --> 01:26:53,104
This is our first time entering the business foray.

1172
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:59,768
For me personally, I'm a cancer researcher, and as you may have heard, last week we did something really stupid.

1173
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:05,512
We sent an email to a few select officials that were worded very dumbly, and for that we apologize.

1174
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:18,975
For having said that, we'd like to get to business at hand here because we are very excited to be able to present to you our plans for the doggie daycare so you and the rest of City Council can actually make informed decisions based on the facts.

1175
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:26,876
As mentioned, we are Michelle Legler and Nick Cavazos and we own the premier dog walking and pet city company called Dogs for Days.

1176
01:27:27,436 --> 01:27:35,738
We are a unique and personalized dog walking company whose sole mission is to provide peace of mind for our clients by allowing dogs to be themselves and have a blast.

1177
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:40,522
We offer a range of services from walks to runs, hikes, playgroups, and boarding.

1178
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:46,566
At Dogs for Days, we seriously love dogs as if they were our own and would do absolutely anything for them.

1179
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:53,192
This isn't just a job for us, it's a complete way of life that we love every single day and we feel blessed to be able to do it.

1180
01:27:53,952 --> 01:28:05,624
If you couldn't tell, we are truly passionate animal lovers, and collectively we have over 10 years of animal handling experience with over 100 clients both here in Medford and surrounding neighbors who trust us daily with their fur babies.

1181
01:28:06,284 --> 01:28:14,432
It is our goal and deepest desire to be the great state of Medford's provider for not only doggy daycare, but training, overnight boarding, and bathing as well.

1182
01:28:15,353 --> 01:28:16,734
Why Medford, you might be thinking.

1183
01:28:17,294 --> 01:28:19,495
Medford, as we know, is a truly beautiful city.

1184
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:21,236
It has a long, rich history.

1185
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:24,958
It has the Middlesex Bells, and of course, Jingle Bells was written here.

1186
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:37,284
Medford is also home to over 10,000 registered dogs, with an additional 400 to 600 dogs registering each year who desperately want and need a place somewhere close to home to send their fur babies to.

1187
01:28:38,024 --> 01:28:43,487
Likewise, given the many people who are moving here daily, they are demanding this type of business be available to them.

1188
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:58,210
Due to Medford's zoning ordinances, the available locations for us to choose from are severely limited, but we have actually identified a perfect location as it meets all zoning requirements according to the Code of Ordinance for the City of Medford.

1189
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:05,212
If you refer to map one that's being held up right here, the vast majority of Medford is zoned to allow for residencies.

1190
01:29:05,772 --> 01:29:10,153
The residential districts are marked clearly in yellow and orange on the official zoning map.

1191
01:29:10,873 --> 01:29:13,474
Only a small percentage of land is zoned industrial.

1192
01:29:14,394 --> 01:29:16,635
Medford has two main industrial districts.

1193
01:29:17,115 --> 01:29:27,538
Both are located on either side of the Wellington Circle, plus there are very few small already impacted streets in those neighborhoods scattered here and there, which regrettably will not work for us.

1194
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:29,979
They are marked in the purple zones on this map.

1195
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:37,901
Unfortunately, the industrial district in the far corner is taken up by Wellington's T Station, so that land is completely out of the question.

1196
01:29:38,381 --> 01:29:43,143
So we are left with only one small section of the purple zone area to place our daycare.

1197
01:29:43,883 --> 01:29:49,308
We have worked hard with the buildings department to identify the perfect location that is in an industrial area.

1198
01:29:49,948 --> 01:30:02,639
If you refer to map 2, you will see that our building at 29 Linden Street is in a very industrial area and is surrounded by several construction companies, auto body shops, and other industrial type companies.

1199
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:23,996
Given that this is an established industrial district already, which contains the normal day-to-day operations that come with such industry, such as large traffic, truck traffic, huge equipment being moved around, and the beeping of vehicles backing up, all the noises and smells associated with industrial equipment and even excessive leaf blowers can be heard at all hours.

1200
01:30:24,637 --> 01:30:28,340
You can see on map three what the area actually looks like.

1201
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:40,625
I would like to bring to your attention that there are three apartment buildings on Locust Street in the industrial zoned area that received a special permit to be constructed inside this zone.

1202
01:30:41,205 --> 01:30:52,148
However, it should also be noted that they were constructed right next to a large construction company which operates heavy machinery, as can be seen in the street view, the brown buildings next to those construction companies.

1203
01:30:52,828 --> 01:31:00,550
Dogs for Days chose 29 Linden Street because it is the only suitable property available for our business and is an industrial zoned district.

1204
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:19,423
We plan to operate a business that is in high demand for the city of Medford, one in which many of our constituents have expressed a great interest in, and quite frankly, given the numerous and expensive apartment buildings and condos that are going up in and around the city, they're expecting this type of service to be available to them in the city they're moving to.

1205
01:31:19,983 --> 01:31:22,725
Now let me have Nick tell you about our building and our plans for it.

1206
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:26,467
Here at Dogs for Days, we're very caring and respectful people.

1207
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,790
This not only covers how we feel about the dogs, but our neighbors as well.

1208
01:31:30,673 --> 01:31:36,042
We do not want to be the noise and smell infested business some may fear will come with bringing a doggy daycare in the neighborhood.

1209
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:39,087
If I may, I refer you to the renderings of our new building.

1210
01:31:42,218 --> 01:31:45,760
as we are very proud of the state-of-the-art design we have put together.

1211
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:50,663
I would also like to note that all of our work has and will be performed by local Medford companies.

1212
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:55,807
The building itself requires very minimal time frame for construction, only taking two to three months.

1213
01:31:56,387 --> 01:32:04,152
Our contractor will be erecting the additional fencing, knocking down a few walls inside, installing dog washing tubs, and laying down the flooring needed for the dogs.

1214
01:32:04,672 --> 01:32:10,343
We also have K9 Grass, the only company who strictly specializes in dog turf, install our turf in the play area.

1215
01:32:10,944 --> 01:32:14,351
Once it is complete, as you can see in our rendering, it'll look absolutely amazing.

1216
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:18,425
However, let's spend some time addressing the potential annoyance to our neighbors.

1217
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:26,850
In regard to light, we will be installing our outdoor lighting below fence height facing downwards as not to disturb any of the neighbors and will not be used late into the evening.

1218
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:36,436
We have spent a considerable amount of time and research on soundproofing plans, and after speaking with experts who have performed these services on other daycares, we have come up with a great plan.

1219
01:32:37,116 --> 01:32:45,361
We've hired New England Soundproofing to install their high-quality reverb material inside that has a noise reduction rating of 1, which is the highest rating you can have.

1220
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:53,166
They have installed this soundproofing in other daycares in Burlington, Woburn, and Waltham, all of which have had no complaints from neighbors since the installation.

1221
01:32:54,285 --> 01:33:03,128
We already have an 8-foot chain-link fence with privacy slats and will also be erecting an additional 8-foot vinyl fence within the currently existing one to double up on sound reduction.

1222
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:08,209
The inner fence will be draped with mass-loaded vinyl, a heavy-duty outdoor soundproofing material.

1223
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:14,371
Having two non-see-through fences with soundproofing material filled in between them will create a state-of-the-art sound barrier.

1224
01:33:15,152 --> 01:33:19,133
Aside from being a great sound barrier, our fencing will also help prevent dogs from escaping.

1225
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:24,557
We have two gates making up our vehicle bay, as well as our electronic gate system in the front of the property.

1226
01:33:25,838 --> 01:33:29,641
The ASPCA guideline suggests a one to 15 human to dog ratio.

1227
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:36,386
To help with noise reduction, we've decided on a one to 10 ratio to make sure all the dogs are kept happy and have ample room.

1228
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:40,529
ASPCA guideline also suggests 75 square feet of space per dog.

1229
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:48,836
We have a plan to double that amount to allow 150 square feet per dog to ensure we don't have too many dogs and every dog is given space to play and roam.

1230
01:33:49,686 --> 01:33:54,087
We will further discuss with Animal Control what proper maximum capacity should be at our facility.

1231
01:33:54,907 --> 01:33:58,488
Let's also discuss another controversial subject, that of waste and potential smell.

1232
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:03,469
We will have several trash bins around the building that are used by many dog parks and other daycares.

1233
01:34:04,069 --> 01:34:08,630
These bins also have lids to keep out weather and pests, as well as keep in any odor.

1234
01:34:09,231 --> 01:34:12,251
These will not be placed near the property line and will be maintained daily.

1235
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:18,853
We will have weekly pickup for our dumpster that will reside behind two gates that is not accessible or visible to the public.

1236
01:34:19,573 --> 01:34:25,837
Our outdoor play area will be lined with specialized dog turf that is made up of antimicrobial material for a cleaner, better smelling environment.

1237
01:34:26,597 --> 01:34:32,961
It is fully permeable and has an air grid below to allow proper drainage so that puddles don't form on top and nothing flows into the streets.

1238
01:34:33,802 --> 01:34:37,184
Our hours of operation will also help in regards to possible annoyance.

1239
01:34:37,784 --> 01:34:43,488
We plan to allow dogs outside to play between the hours of 9 to 5 so that most residents in the neighborhood will already be at work.

1240
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:51,091
We'll have an overnight attendant there after hours and boarding dogs will be let outside one at a time for bathroom breaks no later than 8 p.m.

1241
01:34:51,211 --> 01:34:52,531
and no earlier than 6 a.m.

1242
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:53,252
the following day.

1243
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:58,153
As for traffic concerns, we provide our clients with complimentary drop-off and pickup service.

1244
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:01,734
However, we may have some clients who choose to drop off and pick up on their own.

1245
01:35:02,234 --> 01:35:08,456
Medford's Chief of Police, Chief Sacco, has informed us that there will be little to no impact on traffic to Linden Street due to our business coming in.

1246
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:12,637
Now, I hand you back to Michelle to tell you about the many benefits we will bring to Medford.

1247
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:13,949
Thank you, Nick.

1248
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:20,253
Obviously, this is not all of our plans, but with the limited time we have here, we tried to provide you with a high-level overview.

1249
01:35:20,794 --> 01:35:31,181
We can assure you, as truly passionate dog lovers, that we have carefully, thoroughly, and thoughtfully thought about everything in order to provide a state-of-the-art doggy daycare while being conscientious neighbors.

1250
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:40,507
We have spoken with numerous professionals throughout our industry and even checked out daycares all throughout New England in an attempt to learn their best practices so we may apply them themselves.

1251
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:47,557
Lastly, I'd like to spend the remainder of our time highlighting just some of the many benefits our doggie daycare will bring to the City of Medford.

1252
01:35:48,138 --> 01:35:56,030
If you are not already aware, the pet industry is a $70 billion a year business and is growing steadily every single year.

1253
01:35:56,651 --> 01:36:03,094
As mentioned, there are over 10,000 registered dogs here in Medford, with each year bringing an additional 400 to 600 more.

1254
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:06,435
So those numbers only include the registered dogs.

1255
01:36:06,655 --> 01:36:12,918
And unfortunately, as we know, many residents do not register dogs, so in reality, that number could even be doubled.

1256
01:36:13,818 --> 01:36:17,760
Let's start with tax revenue that Dogs for Days will plan on bringing to the city of Medford.

1257
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:30,012
According to our business plan and several banks that we have spoken with, who are experts in the area, doggy daycares of our caliber bring in anywhere from $1 million to $6 million annual, depending on their size.

1258
01:36:30,672 --> 01:36:42,023
We are expected to bring to the City of Medford approximately $35,000 a year, just in taxes, according to Century Bank, who I believe sent you a letter today on our behalf asking for your approval.

1259
01:36:42,724 --> 01:36:45,486
Keep in mind, we are not costing the city anything.

1260
01:36:45,927 --> 01:36:51,591
There is no additional revenue that the city of Medford will need to spend because Dogs for Days is here.

1261
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:58,076
In fact, not only will we bring you revenue and taxes, but we will also save the city considerable amount of money.

1262
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:08,564
Currently, the City of Medford has nowhere to house stray dogs that are found, lost, or abandoned, so you are paying the North Shore Animal Hospital in Lynn to house them for you.

1263
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:16,109
Since 2012, Medford has paid them approximately $8,200, averaging $650 a year.

1264
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:24,836
We would rectify this immediately by teaming up with Animal Control and allow you to place your dogs with us and even help unclayed dogs get adopted.

1265
01:37:25,496 --> 01:37:33,822
This will not only save the city additional money, but it will save the residents from having to travel to Lynn should their dogs jump a fence or get lost due to a thunderstorm.

1266
01:37:34,302 --> 01:37:39,045
They can drive right down the street and know that a local trusted company has their fur baby safe and sound.

1267
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:52,715
We have spoken with your animal control officer who has given us an extensive amount of information regarding the regulations requirements that are needed to be kept in order to provide this service for you, and we look forward to working with him in order to comply.

1268
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:56,676
Furthermore, and maybe most importantly, we will be hiring locally.

1269
01:37:57,296 --> 01:38:04,737
Nick and I are firm believers in providing high-paying jobs to great employees, and we will be offering a lot of opportunities for the residents of Medford.

1270
01:38:05,277 --> 01:38:10,078
Right off the bat, we are looking to hire six to eight people locally, starting at $15 an hour.

1271
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:19,720
In addition to jobs, we will also be hosting internships for students studying animal sciences, fostering dogs, and supporting local shelters with food drives and donations.

1272
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:28,684
We also plan to team up with local restaurants while hosting yappy hours, events for the communities, come to get to know one another while trying out local restaurants.

1273
01:38:29,545 --> 01:38:35,568
For those of you who do not know what a yappy hour is, it is food and drinks with your fellow dog lovers and your dog.

1274
01:38:36,548 --> 01:38:47,499
Our state-of-the-art facilities, along with great offers and promotions, will bring people from other communities to spend money here in Medford.

1275
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,621
I have one last thing, if I could.

1276
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:51,783
Thank you.

1277
01:38:52,203 --> 01:38:59,547
So we will diligently comply with 100% of the board as well as Mass General Law and ASPC guidelines.

1278
01:39:00,008 --> 01:39:04,230
So lastly, we'd like to thank the many people who have helped and supported us along the way.

1279
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:09,573
Our clients, our dog groups, dog walkers, friends, families, and most importantly to all other dogs.

1280
01:39:09,953 --> 01:39:11,074
We hope we made you proud.

1281
01:39:11,514 --> 01:39:14,456
Please let us know if we can answer any additional questions for you.

1282
01:39:14,676 --> 01:39:15,056
Thank you.

1283
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:16,837
Thank you.

1284
01:39:20,033 --> 01:39:20,733
Anyone else want to speak?

1285
01:39:20,994 --> 01:39:21,494
Any questions?

1286
01:39:21,514 --> 01:39:22,554
Do you want to ask questions now?

1287
01:39:39,137 --> 01:39:39,437
Thank you.

1288
01:39:39,578 --> 01:39:40,178
Councilman Locario.

1289
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:43,663
Maybe if you could expand a little bit more on the soundproofing.

1290
01:39:43,703 --> 01:39:45,965
I know you said there's a soundproofing fence.

1291
01:39:46,085 --> 01:39:50,951
Can you tell me at all about any soundproofing in the building as far as overnight?

1292
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:55,897
So we will be lining the building from floor to ceiling with

1293
01:39:56,899 --> 01:40:12,680
The reverb material that New England soundproofing provides and as previously stated it's got the highest rating you could possibly get for soundproofing this will be covering the floor the walls and parts of the ceiling as so that dogs will not be barking and I

1294
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,583
Like we said, they will be kept busy.

1295
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:18,284
We'll have calming music inside 24 hours a day.

1296
01:40:19,004 --> 01:40:29,708
And if a dog is barking, we have, like we said, we have the human to dog ratio so that one person can take a dog aside and help keep them occupied so that they don't bark.

1297
01:40:31,652 --> 01:40:36,575
And then with regards to the lighting, can you explain the hours for the lighting outside?

1298
01:40:36,675 --> 01:40:46,922
Yes, so the lighting, we will only use, like we said, the dogs won't be outside later than 8 p.m., so lights will not be on later than 8 p.m.

1299
01:40:48,783 --> 01:40:49,084
Thank you.

1300
01:40:53,066 --> 01:40:54,647
Oh, I was gonna go around.

1301
01:40:56,475 --> 01:40:56,795
Thank you.

1302
01:40:57,616 --> 01:40:58,737
Thank you for your presentation.

1303
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:03,440
What's the max amount of dogs you can house at one time?

1304
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:14,327
So, we, with 150 square feet allowed per dog at 7500 square feet of play space, that would generally allow us 100 dogs to be there at once.

1305
01:41:16,068 --> 01:41:17,649
I'm sorry, 50 dogs at once.

1306
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:24,472
Sorry, that was the 75 square foot per dog, but we doubled it to allow 50 dogs at once to give them space to roam.

1307
01:41:24,772 --> 01:41:25,312
My apologies.

1308
01:41:25,472 --> 01:41:36,056
And however, I'd just like to add that we have agreed that with Officer Pat Hogan that we would let him make the final determination of what he determines would be the maximum number of dogs allowed there at one time.

1309
01:41:36,636 --> 01:41:40,837
ASPC guidelines do say, as Nick mentioned, one dog per 75 square feet.

1310
01:41:41,997 --> 01:41:42,298
Okay.

1311
01:41:44,179 --> 01:41:50,710
Now, housing them outside, how many would you house outside during walk time?

1312
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:54,898
Can I actually just ask, because we don't house dogs, I think you mean play?

1313
01:41:57,962 --> 01:42:04,264
So, as stated in the speech, between 9 and 5 the dogs will be allowed outside.

1314
01:42:04,604 --> 01:42:08,265
Usually about 20 or 30 can roam between in and out.

1315
01:42:09,005 --> 01:42:10,526
And we will be keeping them busy.

1316
01:42:11,226 --> 01:42:14,387
There will be one person for every 10 dogs, which is very easily managed.

1317
01:42:15,147 --> 01:42:22,012
And, you know, with people there 24-7, keeping the dogs nice and calm, they have no reason to bark.

1318
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:23,573
They can't see on the other side of the fence.

1319
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:26,435
And there's, you know, nothing to bark at.

1320
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:28,976
They kept busy and nice and tired and having a blast.

1321
01:42:32,059 --> 01:42:37,484
As a dog lover and having my own dog, my wife won't let her out of her sight.

1322
01:42:39,566 --> 01:42:50,597
But what I did do with so many concerns both for and against, I took a tour of a local kennel doggy daycare.

1323
01:42:52,238 --> 01:43:02,504
And one thing that was very evident was a clean facility, but two things that were glaring was the smell of the urine and the dog and the barking.

1324
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:02,944
Yes.

1325
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:15,651
And as I talked to the owner as much, as honestly as she could, when you, as she explained to me, when you bring 10 dogs into the play area, the recreation area, as she called it,

1326
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:21,927
They all set their scent, so there's constant urinating.

1327
01:43:22,347 --> 01:43:35,022
And that was when it was pretty pungent, which they used a chemical spray that continually goes, and they used stone dust that they changed every quarter.

1328
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:41,389
And she said it's just been very difficult to mask that.

1329
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:43,170
So that's one of my concerns.

1330
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:47,354
The other thing is the noise issue.

1331
01:43:48,135 --> 01:43:52,699
As she put it, when dogs do come to her facility,

1332
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,563
They are stressed for the fact that, especially new dogs.

1333
01:43:57,244 --> 01:44:02,509
And we'll have dogs, as I witnessed, that would bark until they're exhausted.

1334
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:10,678
And no matter what they try to do as dog caretakers, it was very difficult for them to control.

1335
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:15,783
So she was very honest and open with me, and my question to you is that

1336
01:44:16,895 --> 01:44:33,631
she finds it very difficult to tell me that she can guarantee anybody in her business where she runs that the dogs aren't going to be loud and the smell of the urine, not using maybe your product might be different, but it was pungent.

1337
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:36,674
Now, if you can help me with that, that would be great.

1338
01:44:37,114 --> 01:44:55,939
Absolutely, so if I may I'll answer those in the order they were asked so as far as the smelling urine like We had said and we do have our turf expert here if you'd like to ask him any questions Our turf is specialized so that it is an antimicrobial material It's made so that it's a cleaner better smelling.

1339
01:44:56,299 --> 01:44:59,220
You know it's it's not dirty stuff it has a

1340
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:10,429
air grid system below it so that when a dog urinates on it, it directly goes beneath and flows to where it drains into the ground.

1341
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:16,455
And so, that being said, they're not peeing on stones that are stuck there all day.

1342
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:21,219
They're peeing and it directly goes straight down and away from where they are.

1343
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:25,683
We will also be hosing the property down at least once a day, if not twice a day.

1344
01:45:27,164 --> 01:45:32,926
We have fountains in the facility so that water is flowing constantly.

1345
01:45:33,426 --> 01:45:37,268
It's not gonna be a dry, smelly place.

1346
01:45:38,608 --> 01:45:46,071
With the noise, so when, sorry, if I may, we had our rendering.

1347
01:45:47,691 --> 01:45:49,413
Sorry, my apologies.

1348
01:45:52,495 --> 01:45:55,257
As you can see in the rendering, we have our vehicle bay.

1349
01:45:55,797 --> 01:46:02,241
And so how we will stop the potential issue of when dogs come in, they just come out and start barking.

1350
01:46:02,642 --> 01:46:03,822
You pull into the vehicle bay.

1351
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:05,923
both of these gates will be closed.

1352
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:13,906
The dogs are let into a door into the inside facility where they will, you know, we have this fence right here, so they are let inside.

1353
01:46:14,426 --> 01:46:17,407
They run, they do their barking and whatnot.

1354
01:46:17,427 --> 01:46:24,569
We try and facilitate that, calm them down, keep them cool, get their energy out, get their barking energy out while they are inside.

1355
01:46:25,069 --> 01:46:29,190
Then we open that gate and they are let outside once they are in a calm and collected manner.

1356
01:46:31,876 --> 01:46:36,197
Okay, I will tell you, I didn't witness that in that daycare.

1357
01:46:36,738 --> 01:46:37,698
You did or did not?

1358
01:46:37,718 --> 01:46:38,078
I did not.

1359
01:46:38,598 --> 01:46:40,139
Well, we, that's.

1360
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,880
I saw that, I mean, I'm just, I know it sounds, I appreciate the hard work.

1361
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:44,740
Yeah, no, absolutely.

1362
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:50,522
But I just, once they were let out, there's no guarantees that the dog's gonna stop barking, correct?

1363
01:46:51,087 --> 01:47:16,349
Absolutely and actually if I could just add on to that I mean one of the reasons why Nick and I wanted to open a doggie daycare is visiting some of the places we saw and witnessed what you had and so we asked people right now when we do our play groups where we might have 10-15 dogs we aren't experiencing that and I think it's some of the engagement by us having so many people on our dog to you know a person ratio by us going above and beyond having some of the activity courses and

1364
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:20,333
They are running around and playing, so they're not barking because they're in an agility course.

1365
01:47:21,154 --> 01:47:22,435
And we're trying to keep them busy.

1366
01:47:22,675 --> 01:47:23,936
I'm not saying it's going to be perfect.

1367
01:47:23,976 --> 01:47:26,999
We're not going to lie to you guys and say there won't be any barking.

1368
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,200
We all know dogs bark.

1369
01:47:29,282 --> 01:47:29,602
Thank you.

1370
01:47:30,663 --> 01:47:31,283
Councilor Belco.

1371
01:47:31,324 --> 01:47:32,164
Thank you, Mr. President.

1372
01:47:32,264 --> 01:47:35,868
I want to thank you for your presentation and thank you for your interest in opening up a business here.

1373
01:47:38,295 --> 01:47:42,981
So you mentioned earlier that you could possibly have 50 dogs at once.

1374
01:47:43,762 --> 01:47:46,545
But you did say, well, maybe 20 or 30 out at one time.

1375
01:47:46,605 --> 01:47:54,515
If you had a maximum capacity of 50 dogs at one time, could you possibly have 50 dogs out in that area at one point in time, at the same time?

1376
01:47:55,757 --> 01:47:56,838
Would you like to answer?

1377
01:47:57,058 --> 01:47:57,158
OK.

1378
01:47:58,868 --> 01:48:02,050
It is possible, but very highly unlikely.

1379
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:11,155
We have, like I said, we have a very large garage-sized space inside, as well as a secondary inside space for the little dogs.

1380
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:19,160
So say we have 50 dogs there, 15 of them are small dogs, they are in the little dog section, which is mostly inside.

1381
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,823
So the large dogs will be, let's see, 50 dogs minus 15 would be 35.

1382
01:48:25,223 --> 01:48:28,305
There would be 35 dogs between the inside and outside space.

1383
01:48:28,866 --> 01:48:35,390
The dogs are allowed in and out once they have calmed down, like we said, and we have gone through the inside and after the vehicle bay and whatnot.

1384
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,451
And they are allowed to roam in and out.

1385
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:46,938
So between that 35 dogs that are left on the in and outside space, some may be napping, some may be playing, some may be outside rolling around.

1386
01:48:47,698 --> 01:48:52,622
And so you won't have all 35 of those dogs running around, barking, playing.

1387
01:48:53,282 --> 01:48:57,325
Many are going to be napping or playing tug of war with each other inside.

1388
01:48:57,345 --> 01:49:03,970
There are many other things that dogs can do besides just outside playing, because they get tired very easily.

1389
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:09,122
And I apologize, I was trying to read this at the same time as you're presenting.

1390
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:12,724
So as far as the, what is the inside of that building?

1391
01:49:12,784 --> 01:49:16,406
How many rooms are we talking as far as, do you have any insight?

1392
01:49:17,386 --> 01:49:17,967
Sorry, so.

1393
01:49:19,548 --> 01:49:19,948
Actually.

1394
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:27,753
Yes, so our architect, can we actually allow him to speak and present to you guys?

1395
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:28,413
That's fine with me.

1396
01:49:30,325 --> 01:49:33,107
I'm Dominic Valenti, 571 Main Street, Bedford.

1397
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:35,209
The existing building is a tri-level building.

1398
01:49:53,255 --> 01:50:02,997
which is at the bottom of that sheet right there, and which has a new handicap ramp being installed for accessibility, is the office area.

1399
01:50:03,757 --> 01:50:20,241
And through a pair of doors that are in the ramp, the dog can either go down the dog slide, or they can be taken down the stairs and into the middle level, which is the garage, the existing garage.

1400
01:50:21,758 --> 01:50:26,740
Attached to the middle level is the basement underneath the first floor entryway.

1401
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:33,182
So the dogs really are down in, we'll say, the basement level, the garage level.

1402
01:50:34,963 --> 01:50:39,144
They enter probably at the upper level, but they're not going to be there.

1403
01:50:39,465 --> 01:50:47,628
They're either in the outside plan or inside plan, or the little ones are inside plan, which is down at the basement level.

1404
01:50:52,233 --> 01:50:52,974
Okay, thank you very much.

1405
01:50:53,114 --> 01:51:00,821
As far as, so I've received a few calls from neighbors saying the space here is industrial space, or it used to be industrial space.

1406
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:02,142
It's an industrial zone.

1407
01:51:02,802 --> 01:51:07,366
Can you talk a little bit about, because I had a couple people call me about safety.

1408
01:51:08,087 --> 01:51:10,789
Since it was at one time industrial, is it safe for dogs?

1409
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:14,332
Can you maybe talk a little bit more about the turf as well?

1410
01:51:15,713 --> 01:51:17,914
Do you want to take that, sir?

1411
01:51:18,374 --> 01:51:22,695
Yes, so as far as the street being industrial, yes it is.

1412
01:51:23,275 --> 01:51:34,898
The dogs will not be out in the street, so they come in onto our property, and as you can see, so they come in onto our property, which will be clean as this is just pavement.

1413
01:51:34,958 --> 01:51:38,919
We have had an environmental study done on the building.

1414
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,060
Everything is safe and good for dogs.

1415
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:47,184
And so this will actually be torn up and put turf down.

1416
01:51:47,264 --> 01:51:53,388
So all of the pavement will actually be torn up, made sure it's safe for the dogs, and the turf is actually laid down.

1417
01:51:53,528 --> 01:52:01,993
So everything will be safe for the dogs, including the inside, which we will have extra flooring laid down to ensure that everything is safe and good for the dogs.

1418
01:52:07,578 --> 01:52:21,919
There's an electronically gate that comes all the way through it's actually pretty state-of-the-art very cool So when you first drive on to the property bay, you actually have to go through an electronic service gate so if our vans which can actually

1419
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:29,987
be seen right here, come in with a stream of dogs, then they would have, the gate is automatically closed behind them.

1420
01:52:30,548 --> 01:52:37,575
As they pull into the auto bay, there is another gate that closes automatically, so they would have to leave two gates.

1421
01:52:38,155 --> 01:52:40,356
to go to leave our property.

1422
01:52:40,776 --> 01:52:43,097
Our employees will be housed with walkie-talkies.

1423
01:52:43,537 --> 01:52:46,819
If an emergency were to arrive, they would be able to talk to one another.

1424
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:50,760
But the street right now, as you mentioned, it is a very industrial area.

1425
01:52:51,561 --> 01:52:54,582
There are some residentials across the street, but it is very safe.

1426
01:52:54,762 --> 01:52:56,023
There are dogs that live there now.

1427
01:52:57,546 --> 01:53:10,560
As far as the turf goes, I think of repetitive use if you have 20, 30 dogs here a day that are outside and peeing and whatnot.

1428
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:12,081
What's the life expectancy of the turf?

1429
01:53:12,101 --> 01:53:13,062
How long is that going to last?

1430
01:53:13,102 --> 01:53:14,704
May I have our turf experts speak on that?

1431
01:53:15,404 --> 01:53:15,905
Absolutely.

1432
01:53:18,927 --> 01:53:19,087
Hi.

1433
01:53:19,187 --> 01:53:20,568
John Buckley, Mansfield, Massachusetts.

1434
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:24,151
I'm the operations director for Evalon, Massachusetts, located in Hanover.

1435
01:53:25,192 --> 01:53:29,214
For an application such as this, this is our canine tariff, which we would be installing here.

1436
01:53:29,234 --> 01:53:31,936
It's a tariff specifically designed for this application.

1437
01:53:31,956 --> 01:53:37,741
The only thing in mind is for basically dog owners, whether it be residential or commercial applications such as this.

1438
01:53:38,962 --> 01:53:52,962
Life expectancy of this turf with the amount of dogs and the wear that it's going to take, I would put it at about upwards of 15 years from the time it's installed until it would likely have to be replaced.

1439
01:53:54,075 --> 01:53:58,338
I'm just thinking with that many dogs over time, there's definitely a concern about odor.

1440
01:53:58,638 --> 01:53:59,079
Sure.

1441
01:53:59,099 --> 01:54:01,600
That's in the neighborhood, so that's.

1442
01:54:01,621 --> 01:54:16,311
Yeah, so other doggy daycare facilities that we install this turf at, most try a different route at first, whether it be P-stone, turf that's not applicable for doggy daycares such as this.

1443
01:54:17,052 --> 01:54:21,035
And what happens is there's a huge, I know we've already touched upon, a huge drainage problem.

1444
01:54:22,335 --> 01:54:28,298
Conventional turfs, if you turn it upside down like this, it just has punch holes that are drain holes.

1445
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:34,461
But this, as we hold it up to the light, I don't know if you guys can see that or not, but you can see through it basically.

1446
01:54:34,481 --> 01:54:35,641
It's completely permeable.

1447
01:54:36,942 --> 01:54:43,985
So liquids pass through this at a rate of over 400 inches of liquid an hour.

1448
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:47,246
Conventional turfs, if someone were to use something else,

1449
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:49,728
30, 40 inches.

1450
01:54:50,749 --> 01:54:52,570
So the drainage is impeccable.

1451
01:54:53,431 --> 01:54:59,195
Every blade is treated with a product called Alpha San, which is an antimicrobial agent.

1452
01:54:59,215 --> 01:55:07,802
So that cuts down on, obviously, bacteria growth and, hence, odors that, again, other facilities experience because they don't have those controls in place.

1453
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:32,510
As far as the how is it how high is the fence eight feet Yes, there is currently an eight-foot fence there and we were actually going to erect an additional eight-foot fence So we will have two eight-foot fences there to all the way around all the way around it as far as

1454
01:55:38,393 --> 01:55:41,535
I think of 20, 30 dogs, I'm thinking a lot of waste.

1455
01:55:42,536 --> 01:55:47,739
And I'm thinking of odor, I'm thinking the residents, that could be a major problem.

1456
01:55:48,139 --> 01:55:51,280
But you're only removing waste once a week.

1457
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,841
That sounds like that could be an issue.

1458
01:55:57,062 --> 01:55:58,042
Let me explain to you.

1459
01:55:59,003 --> 01:56:06,368
A typical dog, I believe we spoke about this once before, a typical dog excretes about three quarters pound of waste per day.

1460
01:56:07,128 --> 01:56:11,191
So if we're going to just, let's just average it double the amount of dogs that we would have.

1461
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:19,397
If we average it 100 dogs a day, for five days a week, we're open for daycare, it comes to about 375 pounds of waste per week.

1462
01:56:19,777 --> 01:56:20,538
That sounds like a lot.

1463
01:56:21,298 --> 01:56:26,727
but if it's picked up by our weekly dumpster service, our 10-gallon barrels hold up about 80 pounds of waste.

1464
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:35,941
If we only put 65 pounds in those 10-gallon barrels, we'll only have about five to six 10-gallon trash bags a week in our dumpster.

1465
01:56:36,762 --> 01:56:41,605
That's, you know, five to six bags of trash, that's your average household sometimes.

1466
01:56:41,966 --> 01:56:42,946
I mean, people with a lot of trash.

1467
01:56:44,467 --> 01:56:54,214
So, five to six, 10 gallon bags of trash in a dumpster that's locked and closed is, and smells, yeah, smells won't escape any of these barrels containing dog waste.

1468
01:56:55,095 --> 01:57:00,819
So, they're only open for a very small amount of time, split second.

1469
01:57:05,008 --> 01:57:14,034
No, I was just going to comment into your, Councillor Dela Russa, they are the same exact cans that are currently used at dog parks now.

1470
01:57:14,134 --> 01:57:15,695
So they have a safety seal on it.

1471
01:57:16,075 --> 01:57:18,236
So smell and odor is not admitted from it.

1472
01:57:19,957 --> 01:57:20,257
Thank you.

1473
01:57:20,598 --> 01:57:20,978
Thank you.

1474
01:57:22,459 --> 01:57:23,119
Councillor Locario.

1475
01:57:25,701 --> 01:57:28,362
Can you explain, so you explained there's going to be two fences.

1476
01:57:29,243 --> 01:57:31,304
Can you explain, it looks like there's a tree buffer.

1477
01:57:33,574 --> 01:57:39,016
Is it only going to be on one side of the floor and how tall are the trees going to be?

1478
01:57:39,396 --> 01:57:39,656
Yes.

1479
01:57:41,717 --> 01:57:42,777
Thank you for that question.

1480
01:57:43,237 --> 01:57:51,059
So if I may, it would actually be in the back side of the building where right now that's focused.

1481
01:57:51,099 --> 01:57:52,460
So we are on Linden Street.

1482
01:57:54,837 --> 01:57:55,638
here.

1483
01:57:55,678 --> 01:58:07,068
The reason being is such as we actually have a company over here where we would not be able to plant some of the trees, but we will be able to plant them all.

1484
01:58:07,928 --> 01:58:12,733
And as they grow, we will install the highest that we can possibly do and we just didn't grow.

1485
01:58:13,571 --> 01:58:18,738
Currently this picture, you will see there are trees already there between us and Linden Street.

1486
01:58:19,398 --> 01:58:22,983
So we would assume they would go natural over the decades.

1487
01:58:23,003 --> 01:58:25,947
We hope to be in the city of Medford to be 15 feet flush trees.

1488
01:58:30,467 --> 01:58:31,188
Councilor Russo.

1489
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:32,449
Mr. President, thank you.

1490
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:39,915
I want to thank the petitioners for choosing Medford to open your business and to go through the fine work that you've done.

1491
01:58:39,975 --> 01:58:43,057
I'm particularly impressed with the architectural renderings.

1492
01:58:43,678 --> 01:58:45,739
You've selected a very good architect, I must say.

1493
01:58:47,721 --> 01:59:02,874
I want to get back to and I Not ever my practice to beat a dead horse But I want to get back to one of the press questions that council Scott Kelly asked And that is about the noise and sound of dogs.

1494
01:59:02,894 --> 01:59:02,914
I

1495
01:59:03,996 --> 01:59:28,723
You've made the case and I agree with you that that's a area that has noise in it But this is a new and different type of noise One of the rare moments in each day that I have peace and quiet is early in the morning before the Hecticness of my business gets going I sit out in the back of my office in the garage door and

1496
01:59:29,703 --> 01:59:32,744
And it's as close as I get to being in the wilderness.

1497
01:59:32,824 --> 01:59:34,025
And there's squirrels.

1498
01:59:34,625 --> 01:59:38,406
And the rabbits, which have infested Medford.

1499
01:59:39,246 --> 01:59:42,608
And the robins chasing the squirrels.

1500
01:59:43,328 --> 01:59:45,729
And the starlings chasing the robins.

1501
01:59:46,129 --> 01:59:48,850
And the grackles chasing the sparrows.

1502
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:52,671
And so I have a wonderful time enjoying nature.

1503
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:54,432
And in the midst of that,

1504
01:59:55,192 --> 02:00:13,285
Traversing my property are many of my dear neighbors who walk their dogs through there and they're lovely and one by one they come but when they intersect they get loud and they start to bark and they get a little out of control and

1505
02:00:14,798 --> 02:00:38,804
So I notice that, and as someone who doesn't own a dog, I see that in interaction, whether it's right in front of me when people are just stopping by, or at a distance out on the back road behind my office when people are just crossing and avoiding each other to stay away, to keep the dogs away from each other, and going on opposite sides of the street.

1506
02:00:39,384 --> 02:00:43,545
So I know Councilor Scarpelli asked about the

1507
02:00:44,305 --> 02:00:46,086
the dogs and the noise.

1508
02:00:47,388 --> 02:01:01,078
You explained you're receiving a process on how dogs are allowed to come in and they go into a gated area and they have a little time to decompress and acclimate themselves to a new environment.

1509
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:11,947
And I'm sure all the smells of other dogs and the course of nature they have between girl dogs and boy dogs and all that gets some of them wound up.

1510
02:01:12,547 --> 02:01:34,635
But I'm concerned to add in a neighborhood that is zoned industrial, is zoned for noise, that has, even though by exception, has become and pretends to become even more residential, or at least mixed use.

1511
02:01:35,416 --> 02:01:38,277
And so could you just talk again about

1512
02:01:38,937 --> 02:02:08,105
the issue of noise and how the addition of a new unique noise other than front end loaders backing up with their little beeps and that type of stuff, which the neighborhood is used to and has grown accustomed to, how does adding and interjecting a new and particular noise, which residents there are not accustomed to,

1513
02:02:08,895 --> 02:02:12,859
and how you're going to deal with that.

1514
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:15,122
Thank you for your question.

1515
02:02:15,642 --> 02:02:22,069
There was two actually, and let me start with the first one for choosing Medford, because we actually have your President Carviello to thank for that.

1516
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:27,514
I had sent him an email in early January, and he replied right away saying, come to Medford.

1517
02:02:27,574 --> 02:02:28,275
It's a great city.

1518
02:02:28,355 --> 02:02:31,599
So thank you, President Carviello, for being the one to bring us to Medford.

1519
02:02:32,737 --> 02:02:38,202
In regards to the noise question, I'd like to refer you to what the street looks like currently now.

1520
02:02:38,682 --> 02:02:44,848
You will see that there are several construction companies on the area as our abutters.

1521
02:02:45,308 --> 02:02:47,030
Next to us is Cardi Construction.

1522
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:48,711
On the other side is Burst Construction.

1523
02:02:49,172 --> 02:02:52,855
They are large construction companies that operate

1524
02:02:59,468 --> 02:03:23,000
blowers every time we have gone there it's been very hard to hear yourself so I definitely agree that it is a noisy area as it is so our addition of having the dogs probably will add a little bit of noise but what is there currently between the construction companies going and operating in and out we do think that it's actually the perfect place to put a doggy day

1525
02:03:26,222 --> 02:03:35,146
I would like to note one thing, that when I was there meeting with the fence guy, I spent about 45 minutes with him, you know, taking tour of the property.

1526
02:03:35,686 --> 02:03:42,509
And during that time, as we said previously, there are dogs that live on the street, and you stated that this would be a new noise.

1527
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:50,133
During that 45 minutes, one of the residential dogs that lived on the street barked the entire 45 minutes.

1528
02:03:51,013 --> 02:03:54,675
So, this dog, you know, that you're,

1529
02:03:56,259 --> 02:04:01,022
Basically, this is no new noise, as people who have dogs have dogs that bark.

1530
02:04:01,483 --> 02:04:21,517
And with this business, we'll be taking the barking dogs out of the neighborhoods and out of the houses that are currently barking because they want to get out, they want to play, they want to make friends, bringing them to our facility, getting them nice and tired, and allowing them to get their energy out in the correct and right ways and not just bark all day and annoy their neighbors.

1531
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:28,470
Carlos Del Rosso, you finished?

1532
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:30,111
I'm done.

1533
02:04:30,451 --> 02:04:30,751
Thank you.

1534
02:04:31,032 --> 02:04:31,812
Vice President Mox.

1535
02:04:33,352 --> 02:04:34,253
Thank you, Mr. President.

1536
02:04:35,713 --> 02:04:55,502
Over the past, actually now three years, I have had the unique opportunity to serve on a committee in the community, self-appointed, Patty Flynn's in the audience here, of residents that got together about three years ago and created our own committee to look into the need for a dog park in the city.

1537
02:04:56,342 --> 02:04:57,403
And we did our homework.

1538
02:04:57,523 --> 02:05:00,164
We found a grant through the Stanton Foundation.

1539
02:05:01,105 --> 02:05:02,626
We sent out surveys.

1540
02:05:02,986 --> 02:05:05,428
We created a committee pause for method.

1541
02:05:05,848 --> 02:05:07,049
We've held fundraisers.

1542
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:13,893
And I can tell you firsthand experience working with this committee and also trying to find a location.

1543
02:05:14,413 --> 02:05:15,954
as you just said, the perfect location.

1544
02:05:16,395 --> 02:05:19,417
Trying to find a location was the toughest part of it all.

1545
02:05:20,358 --> 02:05:24,020
And I won't speak for you, Patty, because you found the grant for us.

1546
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:29,344
But it was the toughest part to find where we could put a dog park.

1547
02:05:29,964 --> 02:05:32,646
And naturally, what we've heard already is noise.

1548
02:05:33,607 --> 02:05:40,892
We didn't want to be in an area that was surrounded with homes because we knew the neighborhood would come out and say, you know what, we want a dog park, but not in my neighborhood.

1549
02:05:42,193 --> 02:05:46,837
We knew that if it was downstream from the park, you're going to get odors and smells and so forth.

1550
02:05:47,318 --> 02:06:04,672
So after doing our homework and due diligence and sending out a citywide survey, which I wouldn't expect you to do, but we came to a point of picking behind the McGlynn School on Riverbend Park, which we all believe it's handicap accessible, it's a great location and so forth.

1551
02:06:05,232 --> 02:06:10,217
And the primary goal was to stay away from residential homes.

1552
02:06:11,117 --> 02:06:12,478
And I think we accomplished that.

1553
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:15,721
Right, the new dog park you have on the list.

1554
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:16,762
I'm glad to see that.

1555
02:06:19,504 --> 02:06:27,751
It's currently under construction and we're looking in the next few months to have a full-fledged dog park in the city for both small and large dogs.

1556
02:06:28,192 --> 02:06:31,635
But needless to say, that was the obstacle.

1557
02:06:31,815 --> 02:06:36,279
And we sat through countless presentations on the use of turf.

1558
02:06:36,739 --> 02:06:37,699
versus peastone.

1559
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:53,246
We ultimately visited a number of parks in Arlington and Somerville and found that peastone with proper irrigation was the best solution we felt to eradicate not everything but a lot of the odor.

1560
02:06:54,086 --> 02:06:58,228
And that was through the experts and consultants that we brought on board.

1561
02:06:58,929 --> 02:07:02,150
And I'm a little concerned that even though your turf sounds great,

1562
02:07:03,619 --> 02:07:05,200
There is no formal irrigation.

1563
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:09,201
I know it leaches through and then it goes somewhere, you said.

1564
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:10,842
I don't know where that somewhere is.

1565
02:07:11,262 --> 02:07:17,165
But it doesn't seem like there's a formal irrigation process, which I know in a dog park,

1566
02:07:17,776 --> 02:07:27,846
And I'm sure in a type of setting that you have would be paramount to making sure that the odor is subsided to have this irrigation.

1567
02:07:28,207 --> 02:07:32,791
So I was wondering if you can answer that irrigation question as well as

1568
02:07:35,013 --> 02:07:36,094
I know you're before us tonight.

1569
02:07:36,975 --> 02:07:37,576
I'm interested.

1570
02:07:37,596 --> 02:07:39,738
Are there other sites that you looked at in the community?

1571
02:07:39,798 --> 02:07:46,666
Are there other areas that you say, you know what, this would be a great area, but we were unable to do this or that?

1572
02:07:47,767 --> 02:07:49,509
Because I'd be interested in seeing other

1573
02:07:50,069 --> 02:07:58,015
Our committee for years said that, and we estimated at the time we had over 9,000 dogs in the city.

1574
02:07:58,575 --> 02:08:06,101
And as the city clerk would attest to you, we register, license probably 350 dogs, 400 dogs a year.

1575
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:11,865
And the reason why it's not because people don't want to license their dog is because we're not a dog-friendly city.

1576
02:08:12,905 --> 02:08:14,147
Really, it's true.

1577
02:08:15,148 --> 02:08:28,960
And the purpose of creating a dog park was actually to make it more of a dog friendly city and also by the creation, giving an incentive to people if they want to use the park, they have to register their dog.

1578
02:08:29,638 --> 02:08:32,644
and so forth, and that will pay for the maintenance and so forth, the upkeep.

1579
02:08:33,145 --> 02:08:43,022
So I was wondering if you could answer the irrigation process and also what other locations did you look at and the reason why they weren't selected?

1580
02:08:43,337 --> 02:09:03,292
So before Michelle touches on that subject, and we bring our turf guy, just along the lines of when you said you guys surveyed the entire city, obviously two people couldn't accomplish something like that, but we did make an attempt to go door-to-door, and we got many petitions signed for people who would like this, so I would like to submit this to you guys, if that is possible.

1581
02:09:05,174 --> 02:09:05,634
To the clerk.

1582
02:09:05,714 --> 02:09:09,697
So let me just discuss, because you asked great questions about council parties,

1583
02:09:16,629 --> 02:09:18,132
You have to talk in the microphone.

1584
02:09:18,873 --> 02:09:19,735
Yeah, we have it.

1585
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:36,382
As you guys know, the zoning, and you in particularly, Officer Marks, that this is a very tough place to choose.

1586
02:09:36,863 --> 02:09:43,145
The only place that we could actually choose is in that purple area down in the bottom area right here.

1587
02:09:43,325 --> 02:09:47,487
If you see, it is marked industrial, the very bottom corner right there.

1588
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:54,009
The two industrial locations are the Wellington Square and this other particular area for us.

1589
02:09:54,469 --> 02:10:01,992
And so, unfortunately, the real estate that has been available to us, there was only two properties that we were able to choose from.

1590
02:10:02,952 --> 02:10:04,673
One of them was not deemed suitable.

1591
02:10:05,033 --> 02:10:06,273
It was too large.

1592
02:10:06,653 --> 02:10:13,616
And to be honest with you, we actually tried to acquire it, but our bank, after looking, who was the expert in this, said it was not feasible.

1593
02:10:13,996 --> 02:10:17,517
So, 29 Linden Street was the only property that we were actually left with.

1594
02:10:18,117 --> 02:10:23,502
If we could identify another place, I can tell you on a personal level, we would take it.

1595
02:10:23,923 --> 02:10:34,252
We absolutely have looked and scoured and continue, our real estate has continued to look for other places, but this particular building absolutely perfectly suits not only our needs,

1596
02:10:34,572 --> 02:10:37,454
but your residence needs as well as where it's located.

1597
02:10:37,954 --> 02:10:43,657
The new Petco is right down the street from there, as well as the dog park is about two blocks away.

1598
02:10:44,037 --> 02:10:46,518
So it is a perfect location on that sense.

1599
02:10:47,839 --> 02:11:03,588
As far as, again, like I said, other sites, we have continued throughout the last nine, 10 months to look as new real estate becomes available, but as you know, Medford is a very, very hot city right now, and there isn't a lot of buildings for sale and or for lease, unfortunately.

1600
02:11:05,269 --> 02:11:10,412
As regards to peastone and irrigation, so I would like to turn that over to you to respond to that.

1601
02:11:10,652 --> 02:11:14,415
Yeah, I can comment on the peastone and lack of an irrigation system.

1602
02:11:15,516 --> 02:11:19,979
A lot of the facilities that we go into that are very similar to this in size.

1603
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:23,821
We actually removed peastone because the owners have found it's not working.

1604
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:24,621
It smells.

1605
02:11:25,241 --> 02:11:25,962
Dogs eat it.

1606
02:11:26,022 --> 02:11:27,042
It's not safe for them.

1607
02:11:27,582 --> 02:11:31,084
They want, you know, a safe product such as the canine turf here.

1608
02:11:31,104 --> 02:11:37,187
So there's been several instances that we've done that, even one this year, a place called the Secret Garden East Bridgewater.

1609
02:11:37,627 --> 02:11:43,050
We removed yard upon yard upon yard of their peastone and replaced it with our canine grass.

1610
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:46,472
Lack of an irrigation system I can address.

1611
02:11:47,412 --> 02:12:06,003
In the seven years that we've been installing this, we've never had a smell complaint from a place and we've never had a place say that they felt they needed to add an irrigation system that just hosing the turf down on a daily basis was sufficient and that a system such as that did not need to be added to a facility.

1612
02:12:07,444 --> 02:12:12,487
So just if I can add then, where exactly, once it goes underneath your dog turf,

1613
02:12:13,242 --> 02:12:15,285
does it go into your property?

1614
02:12:15,646 --> 02:12:17,468
Does it just leach into the ground directly below?

1615
02:12:17,488 --> 02:12:18,650
Yeah, so it'll just go in the substrate.

1616
02:12:19,792 --> 02:12:22,936
So it's not draining to a particular area, there's no slope where it may drain to?

1617
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:48,281
I mean, it's I don't think anything would ever get quick enough to run off and to get to one particular area There's yeah, you know, there's I mean there is some there is some slope to the property as I know when I was there But yeah, I mean nothing's gonna be flowing enough in that manner that you know that it's gonna kind of congregate to one area I should say Another question I have is

1618
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:55,842
What other type of services will you be providing at that particular site?

1619
02:12:56,022 --> 02:12:58,183
Will you be doing dog walking?

1620
02:12:58,223 --> 02:12:59,704
Will you be doing any type of grooming?

1621
02:13:00,164 --> 02:13:01,964
Will there be any type of other services offered?

1622
02:13:02,484 --> 02:13:03,745
Yeah, do you want to take it?

1623
02:13:04,145 --> 02:13:05,005
Yes, absolutely.

1624
02:13:05,125 --> 02:13:07,786
We will be providing a multitude of services.

1625
02:13:07,906 --> 02:13:11,347
We have two grooming tubs downstairs for doggy baths.

1626
02:13:12,287 --> 02:13:13,848
We'll be having training after

1627
02:13:15,068 --> 02:13:16,628
a certain amount of time once we hire a trainer.

1628
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:24,210
We will also be providing walks, so some of our employees will be out walking the dogs that can't come to the daycare.

1629
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:29,031
We provide runs and hikes in the woods that won't be at the facility.

1630
02:13:29,791 --> 02:13:36,073
And as previously stated, we have an agility course, so we have some agility ramps for the dogs to do as well.

1631
02:13:36,093 --> 02:13:38,033
Did I miss anything?

1632
02:13:39,214 --> 02:13:40,734
Yeah, sorry, those are all of our services.

1633
02:13:41,737 --> 02:13:46,999
And just if I could, what is your cost for an average stay?

1634
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:50,361
What our overhead cost is?

1635
02:13:50,681 --> 02:13:58,424
If I'm a client, what does it cost me to take my dog there and have him run?

1636
02:13:58,444 --> 02:13:59,745
$35 a day.

1637
02:13:59,765 --> 02:14:02,606
$35, and that covers, that's not any grooming, correct?

1638
02:14:02,686 --> 02:14:07,688
That is not grooming, but that would be pick up, drop off services and an entire day of daycare.

1639
02:14:08,555 --> 02:14:10,337
And what percent of your business is overnight?

1640
02:14:10,577 --> 02:14:11,798
Who are your house dogs overnight?

1641
02:14:12,579 --> 02:14:15,582
It's actually a small percentage of our business, to be honest with you.

1642
02:14:15,622 --> 02:14:24,711
Most people require daycare, so I would say we're looking more in the 20% of people who will want boarding.

1643
02:14:24,731 --> 02:14:26,533
So 20% of your business is overnight?

1644
02:14:29,263 --> 02:14:34,467
Other places right now, and it goes to the amount of dogs, most places are looking for daycare.

1645
02:14:34,508 --> 02:14:36,849
We have a lot of clients here who can tell you how we operate.

1646
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:39,612
We pick up their dog eight, nine o'clock in the morning.

1647
02:14:39,972 --> 02:14:45,797
We exercise them, be it whether they want us to hike or fels, and then we drop them off when they come home, five or six.

1648
02:14:46,197 --> 02:14:48,940
Sometimes they want it at three, depending on what the hours are.

1649
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:52,042
When the wife comes home, the kids come home, so there's always a cycle of kids.

1650
02:14:52,483 --> 02:14:57,387
The boarding is more when people go away, so it is not a big percentage of our business.

1651
02:14:58,093 --> 02:15:01,874
Okay, and what off-street parking do you have?

1652
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:06,256
Linden Street is a public parking place.

1653
02:15:06,976 --> 02:15:07,837
Is it off-street?

1654
02:15:07,857 --> 02:15:08,317
Oh, off-street.

1655
02:15:08,537 --> 02:15:09,437
Off-street, yes.

1656
02:15:09,497 --> 02:15:14,919
We do have a parking lot in the front, behind our front electronic gate.

1657
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:23,243
So, it allows, as far as we have been able to test, between about four and five cars in the parking lot at once.

1658
02:15:24,463 --> 02:15:26,104
So no one will need to park on the street.

1659
02:15:26,425 --> 02:15:29,027
They can come right in, drop the dog off, and then leave.

1660
02:15:29,187 --> 02:15:34,491
We have drop off hours so that people aren't coming in and out at all times of day.

1661
02:15:35,592 --> 02:15:45,440
But as we previously stated, that about 80 or 90% of our clients do use the complimentary pick up and drop off service because most others charge for that.

1662
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:50,164
And so people really love the fact that we just come right to them, pick the dog up.

1663
02:15:50,744 --> 02:15:54,767
and so we won't have much foot traffic or parking out front needed.

1664
02:15:57,208 --> 02:16:01,090
And if you could speak a little more about, I wasn't aware there was a basement in this building.

1665
02:16:01,451 --> 02:16:01,651
Yes.

1666
02:16:01,931 --> 02:16:07,014
The dogs have access to go down through some type of shaft, you said, or something like that?

1667
02:16:07,354 --> 02:16:10,376
Yeah, so, it is not a shaft.

1668
02:16:11,737 --> 02:16:12,517
I guarantee you.

1669
02:16:12,537 --> 02:16:15,880
So, if you would like to hold this up.

1670
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:22,502
Sorry, let me get my bearings straight here.

1671
02:16:25,423 --> 02:16:28,044
Perfect, okay, so this is the front office to our building.

1672
02:16:28,644 --> 02:16:39,948
They have the chance to come down and go down into the basement, so there is a stairway that goes right down under our basement area, and there is also a doggie ramp that is a nice gentle slope, it is not a shaft.

1673
02:16:40,968 --> 02:16:49,010
And so they have the choice to come down into the basement where, you know, it's technically a basement, but it has several windows.

1674
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:57,292
When I say several, it's about 15 windows lining the whole basement because it is semi, the ceiling is above ground level.

1675
02:16:58,192 --> 02:17:03,533
And so they have the chance to come down into the basement and down into the large garage area.

1676
02:17:05,193 --> 02:17:07,354
Is the facility completely air conditioned?

1677
02:17:07,774 --> 02:17:08,894
Yes, and heated.

1678
02:17:14,916 --> 02:17:15,276
You're welcome.

1679
02:17:17,657 --> 02:17:19,318
One last follow-up through the chair.

1680
02:17:19,798 --> 02:17:26,000
With regards to, that was actually going to be a question of mine too, where does the pee go?

1681
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:36,724
With regards to if the turf expert can explain, you had mentioned that you haven't got any complaints about the smell or odor, especially if it's washed down once per day.

1682
02:17:38,024 --> 02:17:46,470
But what are you comparing that to as far as how large of projects have you done, how many facilities, what number of dogs have they housed?

1683
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:51,834
Yeah, I would compare that to very similar projects such as this.

1684
02:17:52,454 --> 02:17:55,716
We've done facilities that have upwards of 80 to 100 dogs a day.

1685
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:57,558
Some smaller, only 20 to 25.

1686
02:17:58,178 --> 02:18:01,020
But certainly have done facilities larger than this one.

1687
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:05,063
And yeah, we haven't experienced complaints such as that.

1688
02:18:06,643 --> 02:18:07,584
Thank you.

1689
02:18:07,604 --> 02:18:08,425
I have a couple of questions.

1690
02:18:10,086 --> 02:18:11,868
Your hours of operation are going to be what?

1691
02:18:20,415 --> 02:18:27,461
So we plan to have hours of operation between 9 to 5 where most residents will be at work.

1692
02:18:30,065 --> 02:18:33,687
it really will be a 24-hour facility that we would have attendance at the whole time.

1693
02:18:33,747 --> 02:18:37,450
No, but what time will people be able to bring their dog to you?

1694
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:38,230
Oh, okay.

1695
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:38,831
Oh, yep.

1696
02:18:38,991 --> 02:18:50,318
Yes, so we plan to have a one-hour drop-off time before opening, so between 8 and 9, and between 5 and 6 is when people are allowed to come and pick up and drop off their dogs.

1697
02:18:50,898 --> 02:18:53,320
Okay, so no one will be coming like at 10 o'clock at night?

1698
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,720
No, absolutely not.

1699
02:18:56,642 --> 02:18:58,723
Question, what do you do in the winter?

1700
02:19:01,016 --> 02:19:01,897
When you have 50 dogs.

1701
02:19:02,957 --> 02:19:06,359
So we shovel and snowblow, basically.

1702
02:19:07,199 --> 02:19:10,081
I mean, how does that chair hold in the winter?

1703
02:19:13,047 --> 02:19:14,408
Yeah, the turf's fine in the winter.

1704
02:19:15,008 --> 02:19:21,192
It's perfectly capable of being shoveled, snowblowed, so any conventional means of snow removal works just as well on the turf.

1705
02:19:21,792 --> 02:19:28,156
I mean, if you get snow off of it and there's some sun beating down on it, it's not going to be frozen throughout the whole winter.

1706
02:19:28,176 --> 02:19:33,159
It's just as comfortable and safe for the dogs in the winter as it is in the other three months of the year.

1707
02:19:33,559 --> 02:19:37,061
What happens to the drainage when the dogs are peeing and the ground is frozen?

1708
02:19:38,693 --> 02:19:43,159
So basically, I don't know if everyone is able to see this good enough.

1709
02:19:43,179 --> 02:19:47,404
So when I hold this up to the light here, you can see through all that right there.

1710
02:19:47,645 --> 02:19:56,736
So you have a permeable product, and then we put down the base that's underneath it, the gravel base that's underneath it.

1711
02:19:58,197 --> 02:20:01,339
liquids is still able to... It's going to freeze right on top of it.

1712
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:10,845
No, it's a lot of stone, so there's a lot of stone in there, so liquids can still permeate that, because you're always going to have voids and stuff in stone, it can still go through there.

1713
02:20:10,885 --> 02:20:13,727
So it's 365 days a year it's able to drain.

1714
02:20:17,009 --> 02:20:19,710
I have pictures of Linden Street with cars.

1715
02:20:22,632 --> 02:20:26,975
One side is completely full, almost to the top, and the other side is resident only parking.

1716
02:20:28,552 --> 02:20:34,579
If people stop parking cars on both sides, you're going to have 50 cars a day going down there.

1717
02:20:35,077 --> 02:20:35,217
Yeah.

1718
02:20:35,678 --> 02:20:37,259
Actually, thank you for that question.

1719
02:20:37,279 --> 02:20:37,979
A couple of things.

1720
02:20:38,219 --> 02:20:44,024
One, as mentioned, probably 90 percent of our clients do pick up and drop off, so we will have very minimal.

1721
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:46,246
Cars actually go there.

1722
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:48,707
It's more of a two-second.

1723
02:20:48,787 --> 02:20:52,430
Somebody would run in, drive into our property, drop off the dog.

1724
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:54,512
We normally will meet them at their end, and they're gone.

1725
02:20:55,132 --> 02:21:02,378
I believe, additionally, Chief Sacco, who has come down to visit our facility and felt that dogs for days would not pose any impact to traffic.

1726
02:21:02,858 --> 02:21:06,040
for our building in there, and included that in his report as well.

1727
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,921
We're very cognizant of that.

1728
02:21:08,321 --> 02:21:17,585
This is an important street for us, so we wouldn't want it lined with a bunch of people, hence why we do have, and hopefully maybe you guys have even seen some of our vehicles driving throughout the city of Medford now.

1729
02:21:17,965 --> 02:21:23,208
That's why we do require pickup, or we actually offer the pickup and drop-offs, so we don't have a bunch of congestion.

1730
02:21:24,241 --> 02:21:30,925
Getting back to the winter, when the dogs aren't able to, well, are you going to be able to house 50 dogs, 60 dogs in that building?

1731
02:21:32,366 --> 02:21:37,168
I have a dog also, and now he gets in the winter, he gets cold, he goes out the door, he says, I'm not going out.

1732
02:21:39,129 --> 02:21:39,370
Oh, yes.

1733
02:21:40,690 --> 02:21:45,553
Yes, we have a lot of dogs with cute little Christmas sweaters, and so, yes.

1734
02:21:45,853 --> 02:22:04,927
The answer is yes, and we will have a very state-of-the-art facility that will have not only air conditioning and heating, we have a very respectable Medford construction gentleman who has done this at several other places, who's providing state-of-the-art air conditioning and heating, and particularly for winter, so that there won't be a problem with dogs going outside.

1735
02:22:04,947 --> 02:22:09,130
I'm concerned about keeping them in the building.

1736
02:22:09,450 --> 02:22:15,175
Maybe you're saying this is winter, you might get a couple of days where you're not gonna have time to clear the outside.

1737
02:22:16,565 --> 02:22:18,105
Where do you walk these dogs?

1738
02:22:21,226 --> 02:22:28,447
So, I just want to note that, so before this, I worked at a doggie daycare that had no inside facility.

1739
02:22:29,067 --> 02:22:31,028
They had about 30,000 square feet outside.

1740
02:22:31,128 --> 02:22:37,549
They've been around for 20 years, working through the winter and through the summer, and they house about 200 dogs a day outside, and they've had zero,

1741
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:44,771
issue with winter dogs.

1742
02:22:45,092 --> 02:22:54,079
Some dogs don't necessarily want to play, but if you keep them moving, you keep them active, they stay warm, you make sure that we bring the cold dogs inside.

1743
02:22:54,560 --> 02:23:02,346
But with the amount of space that we have, we could definitely house a certain amount of dogs that need to be inside and need to be outside.

1744
02:23:02,987 --> 02:23:05,769
So you feel that 50 would be your maximum amount of dog you have there?

1745
02:23:06,069 --> 02:23:06,249
Yes.

1746
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:08,011
And how many do you plan to board at night?

1747
02:23:08,865 --> 02:23:17,376
So again, it would be based on need, but I would think there would be, if we look at our competition, they'd have anywhere from like 10 to 15, 20 dogs.

1748
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:23,203
If I had to ask you now, what would your maximum be of dogs staying over?

1749
02:23:25,744 --> 02:23:30,106
We would hope it would be more, but I would estimate right now that we're estimating about 20 dogs.

1750
02:23:30,126 --> 02:23:31,706
20 would be the max to stay open.

1751
02:23:31,726 --> 02:23:32,286
Complete max.

1752
02:23:32,346 --> 02:23:32,906
Complete max.

1753
02:23:33,126 --> 02:23:38,228
On average, your average boarding is between one and 10.

1754
02:23:39,788 --> 02:23:45,430
A very, very, very busy weekend is 10 or 15, and it's a weekend.

1755
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:51,672
It's not the whole month, it's just a couple of days, and it's not excessive in any way.

1756
02:23:53,167 --> 02:23:55,187
And how many people are you going to have during the day?

1757
02:23:56,528 --> 02:23:57,868
How many employees we will have?

1758
02:23:58,308 --> 02:24:00,928
So we were looking that we will have probably ten.

1759
02:24:01,729 --> 02:24:02,489
So... Oh, no.

1760
02:24:02,609 --> 02:24:04,749
Like, say... And they will... We will have ten employees.

1761
02:24:04,789 --> 02:24:08,250
On a normal Tuesday morning, and you get 50 dogs, how many employees do you have?

1762
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:08,730
Five.

1763
02:24:08,750 --> 02:24:08,970
Five.

1764
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:12,951
So you feel that one person can handle ten dogs?

1765
02:24:13,491 --> 02:24:13,891
Absolutely.

1766
02:24:13,931 --> 02:24:14,411
Absolutely.

1767
02:24:14,751 --> 02:24:17,731
In fact, that's less than the ratio of ASPCI and LICE.

1768
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:17,951
Okay.

1769
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:20,632
Thank you.

1770
02:24:21,758 --> 02:24:22,819
May I note one more thing?

1771
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:26,682
That's five employees plus the two of us.

1772
02:24:27,402 --> 02:24:36,590
So whether you believe that they can or can't handle, there's always two extra people there to handle any additional need for the dogs.

1773
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:39,952
Okay, well you said that one of you is not a dog trainer.

1774
02:24:41,370 --> 02:24:43,152
No, we're not dog trainers.

1775
02:24:43,232 --> 02:24:47,335
Are these people that are going to be there, they're going to have dog experience?

1776
02:24:47,836 --> 02:24:49,397
Yes, well, yes.

1777
02:24:49,437 --> 02:24:53,380
Are they just going to be, you know, 20-year-old kids, you know, walking dogs?

1778
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:53,681
No.

1779
02:24:53,701 --> 02:24:57,824
We generally only hire people with dog experience and we train them very well.

1780
02:24:58,285 --> 02:25:07,413
I usually spend about two weeks training each boy to ensure that they are good with the dogs and good with the clients and to make sure that they actually do know what they're doing.

1781
02:25:09,096 --> 02:25:12,959
And if I may, just to go back to walking the dogs, twofold on that.

1782
02:25:13,259 --> 02:25:16,021
One, the walking dog is a service that we offer now.

1783
02:25:16,261 --> 02:25:21,464
It's not necessarily people come to Dogs for Days at 29 Linden Street to have their dog walked.

1784
02:25:21,825 --> 02:25:24,326
We bring our cars over, we walk dogs in a group.

1785
02:25:24,686 --> 02:25:34,373
The other reason why we chose this area, if I may, refer you to this map, is there is down across the street,

1786
02:25:38,419 --> 02:25:44,341
So we will be bringing dogs into our bay, put them in the car, and walk them over here.

1787
02:25:44,401 --> 02:25:45,802
We won't necessarily walk them.

1788
02:25:45,822 --> 02:25:47,862
So you'll be taking your dogs to our new dog park?

1789
02:25:48,903 --> 02:25:49,063
No.

1790
02:25:49,303 --> 02:25:52,184
If Patty will let us.

1791
02:25:56,072 --> 02:26:00,116
No, I'm not joking, but you'll be taking 20 dogs to a dog park?

1792
02:26:00,136 --> 02:26:01,618
No, absolutely not.

1793
02:26:01,738 --> 02:26:03,280
What we meant was dogs, no.

1794
02:26:03,981 --> 02:26:06,443
No, I was actually saying that we would walk them along.

1795
02:26:13,653 --> 02:26:26,565
Yes, we would take them out two by two, three by three, and just if they need be, they will go on a walk with an employee, not 20 at once.

1796
02:26:26,585 --> 02:26:28,547
Thank you.

1797
02:26:30,669 --> 02:26:30,990
Thank you.

1798
02:26:33,172 --> 02:26:33,392
Thank you.

1799
02:26:34,683 --> 02:26:35,183
Councilor Knight.

1800
02:26:35,824 --> 02:26:43,129
Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee on zoning tonight before us, we have a hearing, a public hearing on a special permit.

1801
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:47,913
And this hearing is governed by chapter 48, section nine of the general laws.

1802
02:26:48,694 --> 02:27:00,943
And if we take a look at chapter 48, section nine of the general laws, you know, it will say that the special special permit granting authority has the right to allow nonconforming multifamily residential use in an industrially zoned district.

1803
02:27:02,729 --> 02:27:09,630
It goes on to say that in order to do that, the Special Permit Granting Authority has to find that this non-conforming multifamily residential use is in the public interest.

1804
02:27:10,271 --> 02:27:17,452
So that happened, and we have a facility on Locust Street now, a multifamily residential use on Locust Street that directly abuts this property, Mr. President.

1805
02:27:18,292 --> 02:27:27,214
And as we read Chapter 48, Section 9, which this hearing is being governed under, it says that the non-conforming use shall not adversely affect the existing industrial uses

1806
02:27:28,014 --> 02:27:33,659
and provided further that future permitted uses will not be noxious to the non-conforming multifamily residential use.

1807
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:50,973
So here before us this evening, we're gonna be asked the question on this application as to whether or not this particular site's an appropriate location, whether or not, as developed, it will not adversely affect the neighborhood, and whether or not there'll be no nuisance or serious hazards to pedestrians and to vehicles.

1808
02:27:52,538 --> 02:27:56,060
We're also being asked the question as to whether or not these are adequate and appropriate facilities.

1809
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:59,081
Now, Mr. President, I personally have no problem with the facilities.

1810
02:27:59,121 --> 02:28:01,242
I think they are adequate and appropriate for this type of business.

1811
02:28:02,923 --> 02:28:09,886
I do have serious concerns about whether or not this is going to be a nuisance or a serious hazard to pedestrians and to vehicles on Linden Street.

1812
02:28:10,026 --> 02:28:11,567
Linden Street's a dead-end street, Mr. President.

1813
02:28:12,207 --> 02:28:16,949
We have the petitioner here before us saying that they're going to have five employees plus two other people there.

1814
02:28:16,969 --> 02:28:17,570
That's seven people.

1815
02:28:18,150 --> 02:28:23,454
They have parking, as they said already, for five bays of cars that's locked between two electronic gates, Mr. President.

1816
02:28:23,534 --> 02:28:28,937
I think that's going to create a serious nuisance and a serious hazard to pedestrians and to vehicles alike on that street.

1817
02:28:30,018 --> 02:28:36,542
Secondly, Mr. President, as we look at this, you know, we have to say the use as developed will not adversely affect the neighborhood.

1818
02:28:36,822 --> 02:28:40,325
And I don't think anybody behind this rail can say with 100 percent certainty that that's going to happen.

1819
02:28:40,805 --> 02:28:42,186
I think we all have questions about noise.

1820
02:28:42,226 --> 02:28:43,427
We all have questions about smell.

1821
02:28:43,487 --> 02:28:44,648
We all have questions about traffic now.

1822
02:28:45,942 --> 02:28:50,645
Also, Mr. President, as we look at this, the question is whether or not this is an appropriate location for such a use.

1823
02:28:51,145 --> 02:28:54,788
This directly abuts a multifamily residential use.

1824
02:28:55,528 --> 02:28:59,190
And the people who live in that building have come up and expressed concern, Mr. President.

1825
02:29:00,111 --> 02:29:04,834
People that live there now, residents of this community, have said that this is something that they don't want in their own backyard.

1826
02:29:05,434 --> 02:29:06,915
And I can understand why, Mr. President.

1827
02:29:07,055 --> 02:29:10,777
I certainly think that the petitioners have done an excellent job in putting together a strong business plan.

1828
02:29:10,797 --> 02:29:14,460
The petitioners have done an excellent job in putting together something that's going to be successful.

1829
02:29:15,808 --> 02:29:20,990
I just don't think this is the appropriate location, Mr. President, and it's for those reasons that I'm not going to be able to support this paper this evening.

1830
02:29:21,491 --> 02:29:21,791
Thank you.

1831
02:29:23,652 --> 02:29:24,352
Any further questions?

1832
02:29:26,873 --> 02:29:27,874
Would anybody else like to speak?

1833
02:29:30,255 --> 02:29:30,935
Please come forward.

1834
02:29:44,888 --> 02:29:45,988
Name and address of the record, please.

1835
02:29:46,008 --> 02:29:47,009
Thank you, Mr. President.

1836
02:29:47,309 --> 02:29:49,030
I live at 10 Brigitte Avenue in Medford.

1837
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:52,111
My name is Jack McGoldrick, and Medford starts with me.

1838
02:29:53,032 --> 02:29:54,572
I'm a small business owner in Medford.

1839
02:29:55,173 --> 02:29:57,794
I run a small ad agency called McGoldrick Marketing.

1840
02:29:58,394 --> 02:30:02,476
I'm on the board of directors of Cache in Medford, board of directors of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

1841
02:30:03,136 --> 02:30:13,661
I'm a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School Advisory Committee for the Business, Technology, and Marketing Program and the Media Technology Program, which this beautiful new studio is the housing of.

1842
02:30:15,041 --> 02:30:19,944
As a business owner, I have a couple of hard and fast rules about clients I'll work with, and I'm nervous.

1843
02:30:21,685 --> 02:30:24,467
I won't work for clients who sell cigarettes or guns, period.

1844
02:30:25,808 --> 02:30:29,570
Otherwise, I'll agree to work with clients based on their individual merits.

1845
02:30:30,310 --> 02:30:38,695
When I first started my business in Medford, I was approached by three women whom I hold in the highest esteem, Susan Altman, Susan Fairchild, and Charlotte Scuderi.

1846
02:30:39,155 --> 02:30:40,916
They wanted to start a civic pride program.

1847
02:30:41,437 --> 02:30:43,598
We came up with the phrase, Medford starts with me.

1848
02:30:44,746 --> 02:30:52,253
Unfortunately, it never got legs, but nevertheless, the words Medford starts with me are something you can think about when you vote for this simple permit.

1849
02:30:54,275 --> 02:30:58,618
It means pretty obviously that I have the power to do my part to help make Medford a better place.

1850
02:30:59,659 --> 02:31:00,900
So back to choosing who I'll work with.

1851
02:31:02,313 --> 02:31:06,234
So since opening my ad agency in Medford, I think I've chosen one.

1852
02:31:06,634 --> 02:31:23,720
I've worked with the Mystic Valley chapter of the NAACP, Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, Cache in Medford, the Medford Chamber of Commerce, the Mystic Art Gallery, Made in Medford, Families Anonymous, Medford Community Housing, Team Medford, and the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition.

1853
02:31:25,456 --> 02:31:33,599
I think everyone in this room and everyone who will eventually watch at home will agree without a doubt that I've chosen to work with good people who do good things for Medford.

1854
02:31:34,299 --> 02:31:38,801
While I've recently chosen to work with Dogs for Days, I've gotten to know Nick and Michelle in the process.

1855
02:31:39,281 --> 02:31:40,762
They want to do good things for Medford.

1856
02:31:42,102 --> 02:31:50,205
As you, the esteemed city councilors of the city of Medford, you have a golden opportunity to show your constituents that you want to do good things for Medford.

1857
02:31:51,983 --> 02:31:55,926
Nick and Michelle just want to open a mom and pop business in an industrial district.

1858
02:31:56,166 --> 02:31:56,526
That's all.

1859
02:31:56,706 --> 02:31:57,126
Who doesn't?

1860
02:31:58,167 --> 02:32:08,994
This district is zoned for businesses that need a place, as many people have said, to operate heavy machinery, to drive their trucks and cranes and forklifts and tow trucks and backhoes and other dirty, noisy things.

1861
02:32:09,715 --> 02:32:14,418
To know that they're able to earn a living running these types of businesses because they're in an industrial district.

1862
02:32:15,098 --> 02:32:22,426
The city of Medford zoning also dictates that an industrial district is the proper place for Dogs for Days to establish their business.

1863
02:32:22,987 --> 02:32:26,051
This is not a residential district, even though there are residential buildings in it.

1864
02:32:26,251 --> 02:32:27,312
It's an industrial district.

1865
02:32:28,794 --> 02:32:35,682
You can easily discern from the extremely detailed and well thought out plans that they have presented to you that this business will be an exemplary one.

1866
02:32:36,662 --> 02:32:46,190
They'll take a dirty, empty lot and turn it into a shiny example of the kind of business Medford so desperately needs and that the people of Medford so eagerly want.

1867
02:32:47,411 --> 02:32:49,112
They'll be great neighbors to everyone around them.

1868
02:32:49,793 --> 02:32:53,656
This currently sad, run-down property will become a place of great happiness.

1869
02:32:55,413 --> 02:33:13,402
There's absolutely no reason I can think of to deny this simple request for a permit so that a small mom-and-pop business like Dogs for Days can fulfill their dream of providing a happy place for the thousands of dog owners in Medford to let their dogs stay, play, become socialized, and be treated well by people who simply want to do just that.

1870
02:33:13,902 --> 02:33:17,064
So please, do the right thing and vote in favor of this permit.

1871
02:33:24,442 --> 02:33:25,623
name and address to the record please.

1872
02:33:26,084 --> 02:33:34,412
Hi my name is Kayla Heinrichsen and I live on 34 Grove Street Medford Massachusetts and I disapprove of this motion.

1873
02:33:36,375 --> 02:33:43,282
Well good evening council members and and president and city clerk and I would like to

1874
02:33:44,683 --> 02:33:57,833
commend the previous speaker for their very detailed research, for their very fluid and detailed presentation, but I do have a few problems with the business model and such, so I'll read this that I wrote.

1875
02:33:59,976 --> 02:34:10,307
For the past few months, a number of colleagues and myself have been volunteering at Daily Care, a local dog daycare company, and have greatly enjoyed the opportunity.

1876
02:34:10,628 --> 02:34:16,974
Volunteering with Daily Care involves exercising and interacting with a small group of dogs whom we have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with.

1877
02:34:18,316 --> 02:34:21,601
Each dog is well taken care of according to their individualized needs.

1878
02:34:21,921 --> 02:34:33,918
However, it has come to attention that this proprietorship, as well as other local businesses, have been threatened by a larger corporate entity that may harm the dog sitting businesses around the Medford area without the benefit of real economic growth.

1879
02:34:34,878 --> 02:34:49,433
Furthermore, Mr. Gavazos has challenged small dog owners who do not need a permit to gain unneeded permits for their business models as a business smear, which I'll get to later, which they also referenced in the beginning of their speech.

1880
02:34:50,794 --> 02:34:57,335
We propose to keep these businesses intact, focusing on care for each dog and providing a genuine and flexible volunteering setting.

1881
02:34:58,176 --> 02:35:09,018
Within the present community-based setting of area dog sitters, each dog receives constant attention and their owners receive consistent feedback on their behavior every day of their attendance in the program.

1882
02:35:09,698 --> 02:35:19,240
The higher rates and fewer numbers of clients per each business in the Medford area maintains a higher quality of individualized care and attention than a larger corporation would be able to provide

1883
02:35:19,675 --> 02:35:29,864
to provide, even though this isn't necessarily a corporation, it is a much larger business than the current dog sitting businesses in the area.

1884
02:35:29,884 --> 02:35:42,815
A larger entity's arrival would create a surplus of dogs and lower the rate per dog, resulting in an inequity of care and potential negligence among the volunteers and staff.

1885
02:35:42,895 --> 02:35:45,417
I know they mentioned, just based on what I've heard,

1886
02:35:47,268 --> 02:35:50,652
they were going to have 10 dogs per person.

1887
02:35:50,773 --> 02:35:55,158
We have a maximum of about five dogs per person, and we just have more companies.

1888
02:35:55,759 --> 02:36:04,250
Plus, I noticed that they charge $35 per dog at their daycare, where as we charge the most expensive

1889
02:36:04,777 --> 02:36:06,558
local daycare in the area charges $35.

1890
02:36:07,978 --> 02:36:17,222
So you're getting cheaper and more individualized care for a smaller number of dogs, and we're actually looking for business right now.

1891
02:36:17,282 --> 02:36:19,303
We have plenty of room to grow at daily care.

1892
02:36:20,984 --> 02:36:31,712
The structures of current dog-sitting businesses in the area are also set up to accommodate each volunteer's schedule and abilities very flexibly, while still acting as an opportunity to care for and learn about K-9 behavior.

1893
02:36:32,312 --> 02:36:43,801
In a more corporate setting, there would be a natural increase in volunteer volume, consequently requiring more lengthy screening processes, longer waiting times before starting the work, and an overall more business-like character.

1894
02:36:44,662 --> 02:36:54,910
Also, staff and volunteer inclusion into the programs would likely be based more on vocational paperwork rather than first-hand observations of the handler's abilities by the business owner.

1895
02:36:55,851 --> 02:37:05,118
My colleagues and I, for example, have had little formal job experience over the past year, yet have handled animals extensively during that period.

1896
02:37:05,818 --> 02:37:11,843
Thus, we're excited on hearing about the opportunity to work with animals at Daily Care, the business that we volunteer for.

1897
02:37:12,523 --> 02:37:12,683
Ms.

1898
02:37:12,703 --> 02:37:20,604
Daley takes great care in accommodating our needs, driving us to and from her home each time we work, saving us hours on public transportation.

1899
02:37:21,405 --> 02:37:29,966
Also, my colleagues and my work at Daley Care has enriched our sense of community, interacting widely with members of the pet-only community at dog parks and on trails.

1900
02:37:30,626 --> 02:37:33,607
And we have used the dog park on occasions.

1901
02:37:35,047 --> 02:37:40,248
Furthermore, Mr. Gabat, this is getting to more what they were referencing in the beginning of their speech,

1902
02:37:41,813 --> 02:38:02,019
Furthermore, Mr. Gavazos has indicated that all Kenan-related proprietorships in the Medford area must obtain a license before beginning business, which he implied to us via email, which he sent to my manager, Margaret Daly, and a few other small business owners in the Medford area, which I will eventually get to.

1903
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:17,590
Although this may be true for a large doggy daycare enterprise, dog walking itself requires no license in the Medford area, also enabling these owners to board up three dogs at night at their places of establishment.

1904
02:38:18,191 --> 02:38:31,281
It becomes apparent then that Mr. Gavazos merely pressured small businesses with his attainment of a special license in order to have them out on the grounds of needing permits they are not otherwise required to have.

1905
02:38:32,642 --> 02:38:48,108
My colleagues and I greatly rely on the authenticity of our business model and hope that Mr. Gavatsas does not further interfere with a highly genuine, flexible, and individualized small proprietorship, among which there are at least three in the area, and they are thriving right now.

1906
02:38:48,128 --> 02:38:55,351
We're actually, as I mentioned before, we're looking for new businesses, or we're looking for new clients as we speak.

1907
02:38:58,111 --> 02:39:21,811
Although the service may be appreciated in Winchester, the longstanding, and I understand that Winchester is not the prize location, the ideal location for the business, the longstanding small businesses in Medford do not need more competition or smearing in order to protect care, nor does the council need to award Mr. Gavazza a special permit to deny us our rights.

1908
02:39:23,788 --> 02:39:34,635
You'll see here that the owner and all my associates have signed a petition, an informal petition, which you may actually have.

1909
02:39:34,875 --> 02:39:36,936
And I'll go, do I still have time?

1910
02:39:36,956 --> 02:39:40,038
You have the full moment.

1911
02:39:40,058 --> 02:39:40,438
All right.

1912
02:39:40,999 --> 02:39:46,282
And I'll go further into the email smearing event.

1913
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,481
She has the floor.

1914
02:39:48,501 --> 02:39:49,361
Let her finish.

1915
02:39:49,421 --> 02:39:53,783
Basically, my owner, my manager is in the other room.

1916
02:39:53,863 --> 02:39:55,925
She has the email right now if you want to check it.

1917
02:39:56,585 --> 02:40:13,314
But basically, he mentioned that an animal control officer went to one of the small business owners' home, which was also a place of business, and said that her facilities were not intact, that she was doing

1918
02:40:16,546 --> 02:40:21,551
unethical practices and such where that, of course, never happened.

1919
02:40:21,992 --> 02:40:25,856
Now, they have apologized, but that was right before this meeting.

1920
02:40:25,956 --> 02:40:30,721
So, it really makes me question the business ethics of the owners.

1921
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:36,868
You know, if they're willing to pull something that little, you know, if they're willing to pull off something that

1922
02:40:38,194 --> 02:40:40,576
I know you're waiting to chime in.

1923
02:40:40,837 --> 02:40:42,778
Oh, okay.

1924
02:40:42,839 --> 02:40:57,192
I'm sorry, I don't mean to attack them personally, but ethics-wise, business ethics-wise, I view that as, you know, just kind of a behind-the-scenes, dirty, under-the-table playing.

1925
02:40:57,632 --> 02:40:59,234
Whereas we tend to...

1926
02:41:01,035 --> 02:41:02,777
Can I have the floor?

1927
02:41:03,358 --> 02:41:03,778
Thank you.

1928
02:41:03,798 --> 02:41:04,419
I'm sorry.

1929
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:08,203
Whereas, you know, we are longstanding businesses.

1930
02:41:08,243 --> 02:41:09,644
We have great reputations.

1931
02:41:11,927 --> 02:41:14,990
And which also brings me to another point is that

1932
02:41:15,555 --> 02:41:32,504
Before Mr. Gavazos, what I've heard from other business owners in the area, before Mr. Gavazos and his partner started this business, he was actually part of a failed company, which didn't make it and received horrible reviews.

1933
02:41:32,644 --> 02:41:34,685
I don't think we're here to attack anybody.

1934
02:41:34,985 --> 02:41:35,365
Oh, okay.

1935
02:41:35,505 --> 02:41:35,925
I'm sorry.

1936
02:41:36,166 --> 02:41:36,586
I'm sorry.

1937
02:41:37,126 --> 02:41:39,527
But I was just kind of doing my research.

1938
02:41:41,148 --> 02:41:44,670
But yeah, this company has only been around for a year and I applaud them for their efforts.

1939
02:41:45,070 --> 02:41:46,111
I really do applaud them.

1940
02:41:47,111 --> 02:41:55,895
But I think that they have a lot more to learn about the business aspect of the operation of doggie sitting, doggie daycare and such.

1941
02:41:56,816 --> 02:41:58,437
And I also think that

1942
02:41:59,615 --> 02:42:10,101
they could find a different location if they really wanted to without disrupting the community setting, the community-based setting of businesses around the Medford area that already exist.

1943
02:42:10,141 --> 02:42:11,762
And also, what's my time?

1944
02:42:13,864 --> 02:42:14,304
I'm sorry.

1945
02:42:14,564 --> 02:42:17,426
I just want, okay, all right, I'll go fast.

1946
02:42:17,786 --> 02:42:19,747
Let's see.

1947
02:42:21,228 --> 02:42:23,850
You know, and also about the stress of the dogs.

1948
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:30,456
I know Scarpelli, counselor Scarpelli, you actually mentioned the stress and that is a really big part.

1949
02:42:31,117 --> 02:42:34,180
And I actually have a firsthand view of that.

1950
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:41,186
There was a dog at one of our, at our facility that had a huge barking problem.

1951
02:42:41,246 --> 02:42:43,368
And then when I started volunteering,

1952
02:42:44,756 --> 02:42:48,778
that eventually seceded or that ceased.

1953
02:42:48,958 --> 02:42:55,560
So, I mean, it takes a lot of individualized care and attention to deal with this.

1954
02:42:55,620 --> 02:43:00,242
And if you have 10 dogs per person, that's not individualized care.

1955
02:43:00,262 --> 02:43:02,763
That does not say individualized care for me.

1956
02:43:05,252 --> 02:43:10,734
So really, I guess, in conclusion, I would emphasize the business ethics of the owners.

1957
02:43:11,975 --> 02:43:20,097
And I worry about them overcharging or undercharging for the animals that they take care of.

1958
02:43:20,117 --> 02:43:22,658
And I worry about the animals themselves.

1959
02:43:22,718 --> 02:43:28,160
I mean, if they're willing to do something like that, what are they willing to do to the animals?

1960
02:43:28,801 --> 02:43:31,782
And also, I worry about, you know,

1961
02:43:33,255 --> 02:43:43,882
You know, I just don't think that this is going to make a big financial difference in the area to allow a permit for dogs for days.

1962
02:43:44,042 --> 02:43:48,405
Because we charge the same thing, but for more individualized care and better care in the end.

1963
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:49,660
Thank you.

1964
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:50,781
Name and address of the director, please.

1965
02:43:50,941 --> 02:43:53,622
Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

1966
02:43:54,162 --> 02:43:58,824
I am also the owner of Cosmopolitan Real Estate and we deal with a lot of tenants in the city of Medford.

1967
02:43:59,604 --> 02:44:02,345
I am going to ask you to side on housing.

1968
02:44:02,485 --> 02:44:04,086
We are having a housing crisis.

1969
02:44:04,146 --> 02:44:10,028
We do not have enough housing for the people that want to live here, for the people that can afford to live here.

1970
02:44:10,529 --> 02:44:12,589
The price of housing has gotten outrageous.

1971
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:15,291
Everyone keeps talking about Locust Street.

1972
02:44:15,471 --> 02:44:18,372
I can remember when those buildings were gonna go up.

1973
02:44:19,092 --> 02:44:25,534
Medford was excited because it got rid of a lot of the auto body shops, and it brought in some housing that we needed.

1974
02:44:26,154 --> 02:44:32,696
As far as Linden Ave always being industrial, I have been informed by one of the neighbors, and I did do some home research.

1975
02:44:33,236 --> 02:44:39,178
Linden Ave was originally built back in the 1800s as the boarding houses for the people that worked on the ships.

1976
02:44:39,918 --> 02:44:43,379
As far as the history behind that, I would defer to the historical society.

1977
02:44:43,939 --> 02:44:46,920
The families that are down there, the tenants that are there,

1978
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,904
They don't choose to live in an industrial neighborhood.

1979
02:44:50,345 --> 02:44:52,408
That's where they can afford to live.

1980
02:44:52,889 --> 02:45:00,601
To put something like this on Linden Avenue directly across the street from an eight-unit building that was built in 1880.

1981
02:45:02,384 --> 02:45:04,886
Those tenants are only going to be able to put up with so much.

1982
02:45:05,366 --> 02:45:07,807
We're a tired city after all the airplanes.

1983
02:45:07,967 --> 02:45:10,069
We're happy that those have started to succeed.

1984
02:45:10,729 --> 02:45:14,831
I wouldn't want to live next to a daycare for dogs, and I don't think most people will.

1985
02:45:15,212 --> 02:45:19,494
There's not a lot that 57,000 people will agree upon, but I think that is one point.

1986
02:45:19,934 --> 02:45:21,395
Nobody wants to live next to it.

1987
02:45:21,916 --> 02:45:30,281
As far as a special permit, I do believe that this body, whatever people were on it at that time, when they said to have a dog kennel,

1988
02:45:31,121 --> 02:45:33,564
or livestock, you need to have a special permit.

1989
02:45:34,124 --> 02:45:38,709
I do think the reason was because they wanted to make sure it was going to go in the right location.

1990
02:45:39,169 --> 02:45:48,559
There is other property that is available for rent in the city of Medford that is a much more suitable location that does not abut residential homes.

1991
02:45:49,019 --> 02:45:53,002
So I would just ask that you think about the people that live in those homes, the tenants.

1992
02:45:53,162 --> 02:45:55,764
It doesn't matter if the owner built it with spot zoning.

1993
02:45:56,104 --> 02:45:59,126
The people that live in the buildings all have a right to peace.

1994
02:45:59,507 --> 02:46:01,468
They're okay with some noise during the day.

1995
02:46:01,888 --> 02:46:07,593
Linden Ave, those tenants and those landlords and those trucking companies, they've got their own jive going.

1996
02:46:07,773 --> 02:46:09,154
It works over there.

1997
02:46:09,594 --> 02:46:15,858
To bring in a daycare for dogs, I think it's going to upset the neighborhood and there's only so much the people can handle.

1998
02:46:16,539 --> 02:46:24,544
As far as the people that are living in the apartment building right behind it, I don't want to look out my back window and see 50 dogs behind me.

1999
02:46:24,664 --> 02:46:25,584
I don't want to smell it.

2000
02:46:25,684 --> 02:46:26,765
I don't want to put up with it.

2001
02:46:27,305 --> 02:46:34,190
Those people chose to live there, but if they went another 100 feet down a Lumiere, they're going to be paying another $1,000 a month.

2002
02:46:34,610 --> 02:46:38,373
A lot of this is coming down to affordability and keeping Medford home for all.

2003
02:46:39,869 --> 02:46:40,209
Thank you.

2004
02:46:45,534 --> 02:46:46,555
Name and address of the record, please.

2005
02:46:48,613 --> 02:46:49,654
Thank you, Mr. President.

2006
02:46:49,954 --> 02:46:51,815
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2007
02:46:51,955 --> 02:47:00,019
Just to address the need for more businesses in Medford, you can go across this city and see tons of empty storefronts.

2008
02:47:00,699 --> 02:47:12,545
Bringing in a new business that's offering jobs, that's more revenues for the city of Medford, could be used to offset other things that we need, like police and equipment for the firefighters and fixing streets and roads.

2009
02:47:13,026 --> 02:47:13,746
That's number one.

2010
02:47:13,766 --> 02:47:16,728
Number two, I think Nick and Michelle made a really good case.

2011
02:47:17,468 --> 02:47:25,378
to address some of the points that were just made about a lack of smell, about a lack of noise, about it being a good location.

2012
02:47:26,379 --> 02:47:33,408
In reference to what Councilor Knight brought up under the Mass State Laws, I've seen this body of proof permits

2013
02:47:33,868 --> 02:47:38,893
with stipulations that in six months we'll revisit it to take a look at what the impact was.

2014
02:47:39,574 --> 02:47:42,197
I hope that you would consider that in considering this business.

2015
02:47:42,237 --> 02:47:48,803
I don't think these people want to spend a million dollars and then in six months and have a poor impact.

2016
02:47:48,823 --> 02:47:50,305
What if that would happen?

2017
02:47:50,545 --> 02:47:52,647
Or hours of work stipulations.

2018
02:47:52,667 --> 02:47:53,448
That's not an option.

2019
02:47:53,468 --> 02:47:55,410
That's not an option for these people.

2020
02:47:56,491 --> 02:48:00,333
But I say that based upon the fact that they've done their homework and they've done their research.

2021
02:48:00,393 --> 02:48:05,276
And I'm confident that within a few months, you won't find the adverse impacts.

2022
02:48:05,657 --> 02:48:08,118
I mean, these people are loving their dogs.

2023
02:48:08,458 --> 02:48:10,460
This is going to be a good business for Medved.

2024
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,082
Me personally, I would love to live right next door.

2025
02:48:15,223 --> 02:48:16,144
to a dog kennel.

2026
02:48:16,645 --> 02:48:17,265
I love dogs.

2027
02:48:17,285 --> 02:48:19,308
I've grown up with dogs my whole life.

2028
02:48:19,688 --> 02:48:20,950
I lost my dog last summer.

2029
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:22,511
I got another one three weeks later.

2030
02:48:22,952 --> 02:48:25,475
I think this is nothing but a win-win for the city of Medford.

2031
02:48:25,915 --> 02:48:29,299
I strongly urge this board to approve this permit.

2032
02:48:29,619 --> 02:48:30,921
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

2033
02:48:30,981 --> 02:48:31,642
Thank you very much.

2034
02:48:40,771 --> 02:48:41,851
Name and address of the wreckage, please.

2035
02:48:42,271 --> 02:48:44,772
Ray DeLovo, Woodside Road in Medford.

2036
02:48:45,752 --> 02:48:57,795
I don't have a lot to say about the mechanics of this whole thing, but I want to tell you that we have a red-boned coonhound that sits by the front window in the morning and waits for them to come.

2037
02:48:58,956 --> 02:48:59,636
She won't even eat.

2038
02:49:01,256 --> 02:49:04,077
As soon as she sees that truck, she gets so excited.

2039
02:49:05,243 --> 02:49:09,087
All you have to do is open the door, and she doesn't even run in the street.

2040
02:49:09,567 --> 02:49:11,569
They know she doesn't even need a leash.

2041
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:15,634
She goes right to the back of that truck and jumps right in there.

2042
02:49:17,355 --> 02:49:23,482
I don't know two other people in this entire world that will take better care of a dog than those two people.

2043
02:49:24,288 --> 02:49:25,768
They are very, very good.

2044
02:49:26,028 --> 02:49:26,628
They care.

2045
02:49:27,809 --> 02:49:29,709
They bring them back at the right time.

2046
02:49:29,749 --> 02:49:31,189
They pick them up at the right time.

2047
02:49:31,509 --> 02:49:33,130
They are very, very astute people.

2048
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:38,471
So as far as the right people to do this, they're in.

2049
02:49:39,171 --> 02:49:39,511
Thank you.

2050
02:49:46,752 --> 02:49:47,793
Name and address of the record, please.

2051
02:49:48,253 --> 02:49:50,113
Jennifer Keenan, 250 Grove Street.

2052
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:52,690
Thank you for having me.

2053
02:49:53,090 --> 02:49:54,691
I'm an 11-year resident of Medford.

2054
02:49:55,211 --> 02:50:01,112
I'm also a local real estate agent, the newest member of the Medford Historical Commission, and an avid dog lover.

2055
02:50:02,033 --> 02:50:06,374
I wholly support the proposed business, Dogs for Days, and their proposed location.

2056
02:50:06,394 --> 02:50:10,355
I would kindly ask the members of the council to approve their special permit.

2057
02:50:11,055 --> 02:50:16,877
My family, and I suspect other Medford families, would benefit greatly from having a doggie daycare here in Medford.

2058
02:50:17,497 --> 02:50:21,058
Right now, the daycare we send our dog to is located out of town.

2059
02:50:21,878 --> 02:50:25,440
We would love to be able to support a business in town here in Medford.

2060
02:50:26,121 --> 02:50:28,882
We are very excited for the new dog park that is currently being built.

2061
02:50:29,363 --> 02:50:33,045
This daycare is the perfect next step for those of us with furry children.

2062
02:50:34,441 --> 02:50:48,567
Lastly, during these recent times of active talk regarding zoning and a master plan and other changes happening in Medford, for better or for worse, this is a great example of a business trying to open in an appropriately zoned area.

2063
02:50:49,267 --> 02:50:56,930
We should support this kind of development and encourage other business owners to do the same, not discourage them or make them feel unwelcome in any way.

2064
02:50:57,730 --> 02:51:05,485
Again, I strongly urge and respectfully ask the council members to approve their special permit and let this well-needed business open its doors for the residents of Medford.

2065
02:51:05,846 --> 02:51:06,186
Thank you.

2066
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,121
Name and address of the wreckage, please, sir.

2067
02:51:23,362 --> 02:51:27,385
Name, first of all, I apologize, I left my hearing aid on the kitchen table.

2068
02:51:29,047 --> 02:51:30,828
So make sure you talk loud enough.

2069
02:51:31,309 --> 02:51:32,590
I'll let you borrow mine if you want.

2070
02:51:32,610 --> 02:51:38,295
My name, you want my name, is Albert A. Massascusa, 27 Local Street, Apartment 3.

2071
02:51:39,296 --> 02:51:46,103
I've lived in Local Street for 95 years, except for five years I went in World War II.

2072
02:51:47,705 --> 02:51:55,407
And I've had, I've opposed a dog kennel in that area before.

2073
02:51:55,427 --> 02:52:01,348
25 or 30 years ago, Dr. DeCristoforo wanted to open a kennel on Locust Street.

2074
02:52:02,208 --> 02:52:04,289
And it was a big crowd to oppose it.

2075
02:52:05,069 --> 02:52:15,691
So after a long debate, I told the council, when these dogs start barking, these people are gonna call each and every one of you

2076
02:52:17,587 --> 02:52:19,489
in any time of the day or night.

2077
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:26,393
The council defeated the kennel seven to nothing.

2078
02:52:27,774 --> 02:52:36,760
Another thing I want to tell you, Mr. Dougherty put a fortune in building them three well-kept apartment houses.

2079
02:52:37,361 --> 02:52:39,722
Everybody squawked about Locust Street.

2080
02:52:40,062 --> 02:52:42,324
No sidewalk, this and that.

2081
02:52:42,604 --> 02:52:43,925
He made it beautiful.

2082
02:52:44,605 --> 02:52:46,547
Now they want to put,

2083
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:51,542
a kennel in back of it, which doesn't seem fair at all.

2084
02:52:52,282 --> 02:53:04,188
And if you want to put a kennel in Method, it should be on either Commercial Street, Mystic Avenue, or in back of Stop and Shop in a food agency, away from the homes.

2085
02:53:04,728 --> 02:53:12,712
If people will tell you barking doesn't carry, if you've got two minutes, I'm going to tell you a little story about barking.

2086
02:53:13,623 --> 02:53:16,384
Years ago, they used to walk the beat, the police.

2087
02:53:17,264 --> 02:53:19,785
And Locust Street was Officer Bell's beat.

2088
02:53:20,746 --> 02:53:22,846
And we had a big German shepherd.

2089
02:53:23,647 --> 02:53:29,749
And Officer Bell was way up with the bowling alley where Stop and Shop is now.

2090
02:53:30,709 --> 02:53:33,790
And he heard this German shepherd bark way up there.

2091
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:38,752
And he ran down to Locust Street and had broken into one of the buildings.

2092
02:53:39,867 --> 02:53:42,891
Now I really expect a down vote from you people.

2093
02:53:43,492 --> 02:53:44,573
Thank you very much.

2094
02:53:44,794 --> 02:53:45,134
Thank you.

2095
02:53:49,746 --> 02:53:50,566
Councilor Knight.

2096
02:53:50,987 --> 02:54:04,436
Back several months ago, several months ago, Albert, the council, myself and Councilor Penter, I believe, if he's still around here, had put forward a council resolution to congratulate you.

2097
02:54:04,596 --> 02:54:08,298
The Medford City Council had put forward a resolution to congratulate you some months back.

2098
02:54:14,583 --> 02:54:16,086
Several months ago.

2099
02:54:16,206 --> 02:54:17,650
Yes about the metal.

2100
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:19,915
I'm really ashamed of the council the type of

2101
02:54:29,898 --> 02:54:31,639
I'm a knight, right now, I'm a knight.

2102
02:54:32,299 --> 02:54:32,899
Me too.

2103
02:54:32,939 --> 02:54:33,920
Medal of Honor.

2104
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,261
I know, I know.

2105
02:54:35,301 --> 02:54:42,124
Mr. DelaRusso, he met the counselor for coming in to give me the medal.

2106
02:54:42,544 --> 02:54:45,886
He met him down the hallway and he told him all about it.

2107
02:54:45,906 --> 02:54:48,507
Do you think he'd mention it in front of the counselor?

2108
02:54:49,207 --> 02:55:13,945
never well the council did mention it Albert myself a counselor and counselor pet to put it forward to so we asked you to come down and we wanted to congratulate you and since we have you here tonight hopefully give you a round of applause thank you sir and it's also Albert's 95th birthday

2109
02:55:18,290 --> 02:55:18,931
Thank you.

2110
02:55:22,854 --> 02:55:23,815
Comic relief.

2111
02:55:23,915 --> 02:55:25,136
Name and address of the record, please.

2112
02:55:25,416 --> 02:55:29,980
ComEd, Palmezano, 43 Brackett Street, Medford.

2113
02:55:30,040 --> 02:55:33,183
First, I'd like to thank the council and the clerk.

2114
02:55:34,104 --> 02:55:36,205
We're bringing a piece of the city up here with you every week.

2115
02:55:36,305 --> 02:55:37,045
I know it's a pain.

2116
02:55:38,286 --> 02:55:39,366
We all appreciate it.

2117
02:55:39,867 --> 02:55:45,329
That being said, also born and raised in the city and have a business on Locust Street.

2118
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,350
September will be 25 years.

2119
02:55:49,808 --> 02:55:51,110
on a permit by this council.

2120
02:55:51,751 --> 02:55:56,937
That being said, I have nothing against these people, and that's a great idea and what a presentation they put on.

2121
02:55:58,319 --> 02:56:06,248
But to quote the backing up dirty backhoes and forklifts and all, that stops at 6 o'clock at night.

2122
02:56:07,189 --> 02:56:21,201
There's no there's no 24-hour garages or 24-hour backing up trucks or what have you It's that own now you want to put 400 units next door to us with a garage people complain about it we

2123
02:56:22,822 --> 02:56:41,508
Neighbors out back of us came and made a deal if you will and you know you live in Medford You don't want to go home and smell paint when you have a barbecue Okay that I won't spray past 4 30 at night anymore We worked it out But I don't really don't think that area and also washing it off.

2124
02:56:41,548 --> 02:56:42,089
Where's it go?

2125
02:56:42,149 --> 02:56:42,489
I don't know

2126
02:56:44,415 --> 02:56:46,276
I don't, you know, there's no drains.

2127
02:56:46,296 --> 02:56:51,897
Does it keep it on the property and you get it pumped out or something, or that's just going right down the sidewalk?

2128
02:56:51,917 --> 02:56:56,899
There's supposed to be, you know, like I said, clarification maybe on that through you, Mr. President.

2129
02:56:57,599 --> 02:57:08,983
And, you know, you're trying to, three years ago, you had Eddie's want to do the bakery where my golf house, where Corvino's is, and they wouldn't let them go around the clock.

2130
02:57:11,105 --> 02:57:16,550
I just don't think if it was daycare, okay, fine, the gate's locked by 8 o'clock at night, whatever, same as that.

2131
02:57:17,310 --> 02:57:22,595
And you have your quiet enjoyment over there and 60 families that are up against it.

2132
02:57:22,615 --> 02:57:23,876
Again, it's nothing against these people.

2133
02:57:23,976 --> 02:57:24,677
It's a great idea.

2134
02:57:24,697 --> 02:57:28,020
You want to go in business and take your chance, go, I love you.

2135
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:29,801
But I just, I don't see it working.

2136
02:57:30,302 --> 02:57:30,942
Thanks for your minutes.

2137
02:57:39,619 --> 02:57:48,263
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members of the council, I think the petitioners did a great job putting forth their proposal and their business plan.

2138
02:57:48,563 --> 02:57:53,646
However, I don't think they've met the threshold that Chapter 40 requires.

2139
02:57:54,206 --> 02:57:57,328
I think it would be derogatory to the neighborhood in general.

2140
02:57:58,128 --> 02:58:02,852
people have spent a lot of money, you know, improving the local street area.

2141
02:58:03,272 --> 02:58:09,537
You have some great apartment buildings, and as Kelly Catalo said, you know, we need housing for our citizens.

2142
02:58:09,597 --> 02:58:13,921
We don't necessarily need a dog kennel, so to speak.

2143
02:58:14,441 --> 02:58:18,325
So I would respectfully urge you to vote no on this proposal.

2144
02:58:18,585 --> 02:58:18,905
Thank you.

2145
02:58:18,945 --> 02:58:19,305
Thank you.

2146
02:58:23,969 --> 02:58:24,770
Any further discussion?

2147
02:58:33,573 --> 02:58:34,635
Name and address of the record, please.

2148
02:58:35,336 --> 02:58:36,438
My name is C.J.

2149
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:36,779
Daugherty.

2150
02:58:37,039 --> 02:58:39,383
I live at 14 Riling Pond Road in Lincoln, Mass.

2151
02:58:40,004 --> 02:58:45,914
Up until two years ago, I was a lifelong resident of Medford, Saltonstall Road, Grove Street, Woburn Street.

2152
02:58:48,095 --> 02:58:52,599
Medford is where my family settled when I was born, and we're still a huge part of the city, I like to think.

2153
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:56,743
I often joke that the city of Medford is a third of my personality.

2154
02:58:57,204 --> 02:58:58,645
I care about it passionately.

2155
02:58:59,946 --> 02:59:00,927
And it's an honor to speak here.

2156
02:59:01,267 --> 02:59:03,229
Generally, I really enjoy public speaking.

2157
02:59:03,349 --> 02:59:04,590
Some of you know that.

2158
02:59:05,311 --> 02:59:09,715
But I'm nervous today, because in my house growing up, we didn't watch the Red Sox or the Bruins or the Celtics.

2159
02:59:10,336 --> 02:59:11,417
We watched city council meetings.

2160
02:59:12,505 --> 02:59:18,967
So Councillor Penta, Councillor Mayocco, Maloney were bigger stars to me than Wade Boggs and Robert Parish and Mike Greenwell.

2161
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:20,647
So it's intimidating to be here.

2162
02:59:20,687 --> 02:59:23,768
Had it been in the hall, I would have been a little more nervous.

2163
02:59:24,148 --> 02:59:32,270
In growing up and watching those meetings, there were hours of debate on small issues like whether or not neon lights should be allowed on Mystic Avenue.

2164
02:59:34,091 --> 02:59:41,833
Councillor Penta would frequently lose his mind because he wanted what was right for the city, and that wasn't what was necessarily right for the businesses.

2165
02:59:43,418 --> 02:59:51,820
And it always stuck with me that the level of stewardship historically shown by this council mattered, that the people of Medford mattered to this council.

2166
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:57,881
And today, we've all sat here and heard arguments for and against.

2167
02:59:58,461 --> 03:00:04,903
We've heard support ranging far and wide from all areas of this city and beyond.

2168
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:14,445
but none from Hall Street, none from Linden Ave, none from Locust Street, none from Riverside Ave, very few, if any, from Wellington.

2169
03:00:16,046 --> 03:00:25,012
And it's very easy to live on North Cedar Road, to live in Winchester, to live in Andover, and say, this city needs these dog parks.

2170
03:00:25,613 --> 03:00:26,733
They need to be there.

2171
03:00:28,394 --> 03:00:31,957
They go home, or they don't even go to this neighborhood.

2172
03:00:31,997 --> 03:00:33,358
They don't know where Linden Street is.

2173
03:00:35,191 --> 03:00:40,232
A van comes and their coonhound comes running and they go away and they come back at the end of the day.

2174
03:00:42,033 --> 03:00:54,256
In the, and I'll speak just on a side note, the apartments that I'm here to represent, in the construction company with the beeping trucks that I also represent, are spoken of like dirty words tonight.

2175
03:00:56,456 --> 03:00:57,677
Those apartments are there.

2176
03:00:58,377 --> 03:00:59,277
People live there.

2177
03:00:59,637 --> 03:01:01,458
There are 57 units, approximately 128 people.

2178
03:01:03,794 --> 03:01:06,535
These people wake up in the morning and have their coffee there.

2179
03:01:06,996 --> 03:01:09,317
They read their children bedtime stories there.

2180
03:01:09,957 --> 03:01:11,838
They aren't inconvenient facts.

2181
03:01:12,659 --> 03:01:13,379
They're people.

2182
03:01:13,579 --> 03:01:14,860
They're citizens of Medford.

2183
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:17,141
Some of them work the second shift.

2184
03:01:17,181 --> 03:01:18,382
Some of them work the third shift.

2185
03:01:18,722 --> 03:01:19,923
Some of them sleep during the day.

2186
03:01:21,268 --> 03:01:24,371
It was discussed that there'll be weekend boarding.

2187
03:01:24,591 --> 03:01:26,953
That's when most of the weekend boarding will happen.

2188
03:01:27,353 --> 03:01:28,614
That's when everyone's home.

2189
03:01:29,095 --> 03:01:31,597
That's when you expect peace and quiet around the clock.

2190
03:01:32,117 --> 03:01:34,059
That's when our construction companies don't operate.

2191
03:01:34,639 --> 03:01:38,443
Furthermore, having a proximity to construction companies

2192
03:01:39,350 --> 03:01:43,111
It's been discussed like we're building buildings at our facilities.

2193
03:01:43,972 --> 03:01:51,874
We leave at 7 and come back at 5, unless there's a snow emergency in which we have to start our vehicles to come up here so that school opens the next day.

2194
03:01:53,055 --> 03:01:56,256
Construction doesn't happen in the location of the construction facility.

2195
03:01:57,276 --> 03:02:02,838
The only construction that's happening now could be addressed by the party that was here initially, because they're rebuilding Meadow Glen Mall.

2196
03:02:06,110 --> 03:02:09,791
constant noise from landscaping, the lawn gets cut once a week.

2197
03:02:10,331 --> 03:02:13,012
So if you time it right, there's landscaping on Locust Street.

2198
03:02:13,492 --> 03:02:14,892
Beyond that, that's it.

2199
03:02:15,012 --> 03:02:18,893
All those industrial companies that are there open in the morning and close at night.

2200
03:02:19,593 --> 03:02:22,994
They're not—Cardi isn't doing test boring in their own parking lot.

2201
03:02:23,934 --> 03:02:25,154
They go to Winchester.

2202
03:02:25,194 --> 03:02:26,135
They go to Burlington.

2203
03:02:26,415 --> 03:02:27,515
They're not doing it right there.

2204
03:02:29,496 --> 03:02:40,089
Furthermore, when we talk, I am not a dog turf expert, but I'd say there are very few people who know more about digging dirt in Medford than I do, particularly in that exact proximity.

2205
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:45,215
Medford substrate there is clay, which is not permeable.

2206
03:02:45,935 --> 03:02:48,438
Furthermore, the water table is down two feet.

2207
03:02:49,195 --> 03:02:53,256
clay, Mr. President, will freeze and will not permeate.

2208
03:02:53,876 --> 03:03:04,699
So the question of it's great that their magic carpet will permeate water, but it will not go anywhere, especially that it's not, in fact, water.

2209
03:03:05,399 --> 03:03:14,222
Nonetheless, I can't imagine a scenario where this board

2210
03:03:15,436 --> 03:03:20,819
can sit here and approve a business that directly impacts citizens.

2211
03:03:23,301 --> 03:03:27,563
And especially when it's only gonna benefit such a small percentage of them.

2212
03:03:28,204 --> 03:03:42,412
If we're saying that we live in a city of 57,000 people, if we're gonna have 50 dogs a day, five days a week, if there's turnover every day, at most they're gonna service 250 dogs.

2213
03:03:44,418 --> 03:03:45,619
That's a minuscule percentage.

2214
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:52,183
And as a small just point of reference, I'm sorry if I'm off point here.

2215
03:03:53,283 --> 03:03:57,146
The notion that this business is gonna save the city of Medford money.

2216
03:03:58,967 --> 03:04:01,268
I contacted the animal control office.

2217
03:04:01,828 --> 03:04:03,910
On average they spend about $2,000 a year.

2218
03:04:04,650 --> 03:04:09,413
That is three cents per person in Medford is what we pay to house these animals.

2219
03:04:10,674 --> 03:04:12,835
I think that is an asinine,

2220
03:04:14,741 --> 03:04:17,022
point to make when saying this is going to be great for the city.

2221
03:04:17,882 --> 03:04:22,964
Also, that property generates revenue as real estate tax anyway.

2222
03:04:23,424 --> 03:04:27,325
It's not as though this business is going to dramatically change that assessment.

2223
03:04:28,085 --> 03:04:29,506
It's already generating tax.

2224
03:04:29,906 --> 03:04:33,227
If it's not this company that goes in there, someone else will buy it.

2225
03:04:33,327 --> 03:04:35,408
Someone else will operate a business there.

2226
03:04:36,088 --> 03:04:38,789
it will be improved regardless of who goes in.

2227
03:04:39,289 --> 03:04:46,751
But I don't think it's fair to punish the residents there, who again, are people.

2228
03:04:46,851 --> 03:04:49,252
They're women, they're men, they're children, they're families.

2229
03:04:50,252 --> 03:04:57,195
They love Medford for such a small percentage of people who are gonna benefit from it.

2230
03:04:57,695 --> 03:05:02,236
And if we take note of who came to support it, at least 10 of them aren't from Medford.

2231
03:05:02,936 --> 03:05:04,757
So of the 50 dogs, 40 of them

2232
03:05:05,829 --> 03:05:06,950
don't have a Medford accent.

2233
03:05:09,491 --> 03:05:15,955
So with that, I humbly request that this board takes all that into consideration and says no to this permit.

2234
03:05:16,575 --> 03:05:16,996
Thank you very much.

2235
03:05:17,016 --> 03:05:21,818
Thank you.

2236
03:05:21,838 --> 03:05:22,639
Does anyone else have to speak?

2237
03:05:27,455 --> 03:05:28,696
I'm sorry, another busy night for me.

2238
03:05:29,236 --> 03:05:30,717
Name and address of the record, please.

2239
03:05:30,757 --> 03:05:31,937
Gene Yuzo, 35 Parris Street.

2240
03:05:32,717 --> 03:05:39,281
I have to say, when the night first began, that I was skeptical and thought that this was a really bad idea.

2241
03:05:40,101 --> 03:05:40,341
I did.

2242
03:05:41,702 --> 03:05:52,106
Simply because it abuts a property that's a residential property, and I think that, as others have said, it is important that you have quiet enjoyment of your premises.

2243
03:05:52,967 --> 03:05:54,828
But then I watched the presentation,

2244
03:05:55,888 --> 03:05:57,710
and the details of construction.

2245
03:05:58,571 --> 03:06:08,298
The fact that they're going to have double walls of fencing that have insulation between them to help buffer the sound of the dogs.

2246
03:06:08,919 --> 03:06:10,160
The fact that they're going to have

2247
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:22,606
the largest trees they possibly can install in the back to create a barrier that separates that residential unit from the new property that they're looking to put.

2248
03:06:23,406 --> 03:06:27,028
And the fact that they're going to also do insulation internally

2249
03:06:27,928 --> 03:06:29,989
and do some traffic control with the animals.

2250
03:06:30,649 --> 03:06:47,434
And to me, it seems that of all of the different presentations I've seen over the past few years, for businesses and residents and various developments, that aside from one other that I can think of, this one has been very thoughtfully put together.

2251
03:06:48,514 --> 03:06:56,437
And so, I would say at this juncture, I'm leaning more towards looking at the fact that it's an industrial place

2252
03:06:57,859 --> 03:07:17,502
They're looking to use it in an industrial or commercial use, which is what it's intended for, and we can look to find a way to work with them together as a business that isn't a negative or net negative solution as residential units tend to be because it costs more to educate.

2253
03:07:18,162 --> 03:07:22,666
children in those apartments than it does for a commercial property to run.

2254
03:07:23,146 --> 03:07:24,908
We need a delicate balance between.

2255
03:07:25,668 --> 03:07:32,154
And this group of individuals are coming to the city of Medford because they see that as an opportunity.

2256
03:07:33,054 --> 03:07:40,981
And we have other things that are looking to go on Locust Street that we say shouldn't be there because Locust Street is industrial.

2257
03:07:44,118 --> 03:07:46,681
We've got a bit of a mixed message going on here.

2258
03:07:48,183 --> 03:08:01,237
I would think that, you know, if it's the overnight issue that's truly the issue, it's a nominal amount of the business for this group of people, perhaps they would be willing to rethink that.

2259
03:08:01,957 --> 03:08:16,096
And although it's a million dollar investment, I'm sure that a gradual increase, not 100 dogs, not 50 right away, but maybe you look at 25 or 30, and you revisit it in three or six months for that additional 25 or 30.

2260
03:08:17,598 --> 03:08:18,498
It's a give and take.

2261
03:08:18,578 --> 03:08:20,019
There has to be a compromise.

2262
03:08:20,179 --> 03:08:23,600
And I feel like there could be a compromise to be reached here.

2263
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:26,340
And I hope that you guys consider that.

2264
03:08:26,581 --> 03:08:32,362
And with that said, if we can find a middle ground, I would think that it would be a great thing for the city of Memphis.

2265
03:08:33,042 --> 03:08:33,402
Thank you.

2266
03:08:37,724 --> 03:08:37,944
Thank you.

2267
03:08:39,847 --> 03:08:42,649
Patty Flynn, 139 Grand Ave, Bedford, Mass.

2268
03:08:43,549 --> 03:08:44,470
I wasn't going to speak.

2269
03:08:45,010 --> 03:08:45,671
I'll make it brief.

2270
03:08:46,631 --> 03:08:51,234
I think if I, first, if I was a resident, I keep hearing about the residents of Linden Street.

2271
03:08:51,714 --> 03:08:52,435
I don't see them.

2272
03:08:53,676 --> 03:08:54,236
Where are they?

2273
03:08:55,337 --> 03:08:56,317
If they're so opposed to it.

2274
03:08:56,337 --> 03:08:57,418
The gentleman just left.

2275
03:08:57,438 --> 03:08:59,719
He's on Locust Street, and he can't hear.

2276
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:03,902
I'm sorry, but where are the residents that are opposing them?

2277
03:09:05,543 --> 03:09:05,743
Huh?

2278
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:10,693
Where are they?

2279
03:09:12,597 --> 03:09:17,247
If it was me and I was bothered by something that was going to move next to me, I'd be here.

2280
03:09:18,642 --> 03:09:19,382
I've said my piece.

2281
03:09:20,022 --> 03:09:24,283
I think we need businesses in Medford, and I think it'd be a disservice not to grant it.

2282
03:09:24,703 --> 03:09:24,923
Thank you.

2283
03:09:24,943 --> 03:09:26,044
Point of information, Mr. President.

2284
03:09:26,064 --> 03:09:27,824
Point of information, Counselor Scott Pelley.

2285
03:09:28,524 --> 03:09:36,326
Just to address that constituent, I did receive phone calls and emails from people from Linden and Locust Street.

2286
03:09:36,746 --> 03:09:47,928
So, just like I received messages from the outside, so I think that we're, you know, they've sent their message to the people they elected to make sure that we understand where they stand.

2287
03:09:48,788 --> 03:09:51,311
I appreciate everybody that came out tonight, so thank you.

2288
03:09:51,331 --> 03:09:52,432
Name and address of the record, please.

2289
03:09:52,592 --> 03:09:54,553
Carla LoQuante, 49 Lorena Road.

2290
03:09:55,114 --> 03:09:55,835
What city do you live in?

2291
03:09:56,095 --> 03:09:56,815
Winchester, Mass.

2292
03:09:56,855 --> 03:09:57,136
Thank you.

2293
03:09:57,176 --> 03:10:04,282
And I have been grateful and customers of Michelle and Nick for a few years.

2294
03:10:05,323 --> 03:10:11,909
I have been in business for 27 years and I have been a resident of Mass and my parents are still residents and we're dog lovers.

2295
03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:15,232
From where I sit, we are in

2296
03:10:16,008 --> 03:10:19,449
Forget Medford, forget Winchester, forget Malden, forget Lynn.

2297
03:10:19,869 --> 03:10:24,051
We are in America, and we are here to make a living.

2298
03:10:25,011 --> 03:10:29,392
They want to make a beautiful facility, state of the art.

2299
03:10:29,952 --> 03:10:34,554
They're crossing their T's, they're dotting their I's, they're coming before you humbled and asking.

2300
03:10:35,334 --> 03:10:37,355
Please let us run a business.

2301
03:10:37,975 --> 03:10:39,235
We will do what you want us to do.

2302
03:10:39,616 --> 03:10:40,436
What is wrong with that?

2303
03:10:41,691 --> 03:10:43,673
Every other business has to start somewhere.

2304
03:10:44,473 --> 03:10:46,295
Like I said, I started 27 years ago.

2305
03:10:46,755 --> 03:11:05,550
I can't believe the past six months it's been this much angst and dialogue over creating something that is legal and necessary for young people, young people that I'm not, coming into Medford for beautiful property, beautiful condos, through realtors.

2306
03:11:06,051 --> 03:11:08,733
I would think a service business makes complete sense.

2307
03:11:12,483 --> 03:11:13,343
Point of information, Mr. President?

2308
03:11:13,623 --> 03:11:14,804
Point of information, Counselor Knighton.

2309
03:11:14,824 --> 03:11:16,845
I don't think it's the nature of the business that's anybody's concern.

2310
03:11:16,905 --> 03:11:18,305
It is the very nature.

2311
03:11:18,345 --> 03:11:19,326
No, it's the location.

2312
03:11:19,366 --> 03:11:21,086
It's not the nature, it's the location of the business.

2313
03:11:21,287 --> 03:11:22,387
As was spoken earlier, sir.

2314
03:11:22,407 --> 03:11:24,268
That's why it's required to go through a special permitting process.

2315
03:11:24,288 --> 03:11:27,389
And I understand that, and that's what they're doing here, and I completely understand that.

2316
03:11:27,429 --> 03:11:28,690
I respect, I understand you.

2317
03:11:29,070 --> 03:11:30,010
But they have showed you.

2318
03:11:30,370 --> 03:11:31,931
They have looked, and they're still looking.

2319
03:11:32,531 --> 03:11:37,552
This is the perfect location, real estate is what is available at the time.

2320
03:11:38,092 --> 03:11:39,032
And this is where they are.

2321
03:11:39,052 --> 03:11:46,974
Right, it's a perfect location for them to operate a business that they're proposing and they're coming before the council and they're asking us whether or not we feel it's a perfect location.

2322
03:11:47,754 --> 03:11:49,174
But it is a perfect location.

2323
03:11:49,855 --> 03:11:50,415
In your opinion.

2324
03:11:53,915 --> 03:11:54,276
That's it.

2325
03:11:54,476 --> 03:11:54,736
Thank you.

2326
03:11:54,756 --> 03:11:58,216
I hope you vote for them because if you don't, I think that's a very sad day in Memphis.

2327
03:11:58,556 --> 03:11:59,137
Thank you very much.

2328
03:11:59,397 --> 03:11:59,957
For business.

2329
03:12:00,237 --> 03:12:00,837
Thank you very much.

2330
03:12:08,919 --> 03:12:10,040
Name and address of the record, please.

2331
03:12:10,060 --> 03:12:13,061
I'm Mary Ellen Daugherty.

2332
03:12:13,141 --> 03:12:15,402
I live at 173 Wilburn Street in Medford.

2333
03:12:15,962 --> 03:12:18,263
I failed to pass these to you.

2334
03:12:18,303 --> 03:12:20,884
These are... Larry will take care of them.

2335
03:12:27,019 --> 03:12:39,585
I just want to say really briefly that the reason that this kind of facility is so difficult to place is because it's not neighborhood friendly.

2336
03:12:40,026 --> 03:12:41,286
It's not people friendly.

2337
03:12:41,746 --> 03:12:44,648
So it has a hard time finding a home.

2338
03:12:45,808 --> 03:12:47,029
So that's all I have to say.

2339
03:12:47,629 --> 03:12:48,010
Thank you.

2340
03:12:48,070 --> 03:12:48,370
Thank you.

2341
03:12:54,411 --> 03:12:55,952
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

2342
03:12:56,412 --> 03:13:00,896
Charlene Duffy Saulnier, 14 Tontine Street in West Medford.

2343
03:13:02,797 --> 03:13:05,579
So, this is my first city council meeting.

2344
03:13:05,599 --> 03:13:10,983
I've been in Medford all my life, and I should have been here before.

2345
03:13:12,439 --> 03:13:20,641
But I actually am the administrator for the Middlesex Fells Reservation Dog Owners Group.

2346
03:13:22,941 --> 03:13:29,763
I am also one of the Martab board members.

2347
03:13:30,403 --> 03:13:34,924
We advise the governor about how to use money for trails for DCR.

2348
03:13:36,705 --> 03:13:40,927
I'm not representing either of those institutions when I sit here tonight.

2349
03:13:42,528 --> 03:13:52,592
I have to say that when I first met Michelle and Nick, I was introduced to them by some dog lovers who had done a lot of work in the Medford community.

2350
03:13:53,313 --> 03:14:05,618
And I was very excited because I think if you look at the fact that if there are 57,000 of us and 10,000 of us are dog owners, then obviously that's a big percentage of the population.

2351
03:14:06,428 --> 03:14:18,493
And I do think that Medford could use, we could do to be more dog friendly because so many of our citizens own dogs.

2352
03:14:20,293 --> 03:14:32,218
I also think that they did an amazing presentation and that they put in a lot of effort to their presentation.

2353
03:14:32,772 --> 03:14:49,125
But I have to say, from the perspective of, you know, Fels Dog, the Fels Dog group, which I'm co-administering, we started with about 20 members, and in the time that I've been running it, we're up to about 750.

2354
03:14:50,005 --> 03:14:57,151
And so it's a pretty active group, you know, they try to keep the Fels clean, they do a lot of educating and things like that.

2355
03:14:57,951 --> 03:15:11,454
And I was frantically at work one day when I got a lot of phone calls and texts saying that some pretty bad things had happened to a few of the dog walkers in Medford.

2356
03:15:13,235 --> 03:15:23,317
And the gist of it was that some people in Medford had extended a hand and said, let us tell you what the story is about local business.

2357
03:15:28,070 --> 03:15:36,796
they actually offered their services to help these folks get moving forward, and then found their names on a list that went to the dog officer.

2358
03:15:37,497 --> 03:15:45,062
So, you know, I honestly can't, I can only say that all of the parties involved have confirmed to me that that's exactly what happened.

2359
03:15:46,622 --> 03:15:54,265
I had an hour and a half long conference call with Dogs for Days and they never once said they didn't do it.

2360
03:15:54,285 --> 03:16:00,147
I know they started their presentation tonight by saying that they wish that they had not done that.

2361
03:16:00,427 --> 03:16:02,028
I don't think that's good behavior.

2362
03:16:02,048 --> 03:16:04,829
I don't think it's the behavior that you look for in a business.

2363
03:16:06,069 --> 03:16:10,591
But conversely, I can't honestly sit here and say, no, I don't think they should be here.

2364
03:16:11,231 --> 03:16:13,332
I should hope that they learned from what happened.

2365
03:16:14,692 --> 03:16:22,535
And I should hope that they would honor the people that are here, rather than, you know, try to push them aside.

2366
03:16:22,595 --> 03:16:28,997
Because despite what the other gal said, I don't think that there's so many dogs in Medford.

2367
03:16:29,017 --> 03:16:30,877
I don't think there's going to be that much competition.

2368
03:16:30,897 --> 03:16:33,238
I think there's plenty of business for everybody.

2369
03:16:33,578 --> 03:16:37,559
But I do really believe that it's a business that we need.

2370
03:16:37,679 --> 03:16:39,360
It's a really good business model.

2371
03:16:40,901 --> 03:16:44,585
And if run appropriately, I think it would be helpful for the city.

2372
03:16:46,206 --> 03:16:48,688
So that's pretty much what I have to say.

2373
03:16:49,249 --> 03:16:49,589
Thank you.

2374
03:16:52,892 --> 03:16:58,938
Do we have any further discussion?

2375
03:17:02,754 --> 03:17:11,103
I'm going to read you a letter from Shipley Mason, Vice President of Century Bank.

2376
03:17:12,064 --> 03:17:12,864
We all have that letter.

2377
03:17:13,545 --> 03:17:15,087
Oh, I'd like to read it so everybody can hear.

2378
03:17:15,747 --> 03:17:17,509
I believe it was emailed to all of you today.

2379
03:17:18,530 --> 03:17:18,851
July 18, 2017.

2380
03:17:18,911 --> 03:17:22,535
Dear Councillors of the City of Medford, Mass.

2381
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:33,124
You will be deciding on whether to grant a special permit to Dogs for Days LLC to allow them to open up their doggie daycare business at 29 Linden Street, Medford, Mass., this evening.

2382
03:17:33,644 --> 03:17:43,248
As a senior vice president at Century Bank who has funded several of these types of ventures in the past, I can assure you that this business model will bring both benefits and revenue to the City of Medford.

2383
03:17:43,629 --> 03:17:46,650
The common dog in Everett, which Century Bank also funded,

2384
03:17:47,130 --> 03:17:49,012
would be a good model for you to compare this with.

2385
03:17:49,492 --> 03:17:57,820
The city of Medford has developed a lot of residential apartments and condos in the past year, and people need an outlet for their pets in the city rather than going to another town.

2386
03:17:58,240 --> 03:18:05,687
Moreover, upscale tenants and buyers, the people who are choosing to move here, are expecting this type of amenity to be available in their city.

2387
03:18:06,247 --> 03:18:12,953
I'm sorry that I am not available to attend the special permit hearing tonight in person, as I am leaving for vacation this afternoon with my family.

2388
03:18:13,634 --> 03:18:21,182
However, if you have any questions about the amount of revenue or other benefits this type of venture will bring to the city, please do not hesitate to reach me.

2389
03:18:21,362 --> 03:18:22,303
He has his phone number.

2390
03:18:22,884 --> 03:18:30,612
I have met with Michelle Legler from Dogs for Days personally, and I believe she will be a smart, hardworking business owner who will benefit the community.

2391
03:18:31,092 --> 03:18:39,726
I am hoping that everyone in the City Council can see that this business will meet a growing demand for services from both the existing and many of the City's new residents.

2392
03:18:40,087 --> 03:18:43,613
Sincerely, Shipley C. Mason, Senior Vice President, Central Bank.

2393
03:18:44,474 --> 03:18:44,735
Thank you.

2394
03:18:49,694 --> 03:18:50,855
Name and address of the record, please.

2395
03:18:50,876 --> 03:18:51,416
Okay.

2396
03:18:51,456 --> 03:18:54,180
For those of you who don't know me, Heather Champney Anderson.

2397
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:59,947
I live at 102 Brooks Street in Medford, and I did not come here tonight for this particular discussion.

2398
03:19:00,888 --> 03:19:07,757
But what has distressed me as I sit and listen to this is that I am totally confused.

2399
03:19:08,558 --> 03:19:20,605
First of all, I've heard almost every one of you speak specifically to encouraging and developing more business, new business, and small business in Medford on more than one occasion.

2400
03:19:21,485 --> 03:19:23,887
In fact, many of your platforms have been based upon this.

2401
03:19:24,367 --> 03:19:43,819
At the same time, I have been very active in the last 35 years in the community around a number of activities where citizens have come forward concerned about their neighborhoods, concerned about changes within their neighborhoods, concerned about things much worse than noise in their neighborhoods.

2402
03:19:44,060 --> 03:19:50,764
And quite honestly, they have not found satisfaction with the council or some of its decisions.

2403
03:19:51,681 --> 03:20:02,632
I have observed over 35 years that it does seem that there has been, and I'm not speaking to you as individuals now, because it's 35 years and some of you probably weren't even out of school.

2404
03:20:04,774 --> 03:20:08,197
I am concerned, of course you were one of those.

2405
03:20:10,665 --> 03:20:16,568
that I am concerned that the rules don't apply equally and evenly to everyone.

2406
03:20:17,609 --> 03:20:25,353
We would not even be having this discussion had there not been a change to the industrial zoning approval in the first place.

2407
03:20:26,578 --> 03:20:40,301
So I'm having great difficulty in understanding why rules apply to certain individuals in the community or certain businesses in the community and not necessarily do the rules apply to others.

2408
03:20:40,761 --> 03:20:50,862
I think it's, I understand what a difficult position it is for all of you to have constituents who are calling, who are saying, not in my backyard, don't make noise here.

2409
03:20:50,922 --> 03:20:53,163
But I know that you've all had this before.

2410
03:20:53,963 --> 03:21:12,527
It is time to move Medford forward in a new direction, not to play the same 35-year-old politics that we've been hearing, and to please, let's apply rules evenly, let's not search desperately for there's going to be four ounces extra P here and, you know, two pounds of whatever here.

2411
03:21:12,587 --> 03:21:22,529
These are people who have clearly brought forward a business plan, which in my opinion and experience is way more sophisticated than many of the business plans that have been brought before you.

2412
03:21:23,509 --> 03:21:49,085
So I'm here speaking as a citizen just concerned about what I hear and what I've seen over 35 years and really excited by the possibility of what I felt was happening in the city that we were actually moving forward looking at what was going to happen in the city now and in the future and not just consistently responding to certain issues in certain ways.

2413
03:21:49,325 --> 03:21:51,407
And I am really tired of the

2414
03:21:52,047 --> 03:22:03,051
These of us who are Medford versus the rest of the world, the bottom line is you're selling your properties in this community to people who have not been born here at greatly inflated prices.

2415
03:22:03,371 --> 03:22:05,531
People are making money all over the place.

2416
03:22:06,132 --> 03:22:07,852
It is time to stop.

2417
03:22:08,532 --> 03:22:10,193
And I have to ask the question.

2418
03:22:10,893 --> 03:22:14,977
Is this property eventually becoming more valuable for more development?

2419
03:22:15,277 --> 03:22:17,579
And I don't mean development of an industrial nature.

2420
03:22:17,859 --> 03:22:30,490
People have already been making, many developers have come in who are not Medford residents and who have made bucks off all of us all and the rest of us in those communities and those neighborhoods have been impacted and not always in a positive way.

2421
03:22:31,150 --> 03:22:32,671
Can't we please move forward?

2422
03:22:32,971 --> 03:22:34,452
This is an industrial area.

2423
03:22:34,752 --> 03:22:36,253
This is a legitimate business.

2424
03:22:36,533 --> 03:22:37,313
These are people.

2425
03:22:37,774 --> 03:22:40,235
I don't care about the competitive issue.

2426
03:22:40,275 --> 03:22:41,816
I mean, competition is competition.

2427
03:22:42,336 --> 03:22:48,379
We have pet walkers and people who board animals in their home in our neighborhood over in West Medford.

2428
03:22:48,940 --> 03:22:50,380
They do not have any licenses.

2429
03:22:50,481 --> 03:22:52,802
No one has asked us about the barking, et cetera.

2430
03:22:53,422 --> 03:22:54,503
No one has complained.

2431
03:22:55,423 --> 03:23:01,544
I think there is room for a formal business, a big business of this sort, as well as for the small businesses.

2432
03:23:01,764 --> 03:23:12,606
But my bottom line is my concern is where is this council and where is the future of Medford going, and are we going to treat all people in a way that is fair and equal?

2433
03:23:13,506 --> 03:23:13,746
Thank you.

2434
03:23:13,766 --> 03:23:23,468
Thank you.

2435
03:23:23,488 --> 03:23:24,608
Do we have any further discussion?

2436
03:23:33,117 --> 03:23:38,083
I'm Mike Lewis, 133 Pyramid Road, Medford, Mass.

2437
03:23:38,804 --> 03:23:41,828
I'm a commissioner for the Medford Housing Authority on the CPC as well.

2438
03:23:42,368 --> 03:23:43,409
I'm a dog owner.

2439
03:23:43,429 --> 03:23:44,050
I have two dogs.

2440
03:23:44,070 --> 03:23:44,751
I love them to death.

2441
03:23:46,733 --> 03:23:53,622
I'm just here, I would support these residents, because if it's not this place, it's going to be where the housing authority is.

2442
03:23:53,663 --> 03:23:55,905
That's where they typically put these types of businesses.

2443
03:23:56,767 --> 03:24:00,351
I'm here to support those residents, even if they're not particularly here.

2444
03:24:02,343 --> 03:24:09,086
The amount of noise, just because there's construction there, doesn't mean you add on additional 30, 40, 50 dogs.

2445
03:24:09,586 --> 03:24:13,968
In addition, like the gentleman previously said, those construction companies, they shut down at night.

2446
03:24:14,569 --> 03:24:21,052
Overnight dogs, if anyone had dogs near them during the Fourth of July, the fireworks, those dogs go nuts.

2447
03:24:21,112 --> 03:24:21,792
I mean, my own do.

2448
03:24:23,013 --> 03:24:25,955
So I just think it's just, I think the business plan is great.

2449
03:24:25,995 --> 03:24:27,856
I think they did a fantastic job.

2450
03:24:28,677 --> 03:24:29,977
I just don't think the area's right.

2451
03:24:30,518 --> 03:24:37,543
In addition, I would say my dog walker called me in tears about fictitious claims made to the dog officer.

2452
03:24:37,983 --> 03:24:44,648
So this company that wants to come in and do all these great things, they're going to bad mouth all the current businesses in Medford.

2453
03:24:45,228 --> 03:24:47,630
and bring some bad publicity to them.

2454
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:52,433
To me, that's just not the right foot you want to make coming to the city.

2455
03:24:52,913 --> 03:24:58,457
So it's disconcerting that they're saying, oh, we're professional, we do this, we do that, oh, look at this turf, we got all this stuff.

2456
03:24:59,057 --> 03:25:07,463
Yet we're going to make false claims and waste the city resources of the dog officer and make false claims about the businesses that have been in Medford for a number of years.

2457
03:25:10,465 --> 03:25:10,825
Thank you.

2458
03:25:12,226 --> 03:25:13,287
Anyone else wishing to speak?

2459
03:25:20,942 --> 03:25:28,806
I know everyone's tired and wanna go home, but I just wanna speak on behalf of Nick and Michelle, and I'm in Winchester right now, but I lived in Medford for two years and Somerville for one.

2460
03:25:29,206 --> 03:25:30,487
I love this city, I know this city.

2461
03:25:30,627 --> 03:25:31,688
I work at Tufts University.

2462
03:25:31,768 --> 03:25:33,949
My mom's a high school teacher at Medford High.

2463
03:25:34,829 --> 03:25:37,311
I think that this is a great opportunity for this town.

2464
03:25:37,791 --> 03:25:45,135
I think that whatever concerns you guys have, I think as far as parking goes and other residents, I'm sure they can figure it out and work with the city.

2465
03:25:45,435 --> 03:25:48,596
Maybe they'll have an off-site lot and they'll have you guys book them in.

2466
03:25:50,297 --> 03:25:50,938
bring people in.

2467
03:25:52,458 --> 03:25:57,661
As far as the residents go, I don't think they'll have, like he said, there was a dog barking there for 45 minutes.

2468
03:25:57,801 --> 03:26:00,663
If no one complained about that, I don't think it's a huge issue.

2469
03:26:01,283 --> 03:26:09,648
Also, they said they were gonna shut down at 6 p.m., the same as the construction company, and all the dogs will go inside, they'll do individual walks outside.

2470
03:26:09,768 --> 03:26:14,951
I think that's fair, and they said, what is it, one for soundproofing?

2471
03:26:16,885 --> 03:26:18,287
He'll be a level one.

2472
03:26:18,307 --> 03:26:19,869
I don't think anyone will hear that.

2473
03:26:20,009 --> 03:26:21,431
I really, truly don't.

2474
03:26:21,531 --> 03:26:23,433
I mean, that plan looks solid.

2475
03:26:23,473 --> 03:26:24,895
It looks on point.

2476
03:26:25,115 --> 03:26:29,040
Also, to their character, I think they are just amazing people.

2477
03:26:29,141 --> 03:26:34,668
I had a dog that was super leash aggressive, and I asked Nick to take care of her and try to train her.

2478
03:26:35,128 --> 03:26:56,880
didn't charge me any extra just for the love and the passion this is their passion and she's amazing now i can take her anywhere do anything with her she's an amazing dog i don't think that i think that they are solid people this is their passion they're here to create business for the city and to bring a great aspect to the city and i think that they're willing to work with you guys in the city

2479
03:26:57,380 --> 03:27:00,042
and everyone else around them, because this is their passion project.

2480
03:27:00,102 --> 03:27:01,203
This is what they want to do.

2481
03:27:01,243 --> 03:27:02,584
This is what they want to bring to the city.

2482
03:27:03,245 --> 03:27:05,767
And I just think that we should be in support of them.

2483
03:27:06,087 --> 03:27:06,487
That's all.

2484
03:27:06,747 --> 03:27:07,068
Thank you.

2485
03:27:12,372 --> 03:27:13,613
Any further discussion?

2486
03:27:16,638 --> 03:27:17,018
Questions?

2487
03:27:17,659 --> 03:27:20,140
Any questions?

2488
03:27:21,640 --> 03:27:23,021
Thank you, President Carviello.

2489
03:27:23,041 --> 03:27:27,923
I appreciate everybody coming and letting us know where you stand.

2490
03:27:27,943 --> 03:27:31,805
I would love to see some compromise.

2491
03:27:31,845 --> 03:27:33,946
I don't know how the council stands.

2492
03:27:33,966 --> 03:27:41,249
I'm not sure if the votes are there or not, but have you created different financial models to

2493
03:27:42,103 --> 03:27:48,245
potentially not do overnights and close at six o'clock, or not take 50 dogs at first.

2494
03:27:48,545 --> 03:28:01,890
We have granted special permits for, with six month reviews, with a year review, and I, not that we can do that to you, I know you probably invested not just one million on the building, but additional money.

2495
03:28:03,611 --> 03:28:10,354
And it's hard to negotiate tonight, because we don't, we have the land owners there, but we don't have the residents that live there.

2496
03:28:11,514 --> 03:28:21,517
and I'll speak personally, that I like to hear from residents who are going to be affected by certain projects because they come first, but at the same time they're not here.

2497
03:28:21,617 --> 03:28:24,618
So I just wanted to maybe ask you if you can speak to that.

2498
03:28:25,719 --> 03:28:29,240
Is there any wiggle room, maybe a little negotiation we can

2499
03:28:30,141 --> 03:28:30,761
Absolutely.

2500
03:28:31,222 --> 03:28:32,603
So thank you for the question.

2501
03:28:32,964 --> 03:28:34,585
Let me address first the residents.

2502
03:28:35,026 --> 03:28:40,331
So we actually did go down Linden Street and speak to the residents of actually Linden Street.

2503
03:28:41,212 --> 03:28:51,203
I do speak Spanish in addition to English and we spoke to several people that spoke in English and Spanish and our concerns were that we heard was we have a dog, it's not a problem.

2504
03:28:51,543 --> 03:28:55,445
We also spoke with Cardi and they did not have a concern as well too.

2505
03:28:55,525 --> 03:29:01,007
In fact, they encouraged us, wished us best of luck, gave us a handshake and said, you know, we hope to have you as neighbors here.

2506
03:29:01,367 --> 03:29:05,169
So we did speak quite a bit to the actual Linden Street residents.

2507
03:29:06,029 --> 03:29:08,170
As far as compromise, absolutely.

2508
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:14,333
As Nick and I have said numerous times, we're really here to build a business and to work with the city of Medford.

2509
03:29:14,713 --> 03:29:19,355
So this much talked about email, which we do have copies here for you.

2510
03:29:20,176 --> 03:29:21,917
As Brianna you were actually copying on it.

2511
03:29:22,018 --> 03:29:35,532
You do know that we actually inquired If we could look at would we need a permit for just doing daycare or do you need a permit solely just for doing for boarding and the response was you need a permit for

2512
03:29:35,772 --> 03:29:39,433
Whether you do daycare or boarding, there absolutely was no difference.

2513
03:29:39,834 --> 03:29:42,855
So from a business model perspective, yes, I have sat down.

2514
03:29:42,895 --> 03:29:45,136
I do actually have another bank here as well.

2515
03:29:45,516 --> 03:29:50,598
Brookline Bank, Century Bank, and Eastern Bank have all worked revenue models with me.

2516
03:29:51,198 --> 03:29:58,909
And so the boarding, as I mentioned before, is not a substantial portion of our business, so we would be willing to look at different revenue models.

2517
03:29:59,250 --> 03:30:04,818
However, having said that, according from VIVUSA, we would still require the same permit.

2518
03:30:04,838 --> 03:30:06,841
There would be absolutely no difference in that.

2519
03:30:09,887 --> 03:30:14,528
So, what are the models that you've approved?

2520
03:30:14,588 --> 03:30:15,668
Removing boarding.

2521
03:30:15,888 --> 03:30:24,670
We would look at removing overnight boarding, but the permit, the way that the city ordinances are for Medford, the permit is the same whether we offer it or not.

2522
03:30:24,770 --> 03:30:28,931
So, if you do a daycare in the city of Medford, you do require a special permit.

2523
03:30:29,671 --> 03:30:36,633
And then, I guess my other concern would be an irrigation system or some sort of, I mean, have you priced any of those?

2524
03:30:38,263 --> 03:30:47,811
Yes, I actually tried to speak to a construction company that is here that actually specializes in that and they were not interested in further conversations with us.

2525
03:30:48,211 --> 03:30:55,897
So we would like to explore that model further to try and figure out what we really would like to do is work with local Medford companies.

2526
03:30:56,577 --> 03:30:57,877
and have those companies.

2527
03:30:57,957 --> 03:31:04,379
Right now, I know there was a lot of discussions about our street, and so our neighbor across the street is a 24-hour towing company.

2528
03:31:04,939 --> 03:31:10,440
We had tried to talk with him about who does he use, how does he work with traffic, DPW, next door.

2529
03:31:10,640 --> 03:31:19,742
Everybody we have worked with has been tried to local, so we would like the local sewage experts, who I believe are CJ Doherty Construction, they specialize in this.

2530
03:31:20,102 --> 03:31:25,243
We actually would like to work with them and make sure that we have the proper sewage for our building.

2531
03:31:31,242 --> 03:31:39,714
I guess to ask the building owner, would closing at five or six change the scenario at all?

2532
03:31:40,054 --> 03:31:41,777
No, there's no scenario.

2533
03:31:42,698 --> 03:31:44,340
This is a Pandora's box scenario.

2534
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:45,241
Can I speak for you?

2535
03:31:45,302 --> 03:31:45,482
Yep.

2536
03:31:46,583 --> 03:31:47,445
Come to the podium, please.

2537
03:32:01,228 --> 03:32:14,440
So, from our perspective, as CJ had already incorporated, runoff from a dog waste facility is not sewerage.

2538
03:32:15,401 --> 03:32:16,342
It's a whole other matter.

2539
03:32:16,662 --> 03:32:18,504
We wouldn't just come up with a plan, you'd need an engineer.

2540
03:32:19,025 --> 03:32:22,468
Beyond that, from a compromise standpoint of whether or not

2541
03:32:24,263 --> 03:32:28,986
any of the real estate LLCs would find a way to negotiate this working.

2542
03:32:29,466 --> 03:32:30,227
The answer is no.

2543
03:32:30,967 --> 03:32:40,694
There is no scenario, this is not a Pandora's box situation, where they've openly said we're doing half of what the EPA or the ASPCA recommends.

2544
03:32:41,935 --> 03:32:43,416
I don't think any reasonable person

2545
03:32:44,800 --> 03:32:50,605
In their scenario, if business is booming like they anticipate, will not slowly escalate beyond that.

2546
03:32:51,426 --> 03:32:57,371
This is a scenario, once the door is opened and we unleash the dogs, they're not going back in.

2547
03:32:58,092 --> 03:33:06,940
This is a permanent decision where they will have an ongoing business in a neighborhood with residents, whether it's overwhelmingly zoned otherwise.

2548
03:33:07,960 --> 03:33:13,243
There are residents on Linden, there are residents on Locust Street, many of whom have signed the petition that was handed to you earlier.

2549
03:33:13,363 --> 03:33:18,225
A letter from one resident on Linden included, who couldn't attend because she works.

2550
03:33:19,326 --> 03:33:21,907
There's no scenario in which this moves forward.

2551
03:33:23,252 --> 03:33:24,953
that it doesn't become an ongoing problem.

2552
03:33:25,574 --> 03:33:36,982
When Michelle visited my office and we spoke outside, she had said to me, it's overwhelmingly supported by our neighbors, most of whom close their doors and go home at five or seven.

2553
03:33:37,803 --> 03:33:43,727
She also stated that the number one complaint of apartment owners and developers in the city was dogs barking.

2554
03:33:45,361 --> 03:33:52,363
And I had stated to her at that time, that's interesting because we do not allow dogs because in an apartment environment, they're a nuisance.

2555
03:33:52,943 --> 03:33:59,185
So now under her proposal, we're solving other people's problems by creating one in a new area.

2556
03:34:01,066 --> 03:34:08,688
And you have to acknowledge that the dog across the street that barks for 45 minutes will incite your dogs to bark all day.

2557
03:34:09,701 --> 03:34:14,044
Anyone who has a dog has heard their dog bark and then a crescendo across the neighborhood.

2558
03:34:14,684 --> 03:34:15,925
And that goes around and around.

2559
03:34:16,225 --> 03:34:21,549
So for us to think this is a problem solely on Linden and Locust is foolish.

2560
03:34:22,069 --> 03:34:26,893
This is a situation where once one dog goes, there's nothing stopping it from being 125.

2561
03:34:27,893 --> 03:34:34,318
And again, for our residents, who I'm representing, that's non-starter.

2562
03:34:34,838 --> 03:34:35,739
You can't allow that.

2563
03:34:36,951 --> 03:34:41,215
So if they get the permit and they choose to hire us, we need to get a design.

2564
03:34:42,596 --> 03:34:50,942
But no, there's no variation of this proposal that we can be okay with.

2565
03:34:53,484 --> 03:34:55,406
And there's no, that's it.

2566
03:34:56,967 --> 03:34:57,267
That's it.

2567
03:34:57,928 --> 03:35:03,913
My only comment to that is when you say it's a permit and if they get it, they'll just expand.

2568
03:35:04,485 --> 03:35:07,186
We as a council can put restrictions on that permit.

2569
03:35:07,206 --> 03:35:19,291
Sure, but if I tried to talk to you right now and I had put my phone down on a YouTube sound of dogs barking, it's only two dogs, but you and I wouldn't be able to communicate.

2570
03:35:19,971 --> 03:35:24,813
Whether it's 50 dogs or 100 dogs, once it starts, once they're there,

2571
03:35:25,841 --> 03:35:31,146
The people who live on Linden Ave, who I realize aren't necessarily here, most of them speak Spanish.

2572
03:35:31,286 --> 03:35:32,487
They may not be legal citizens.

2573
03:35:32,847 --> 03:35:34,328
They may not feel comfortable coming here.

2574
03:35:34,969 --> 03:35:35,329
I'm here.

2575
03:35:35,990 --> 03:35:36,790
I'm speaking for them.

2576
03:35:40,874 --> 03:35:41,474
It's a problem.

2577
03:35:41,514 --> 03:35:43,676
There's still people, there's still residents, there's still our neighbors.

2578
03:35:46,979 --> 03:35:47,620
The dogs aren't.

2579
03:35:48,694 --> 03:35:51,157
There are other facilities, there are facilities in Malden, there are facilities all over.

2580
03:35:51,197 --> 03:35:53,120
Do a Google search of doggie daycare.

2581
03:35:53,601 --> 03:35:54,642
The map is pretty full.

2582
03:35:55,283 --> 03:35:56,665
It doesn't have to be right here.

2583
03:35:59,368 --> 03:35:59,729
That's it.

2584
03:36:03,874 --> 03:36:04,235
Thank you.

2585
03:36:05,737 --> 03:36:06,438
Any further discussion?

2586
03:36:09,852 --> 03:36:13,114
I only have one last thought to add.

2587
03:36:13,674 --> 03:36:20,757
We can either talk tonight about some type of special variance for dogs, or we'll be at the ZBA in a couple of months talking about another 10 story building.

2588
03:36:21,457 --> 03:36:21,778
Thank you.

2589
03:36:23,658 --> 03:36:28,121
Do we have any further discussion?

2590
03:36:28,341 --> 03:36:28,901
Any more questions?

2591
03:36:31,062 --> 03:36:31,222
No.

2592
03:36:32,082 --> 03:36:37,545
You've already spoken twice on this matter, and that's the, we said at the beginning that that would be limited to two times.

2593
03:36:38,962 --> 03:36:40,663
Do we have any further discussion on this matter?

2594
03:36:42,965 --> 03:36:43,966
Motion in the debate, Mr. President.

2595
03:36:43,986 --> 03:36:45,007
We have a motion on the table.

2596
03:36:45,027 --> 03:36:47,248
I mean, between the council.

2597
03:36:47,489 --> 03:36:49,190
Yeah, we need to discuss it.

2598
03:36:50,851 --> 03:36:54,794
There's a motion on the table to approve the permit.

2599
03:36:55,875 --> 03:36:57,116
Who put that motion forward?

2600
03:36:57,156 --> 03:36:57,937
We're looking for one.

2601
03:37:00,198 --> 03:37:01,900
Do we have any further discussion amongst the council?

2602
03:37:02,240 --> 03:37:03,061
Move for approval, Mr. President.

2603
03:37:03,761 --> 03:37:05,282
Motion by Councilor Knight for approval.

2604
03:37:05,302 --> 03:37:05,743
Second.

2605
03:37:08,493 --> 03:37:11,494
Do you have any concerns, Councilwoman?

2606
03:37:11,554 --> 03:37:12,855
Any further questions?

2607
03:37:12,875 --> 03:37:34,403
I still do have a concern about the irrigation portion, and it is being explored, so whether that means we wait till we get, I mean, that's one of the, putting restrictions and an irrigation system are two things that I think need to be discussed amongst the council.

2608
03:37:40,702 --> 03:37:45,683
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

2609
03:37:45,763 --> 03:37:46,824
I'm open to discussion.

2610
03:37:47,204 --> 03:37:48,644
What's the discussion, Mr. President?

2611
03:37:49,064 --> 03:37:55,466
Council Member Kern has concerns about the irrigation system that is in place on the property there.

2612
03:37:55,606 --> 03:37:58,447
What does she propose, Mr. President?

2613
03:37:59,387 --> 03:38:00,568
Just a lot has been discussed.

2614
03:38:00,648 --> 03:38:02,208
I hear that there's potential clay.

2615
03:38:03,109 --> 03:38:05,530
We hear the rock versus the grass.

2616
03:38:05,550 --> 03:38:08,370
I'm sure there is clay, Mr. President, if I might throw the chair.

2617
03:38:08,390 --> 03:38:09,531
There's clay everywhere in that area.

2618
03:38:09,571 --> 03:38:11,071
See, there is clay everywhere.

2619
03:38:11,551 --> 03:38:15,552
My building is atop a bed of clay that wobbles and shakes.

2620
03:38:16,072 --> 03:38:19,213
But 50 dogs may not be peeing on your property.

2621
03:38:19,273 --> 03:38:20,013
They do not.

2622
03:38:20,033 --> 03:38:28,315
I have about five or six that pee there regularly, Madam Counselor, along with the rabbits and squirrels that I mentioned earlier.

2623
03:38:33,043 --> 03:38:33,904
Move the question, Mr. President.

2624
03:38:34,665 --> 03:38:36,066
Motion by Councilor Knight.

2625
03:38:37,227 --> 03:38:40,211
Second by Councilor DelaRusso.

2626
03:38:42,073 --> 03:38:47,819
As everyone knows, this is a special permit, and it does require five votes for approval.

2627
03:38:48,579 --> 03:38:50,241
Mr. Clerk, please call.

2628
03:38:50,281 --> 03:38:50,662
If I may.

2629
03:38:52,537 --> 03:38:57,600
I don't believe I'm ready to vote on it unless I get an irrigation system.

2630
03:38:57,620 --> 03:39:03,524
And we discuss reducing the hours, especially at first.

2631
03:39:05,265 --> 03:39:10,808
Like it's been said, there's 57 units abutting the property.

2632
03:39:10,828 --> 03:39:15,031
I'm awaiting a motion here.

2633
03:39:15,391 --> 03:39:16,792
Motion on the table.

2634
03:39:16,812 --> 03:39:17,492
Motion on the table.

2635
03:39:17,512 --> 03:39:18,393
It's been seconded.

2636
03:39:18,453 --> 03:39:18,913
Call the roll.

2637
03:39:19,193 --> 03:39:19,854
It's been seconded.

2638
03:39:20,154 --> 03:39:22,055
Call the roll.

2639
03:39:24,348 --> 03:39:26,651
If you have any further discussion, now is the time.

2640
03:39:26,671 --> 03:39:27,091
Mr. President.

2641
03:39:31,376 --> 03:39:32,397
Vice President Mox.

2642
03:39:33,017 --> 03:39:33,978
Thank you Mr. President.

2643
03:39:33,998 --> 03:39:42,868
I've been on the council a number of years and I've been through the building of new schools.

2644
03:39:43,662 --> 03:39:48,204
which was a contentious issue, taking neighborhood schools and making centralized schools.

2645
03:39:49,185 --> 03:39:57,289
I've been through issues relative to building a new police station, a new DPW, you know, and the list goes on and on.

2646
03:39:58,130 --> 03:40:04,513
And I can honestly tell you, this issue, in my opinion, has taken a life of its own.

2647
03:40:05,773 --> 03:40:08,535
And, you know, having the

2648
03:40:11,295 --> 03:40:12,916
foresight of prior votes.

2649
03:40:14,337 --> 03:40:31,549
I recall back, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago now, and I think Councilor Longo was on the council at the time with me, that we took a vote as a council to not approve a tattoo parlor that wanted to come into Forest Street in Method Square.

2650
03:40:32,630 --> 03:40:33,991
And people might say, what is he talking about?

2651
03:40:34,891 --> 03:40:36,252
This has some relevance.

2652
03:40:38,553 --> 03:40:41,095
At the time, we were looking at revitalizing the square.

2653
03:40:41,715 --> 03:40:50,240
And there was a lot of discussion about putting lucky tattoos on Forest Street, across from Chevalier, right next to a dialys center and so forth.

2654
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:57,764
Right across from the Method Y Boys and Girls Club.

2655
03:40:58,704 --> 03:41:02,808
And at the time, I was one member, and we voted it down, Mr. President.

2656
03:41:03,389 --> 03:41:04,770
And I don't know if you recall this or not.

2657
03:41:06,112 --> 03:41:11,397
We did not give an adequate enough reason for voting down a special permit.

2658
03:41:12,458 --> 03:41:16,542
And sure enough, the petitioner took us to court.

2659
03:41:17,463 --> 03:41:32,263
and won a financial settlement in court because we didn't provide enough information on why we were against something that was legally zoned and, you know, there was no reason why

2660
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:37,121
We didn't vote to put it there, more or less.

2661
03:41:38,081 --> 03:41:43,383
And the only reason why I bring that up, Mr. President, is, you know, I live the closest to that.

2662
03:41:43,423 --> 03:41:45,503
I live on Wellington Road, right off of Riverside Ave.

2663
03:41:45,563 --> 03:41:49,885
I come out on my street, and I can be at that location in five minutes by walk.

2664
03:41:51,925 --> 03:41:59,026
And originally, and I've always taken this course of action, is that the neighborhood comes first.

2665
03:41:59,827 --> 03:42:03,967
You know, if there's people there, residents, I want to hear from them, they come first.

2666
03:42:04,907 --> 03:42:18,690
And with that being said, I am comfortable right now with the fact that many of the issues that I think were going to be potential issues, like we had with the building of the new dog park,

2667
03:42:19,636 --> 03:42:23,498
noise, smell, you name it, seem to be addressed.

2668
03:42:23,538 --> 03:42:24,539
Are they addressed 110%?

2669
03:42:25,559 --> 03:42:26,160
Absolutely not.

2670
03:42:26,580 --> 03:42:27,920
But they seem to be addressed.

2671
03:42:28,721 --> 03:42:41,988
And as Councilor Lungo-Kern mentioned, we always like to look for compromise, and I thought that was a good compromise, maybe removing the overnight boarding, or add some other stipulations, which we can do by right, on a special permit.

2672
03:42:42,808 --> 03:42:43,829
And it is enforceable.

2673
03:42:45,310 --> 03:42:48,832
And we can call back any special permit if they don't adhere to it.

2674
03:42:49,755 --> 03:43:17,161
So based on the information that we were presented tonight, based on the fact that there is a need in the community, in my opinion, based on the fact that I believe, and I know there was some contentious stuff going back and forth, I think there's enough business, as was mentioned, in the community to not only accommodate a dog for days, but every other dog business in the community that does dog walking or so forth.

2675
03:43:19,701 --> 03:43:24,666
Based on that knowledge that I have and the fact that I believe this could work.

2676
03:43:24,706 --> 03:43:39,340
Mr. President in that area I will support that tonight and Like I said, it's it's not an easy issue At the beginning they were talking about a yappy hour and I think this council will need a yappy hour and

2677
03:43:41,556 --> 03:43:48,281
after we take a vote on this tonight, because it did come to a contentious way.

2678
03:43:48,321 --> 03:43:51,063
And I've known the Daugherties for a lot of years.

2679
03:43:51,083 --> 03:43:51,964
They're good people.

2680
03:43:51,984 --> 03:43:52,984
They're good business owners.

2681
03:43:53,325 --> 03:43:56,347
I know a lot of the people that are opposed, a lot of people in favor.

2682
03:43:56,947 --> 03:43:59,109
And in my opinion, I have to do what my heart tells me.

2683
03:43:59,789 --> 03:44:03,331
And my heart's telling me, what right do we have to keep them out?

2684
03:44:03,971 --> 03:44:05,272
I realize there's residents there.

2685
03:44:05,652 --> 03:44:06,573
It's zoned for it.

2686
03:44:07,373 --> 03:44:08,634
Is there a need in the community?

2687
03:44:09,795 --> 03:44:13,897
If this was servicing everyone from Winchester and no method people, I'd say, you know what?

2688
03:44:14,557 --> 03:44:15,878
Winchester, you don't want a CVS?

2689
03:44:15,898 --> 03:44:16,678
We'll give you a dog.

2690
03:44:18,780 --> 03:44:21,061
We'll give you, you can take a dog kennel.

2691
03:44:22,122 --> 03:44:23,823
But that's not the case, Mr. President.

2692
03:44:23,843 --> 03:44:35,710
This is going to service many, many Medford residents, and I think it can be done in a fashion that will be amendable to the abutters, which we always want to make sure the abutters are on notice.

2693
03:44:37,371 --> 03:44:41,134
So for those reasons, Mr. President, I will support this petition today.

2694
03:44:41,254 --> 03:44:41,494
Thank you.

2695
03:44:45,640 --> 03:44:46,381
Thank you, Mr. President.

2696
03:44:46,861 --> 03:44:51,644
I just, you know, this is, I do not question the presentation.

2697
03:44:51,664 --> 03:44:52,705
The presentation was great.

2698
03:44:53,746 --> 03:45:04,153
What I do question, since I've been on the council for almost two years now, a very important topic that we've been talking about probably on a weekly basis, that's zoning.

2699
03:45:05,073 --> 03:45:07,295
And people that have come up in support of this.

2700
03:45:08,475 --> 03:45:20,643
were the same people that helped us see the negative impact of negative zoning and how one project can negatively affect a neighborhood or people in those neighborhoods.

2701
03:45:20,663 --> 03:45:29,909
I made a decision then that I would make sure that I do my due diligence when it comes to my vote.

2702
03:45:31,650 --> 03:45:35,913
I visited a county and I appreciate the due diligence,

2703
03:45:39,713 --> 03:46:05,072
The smell and the noise that I heard, and that was 11.30 in the afternoon, personally that I saw, whether it's not their daycare, whether it isn't their daycare, from what I've witnessed, my opinion, and listening to the residents of Locust Street, not the Doherty's, the residents that live in there, that have repeatedly told me

2704
03:46:06,038 --> 03:46:09,300
This isn't a dog-friendly unit.

2705
03:46:09,900 --> 03:46:13,562
We don't allow dogs, we don't want dogs in here, and that's why they rent there.

2706
03:46:15,022 --> 03:46:20,205
And talking to Linden residents that have the same concerns and same issues.

2707
03:46:22,106 --> 03:46:34,832
So, way back when we decided to sue our own zoning board to protect the residents in that neighborhood, and now sitting before us, a situation that I have to put a vote on?

2708
03:46:35,975 --> 03:46:43,001
that affects residents of our community, that I don't care if it's, the boarding issue doesn't bother me.

2709
03:46:44,142 --> 03:47:01,656
During the day, that the residents that called me and talked to me, that talked about the noise of possibly 50 dogs in one area, I don't care what fencing, what proofing they have, my expertise of a dog owner, they get loud.

2710
03:47:03,722 --> 03:47:21,871
And from what my experts telling me in my field that I work with turf specialists, whatever the turf specialist says, there isn't a turf out there that will mask the odor of 50 dogs laying their scent down during a hot summer day.

2711
03:47:23,272 --> 03:47:24,532
So I did my homework.

2712
03:47:26,569 --> 03:47:32,273
It's funny because I get angry with residents who come up here and point their finger and say, shame on you, we want to move Medford forward.

2713
03:47:32,734 --> 03:47:34,675
So do we, but at what cost?

2714
03:47:36,096 --> 03:47:36,797
At what cost?

2715
03:47:38,318 --> 03:47:42,121
Because if it was my neighborhood, I'll speak open.

2716
03:47:42,681 --> 03:47:46,084
I wouldn't want it, because it'll affect my neighborhood.

2717
03:47:47,669 --> 03:47:49,832
So I will not support this.

2718
03:47:50,052 --> 03:47:57,502
And I apologize because I think it's a great plan, but for that area and for what I've seen, I just don't, I can't support it.

2719
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,060
Councilor Belco?

2720
03:48:08,460 --> 03:48:09,281
Thank you, Mr. President.

2721
03:48:09,501 --> 03:48:11,982
I want to thank everybody for coming down.

2722
03:48:12,022 --> 03:48:19,445
No matter what side you are on tonight, it's always good to see civic participation and people coming just to, you know, let us know how you feel, for or against.

2723
03:48:20,325 --> 03:48:24,787
And this is a rather, it's a very interesting issue.

2724
03:48:25,207 --> 03:48:28,268
And it's one that, you know, I feel, I felt torn about.

2725
03:48:28,288 --> 03:48:30,269
I mean, it's, I'm a dog owner.

2726
03:48:30,489 --> 03:48:31,669
I own a beagle hound.

2727
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:32,710
I love him.

2728
03:48:32,730 --> 03:48:33,590
He's part of the family.

2729
03:48:35,951 --> 03:48:38,232
My kids love him, and he's a great dog.

2730
03:48:38,732 --> 03:48:43,775
And I love the passion that you bring to this tonight.

2731
03:48:45,155 --> 03:48:50,878
Your maps, your sketches, I mean, you've obviously done your research.

2732
03:48:52,018 --> 03:48:56,180
And you can tell you're passionate about this, and that's very impressive.

2733
03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:03,223
And I come back to also saying, this is a great idea.

2734
03:49:04,289 --> 03:49:10,853
This is, it's an idea I think that, yes, Medford could use, but I'm torn on the location.

2735
03:49:11,153 --> 03:49:25,302
I really am, because I do see that, you know, although it's an industrial zone, you have apartment buildings there, you have homes, and that's the part that really, really, I struggle with, because I know,

2736
03:49:27,942 --> 03:49:33,627
For example, I know this year we've had neighborhood meetings, police meetings in each of the neighborhoods.

2737
03:49:33,667 --> 03:49:40,573
And as we've gone through neighborhood to neighborhood, people really care about their neighborhood and really care what happens in their neighborhood.

2738
03:49:41,394 --> 03:49:47,299
And I have received phone calls and emails on this as well, both for and against.

2739
03:49:50,257 --> 03:49:57,480
You know, so I really do struggle with this decision, but at the end, you know, for me it comes down to the neighborhood.

2740
03:49:57,820 --> 03:50:06,864
And it comes down to, you know, is this going to have a positive or negative impact on, you know, I don't want to say the quality of life, but it does to some point.

2741
03:50:06,884 --> 03:50:08,125
I mean, because if you're hearing

2742
03:50:08,845 --> 03:50:09,586
barking all the time.

2743
03:50:09,626 --> 03:50:11,907
I know my dog, I mean, he's part hound.

2744
03:50:12,067 --> 03:50:20,493
When he starts going, he's barking and it can definitely be disruptive.

2745
03:50:20,553 --> 03:50:23,916
When I hear 50 dogs, at the end of the day, 50 dogs is 50 dogs.

2746
03:50:24,776 --> 03:50:30,740
And if they're kind of all going at the same time, that's going to be loud, inside or outside.

2747
03:50:34,601 --> 03:50:44,202
You know, I love that you're passionate about this, but I think it's a great idea, I just think it's a bad location, and that's what it comes down to me.

2748
03:50:45,315 --> 03:50:47,656
And I do love the idea.

2749
03:50:48,216 --> 03:50:56,060
I wish it was a place where there was just no apartment buildings and there were no homes that were near this.

2750
03:50:57,181 --> 03:50:58,361
Because I do think it's a great idea.

2751
03:50:58,681 --> 03:51:00,302
And I think it's something that the city could use.

2752
03:51:00,983 --> 03:51:03,304
And I honestly do struggle with this.

2753
03:51:03,344 --> 03:51:04,684
I know I've talked to you both about this.

2754
03:51:07,549 --> 03:51:20,893
But at the end of the day, to me it's the neighborhoods and to have this, even though it's an industrial neighborhood, in many ways, because there are apartment buildings there and there are homes there, in many ways it's kind of like a residential neighborhood.

2755
03:51:21,613 --> 03:51:26,455
And getting back to the other argument of zoning, zoning needs to be looked at.

2756
03:51:26,495 --> 03:51:27,755
We've talked about this many times.

2757
03:51:28,235 --> 03:51:32,237
Zoning has not been looked at in this city in 50 years and it needs to be addressed.

2758
03:51:33,197 --> 03:51:35,738
So I cannot support this.

2759
03:51:37,819 --> 03:51:38,520
Thank you.

2760
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:44,130
And I'll give my last two cents here, but I've been a dog owner almost my whole life.

2761
03:51:44,251 --> 03:51:45,934
I still have a dog.

2762
03:51:49,752 --> 03:51:53,653
I share the same concerns with Councilor Falco, that this is a neighborhood thing.

2763
03:51:53,873 --> 03:51:57,554
If this was one street over, I don't think I'd ever, I wouldn't have a problem with it.

2764
03:51:57,894 --> 03:52:07,196
I know exactly where the Common Dog is, and I know, again, that's a, there are no houses over there, and for those of you who don't know, many of you know Larry White.

2765
03:52:08,016 --> 03:52:11,717
It's about 100 yards from Larry White's building off the parkway in Everett.

2766
03:52:11,917 --> 03:52:12,797
I know exactly where it is.

2767
03:52:13,457 --> 03:52:14,797
Again, if this was on Hall Street,

2768
03:52:17,698 --> 03:52:21,259
where there are no homes or commercial street without no homes, I wouldn't have a problem with either.

2769
03:52:21,279 --> 03:52:30,360
But where there are homes in the front and the back of you, I do have a problem with that because the neighbors are what count in the city.

2770
03:52:31,701 --> 03:52:31,801
No.

2771
03:52:33,781 --> 03:52:35,101
Move the question.

2772
03:52:36,241 --> 03:52:39,602
I'm on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2773
03:52:40,762 --> 03:52:43,002
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2774
03:52:43,243 --> 03:52:43,883
What's the motion?

2775
03:52:45,363 --> 03:52:45,823
For the permit.

2776
03:52:49,590 --> 03:52:52,092
Okay, I thought there was a motion for approval.

2777
03:52:53,113 --> 03:52:53,713
Councilor, it is.

2778
03:52:53,933 --> 03:52:54,994
Councilor Night made a motion for approval.

2779
03:52:55,014 --> 03:52:55,474
For approval.

2780
03:52:55,654 --> 03:52:55,835
Yes.

2781
03:52:56,055 --> 03:52:56,295
Okay.

2782
03:52:57,676 --> 03:52:58,557
Councilor DelaRusso?

2783
03:52:58,757 --> 03:52:58,997
Yes.

2784
03:52:59,617 --> 03:53:00,338
Councilor Falco?

2785
03:53:00,458 --> 03:53:00,618
No.

2786
03:53:01,259 --> 03:53:01,799
Councilor Night?

2787
03:53:01,859 --> 03:53:02,059
No.

2788
03:53:03,080 --> 03:53:03,880
Councilor Long-Term?

2789
03:53:04,021 --> 03:53:04,201
No.

2790
03:53:05,402 --> 03:53:06,122
Vice President Marks?

2791
03:53:06,182 --> 03:53:06,462
Yes.

2792
03:53:07,023 --> 03:53:07,803
Councilor Scott Pelli?

2793
03:53:08,103 --> 03:53:08,284
No.

2794
03:53:09,304 --> 03:53:10,005
President Caviello?

2795
03:53:10,105 --> 03:53:10,285
No.

2796
03:53:11,606 --> 03:53:18,231
Two in the affirmative, five in the negative, motion fails.

2797
03:53:22,085 --> 03:53:22,405
I have reasons.

2798
03:53:22,425 --> 03:53:22,986
Do you want them now?

2799
03:53:23,926 --> 03:53:25,788
Motion for a brief recess, Mr. President.

2800
03:53:25,988 --> 03:53:28,189
Motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo for a five-minute recess.

2801
03:53:28,230 --> 03:53:29,450
I have my reasons whenever you want them.

2802
03:53:49,285 --> 03:53:52,627
Motion to revert back to regular business.

2803
03:53:54,128 --> 03:53:55,469
All right, what do we got left here?

2804
03:53:55,489 --> 03:54:01,893
We got that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.

2805
03:54:06,747 --> 03:54:17,071
17568, offered by Counselor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council to send the deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Honorable Judge Lee Johnson on his recent passage.

2806
03:54:17,091 --> 03:54:28,736
Judge Johnson was appointed to the District Court in September 2001 by then acting Governor Jane Swift and was appointed first justice in the Malden District Court where he served with distinction until he retired in 2016.

2807
03:54:28,776 --> 03:54:32,377
He was the first African American to serve in that position at the court.

2808
03:54:32,677 --> 03:54:34,358
His tenure as first justice was the longest

2809
03:54:34,958 --> 03:54:36,979
duration in the history of the Marlins District Court.

2810
03:54:37,019 --> 03:54:47,206
For over 10 years, Judge Johnson was instrumental in the successful probation of the drug court session that empowered many defendants to leave productive drug-free lives.

2811
03:54:47,266 --> 03:54:47,967
Counselor Knight.

2812
03:54:48,527 --> 03:54:52,009
Mr. President, I think that the resolution sums itself up.

2813
03:54:52,109 --> 03:54:53,750
Judge Lee Johnson passed away recently.

2814
03:54:53,770 --> 03:54:57,993
He was a great, great public servant, a great person, and a great individual, Mr. President.

2815
03:54:58,013 --> 03:54:59,374
He went above and beyond the call of duty.

2816
03:54:59,958 --> 03:55:01,460
to provide for his constituencies.

2817
03:55:01,801 --> 03:55:12,013
As the first justice of the Malden District Court, he did an excellent thing in implementing drug court, Mr. President, and instead of putting individuals in the system, he got them assistance and treatment.

2818
03:55:12,511 --> 03:55:17,175
And I think that's a compassionate and humane way of going about things, and it's become the norm, Mr. President.

2819
03:55:17,195 --> 03:55:23,800
So I'd like to extend our deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Lee Johnson, a longtime Medford resident, on his recent passing.

2820
03:55:24,280 --> 03:55:24,641
Thank you.

2821
03:55:24,701 --> 03:55:36,410
And before we do that, we have one other one offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Alfie on her recent passing.

2822
03:55:36,470 --> 03:55:37,010
Councilor Knight.

2823
03:55:37,891 --> 03:55:39,131
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2824
03:55:39,191 --> 03:55:50,914
It's ironic that we're here this evening having our meeting in Medford High School because this is where I first met Rosemary Alfie when she was Mr. Maskell's administrative assistant, as Mr. Maskell was the submaster and Ms.

2825
03:55:50,994 --> 03:55:52,715
Alfie worked there on the second floor of the B building.

2826
03:55:53,215 --> 03:56:01,477
She recently passed away unexpectedly at age 85, and I just want to say that she was someone that made my days in high school a little bit brighter every day that I came to school and I got to see her face.

2827
03:56:02,043 --> 03:56:05,985
She was certainly someone that made my day a little bit easier and made things go a lot smoother for me in high school.

2828
03:56:06,005 --> 03:56:07,827
So I'm very, very grateful to have her as a friend.

2829
03:56:07,867 --> 03:56:09,308
And I'm very, very sad that she is gone.

2830
03:56:09,348 --> 03:56:10,268
And she will be sadly missed.

2831
03:56:10,308 --> 03:56:11,709
I ask my council colleagues to join me.

2832
03:56:11,809 --> 03:56:13,330
Please rise for a moment of silence.

2833
03:56:21,995 --> 03:56:22,236
Thank you.

2834
03:56:22,436 --> 03:56:30,781
I must suspend the rules, take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.

2835
03:56:32,652 --> 03:56:36,254
Motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

2836
03:56:36,294 --> 03:56:36,934
All those in favor?

2837
03:56:37,254 --> 03:56:37,334
Aye.

2838
03:56:37,934 --> 03:56:38,615
Motion passes.

2839
03:56:39,675 --> 03:56:40,155
Okay.

2840
03:56:41,916 --> 03:56:45,298
We have communications from the Mayor.

2841
03:56:49,380 --> 03:56:50,460
I'm sorry, you want to take the end?

2842
03:56:50,700 --> 03:56:51,641
No, communicate, that's what I meant.

2843
03:56:51,701 --> 03:56:52,161
I'm sorry.

2844
03:56:52,730 --> 03:56:56,811
Communications from the mayor.

2845
03:56:56,831 --> 03:57:04,313
17577, dear Mr. President, city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home rule petition.

2846
03:57:04,333 --> 03:57:08,814
Oh no, I'm sorry, we already did that, I apologize.

2847
03:57:10,294 --> 03:57:12,595
We skipped around so many, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

2848
03:57:12,615 --> 03:57:13,475
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2849
03:57:13,515 --> 03:57:15,155
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2850
03:57:15,175 --> 03:57:16,896
Let me see, hold on.

2851
03:57:17,096 --> 03:57:16,896
17582?

2852
03:57:17,116 --> 03:57:16,896
581.

2853
03:57:17,176 --> 03:57:16,896
581. 17581.

2854
03:57:25,033 --> 03:57:31,996
Mr. President and City Council, I respectfully request— Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a brief synopsis done by the financial director.

2855
03:57:32,436 --> 03:57:35,037
Motion by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor De La Ruza.

2856
03:57:35,057 --> 03:57:35,958
All those in favor, aye.

2857
03:57:36,318 --> 03:57:36,418
Aye.

2858
03:57:37,378 --> 03:57:38,039
Motion passes.

2859
03:57:38,759 --> 03:57:40,320
Brief synopsis by the City Treasurer.

2860
03:57:45,403 --> 03:57:45,963
Thank you.

2861
03:57:47,464 --> 03:57:52,586
This is a very straightforward $2,075,000 loan through the MWRA.

2862
03:57:53,366 --> 03:58:07,372
It's a 10-year loan at 0% interest, and it's for an engineering project, and our city engineer, Cassandra Kunalitis, is here with me tonight, and she'll be able to answer all the specifics with regard to the project itself.

2863
03:58:08,066 --> 03:58:08,386
Thank you.

2864
03:58:09,447 --> 03:58:10,328
Finance question, Mr. President?

2865
03:58:11,189 --> 03:58:11,649
Councillor Knight.

2866
03:58:12,730 --> 03:58:12,870
Ms.

2867
03:58:12,890 --> 03:58:22,038
Zerwan, can you explain what impact this is going to have, if appropriated this evening, on the schedule of bonded indebtedness and the plans to hopefully construct a new police station and fire station?

2868
03:58:22,679 --> 03:58:24,260
There's no impact on that whatsoever.

2869
03:58:24,280 --> 03:58:31,327
This is a 0% loan, and the loan payments will be paid through retained earnings.

2870
03:58:34,822 --> 03:58:37,504
So zero impact on our ability to bond in the future.

2871
03:58:37,524 --> 03:58:39,145
We're still on the same track as we were.

2872
03:58:39,746 --> 03:58:43,649
And what was that last part I missed, I'm sorry?

2873
03:58:44,189 --> 03:58:46,491
The loan payments will be paid through retained earnings.

2874
03:58:46,511 --> 03:58:47,591
Retained earnings, okay, excellent.

2875
03:58:48,252 --> 03:58:49,153
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

2876
03:58:49,173 --> 03:58:50,433
Thank you.

2877
03:58:50,454 --> 03:58:51,674
Any further questions for the treasurer?

2878
03:58:54,076 --> 03:58:57,319
If we could have the city engineer speak on this.

2879
03:59:05,050 --> 03:59:06,491
Good evening, or should I say good morning?

2880
03:59:09,934 --> 03:59:16,058
So the last time I was here for a loan through the MWRA was 2013.

2881
03:59:16,098 --> 03:59:21,923
And we come back again because there are a number of infrastructure projects for water.

2882
03:59:22,586 --> 03:59:43,124
that need to be done, some in advance of roadway work, such as Grove Street and Evans Street, and others that are necessary for reasons of large leak history, you know, tuberculation, reduced volume, reduced pressure for firefighting, and seeking improved water quality.

2883
03:59:43,744 --> 03:59:50,170
The handout that you have tonight represents a summary of work that was issued for a contract for bids

2884
03:59:50,865 --> 04:00:01,137
a three-year contract that is about to be awarded to a company called Joseph P. Cardello and Son, should you approve the application that's before you.

2885
04:00:02,338 --> 04:00:07,404
There is also some money left over in the MWRA account that will be applied to some projects that we have.

2886
04:00:08,282 --> 04:00:10,123
in anticipation.

2887
04:00:10,363 --> 04:00:22,129
Like I said before, Evans Street and Grove Street, there's a project on Mystic Valley Parkway to clean and line a pipe that is needed to provide improved flow to the local street area and to Wellington.

2888
04:00:24,770 --> 04:00:26,411
So that's the piece of it.

2889
04:00:26,591 --> 04:00:32,014
In the loan application, there is also a funding request for a hydraulic model citywide.

2890
04:00:32,637 --> 04:00:34,579
It's time that the city did something like that.

2891
04:00:34,639 --> 04:00:35,640
It's been several years.

2892
04:00:35,820 --> 04:00:40,204
In fact, as long as I've worked here, there has been no citywide hydraulic model.

2893
04:00:40,244 --> 04:00:46,110
There's just been site-specific hydraulic models done, and the authority very much recommends that you undertake one.

2894
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:47,911
We're also requesting $200,000

2895
04:00:50,106 --> 04:00:53,290
for the change out of privately owned led services.

2896
04:00:53,990 --> 04:00:56,874
This would be something that we're going to view as a pilot program.

2897
04:00:57,414 --> 04:01:06,705
We're anticipating issuing a extra work order with the contractor and we're going to look at lines that are led

2898
04:01:07,325 --> 04:01:16,467
Line lead services on the public side and try to change out the private side as well the logistics for the Payment from the customer.

2899
04:01:16,987 --> 04:01:24,609
I believe it's a reimbursement or a pass-through that would be worked out with the city administration There's going to be a mechanism for doing that.

2900
04:01:25,049 --> 04:01:26,650
But right now we start with 200,000.

2901
04:01:27,110 --> 04:01:30,370
I know you're familiar that there's a loan program That's a hundred million dollars.

2902
04:01:31,051 --> 04:01:36,732
The authority has said that that is a safe and potentially endless supply of money should we need in the future

2903
04:01:37,252 --> 04:01:47,796
And we are, in the meantime, doing an inventory of private side lead lines to the best of our ability, and we'll be conducting some surveys in the future to see if those people still have lead services.

2904
04:01:49,057 --> 04:01:50,518
And I'm happy to answer questions.

2905
04:01:51,378 --> 04:01:52,118
Councillor Scott Belli.

2906
04:01:52,178 --> 04:01:58,361
If I can, just again, I hate to keep hopping on it, but Evans Street and Parra Street, is that on?

2907
04:01:58,681 --> 04:01:59,821
Yes, that's in here.

2908
04:02:01,702 --> 04:02:06,205
Evans is probably the first street they'll undertake, Evans and Grove.

2909
04:02:06,265 --> 04:02:15,212
Now, Parris Street, we have to bundle that as part of a Chapter 90 project, so it's not just the water, but it's also the construction of the road.

2910
04:02:15,732 --> 04:02:18,714
But getting the water done, getting the water funding is the first step.

2911
04:02:19,014 --> 04:02:20,695
So how long before that project?

2912
04:02:20,735 --> 04:02:23,758
Because I've been telling the people that it's any date, and this is...

2913
04:02:25,361 --> 04:02:27,922
I have a bid opening tomorrow.

2914
04:02:28,502 --> 04:02:34,504
We have a bid opening tomorrow for complete streets So what we're doing with complete streets is potentially funding.

2915
04:02:34,584 --> 04:02:34,604
I

2916
04:02:47,392 --> 04:02:54,633
It was a $400,000 grant, as you all are familiar with, but the scope has changed and gotten better, so the actual budget is higher.

2917
04:02:55,233 --> 04:03:02,955
The idea is that we're gonna supplement that money with Chapter 90 money, which will tell us how much we have left over to fund Paris and Pinkham Streets.

2918
04:03:03,575 --> 04:03:06,576
So it could be a fall bid, or it could be a spring bid.

2919
04:03:06,656 --> 04:03:07,136
I don't know.

2920
04:03:07,156 --> 04:03:11,837
I don't know.

2921
04:03:11,857 --> 04:03:12,997
My irritation is bad.

2922
04:03:14,549 --> 04:03:16,632
This was supposed to be done years ago.

2923
04:03:17,413 --> 04:03:18,835
The water lines were changed out.

2924
04:03:19,296 --> 04:03:20,858
They were supposed to come in the next spring.

2925
04:03:21,619 --> 04:03:23,161
Residents, I talked to every day.

2926
04:03:24,298 --> 04:03:29,624
And then it was said that we're gonna do it recently, then it was gonna be done by the spring.

2927
04:03:30,425 --> 04:03:32,387
And I was saying probably not the fall.

2928
04:03:33,268 --> 04:03:37,152
So I just have to know, if you can just get back to me, just let me know.

2929
04:03:37,172 --> 04:03:45,801
If it's not till next year, somebody just tell me that I can tell these residents that it's not next year because this is what makes us look bad as a community.

2930
04:03:46,582 --> 04:03:53,809
When we sit there and we're told what we're supposed to be doing and it comes back and we get, you know, again, it's not ready yet.

2931
04:03:54,490 --> 04:03:56,292
So, thank you.

2932
04:03:56,352 --> 04:04:00,716
Well, just to clarify, the gas needs were done, not the water lines.

2933
04:04:00,736 --> 04:04:03,399
Okay, but the street was supposed to be done two years ago.

2934
04:04:03,959 --> 04:04:04,740
That's what they told me.

2935
04:04:04,800 --> 04:04:06,562
So, I think they told us.

2936
04:04:07,122 --> 04:04:07,683
Maybe I'm wrong.

2937
04:04:10,325 --> 04:04:12,026
Councilor Knight.

2938
04:04:12,046 --> 04:04:15,970
So I know Councilor Schapiro just asked about Evans and Paris, and I'm just a little confused.

2939
04:04:15,990 --> 04:04:17,651
So where are we exactly on Evans again?

2940
04:04:18,932 --> 04:04:29,640
This loan application and the contract we issued, and also we did have a waterworks contract that went out last year, and the contractor walked away.

2941
04:04:30,321 --> 04:04:32,543
So last year we were supposed to get Evans Street done.

2942
04:04:33,713 --> 04:04:39,980
but because there was a lag of more than 90 days in awarding the contract, the contractor did not have to take the project.

2943
04:04:40,100 --> 04:04:40,941
When did the contract ago?

2944
04:04:42,131 --> 04:04:43,192
Where did the contractor go?

2945
04:04:43,492 --> 04:04:46,134
He went in late fall, actually.

2946
04:04:46,174 --> 04:04:47,535
He declined to take the project.

2947
04:04:47,555 --> 04:04:54,100
He agreed to take it, he said he would do it, and then we couldn't reach him to schedule anything or to have him sign any of the contract language.

2948
04:04:54,541 --> 04:04:57,543
We wrote to him, we gave him a drop-dead date to respond to us.

2949
04:04:57,563 --> 04:05:01,226
When he did not respond, we knew that we had to put the project out to bid again.

2950
04:05:01,326 --> 04:05:03,368
So this project was rebid from last year's.

2951
04:05:04,168 --> 04:05:07,251
And because of staffing changes, there was a lag period in which

2952
04:05:07,750 --> 04:05:09,452
he had the ability to walk away from it.

2953
04:05:09,692 --> 04:05:11,454
Was any of that information shared with us?

2954
04:05:11,874 --> 04:05:12,615
I believe so.

2955
04:05:12,675 --> 04:05:14,116
I don't recall seeing it.

2956
04:05:15,438 --> 04:05:18,261
You know, I echo Councillor Scott Pelly's sentiment on Evans Street.

2957
04:05:18,281 --> 04:05:18,981
This needs to get done.

2958
04:05:19,001 --> 04:05:21,404
It's been something we've been beating our chests about now since November.

2959
04:05:22,505 --> 04:05:23,726
You know, it's almost been a year.

2960
04:05:23,786 --> 04:05:24,727
Even longer.

2961
04:05:24,847 --> 04:05:25,288
Even longer.

2962
04:05:26,308 --> 04:05:29,230
So with that being said, I'd like to see that get done as soon as possible.

2963
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:35,713
And I'd like to ask that we get quarterly reports on the status of the Evans Street paving project, Mr. President.

2964
04:05:36,073 --> 04:05:36,353
Thank you.

2965
04:05:36,793 --> 04:05:37,454
Councilor DelaRusso.

2966
04:05:37,474 --> 04:05:42,596
Mr. President, seeing that it's past my bedtime, I'd like to move approval.

2967
04:05:43,476 --> 04:05:45,137
Through the chair, I have questions.

2968
04:05:45,157 --> 04:05:46,898
Councilor Lococo.

2969
04:05:46,938 --> 04:05:49,439
My first question is with regard to the funding.

2970
04:05:49,959 --> 04:05:50,200
Sorry.

2971
04:05:51,515 --> 04:05:54,297
I'm getting it all together myself.

2972
04:05:54,317 --> 04:05:58,959
$2,075,000, is that what we requested specifically or did we request more and not get it?

2973
04:05:59,559 --> 04:06:01,220
No, that's what we're requesting specifically.

2974
04:06:01,861 --> 04:06:11,546
And so, how does the MWRA evaluate the amount you requested or was given?

2975
04:06:11,566 --> 04:06:19,971
Because I appreciate the outline of a few streets that are going to get done and certain projects that are going to get done.

2976
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:27,666
do we have, is there anything at City Hall that outlines exactly which streets are gonna be done and how much, you know, the proposal is?

2977
04:06:28,967 --> 04:06:29,207
Yes.

2978
04:06:29,367 --> 04:06:30,028
So we, okay.

2979
04:06:30,608 --> 04:06:32,850
Maybe if we, could we get a copy of that?

2980
04:06:35,092 --> 04:06:35,813
Would this be it?

2981
04:06:36,093 --> 04:06:47,023
Well, and, well, this isn't by number, I mean, because what I'm concerned with is replacement of residential lead water services with copper tubing, but one, two, and three don't,

2982
04:06:47,980 --> 04:07:04,783
all under 1A don't list streets, so it's really, it's very good that this work's gonna get done, but as one counselor, I would like to know where that's, how much is gonna be put towards 1, 2, and 3, and where the work is gonna be done.

2983
04:07:07,025 --> 04:07:10,507
Under year one, it explains each street that would be worked on.

2984
04:07:10,587 --> 04:07:13,649
Under year two, it explains each street that's programmed for year two.

2985
04:07:14,310 --> 04:07:19,033
Under year three, and then Paris and Pinkert's a different package because that's designed already.

2986
04:07:19,594 --> 04:07:21,155
That's already on the shelf ready to go.

2987
04:07:21,195 --> 04:07:22,976
That's not part of this Water Works contract.

2988
04:07:26,879 --> 04:07:28,960
So what we have is $929,000 left over from the previous borrowing.

2989
04:07:32,292 --> 04:07:34,834
We're going to spend that money, we're going to reallocate that money.

2990
04:07:34,854 --> 04:07:37,257
I've already talked to MWRA, they've already agreed to it.

2991
04:07:37,697 --> 04:07:41,641
We're reallocating it to use toward these projects that are going up first.

2992
04:07:42,442 --> 04:07:47,807
We're supplementing that $920,000 to move Grove Street up because Grove Street needs to be built.

2993
04:07:48,411 --> 04:07:51,353
You know, we had the gas main done, and we were anticipating doing the water main.

2994
04:07:51,834 --> 04:07:54,976
However, the contract fell apart, so we're rebidding it again this year.

2995
04:07:55,557 --> 04:08:03,083
We're adding the hydraulic model, we're adding the lead service lines, and like I said, we're adding Paris and Pinkert because that project is designed.

2996
04:08:03,103 --> 04:08:11,029
Okay, so the main, the beginning of the correspondence then is further explained.

2997
04:08:11,769 --> 04:08:12,890
Through each year?

2998
04:08:13,110 --> 04:08:13,330
Yes.

2999
04:08:13,410 --> 04:08:14,490
That makes more sense.

3000
04:08:14,590 --> 04:08:18,172
And then we can add other projects as we need to because this is not limited.

3001
04:08:18,212 --> 04:08:28,237
This is a everything but the kitchen sink type contract that we're putting in there if we need any spot repair work, the sewer, the catch basin or anything, we can have it done.

3002
04:08:29,198 --> 04:08:31,819
It's a good mechanism, it's a reliable contractor.

3003
04:08:32,479 --> 04:08:41,104
We are, you know, we've checked his references, he's putting all his bonds together so as soon as we have the funding for the full three years,

3004
04:08:41,784 --> 04:08:42,545
We're good to go.

3005
04:08:45,348 --> 04:08:45,929
Who's the contractor?

3006
04:08:46,569 --> 04:08:48,992
Joseph P. Cardillo and Sons.

3007
04:08:49,032 --> 04:08:51,234
He's the lowest eligible builder.

3008
04:08:51,254 --> 04:08:52,976
I have two questions.

3009
04:08:53,757 --> 04:08:54,758
What is the hydraulic project?

3010
04:08:55,873 --> 04:08:56,814
Hydraulic pressure?

3011
04:08:56,834 --> 04:08:56,894
Yes.

3012
04:08:57,814 --> 04:08:59,676
I'm sorry, you mean the hydraulic model?

3013
04:08:59,796 --> 04:09:00,056
Yes.

3014
04:09:00,596 --> 04:09:09,282
What that does is it looks at the entire city, so it takes a snapshot of where the pressure and volume problems are.

3015
04:09:09,302 --> 04:09:11,663
We're also doing something called unidirectional flushing.

3016
04:09:11,683 --> 04:09:14,265
This is a DPW effort, it's not really an engineering effort.

3017
04:09:14,385 --> 04:09:23,511
I'm here representing the Department of Public Works, putting out the contract and the design on their behalf, on the water and sewer superintendents' behalf.

3018
04:09:23,531 --> 04:09:24,772
You run a hydraulic model,

3019
04:09:25,292 --> 04:09:26,954
to find out where your weak spots are.

3020
04:09:27,394 --> 04:09:34,039
We did one in West Medford some years back and found out that we really needed to improve the water mains so we could have better flows and pressure.

3021
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:36,842
We still have a couple of projects to do there, one of them being pitcher.

3022
04:09:37,883 --> 04:09:44,188
You know, we're raising the gallons per minute from inadequate to 1,000, 1,300, 1,500 gallons per minute.

3023
04:09:44,208 --> 04:09:45,109
Thank you.

3024
04:09:46,610 --> 04:09:47,271
One other question.

3025
04:09:47,631 --> 04:09:48,311
Cutting and patching.

3026
04:09:49,463 --> 04:09:53,168
Are any of these streets going to be paved in full that are being done here?

3027
04:09:53,428 --> 04:09:55,271
Well, Evans is going to be pulverized.

3028
04:09:55,351 --> 04:10:04,503
The reason why we could not pave Evans Street before because the macadam was so big and you have to do the water mains are neck down to be about this small in diameter.

3029
04:10:05,020 --> 04:10:08,742
So if we just paved it, we'd be digging it up promptly to repair leaks.

3030
04:10:08,782 --> 04:10:10,303
So we're going to crush Evans.

3031
04:10:11,084 --> 04:10:14,606
We are repaving Grove.

3032
04:10:14,626 --> 04:10:15,987
For repavement?

3033
04:10:16,347 --> 04:10:19,910
Not crushing, but I believe it's going to be repaved.

3034
04:10:20,690 --> 04:10:21,491
milled and paved.

3035
04:10:21,711 --> 04:10:22,312
Milled and paved.

3036
04:10:22,332 --> 04:10:23,433
Yeah, and some other streets.

3037
04:10:23,633 --> 04:10:26,655
Streets like Vista, probably not paving in full.

3038
04:10:26,935 --> 04:10:30,818
There's a mix of different types of treatments for the road surface once we're done.

3039
04:10:31,459 --> 04:10:36,663
Parris Street, Pinker Street, full reconstruction, sidewalks, trees, drainage.

3040
04:10:39,305 --> 04:10:39,805
Mr. President.

3041
04:10:40,546 --> 04:10:41,166
Counselor Falco.

3042
04:10:41,246 --> 04:10:42,026
Thank you, Mr. President.

3043
04:10:42,046 --> 04:10:49,030
If I may, with regard to the hydraulic model, so how long does that take and do the results come back to you?

3044
04:10:49,610 --> 04:10:51,031
The results come back to us, yes.

3045
04:10:51,651 --> 04:11:00,115
We're using some of the information that we're getting from the unidirectional flushing that's starting slowly but moving on.

3046
04:11:01,593 --> 04:11:04,978
where the weak spots are in the city or areas that we do need to do work.

3047
04:11:05,459 --> 04:11:09,785
So it's a month's, it's not a year's long effort, it's a month's effort.

3048
04:11:10,286 --> 04:11:12,509
We have some good data, but we have to supplement that.

3049
04:11:13,567 --> 04:11:14,788
So when would that begin?

3050
04:11:15,609 --> 04:11:25,538
As far as the hydraulic model, when could we expect some sort of report back that says these are the pain points, these neighborhoods or these streets.

3051
04:11:26,499 --> 04:11:36,249
You go up into the heights and you hear complaints all the time with regard to pressure and people not being able to take a shower or flush the toilet without losing water somewhere.

3052
04:11:38,170 --> 04:11:49,405
It would be nice to see some sort of a report that we could get that, you know, we could just be able to identify and then, you know, I would assume when you get that report back, you come up with some sort of a plan moving forward, right?

3053
04:11:50,175 --> 04:11:50,496
Correct.

3054
04:11:50,536 --> 04:12:06,370
In fact, when I read the last time I did a three-year, I put together this three-year contract before we started adding streets and taking some streets out, the plan was to do Fulton Street, you know, to upgrade that line, because once you improve that line, then you're improving service to the heights.

3055
04:12:06,791 --> 04:12:11,875
We already know, I mean, anecdotally and empirically, we know some areas that are called the spots already.

3056
04:12:13,617 --> 04:12:14,697
a citywide sweep.

3057
04:12:15,337 --> 04:12:23,879
And when you're asking do we have any information now, we have some results from the unidirectional flushing that took place in the Heights that we can share.

3058
04:12:23,899 --> 04:12:36,981
Depending on when we hire somebody and we can go out for engineering services, you know, as soon as we want to, we could have results in by, I'd say, late fall and perhaps spring.

3059
04:12:37,161 --> 04:12:41,202
You know, I'd have to talk to the consultant and see what their schedule is and what they recommend.

3060
04:12:42,441 --> 04:12:42,661
Thank you.

3061
04:12:43,722 --> 04:12:44,042
Thank you.

3062
04:12:44,182 --> 04:12:44,682
Mr. President?

3063
04:12:45,462 --> 04:12:46,443
Vice President Mox.

3064
04:12:46,543 --> 04:12:47,363
Thank you, Mr. President.

3065
04:12:47,383 --> 04:12:48,063
And I'll be quick.

3066
04:12:49,024 --> 04:12:52,845
The privately owned lead services, this is not the first time we've offered this.

3067
04:12:53,666 --> 04:12:55,486
And I believe the last amount was roughly $200,000.

3068
04:12:55,707 --> 04:13:00,188
Can you explain a little more on how it works?

3069
04:13:01,089 --> 04:13:06,391
If I know I have a lead line that's coming into my home, what am I eligible for?

3070
04:13:06,411 --> 04:13:10,473
Is this some type of 0 percent finance loan that I'm getting through this?

3071
04:13:11,213 --> 04:13:20,376
Right in the past, people had to hire a contractor on their own, so the only part we took care of was the publicly owned piece, from the sidewalk to the main.

3072
04:13:21,216 --> 04:13:25,377
But now we're saying to people, we would offer you a pass through.

3073
04:13:25,417 --> 04:13:39,402
We're not sure of the exact mechanics just yet, but there are a few individuals that I've spoken to, and I'm sure there will be more that will come out, who would like to see some type of a program that allows them to pay over time, whether it's an attachment to their water bill, or it's broken into sections.

3074
04:13:40,302 --> 04:13:44,626
We're flexible and neutral, I think, at this point on how it's all going to work.

3075
04:13:45,327 --> 04:13:50,231
And then once we do know that, then we can roll that out to a larger audience and see how it works.

3076
04:13:50,652 --> 04:14:02,943
It's the kind of project that takes more time and effort because you really have to pay attention to any disruption to somebody's property, make sure it's restored properly, make sure that you coordinate with people individually.

3077
04:14:04,802 --> 04:14:15,390
I don't recall the numbers, but last I remember there were hundreds, if not maybe even thousands of lead lines still in the city, privately owned lead lines.

3078
04:14:16,370 --> 04:14:24,697
And from what I recall, it's roughly five to six grand, and I'm not sure if that's on the city side as well as the individual homeowner.

3079
04:14:25,397 --> 04:14:30,700
So, when we're talking 200,000, we're not talking many homes that can take advantage of this.

3080
04:14:30,920 --> 04:14:31,460
You're correct.

3081
04:14:31,801 --> 04:14:41,046
And, you know, what Fred Lasky told us a couple years back is that the MWRA provides lead-free water 30 miles to our home.

3082
04:14:41,826 --> 04:14:51,595
And then the leaching point is the 10 feet from the street into my home where possible lead that sits in the pipe for a period of time can leach.

3083
04:14:52,615 --> 04:15:03,425
And I find that shocking that it travels 30 miles with no lead contaminants, but it'll possibly pick up lead 10 feet from my house into my house.

3084
04:15:03,805 --> 04:15:05,967
Or in your house, because of the solder.

3085
04:15:06,107 --> 04:15:07,007
Or in the house, correct.

3086
04:15:07,027 --> 04:15:07,348
And the fixtures.

3087
04:15:07,768 --> 04:15:08,108
Correct.

3088
04:15:09,169 --> 04:15:11,811
So I support that wholeheartedly.

3089
04:15:12,231 --> 04:15:14,212
I'd like to see some figures.

3090
04:15:15,053 --> 04:15:18,955
I don't know if it was you or Dawn Ouellette that provided the last set of figures.

3091
04:15:19,016 --> 04:15:19,976
It was a while back.

3092
04:15:20,497 --> 04:15:22,758
But how many lead service lines there are in the community.

3093
04:15:23,659 --> 04:15:27,061
I think that'd be pretty interesting to find out.

3094
04:15:27,561 --> 04:15:30,263
And maybe if, how are you gonna get this out to the public?

3095
04:15:30,303 --> 04:15:32,585
How are they gonna be aware that this is out?

3096
04:15:33,347 --> 04:15:37,751
Well, right now, because as you mentioned, it's not a large amount of money.

3097
04:15:38,732 --> 04:15:43,176
We have individuals who have called in about the program.

3098
04:15:43,436 --> 04:15:46,939
The MWRA launched it last July, so it's about a year old.

3099
04:15:47,599 --> 04:15:58,569
And it has had some problem getting off the grounds with other cities and towns, so we're going to use the information that they've garnered to help us design something that's more

3100
04:16:00,222 --> 04:16:01,242
you know, more foolproof.

3101
04:16:02,042 --> 04:16:20,027
But if you said, for example, we have an estimate of potentially 600 services, then we would reach out to people that we think may still have a lead mind, you know, and then ask them if they wanted to be part of this program, and then start taking it on one service at a time.

3102
04:16:20,047 --> 04:16:24,088
You know, almost for the 200,000 on a first come, first serve basis.

3103
04:16:24,628 --> 04:16:28,171
Not everybody has wanted to do the work.

3104
04:16:28,291 --> 04:16:35,757
Every time we do a project and we change out the public side, every single homeowner is approached and asked if they want to change out their service.

3105
04:16:36,097 --> 04:16:37,078
Some of them refuse.

3106
04:16:37,838 --> 04:16:46,285
Some of them do it later, some of them do it at the same time with that contractor for a better price because he's already paid mobilization, he's already there on site.

3107
04:16:47,143 --> 04:16:49,224
So we try to wrap it into the project anyway.

3108
04:16:49,264 --> 04:16:50,664
We can't force anybody to do it.

3109
04:16:51,524 --> 04:16:59,827
I have a letter, almost a form letter saying we strongly recommend that you do this and this is the time to do it and we get some done.

3110
04:16:59,847 --> 04:17:05,109
I think if people were aware that possibly they could roll it into their bill.

3111
04:17:06,229 --> 04:17:14,733
Over a period of time so they don't feel the impact that may be helpful to get more people on board And just one one quick thing the leak detection.

3112
04:17:15,034 --> 04:17:20,196
I know that's been an issue for a while We were told that this company is on board now.

3113
04:17:20,256 --> 04:17:20,816
Is that correct?

3114
04:17:21,777 --> 04:17:22,597
Okay, thank you

3115
04:17:29,511 --> 04:17:30,833
Move to the question, Mr. President.

3116
04:17:31,033 --> 04:17:31,273
Second.

3117
04:17:31,694 --> 04:17:35,138
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

3118
04:17:35,158 --> 04:17:35,739
Mr. Clerk.

3119
04:17:36,039 --> 04:17:36,540
First reading.

3120
04:17:37,581 --> 04:17:39,403
For the first reading, please call the roll.

3121
04:17:42,727 --> 04:17:43,288
Just woke me up.

3122
04:17:50,730 --> 04:17:51,511
Councilor DelaRusso?

3123
04:17:51,551 --> 04:17:51,851
Yay.

3124
04:17:52,532 --> 04:17:53,212
Councilor Falco?

3125
04:17:53,533 --> 04:17:53,793
Yes.

3126
04:17:54,213 --> 04:17:54,634
Councilor Night?

3127
04:17:54,814 --> 04:17:55,034
Yes.

3128
04:17:55,675 --> 04:17:56,356
Councilor Kern?

3129
04:17:56,476 --> 04:17:56,716
Yes.

3130
04:17:57,417 --> 04:17:58,237
Vice President Monk?

3131
04:17:58,277 --> 04:17:58,578
Yes.

3132
04:17:59,158 --> 04:17:59,859
Councilor Scott Kelly?

3133
04:17:59,879 --> 04:18:00,099
Yes.

3134
04:18:02,241 --> 04:18:04,283
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

3135
04:18:04,764 --> 04:18:06,566
Motion takes its first reading.

3136
04:18:06,586 --> 04:18:14,033
17582, dear Mr. President, city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body

3137
04:18:14,774 --> 04:18:24,122
approve the following transfer of $1,500,000 to be transferred from water and sewer retained earnings to a water sewer capital project account.

3138
04:18:25,010 --> 04:18:31,572
The amount of $1.5 million is needed for replacement of water mains, valves, and appurtenances in the City of Medford.

3139
04:18:32,052 --> 04:18:39,754
Finance Director Alicia Nunley and Engineering Director Cassandra Coulis are on present to answer any of the council's questions regarding the matter.

3140
04:18:40,014 --> 04:18:45,015
The remaining valves in the water sewer retained earnings after this transfer will be $5,476,978.

3141
04:18:45,115 --> 04:18:45,635
Good evening.

3142
04:18:53,458 --> 04:18:57,860
Good evening, Councillors.

3143
04:18:58,000 --> 04:18:58,420
Good morning.

3144
04:18:58,480 --> 04:19:05,163
This is 1.5 is in addition to that $2 million, so we wanted to do the $2 million loan at 0% and then pay the remainder with retained earnings.

3145
04:19:08,444 --> 04:19:08,924
To the Chair.

3146
04:19:08,944 --> 04:19:09,865
Oh, go ahead.

3147
04:19:09,885 --> 04:19:10,745
Councilor Lohman, go ahead.

3148
04:19:12,766 --> 04:19:20,489
To the Chair, so what we were given tonight, which is the summary of work, is estimated to cost a total of $4,000?

3149
04:19:20,529 --> 04:19:21,609
I mean $4 million?

3150
04:19:24,879 --> 04:19:28,160
The contract, Cardillo's contract is 3.463 million.

3151
04:19:28,180 --> 04:19:28,440
3.463 million.

3152
04:19:28,460 --> 04:19:32,661
So almost 3.5, and then the 200,000 for the lead service would bring it to 3.7.

3153
04:19:32,742 --> 04:19:35,442
So what are we doing with the extra monies?

3154
04:19:55,021 --> 04:19:56,642
Sorry, I'm taking these, my calculator.

3155
04:19:57,802 --> 04:20:12,668
Well, the little bit of what is extra, some things within the loan program, like you had asked, I believe, what was chosen by the MWRA, some items are considered to be included and eligible by MWRA, some items are not.

3156
04:20:14,629 --> 04:20:16,590
So there's a little cushion there for that.

3157
04:20:16,730 --> 04:20:24,273
Also, we have $125,000 in the budget towards this as well for water meters and MTUs.

3158
04:20:26,190 --> 04:20:28,391
I didn't hear that, I'm sorry, I was calculating the numbers.

3159
04:20:28,471 --> 04:20:31,891
Say that one more time, I'm sorry.

3160
04:20:31,931 --> 04:20:43,114
There's $225,000 in the loan application, there's 125,000 in the budget currently for new water meters, large meters, residential meters, and the meter reading devices.

3161
04:20:48,856 --> 04:20:51,776
So you have 3.463,200,000 for the lead service, and then additional money's needed?

3162
04:20:55,535 --> 04:21:01,297
Yes, and there's money already in the loan program, there's leftover money that we're going to reallocate.

3163
04:21:04,379 --> 04:21:06,960
Yeah, I guess the numbers just aren't adding up to me.

3164
04:21:07,480 --> 04:21:17,064
With the leftover money, the 2.75 million and the 1.5 million, that adds up to four and a half million.

3165
04:21:18,244 --> 04:21:19,425
And I see us only spending

3166
04:21:21,985 --> 04:21:22,606
$3,600,000.

3167
04:21:22,105 --> 04:21:22,606
I mean, $3,600,000.

3168
04:21:22,646 --> 04:21:29,951
We have the hydraulic model, we have Paris and Pinkert Street.

3169
04:21:41,641 --> 04:21:45,124
That's why I think I asked earlier, just like the breakdown.

3170
04:21:45,184 --> 04:21:57,195
I appreciate this, but it's 11.30 and to just start reading things that contain millions of dollars, I would ask what is the timeline for this?

3171
04:21:57,235 --> 04:22:05,923
Can we have a Committee of the Whole meeting before our August meeting and take a vote on this paper then, once everything is completely understood?

3172
04:22:08,775 --> 04:22:13,610
We can get a better breakdown of the money portion of it and where it's being spent and on what.

3173
04:22:14,078 --> 04:22:16,159
I feel like I'm doing calculating work.

3174
04:22:16,619 --> 04:22:23,841
If I may, through the chair, she already has a contract out there, so we would like to get the work done as soon as possible.

3175
04:22:24,341 --> 04:22:34,904
I would absolutely be open to provide all of the counselors with a breakdown of all the funds, but the faster we can actually get out there and start to get the work done and get that infrastructure moving, then we can start the paving.

3176
04:22:34,924 --> 04:22:36,704
I would really hate for it to go too long.

3177
04:22:37,564 --> 04:22:39,585
And I understand that,

3178
04:22:41,088 --> 04:22:48,394
to vote for 1.5 million to be taken out of water and sewer retained earnings, and maybe we only need a million, it's a big difference.

3179
04:22:48,574 --> 04:22:50,075
No, you're gonna need 1.5.

3180
04:22:50,675 --> 04:22:51,296
You're gonna need it.

3181
04:22:51,376 --> 04:22:56,520
So you're gonna need the four and a half million dollars to do all this work.

3182
04:22:56,540 --> 04:22:57,881
Yes, yes.

3183
04:22:58,421 --> 04:22:59,582
And what's in the application.

3184
04:22:59,622 --> 04:22:59,923
Yes.

3185
04:23:01,324 --> 04:23:02,304
This is a combined.

3186
04:23:03,889 --> 04:23:04,809
It's supplemental.

3187
04:23:05,410 --> 04:23:10,392
So this is the contract and then we have water meters and meter reading devices.

3188
04:23:10,432 --> 04:23:11,873
We have Paris and Pinkert Street.

3189
04:23:12,853 --> 04:23:16,495
We have the hydraulic model and we have the private lead services.

3190
04:23:17,475 --> 04:23:22,378
So what I shared with you tonight is a summary of the work in the contract, the three-year contract.

3191
04:23:25,553 --> 04:23:26,693
So it's not everything.

3192
04:23:27,314 --> 04:23:36,577
And I know it seems a little confusing, and I apologize for that, but it's a piecing together of different funding sources to do all of this work.

3193
04:23:36,957 --> 04:23:44,720
And it's correct in that we do, I don't even know, it's going to be exactly 1.5, we might be slightly short.

3194
04:23:45,441 --> 04:23:46,921
It's not that we'll have too much money.

3195
04:23:49,302 --> 04:23:51,263
I can vouch for that as I look at my notes.

3196
04:23:53,465 --> 04:24:12,758
I just think when we're talking about $4.5 million worth of projects that were probably definitely needed within the city, and we don't get any documentation on it except two lines in our council agenda until tonight, which obviously we didn't have time to read because we had lengthy discussions on other issues.

3197
04:24:12,778 --> 04:24:14,680
Do you all have the application directions after tonight?

3198
04:24:21,494 --> 04:24:25,835
Through the chair, Councillor, if I could help you with that a little bit.

3199
04:24:25,955 --> 04:24:26,235
Yes.

3200
04:24:26,415 --> 04:24:40,357
So, the 3.5 million that's needed for the three-year contract and some other little things that you have in there, like the hydraulic model, is 3.5 million.

3201
04:24:40,457 --> 04:24:48,919
And then there's an additional 200,000 that we would like to include the lead replacement program, for the lead replacement program.

3202
04:24:49,519 --> 04:24:52,561
we're at 3.7 million.

3203
04:24:53,201 --> 04:25:04,087
The loan through the MWRA is for 2.075 million, so that gets us, if you take that from the 3.7 million, that leaves a difference of 1.625.

3204
04:25:08,026 --> 04:25:08,526
Did you get that?

3205
04:25:08,726 --> 04:25:09,807
Are you with me?

3206
04:25:11,048 --> 04:25:14,009
Gotcha.

3207
04:25:14,089 --> 04:25:19,572
Okay, so from that 1.625, 125,000 was in the budget.

3208
04:25:21,053 --> 04:25:25,676
So we'd free up that money that was in the budget for water main replacement.

3209
04:25:26,256 --> 04:25:33,740
So we take that 125 out, we're at 1.5 million, which is where we need to take from retained earnings.

3210
04:25:36,186 --> 04:25:40,687
So that would pay for all of what we need right now.

3211
04:25:43,908 --> 04:25:49,490
And what about the $929,000 left over from the last time we borrowed from the MWRA?

3212
04:25:49,550 --> 04:25:58,112
That's authorized unissued debt that we can use through MMDT to, I believe you were gonna use that for Harris and Pinkert as a separate project?

3213
04:25:58,192 --> 04:25:59,313
It's all supplemental.

3214
04:26:00,033 --> 04:26:02,854
When you bid a job like this, you don't say give me a price for

3215
04:26:03,794 --> 04:26:06,057
I don't know if it's fair to say that.

3216
04:26:17,705 --> 04:26:21,768
So you give him how many feet of pipe we need.

3217
04:26:21,808 --> 04:26:23,929
Total feet of pipe and he gives me a number.

3218
04:26:24,270 --> 04:26:31,194
So I can't tell you how much he bid on Grove Street compared to some other street because he doesn't do it that way.

3219
04:26:31,214 --> 04:26:32,195
He's giving you totals.

3220
04:26:32,855 --> 04:26:35,998
So we have backup estimates that we put together.

3221
04:26:36,758 --> 04:26:39,299
for an engineer's estimate, it summarizes.

3222
04:26:40,159 --> 04:26:42,800
And ours was actually higher than what he bid.

3223
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:45,981
So he came in lower, but I just don't want to prorate it.

3224
04:26:46,121 --> 04:26:48,621
I don't think that would be the way to go.

3225
04:26:49,361 --> 04:26:55,803
So... So if you were to give the council pricing, it would be broken down a different way.

3226
04:26:55,823 --> 04:26:58,484
Yes, it wouldn't be the same thing.

3227
04:26:58,564 --> 04:27:00,024
It would be estimates.

3228
04:27:00,965 --> 04:27:05,906
I mean, we could actually, you know, we're going to use the budget numbers, you know, for the...

3229
04:27:06,986 --> 04:27:10,707
The meters will cost whatever they cost within the $225,000.

3230
04:27:12,128 --> 04:27:18,769
The estimate for the lead services is estimating $5,000 a service, but they may get a price of $6,000.

3231
04:27:18,809 --> 04:27:20,150
We might have one at $7,000, one at $4,000.

3232
04:27:21,470 --> 04:27:27,592
We don't know until we go house by house, case by case, how much each one of those will cost.

3233
04:27:29,388 --> 04:27:34,691
And the idea would be come up with a bid in the future that would say, here is a relatively simple change out.

3234
04:27:34,731 --> 04:27:37,933
Here's a more medium level change out.

3235
04:27:37,973 --> 04:27:39,114
Here's a complicated one.

3236
04:27:39,174 --> 04:27:40,715
Give us three prices for each.

3237
04:27:41,415 --> 04:27:43,876
So we can then partition it out better.

3238
04:27:44,497 --> 04:27:45,057
Okay.

3239
04:27:46,318 --> 04:27:46,578
Thank you.

3240
04:27:48,679 --> 04:27:49,480
Councilor Del Rosso.

3241
04:27:50,000 --> 04:28:04,355
Mr. President, I just want to say that I'm sure the people of Medford can enthusiastically look forward to these improvements that are coming to the neighborhoods and in the city.

3242
04:28:04,775 --> 04:28:06,297
Many of them long sought after.

3243
04:28:06,317 --> 04:28:09,820
I endorse the efforts of the

3244
04:28:12,142 --> 04:28:18,526
engineers office and the financial offices that are putting together these great deals throughout the community.

3245
04:28:19,126 --> 04:28:20,167
I have one question.

3246
04:28:20,827 --> 04:28:23,668
If I may, to either Ms.

3247
04:28:23,728 --> 04:28:37,015
Irwin or Nunley, the $1.5 million that we're going to take out of retained earnings, will the use of that and the debt payment that will come out of

3248
04:28:39,817 --> 04:28:55,711
retained earnings in any way alter our profile for loan orders in the future or make our ability to bond and repay those bonds on those major capital products any weaker.

3249
04:28:56,532 --> 04:28:58,374
Thank you for your foresight and your preparation.

3250
04:28:58,394 --> 04:28:59,475
Move approval, Mr. President.

3251
04:28:59,735 --> 04:29:02,978
On the motion by Councilor Dela Ruta, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3252
04:29:03,658 --> 04:29:05,260
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3253
04:29:07,722 --> 04:29:08,643
Councilor De La Russo?

3254
04:29:08,864 --> 04:29:09,264
Yes.

3255
04:29:09,605 --> 04:29:10,326
Councilor Falco?

3256
04:29:10,426 --> 04:29:10,666
Yes.

3257
04:29:11,087 --> 04:29:11,608
Councilor Night?

3258
04:29:11,668 --> 04:29:11,928
Yes.

3259
04:29:12,589 --> 04:29:13,410
Councilor Wendell Kern?

3260
04:29:13,831 --> 04:29:14,091
Yes.

3261
04:29:14,772 --> 04:29:15,574
Vice President Marks?

3262
04:29:15,614 --> 04:29:15,974
Yes.

3263
04:29:16,315 --> 04:29:17,116
Councilor Scott Kelly?

3264
04:29:19,419 --> 04:29:19,720
Absent.

3265
04:29:20,441 --> 04:29:21,202
President Caviello?

3266
04:29:21,322 --> 04:29:21,523
Yes.

3267
04:29:24,461 --> 04:29:26,282
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

3268
04:29:27,343 --> 04:29:28,183
Motion passes.

3269
04:29:28,563 --> 04:29:30,064
Motion to adjourn, Mr. President.

3270
04:29:30,084 --> 04:29:32,566
Reports from committee, 17584.

3271
04:29:32,866 --> 04:29:35,248
Unfortunately, Mr. Del Rosso, we do have some more things under there.

3272
04:29:35,728 --> 04:29:37,469
I'm sorry, Councilor Montgomery, what did you want?

3273
04:29:37,509 --> 04:29:42,733
Well, we have a few other people that'd like to speak, and we have one petition for a sign.

3274
04:29:43,553 --> 04:29:45,615
I think that's with Councilor Marks, which would be... 17584.

3275
04:29:47,782 --> 04:29:52,704
We're already here.

3276
04:29:52,724 --> 04:29:57,086
17584, Subcommittee on Business, Economic Development and Science Report, July 13th.

3277
04:29:57,266 --> 04:30:00,867
The purpose was to review and discuss signs in our reversal petition.

3278
04:30:01,207 --> 04:30:05,349
Councilor Marks, who is the chairman of that committee, would you like to give us a report?

3279
04:30:05,669 --> 04:30:12,472
Yes, Mr. President, the subcommittee on business, economic development, and science met Thursday, July 13th at 5 p.m.

3280
04:30:13,412 --> 04:30:25,138
for the purpose of three signed denial petitions, of which paper 17-553, the ultimate tango, was approved as resubmitted to this council.

3281
04:30:26,538 --> 04:30:28,219
And the other two papers, 17-452 and 17-450,

3282
04:30:35,642 --> 04:30:40,785
were received and placed on file, Mr. President, because the petitioners were not present.

3283
04:30:41,466 --> 04:30:42,527
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

3284
04:30:42,547 --> 04:30:44,368
So I move approval on that report.

3285
04:30:45,629 --> 04:30:47,030
Mr. President, I second that.

3286
04:30:48,521 --> 04:30:52,204
On the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3287
04:30:52,385 --> 04:30:53,085
All those in favor?

3288
04:30:53,345 --> 04:30:53,666
Aye.

3289
04:30:54,026 --> 04:30:55,087
Motion passes.

3290
04:30:55,607 --> 04:30:57,809
Motion approval on that sign, Mr. President.

3291
04:30:57,829 --> 04:31:00,031
Motion on the approval of the sign.

3292
04:31:00,211 --> 04:31:02,814
As was amended and discussed in committee.

3293
04:31:03,414 --> 04:31:06,797
Motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by second Councilor Knight.

3294
04:31:06,917 --> 04:31:07,598
All those in favor?

3295
04:31:07,778 --> 04:31:07,978
Aye.

3296
04:31:08,299 --> 04:31:09,019
Motion passes.

3297
04:31:09,319 --> 04:31:10,100
Congratulations.

3298
04:31:10,420 --> 04:31:11,281
Keep dancing.

3299
04:31:14,084 --> 04:31:14,906
August 1st.

3300
04:31:15,346 --> 04:31:16,028
August 1st.

3301
04:31:16,488 --> 04:31:16,949
Thank you.

3302
04:31:17,330 --> 04:31:18,051
Thank you.

3303
04:31:18,151 --> 04:31:20,195
All right.

3304
04:31:20,335 --> 04:31:22,539
Motion to revert back to regular business.

3305
04:31:27,441 --> 04:31:40,584
17574, petition by Andrew P. Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, to address the council about making America a democracy again, starting in Medford.

3306
04:31:40,604 --> 04:31:43,865
Mr. Castagnetti, if I can remind you, the 10 minute rule is in effect.

3307
04:31:47,326 --> 04:31:47,646
Thank you, sir.

3308
04:31:47,666 --> 04:31:48,346
Thank you so much.

3309
04:31:59,632 --> 04:32:03,814
Andrew Paul Castanetti, 23 Cushman Street Method Massachusetts.

3310
04:32:05,355 --> 04:32:07,296
Good evening honorable city councilors.

3311
04:32:09,357 --> 04:32:10,838
I mean, almost good morning.

3312
04:32:10,858 --> 04:32:11,879
It's almost midnight.

3313
04:32:14,020 --> 04:32:19,103
God bless America for allowing me to file my petition and speak on this matter with our first amendment right.

3314
04:32:20,083 --> 04:32:23,325
I promise to be brief as possible and not ad lib.

3315
04:32:25,327 --> 04:32:32,012
Therefore, I'll read from my teleprompter of handwritten notes before me.

3316
04:32:32,673 --> 04:32:34,254
I only need about eight minutes.

3317
04:32:36,035 --> 04:32:39,358
If the phone works, it's 1151 for the record.

3318
04:32:43,001 --> 04:32:45,483
Are we a democracy or not a democracy?

3319
04:32:45,763 --> 04:32:46,724
That is my question.

3320
04:32:47,385 --> 04:32:52,629
An extreme concern here in 02155 and for all of the United States of America.

3321
04:32:53,678 --> 04:33:03,121
Number two, for example, I must read two letters that were issued from the City of Medford Board of Health.

3322
04:33:03,901 --> 04:33:14,024
The first letter was sent, I'm not sure of the date because it's not dated, from Mary Ann O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health.

3323
04:33:15,245 --> 04:33:18,626
It states, the Board of Health recently voted to implement

3324
04:33:20,070 --> 04:33:22,852
proposed changes to Memphis tobacco regulations.

3325
04:33:23,692 --> 04:33:28,255
As of July 10, 2017, the proposed changes will become effective.

3326
04:33:29,796 --> 04:33:34,098
And in the bottom, it's directed towards private clubs.

3327
04:33:34,859 --> 04:33:39,701
Smoking prohibited in private clubs slash memberships associations.

3328
04:33:41,162 --> 04:33:44,064
Another letter was also sent out thereafter.

3329
04:33:44,604 --> 04:33:45,665
What date, I don't know.

3330
04:33:46,025 --> 04:33:47,186
It's not dated, again.

3331
04:33:49,563 --> 04:33:51,324
Same department, same director.

3332
04:33:52,325 --> 04:33:55,588
It states, Board of Health notice to private clubs.

3333
04:33:56,088 --> 04:34:05,335
The Memphis Board of Health voted at the June meeting to postpone the enactment of the private club smoking ban for six months until after the next election.

3334
04:34:09,078 --> 04:34:12,721
Three, it seems very undemocratic, you'd think.

3335
04:34:14,158 --> 04:34:19,277
Before I continue, I'll disclose I am an officer at the Sons of Italy in Winchester, Massachusetts.

3336
04:34:20,320 --> 04:34:24,202
And yes, the club did ban smoking, November of 016.

3337
04:34:25,123 --> 04:34:30,506
However, the private club membership voted amongst themselves in a democratic election period.

3338
04:34:31,087 --> 04:34:36,630
Furthermore, the Winchester town government never dictated any such order.

3339
04:34:37,231 --> 04:34:45,396
And also, our club did allow a special area for the people to go and enjoy their medicine, smoking.

3340
04:34:47,938 --> 04:34:50,799
With thoughtful respect, thank you to the sons of Italy.

3341
04:34:51,500 --> 04:34:55,762
Number five, look, we understand that smoking is a nasty addictive habit.

3342
04:34:56,382 --> 04:35:00,765
My belief is nicotine is the most addictive drug on earth.

3343
04:35:01,465 --> 04:35:04,487
They say smoking kills people and may indeed be killing me.

3344
04:35:05,167 --> 04:35:10,830
However, did anyone ever think that this nicotine medicine kept me alive for 66 years?

3345
04:35:11,930 --> 04:35:12,551
And many others.

3346
04:35:13,477 --> 04:35:14,398
especially U.S.

3347
04:35:14,778 --> 04:35:21,163
soldiers who are now veterans, a la VFW, American Legion, and more.

3348
04:35:21,984 --> 04:35:36,316
Six, by the way, my point of factual information, when I started smoking in 1962, cigarettes was 28 cents a pack, the same price as a gallon of gasoline at Dick's Esso at Tufts Park.

3349
04:35:37,344 --> 04:35:41,606
OK, so gas is now $2.10 a gallon.

3350
04:35:42,246 --> 04:35:49,429
But a package of smokes is five times more than that in Texas.

3351
04:35:50,409 --> 04:35:57,753
Costing the most addicted and poorest people in society more than $10 per package.

3352
04:35:58,813 --> 04:36:03,195
PS, most of that $10 is federal, state, local taxes.

3353
04:36:04,008 --> 04:36:10,933
hello, if we all stop smoking, the government will lose billions in tax revenue.

3354
04:36:11,373 --> 04:36:23,922
And I don't even want to think how and what the government would tax to recoup the huge tax loss, especially with Proposition 2.5 in effect in Massachusetts.

3355
04:36:24,282 --> 04:36:26,423
Thank you, Barbara Anderson.

3356
04:36:26,543 --> 04:36:27,224
Rest her soul.

3357
04:36:29,196 --> 04:36:32,459
6A, please don't get too lost in what I just said.

3358
04:36:33,179 --> 04:36:36,402
But at that time, I really felt that way, and I still do.

3359
04:36:39,524 --> 04:36:42,146
In closing, sorry, I'm going to have to ad lib now.

3360
04:36:45,108 --> 04:36:57,698
Once, I agree with the past councilor, President Robert Mayorko, when he once said, leave the people alone.

3361
04:37:01,455 --> 04:37:04,999
I remember it because it was the only time I agreed with a man.

3362
04:37:08,402 --> 04:37:10,705
I'll never forget it, but that never happened.

3363
04:37:10,725 --> 04:37:10,705
8.

3364
04:37:12,406 --> 04:37:17,432
It seems Big Brother, the government, has its own nasty habit.

3365
04:37:19,158 --> 04:37:21,539
of putting their nose in people's private business.

3366
04:37:22,419 --> 04:37:23,700
Again, again, and again.

3367
04:37:24,100 --> 04:37:41,186
It is appalling to me and many other voters when our so-called leaders dictate to our VFW veterans of way too many wars, demanding that we cease from smoking in our private club.

3368
04:37:41,587 --> 04:37:45,048
This is not fair and very undemocratic.

3369
04:37:46,114 --> 04:37:50,356
We, the member peoples, are very capable to vote amongst ourselves.

3370
04:37:51,237 --> 04:38:13,908
Furthermore, these fellow veterans who sacrificed life and limb and much more that I couldn't even comprehend, and we don't want to walk a mile on this show, I'm sure, unless you already have, you don't want to go back there, are the only reason we are not speaking German on the East Coast or Japanese on the West Coast and maybe even Mexican up to the Mason-Dixon line.

3371
04:38:16,446 --> 04:38:23,010
Number nine, you know when I started kindergarten at the Hancock School, I no speak of the English at all.

3372
04:38:23,851 --> 04:38:25,552
I spoke a Northern Italian dialect.

3373
04:38:26,353 --> 04:38:32,617
Eventually I picked up your English as my second language without an ESL teacher.

3374
04:38:33,097 --> 04:38:39,902
But I do remember quite well those 50s teachers told me, this country is based on democracy.

3375
04:38:43,142 --> 04:38:58,045
However, I've learned since then that this may be the biggest lie of all time, because it seems to be capitalism rules, and therefore trumps over our so-called democracy.

3376
04:38:58,866 --> 04:39:01,126
So please, back off.

3377
04:39:02,827 --> 04:39:04,487
Leave us alone.

3378
04:39:06,048 --> 04:39:16,479
And finally, number 10, my fellow VFW members asked me to ask you all, will you stand on this matter now tonight, July 18th, 2017?

3379
04:39:22,778 --> 04:39:24,159
This is from seven minutes ago.

3380
04:39:24,379 --> 04:39:24,499
It's 11.58.

3381
04:39:25,199 --> 04:39:30,962
You have about four minutes left, three minutes left, three minutes left.

3382
04:39:30,982 --> 04:39:31,843
I don't want that much time.

3383
04:39:31,863 --> 04:39:33,243
I don't want that much time.

3384
04:39:33,263 --> 04:39:34,584
I'm going to repeat number 10, however.

3385
04:39:34,604 --> 04:39:35,604
I got to get off track.

3386
04:39:35,725 --> 04:39:36,725
We have our timer going.

3387
04:39:36,945 --> 04:39:37,405
Thank you, sir.

3388
04:39:39,226 --> 04:39:52,013
My fellow VFW members, including the top three, Commander Down, and in succession, they asked me to ask you all, where you stand on this matter now, tonight,

3389
04:39:53,008 --> 04:39:54,309
before the next general election.

3390
04:39:55,470 --> 04:39:56,311
Thank you for listening.

3391
04:40:12,960 --> 04:40:20,304
important to point out that when the Massachusetts State Legislature passed the public smoking ban back in the early 2000s, they exempted private clubs.

3392
04:40:20,864 --> 04:40:23,045
And they exempted private clubs and they allowed local control.

3393
04:40:23,725 --> 04:40:26,306
And they vested that local control into the local boards of health.

3394
04:40:28,027 --> 04:40:37,812
Personally, I think if they were going to implement the ban, back then the legislature should have either implemented a ban or not implemented a ban, but they left these certain low-hanging fruit, as we'll call them.

3395
04:40:38,345 --> 04:40:38,906
that are out there.

3396
04:40:38,946 --> 04:40:48,634
So what's happened here in the City of Medford is we've had a couple of changes at the Office of the Board of Health, a couple of changes at the members of the Board of Health, and they've brought this proposal forward and they voted on it.

3397
04:40:49,214 --> 04:41:00,523
It's my understanding that when the proposal went through, there were a number of individuals that were very upset in these private club settings about learning of the fact that smoking is going to be banned in these facilities that they've been smoking in for a long time.

3398
04:41:01,184 --> 04:41:06,328
So in response to that, the administration felt as though it would make sense and the Board of Health felt as though it would make sense to sit down

3399
04:41:06,778 --> 04:41:12,965
and give a period of time for people to have dialogue and exchange some conversation about the situation, Mr. Castagnetti.

3400
04:41:13,306 --> 04:41:25,880
So as of right now, it's my understanding that the reason why the moratorium was put in place on the ban was to allow for the stakeholders, the people at the VFW, the people at the American Legion, the people down at the Amici Club, the people over at the Sons of Italy,

3401
04:41:26,460 --> 04:41:35,307
and every other private club, the Elks, for example, to come and get to the table and sit down with the Board of Health and talk about what's going on and why this is happening and why they're seeking to implement it.

3402
04:41:35,868 --> 04:41:44,795
And I understand there's also been some discussion about doing what they've done over in Winchester at your private club, which is designated smoking areas, so on and so forth.

3403
04:41:44,835 --> 04:41:47,537
So right now it's actually a work in progress, Mr. Castagnetti.

3404
04:41:47,557 --> 04:41:55,283
It's my understanding that the Board of Health is meeting with the leadership of the clubs, or has met with the leadership of the clubs, and they're going to continue to keep them informed.

3405
04:41:56,063 --> 04:41:59,844
on the ongoing deliberations and discussions and include them in these conversations.

3406
04:42:00,944 --> 04:42:02,025
Thank you for your response.

3407
04:42:02,105 --> 04:42:02,625
Anyone else?

3408
04:42:07,806 --> 04:42:14,148
I think it's time to start another party call, not we the people, you the people.

3409
04:42:14,948 --> 04:42:17,449
Because democracy doesn't seem to be working.

3410
04:42:18,980 --> 04:42:25,603
I know we're a minority, and we're looked upon as- I know, I know Woobin did the same thing.

3411
04:42:25,623 --> 04:42:29,825
Woobin has a, they have a special room for smokers.

3412
04:42:29,885 --> 04:42:33,747
There is some room for- It's the most addictive drug in the world.

3413
04:42:33,807 --> 04:42:35,408
My mother died from smoking.

3414
04:42:35,688 --> 04:42:36,829
It's a tough, tough topic.

3415
04:42:36,849 --> 04:42:38,730
I know exactly where you're coming from.

3416
04:42:38,790 --> 04:42:44,092
Maybe I should just throw my hat in the ring for the first time ever tomorrow morning and put my papers up at city council.

3417
04:42:44,853 --> 04:42:45,233
Good luck.

3418
04:42:46,641 --> 04:42:48,862
Thank you very much, Mr. Castaneda.

3419
04:42:49,582 --> 04:42:55,124
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to be received and placed on file, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3420
04:42:55,184 --> 04:42:55,864
All those in favor?

3421
04:42:55,884 --> 04:42:56,144
Aye.

3422
04:42:56,404 --> 04:42:58,145
Motion passes.

3423
04:42:58,165 --> 04:43:03,747
15 by 7-5, petition by Robert M. Penta, 0 Summit Road, Memphis, Mass., to address the council.

3424
04:43:05,191 --> 04:43:22,834
to discuss a review of a home rule petition to amend Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 44, Section 16 A and B, inclusive of the local legislative option provision as it relates to the Community Preservation Act and the Community Preservation Act Trust Fund.

3425
04:43:24,414 --> 04:43:30,476
Mr. President, it was my intent to address this council on Tuesday, July 18th.

3426
04:43:31,096 --> 04:43:32,736
This is now Wednesday.

3427
04:43:33,416 --> 04:43:39,982
Councilor Del Rosso is tired, he wants to go home, so I'd like to table this to our August meeting.

3428
04:43:40,042 --> 04:43:41,103
And the council thanks you for that.

3429
04:43:43,365 --> 04:43:44,225
And we thank you for that also.

3430
04:43:44,245 --> 04:43:45,066
Yes, I'll vote for that.

3431
04:43:46,647 --> 04:43:50,391
Motion to table Mr. Penta's request to the August meeting.

3432
04:43:50,411 --> 04:43:51,131
All those in favor?

3433
04:43:51,411 --> 04:43:51,712
Aye.

3434
04:43:52,352 --> 04:43:54,454
I think we did everything.

3435
04:43:57,156 --> 04:43:58,337
Papers in the hands of the clerk.

3436
04:44:05,912 --> 04:44:16,630
17, 585, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Christopher and Caitlin Murphy on the birth of their first child, Sadie Elizabeth.

3437
04:44:17,844 --> 04:44:18,544
Councilor Knight.

3438
04:44:18,864 --> 04:44:21,485
Mr. President, rather self-explanatory resolution.

3439
04:44:21,525 --> 04:44:27,548
Very recently, Chris Murphy, one of the city's members of the Parks Commission, recently had his first child.

3440
04:44:27,588 --> 04:44:29,368
He and his wife, Caitlin, had their first child.

3441
04:44:29,448 --> 04:44:31,569
And he's a very happy, proud dad.

3442
04:44:31,609 --> 04:44:32,489
Caitlin's very healthy.

3443
04:44:32,509 --> 04:44:33,490
The baby's very healthy.

3444
04:44:33,530 --> 04:44:38,151
And I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate them and wish them the best of luck in their new endeavor.

3445
04:44:38,832 --> 04:44:39,152
Thank you.

3446
04:44:41,193 --> 04:44:41,453
All right.

3447
04:44:41,893 --> 04:44:44,115
He's still up, by the way, now that he had the baby.

3448
04:44:44,155 --> 04:44:44,575
Absolutely.

3449
04:44:44,615 --> 04:44:45,315
He's still up.

3450
04:44:46,036 --> 04:44:48,177
I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

3451
04:44:48,197 --> 04:44:48,357
Seconded.

3452
04:44:48,697 --> 04:44:49,777
Seconded by Council Member Kern.

3453
04:44:49,797 --> 04:44:50,438
All those in favor?

3454
04:44:50,638 --> 04:44:50,978
Aye.

3455
04:44:51,018 --> 04:44:51,738
Motion passes.

3456
04:44:52,179 --> 04:45:03,965
Offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the potholes at the intersection of Locust and Riverside Ave and Riverside Ave and Middlesex Street be filled in the interest of public safety.

3457
04:45:04,345 --> 04:45:05,285
Vice President Mox.

3458
04:45:06,865 --> 04:45:09,806
On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

3459
04:45:09,866 --> 04:45:10,487
All those in favor?

3460
04:45:10,667 --> 04:45:10,807
Aye.

3461
04:45:11,107 --> 04:45:11,907
Motion passes.

3462
04:45:12,428 --> 04:45:19,551
Offered by Councilor Mox, being resolved that the area around Placid Park tennis court be paved in the interest of public safety.

3463
04:45:19,971 --> 04:45:21,272
Mr. Vice President Mox.

3464
04:45:21,912 --> 04:45:23,233
Thank you, Mr. President.

3465
04:45:24,533 --> 04:45:30,256
Anyone that's been on this council for a number of years will know this has been an issue of many of the neighbors in the area.

3466
04:45:31,056 --> 04:45:34,958
When it rains heavily, that particular area gets flooded out.

3467
04:45:35,629 --> 04:45:43,753
And it makes it almost impossible for people trying to use the park to either go to the tennis courts or gain access into the tot lot in the park.

3468
04:45:44,273 --> 04:45:55,599
And I would ask that, once and for all, Mr. President, that the area surrounding the tennis courts on Century Street Extension be repaved in the interest of public safety.

3469
04:45:57,440 --> 04:45:59,922
Mr. President, I would certainly second that motion.

3470
04:45:59,982 --> 04:46:07,909
I think it's a great idea, and I'd like to add that if they do pave it, that they stripe it as well, so that we can have defined parking spots there, because it does get a little haphazard during the busy season.

3471
04:46:09,537 --> 04:46:14,740
On the motion by Vice President Mox as amended by Councilor Knight.

3472
04:46:15,100 --> 04:46:15,800
All those in favor?

3473
04:46:15,980 --> 04:46:16,381
Aye.

3474
04:46:16,481 --> 04:46:17,421
Motion passes.

3475
04:46:18,522 --> 04:46:29,127
Offered by Vice President Mox, it resolves that the recent construction on 3rd Street from 3rd and Riverside is during the Pell's Way be discussed.

3476
04:46:29,287 --> 04:46:30,168
Vice President Mox.

3477
04:46:30,528 --> 04:46:33,550
Mr. President, this is the second time I've offered this resolution.

3478
04:46:34,090 --> 04:46:43,596
As we're all aware, that end of 3rd Street from Riverside Ave to the Felsway has been dug up over the last two and a half years.

3479
04:46:44,557 --> 04:46:53,422
And from what I'm being told, the repaving that has been done, which is shoddy work, is the final repaving that's going to get done.

3480
04:46:53,862 --> 04:46:59,906
And I would ask that the city go out there immediately, the clerk of the works or the billing department,

3481
04:47:00,466 --> 04:47:09,537
and take a look at what's been paved and offer a better solution, Mr. President, than currently exists there for residents.

3482
04:47:11,577 --> 04:47:11,877
Second.

3483
04:47:11,897 --> 04:47:15,178
On the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3484
04:47:15,498 --> 04:47:16,239
All those in favor?

3485
04:47:16,459 --> 04:47:16,699
Aye.

3486
04:47:17,159 --> 04:47:18,039
Motion passes.

3487
04:47:18,819 --> 04:47:21,820
Records were passed to Councilor Falco.

3488
04:47:22,320 --> 04:47:26,962
Councilor Falco, at this late hour, how did you find those records, if you can still read them?

3489
04:47:27,142 --> 04:47:34,684
Mr. President, yes, I was able to read them and I have actually a couple of amendments to make to the records.

3490
04:47:34,764 --> 04:47:37,865
If you'd like to table them and give them to the clerk for next week, that would be,

3491
04:47:39,345 --> 04:47:42,547
Actually, I can just read them out now.

3492
04:47:42,647 --> 04:48:07,022
So there's just two points that were missing, and it had to do with 17-512, which was the city budget, and so if we could just add that Councilor Scarpelli disclosed that he has a relative employed by the schools, and that is reflected in the school budget, and then myself, Councilor Falco, disclosed that he had a relative employed by the city, and that is reflected in the city budget.

3493
04:48:08,402 --> 04:48:11,343
Motion to approve is amended.

3494
04:48:11,363 --> 04:48:14,284
These are the amendments.

3495
04:48:14,484 --> 04:48:16,905
Motion by Councilor Falco to adjourn.

3496
04:48:16,925 --> 04:48:17,505
All those in favor?

3497
04:48:18,966 --> 04:48:19,146
No.

3498
04:48:20,586 --> 04:48:23,127
First we have to approve the amendments.

3499
04:48:23,967 --> 04:48:25,828
Approve as amended by Councilor Falco.

3500
04:48:26,308 --> 04:48:26,908
Yes.

3501
04:48:27,148 --> 04:48:27,928
All those in favor, aye.

3502
04:48:28,028 --> 04:48:28,849
Motion passes.

3503
04:48:29,249 --> 04:48:30,529
Motion by Councilor Falco.

3504
04:48:30,849 --> 04:48:31,569
Motion passes.
