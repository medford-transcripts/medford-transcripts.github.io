24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:22,042
[SPEAKER_42]: And we have some quicker things we want to do first, a couple of common pictures, small things, so we can get those people out of here and concentrate on what the bigger crowd is here for.

[SPEAKER_42]: All right.

[SPEAKER_41]: I see that all the paperwork is in order.

37
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,064
[SPEAKER_41]: Can you just give us a brief description of the business that we're presenting to us tonight?

38
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:21,808
[SPEAKER_58]: It's a restaurant, but we also, our business in

39
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:39,104
[SPEAKER_58]: Davis Square is a market, a specialty grocery, so it's gonna be a small market, but also we have a full liquor license with a full bar, so at Dave's, we have a wine shop, so instead of that, we're gonna have a bar and a restaurant.

40
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:50,468
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna be open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, open at seven in the morning, Monday through Friday, until 10 or so at night, and then closed on Sundays.

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,446
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so the report calls that you're closing out, your hours are from what time to what time?

42
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:05,913
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna be open at seven in the morning, and then we'll probably close somewhere around nine or 10, depending on the night, maybe.

43
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,094
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, but the permit reads.

44
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:10,918
[SPEAKER_41]: You're allowed 11.

45
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,419
[SPEAKER_41]: The hours of operation is 11, so.

46
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:13,600
[SPEAKER_41]: Right.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you know that.

49
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Read that along.

50
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:17,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

51
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:25,851
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, I see all the departments have checked off, Mr. President.

52
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:28,072
[SPEAKER_41]: Everything looks like it's in order.

53
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,895
[SPEAKER_41]: I move to accept and place on file.

54
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,036
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. President.

55
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:33,457
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Naito.

56
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:37,870
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, this is something I'm very excited about this evening.

57
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:47,139
[SPEAKER_49]: This is something that's been in the works for quite a bit of time when the Brown and Blue coffee shop was removed and we've seen Dave's Fresh Pasta on Holland Street that's been very successful.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,682
[SPEAKER_49]: That's a very successful business over there in Somerville.

59
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:54,645
[SPEAKER_49]: They run for their money, but I don't want to let anybody know that out here.

60
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:58,587
[SPEAKER_49]: But I think that this is going to be a great addition to the community, Mr. President.

61
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,289
[SPEAKER_49]: And I, for one, feel as though this is something that should be supported this evening, and I'll move for approval to pay for it.

62
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,629
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

63
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,750
[SPEAKER_51]: Councilor Dello Russo.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,113
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. President, there was great enthusiasm with the significant outpouring of support.

65
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:17,705
[SPEAKER_51]: on various phases of this project and for the licensing that was granted as well, Mr. President.

66
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,151
[SPEAKER_51]: So I also lend my voice of approval to this.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,300
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

68
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,081
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you President Caraviello.

69
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:28,464
[SPEAKER_44]: Could you just let us know how many people, patrons, you'll be able to serve at one time?

70
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,085
[SPEAKER_44]: How many seats are there?

71
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:36,968
[SPEAKER_58]: We have about 60 to 63 seats inside as of now.

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,210
[SPEAKER_58]: We don't want it to be too crowded, so we're keeping it comfortable.

73
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:45,333
[SPEAKER_58]: And we will have some outdoor seating eventually, but we're not quite there yet.

74
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,774
[SPEAKER_58]: We've got to get it open first.

75
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,889
[SPEAKER_44]: And can you give us a time frame of when you think you'll be open?

76
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,270
[SPEAKER_44]: The outdoor?

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,132
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, just when you'll be open in general so the public knows.

78
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:56,578
[SPEAKER_58]: Well, we wanted to open tomorrow morning, but we're not quite ready.

79
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:57,879
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're thinking Thursday morning.

80
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,461
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to open in stages.

81
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:03,206
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to start with breakfast and then add the other things as we get comfortable.

82
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:11,593
[SPEAKER_58]: We're hoping to be fully running before the students come back, because Tufts is our landlord, and they will come, so we want to be ready for them.

83
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,335
[SPEAKER_44]: Do you have the voucher program with Tufts University?

84
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:14,856
[SPEAKER_44]: No.

85
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,658
[SPEAKER_58]: We're not part of dining services or anything.

86
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:18,719
[SPEAKER_58]: They're just our landlord.

87
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,961
[SPEAKER_58]: I wish you good luck.

88
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,041
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you very much.

89
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,503
[SPEAKER_58]: Appreciate the support.

90
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,293
[SPEAKER_42]: Move the motion by Councilor Scarpelli.

91
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,074

[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

95
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,079
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

96
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:31,940
[SPEAKER_42]: Congratulations.

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,183
[SPEAKER_42]: Hope to see you one day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner or all of the above.

98
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:36,965
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

99
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,551
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, 17571, petition for a common fixture license by Deepak Kachayapati.

100
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:51,652
[SPEAKER_42]: 50 Barrett Street, Malden, Mass.

101
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:57,393
[SPEAKER_42]: 02148 for Malden Bazaar, LLC doing business as City Bazaar.

102
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:58,693
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,614
[SPEAKER_42]: Is the petitioner here?

104
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:05,574
[SPEAKER_42]: I thought I saw him here.

105
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:16,668
[SPEAKER_42]: He's in room B. They can hear you in there, so may I call his name?

106
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,590
[SPEAKER_42]: Larry, can you just go in there and see if he's there?

107
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,671
[SPEAKER_42]: I thought he said he was here.

108
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:38,743
[SPEAKER_42]: Also, I want to inform everybody that this meeting is being taped for a later broadcast, but it is also being filmed by another private person, so if anyone has any objections to that, please let me know.

109
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,145
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, motion to table.

110
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:40,945
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

111
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

112
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:41,786
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion is tabled.

113
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:53,470
[SPEAKER_42]: Which one are we doing next, the science?

114
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:53,670
[SPEAKER_42]: PPA.

115
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:53,951
[SPEAKER_42]: PPA.

116
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,251
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

117
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:54,931
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President.

118
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,972
[SPEAKER_29]: Hold up.

119
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:59,274
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, we have one person here for the monopole.

120
00:06:59,294 --> 00:06:59,834
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll get to you.

121
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:04,077
[SPEAKER_42]: There may be a few people there.

122
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:04,557
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

123
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:11,141
[SPEAKER_42]: 17567, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the MBTA proposed cellular towers be discussed.

124
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:11,801
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Marks.

125
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:13,663
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,884
[SPEAKER_29]: I offered this resolution several months back.

127
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:27,711
[SPEAKER_29]: When I found out of the proposal, the MBTA was looking to install 375-foot towers throughout 60 communities along the rail line.

128
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:41,637
[SPEAKER_29]: And at that time, Mr. President, the council asked that we have a meeting with the MBTA to discuss some of the issues that naturally we would know residents would have.

129
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:50,463
[SPEAKER_29]: One of the polls — actually, both of the polls are located in residential neighborhoods that abut railroad lines.

130
00:07:51,323 --> 00:08:08,835
[SPEAKER_29]: And knowing that, Mr. President, the council asked that we meet with the MBTA to look at whether or not the MBTA can cancel the contract they have currently now with BAI Communications and allow for public input.

131
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:13,098
[SPEAKER_29]: which, to date, there has been very little, if any, public input.

132
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:30,872
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know some residents from the Tyler Ave area reached out to this council and requested that we give them the ability to speak before the council with some of their concerns, and I requested City Solicitor Mark Rumley, who I believe is here tonight,

133
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,854
[SPEAKER_29]: He is here tonight to be present if he can answer any questions.

134
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:49,884
[SPEAKER_29]: But as of Friday, June 30th, the T did announce that they were going to take a step back and conduct a 30-day assessment of the project, which involved, as I mentioned, 375-foot towers in 60 communities.

135
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:56,368
[SPEAKER_29]: The T also went on to say there will be no construction of poles or other infrastructure during this review.

136
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:02,472
[SPEAKER_29]: which will include comments and other feedback from customers, elected and appointed officials, and residents.

137
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:10,058
[SPEAKER_29]: A presentation of the status of the project will be given to the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board at an upcoming meeting.

138
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,764
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would ask, Mr. President, at this time that we hear from residents that are here regarding this particular poll.

139
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,226
[SPEAKER_29]: and the impact it's going to have on the neighborhood.

140
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:34,177
[SPEAKER_29]: I also wanted to mention that this council did write a letter regarding historic property that are located within this, I forget the distance, I think it's a half a mile or one mile from the pole.

141
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:42,084
[SPEAKER_29]: And we did write a letter stating that we were in opposition of these particular sites, Mr. President.

142
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,245
[SPEAKER_29]: But at this time, I know there's a few residents here.

143
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,987
[SPEAKER_29]: If you'd like to come forward.

144
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:01,652
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening.

145
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,253
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record please.

146
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

147
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:05,495
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Carol Brown.

148
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:11,581
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on 67 Tyler Ave and I want to thank the members of the City Council for

149
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:21,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Taking all of my emails and responding and I want to thank you again I've done it a couple of times and you're all really great about it, especially for the files.

150
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:27,913
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you I've been a 33 year resident of Medford in West Medford.

151
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:34,658
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a wonderful community I can tell you from the the price of houses.

152
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:37,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody loves our community and

153
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:50,889
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the T and the commuter rail are a big important part of our community and the value of the houses, but I have to say that I have a few concerns.

154
00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:03,317
[SPEAKER_16]: First and foremost, I know there's a need for technology, but I feel that the T kind of snuck everything in through the back door.

155
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,999
[SPEAKER_16]: I only learned about this maybe

156
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:22,073
[SPEAKER_16]: 20, 30 days ago, and it was from a neighbor who was approached by a person who offered money for them to go down their property to put up the pole, which everybody in the neighborhood then started to hear about it.

157
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,535
[SPEAKER_16]: So that then gets me a little concerned.

158
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:31,261
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know Manchester-by-the-Sea and Andover are other communities who are being impacted by this.

159
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:40,106
[SPEAKER_16]: It just seems that Medford is, you know, I hate to say it, but we're the poor relation, and they're going to just kind of barrel it through.

160
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:50,232
[SPEAKER_16]: And the concerns of some of the people that are on vacation that I'm also speaking for, one, of course, is health concerns, because we're not sure what all of this is going to do or be.

161
00:11:52,593 --> 00:12:07,278
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I walked the neighborhood and Saltonstall and Grove Street, right at the bridge that goes over the T line, all the trees have just been, they're bald.

162
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,780
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're moving forward, whether they say they are or not, they have just taken line of sight limbs down.

163
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,481
[SPEAKER_16]: There's mounds of fresh,

164
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,723
[SPEAKER_16]: sawdust from when they took the limbs.

165
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:27,009
[SPEAKER_16]: They put up a meter machine, but they haven't put the meter in yet.

166
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,252
[SPEAKER_16]: They put in a new gate, some new locks.

167
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:34,215
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot going on that nobody else is apparently telling you.

168
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:45,364
[SPEAKER_16]: So from that point of view, if they've taken down all those trees, my question is, if they put up this 70-odd foot pole, are they going to wipe out all the trees that are the only

169
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:53,207
[SPEAKER_16]: small amount of hiding an enormous tree, which is like two telephone poles tall, which is really big.

170
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,047
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you take out all the trees, it's much more obvious.

171
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it a health concern?

172
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:04,569
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's it going to do for the property value of us in that area with this giant pole?

173
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:06,750
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's a question.

174
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So, those are my concerns.

175
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:14,157
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they're going to put up a tree or a pole, can they make it look like a tree?

176
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:19,162
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, some of the highways, you see those poles and they've got all the little limbs coming out of it.

177
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:22,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Can they at least, you know, kind of sort of pretend it isn't what it is?

178
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:26,488
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate your time and looking into this.

179
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:33,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the 30 days all well and good, but I think they're moving forward given all the limbs they've taken down.

180
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:36,375
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's our concern.

181
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:37,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

182
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:38,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

183
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,960
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

184
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:43,335
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not sure.

185
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,436
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

186
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:52,318
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not sure if Councilor Marks or our city solicitor who has been involved with this, thankfully, can give us a little bit more detail with regards to the 30 days.

187
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,439
[SPEAKER_42]: I know- Mr. Rumbly, I see you in the audience here.

188
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,420
[SPEAKER_42]: Would you like to lend us your input?

189
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:03,381
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

190
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,142
[SPEAKER_42]: Kind of like a grand jury, you get a chair.

191
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:23,709
[SPEAKER_22]: There's really, what was just spoken, what was just stated by the citizen, I'm sorry I didn't get your name, is quite accurate, actually.

192
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:34,651
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a 30-day period which the management board of the T has decided to react to the groundswell of opposition, which is coming not only from Medford, but from many different cities and towns.

193
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:39,652
[SPEAKER_22]: And whether or not that will be continued or not, right now, would be a matter of speculation.

194
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:40,892
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know.

195
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:47,514
[SPEAKER_22]: But the points that were being made about property value, about placement, they're all relevant and they're all prudent concerns.

196
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:59,079
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, just to take the last one first, there are poles that are erected at various places around greater Boston that are made to masquerade other things, one of which is a tree.

197
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,640
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be a good idea.

198
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,102
[SPEAKER_22]: But you're not going to get to the good idea unless you have some dialogue with the people whose property it affects.

199
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:10,425
[SPEAKER_22]: The second thing is the placement of the polls.

200
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:18,273
[SPEAKER_22]: As Councilor Marks has stated, they are at least in two residential areas, but there are actually three in Medford.

201
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,194
[SPEAKER_22]: The other one is in the Wellington area.

202
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,436
[SPEAKER_22]: So the placement of the polls, is it

203
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:28,021
[SPEAKER_22]: necessarily so that the places that they've chosen are the best places.

204
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:37,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Are there other places that maybe are not owned by the MTA that might serve the purpose just as well, which wouldn't have the same impact on residential areas?

205
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,732
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are a number of other concerns.

206
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:54,837
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, the initial plan, as I know the council knows and maybe the citizens don't, the initial plans were for poles that were not as high as the 73-foot poles that are presently planned.

207
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,778
[SPEAKER_22]: The original ones were much smaller than that.

208
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:00,239
[SPEAKER_22]: And it begs the question, why was that abandoned?

209
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:16,737
[SPEAKER_22]: So, in the time that the council has generated concerns and questions about this, which they have, and the mayor has also, her communication to the T went out on that very day that Councilor Marks talked about, June 30th.

210
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:27,460
[SPEAKER_22]: With all of the groundswell of opposition to this, there is a necessity for dialogue and conversation, because otherwise, the first statement that was made by the resident is the accurate one.

211
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,903
[SPEAKER_22]: It would seem to be something that's simply being forced on people.

212
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:39,611
[SPEAKER_22]: And something which is forced on people runs against the grain of not only good government, but also courtesy and good citizenship.

213
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:47,338
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's not a lot to report because we're in that window, but I would encourage anyone who has some interest in voicing their

214
00:16:47,838 --> 00:17:06,807
[SPEAKER_22]: opinion or voicing their concerns about this to contact especially the state delegation so that they can also relay that to the officials at the T and that there can be a higher level of communication and dialogue than there has been to date, because that's what's necessary in order for there to be any progress on this issue.

215
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,928
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Mr. Solis.

216
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:16,451
[SPEAKER_44]: Through the chair, you said there is need and they realize the need for a conversation with the neighbors in the city.

217
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:22,019
[SPEAKER_44]: So within that 30-day period, is there any meeting scheduled, or we just don't know yet?

218
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,280
[SPEAKER_22]: There aren't any meetings scheduled in Medford.

219
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,081
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that much.

220
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And that hasn't been for lack of trying.

221
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:37,711
[SPEAKER_22]: This council and the mayor have made, and I have, for the council, made repeated inquiries to the T to have a representative talk to us in any form they'd like.

222
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:41,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Not necessarily at a council meeting, but in any form, if they'd like to come out to Medford.

223
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,195
[SPEAKER_22]: And honestly, the response hasn't been no.

224
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:45,977
[SPEAKER_22]: There's been no response.

225
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:50,078
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to thank the solicitor for listening to our concerns.

226
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:58,385
[SPEAKER_44]: I know he's very busy, but I've seen the dialogue back and forth with you and the TEA, and I've gotten a number of complaints, especially from the Tyler Ave.

227
00:18:00,116 --> 00:18:08,082
[SPEAKER_44]: residents and you know it's a concern of ours and hopefully we can get a seat at the table with our residents to discuss the concerns that they have.

228
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:08,762
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

229
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:09,143
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

230
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:10,003
[SPEAKER_44]: Councilor Knight.

231
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:13,546
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President thank you very much and Mr. Solicitor thank you for being here this evening.

232
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:24,614
[SPEAKER_49]: If you'd be so kind to explain a little bit about the background and why the MBTA has taken the position that local zoning laws won't control the height of the tower and so on.

233
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd be happy to explain that and I know that many of you be

234
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:29,477
[SPEAKER_22]: I was going to say behind the rail.

235
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,237
[SPEAKER_22]: I know what the answer to this is.

236
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:35,419
[SPEAKER_22]: But part of it goes back to a case that came out of Somerville a few years back.

237
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,921
[SPEAKER_22]: If you drive down the 93, you'll see a billboard which is on top of or placed on MBTA property.

238
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:45,142
[SPEAKER_22]: There was objection to that billboard when it was constructed.

239
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:56,006
[SPEAKER_22]: The matter went through court and the courts decided that in that instance that the MBTA on their own property would be exempt from local zoning regulations.

240
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,267
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, that would still be true if they were to build on their own property in Medford.

241
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:08,548
[SPEAKER_22]: However, that denies the issue of whether or not there are better places to put these poles which may not be on MBTA property.

242
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:20,391
[SPEAKER_22]: For example, and I haven't done any homework on this, is there property owned by the City of Medford where it would be better placed as opposed to right along the tracks on MBTA property that could serve the same purpose?

243
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:25,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Because the purpose of these poles is to benefit their ridership with Wi-Fi and all that.

244
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,453
[SPEAKER_22]: But there are other concerns, too.

245
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:31,934
[SPEAKER_22]: And this one is also one that's relevant to the billboard case in Somerville.

246
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:44,939
[SPEAKER_22]: These towers, these towers always have a placement for other companies to put their, I don't know what they're called, radio equipment, wireless equipment on the tower.

247
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,059
[SPEAKER_22]: And they would be doing that for profit.

248
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, that argument came up in the Somerville billboard case, and the opponent said,

249
00:19:54,722 --> 00:20:05,353
[SPEAKER_22]: If the T is going to have a billboard and they're going to make a profit from the billboard, then that should affect negatively, that is, it should affect their ability to have a zoning exemption.

250
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:11,460
[SPEAKER_22]: In other words, if they're going to engage in a for-profit activity, they should lose the benefit of the zoning exemption.

251
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:16,785
[SPEAKER_22]: However, the court said, in so many words, we all know that the T needs money.

252
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,508
[SPEAKER_22]: So, but there's a concern there, too.

253
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:31,197
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, if they were to construct a tower, which maybe looked like a tree or something like that, it would be less onerous if they were selling spots on that to private companies for Wi-Fi purposes.

254
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,059
[SPEAKER_22]: But those are issues that came up in the Somerville case.

255
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,880
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Mox.

256
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,201
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:46,886
[SPEAKER_29]: And the council, as you know, Mr. Solicitor, is currently working on a city ordinance to address the cell tower issue.

258
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:47,226
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

259
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:56,411
[SPEAKER_29]: I agree with you that because the MBTA has their own private property, city ordinance or regulation will have no bearing on what they do on their own property.

260
00:20:56,952 --> 00:21:01,675
[SPEAKER_29]: However, in the community right now, we only regulate TV and radio antennas.

261
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:10,138
[SPEAKER_29]: So, under the city ordinance right now, if someone wanted to erect a cell tower, there are no provisions within our regulations that would govern that.

262
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:27,405
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm hoping that this body, and I know we've already drafted and met with you and so forth, that we put in a regulation that governs cell towers and prohibits them in any area but industrial and commercial zoned areas.

263
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:40,773
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that will go a long way to ensure residents that someday a cell tower won't pop up on private property, could be your next door neighbor, without having some oversight by this government.

264
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:46,337
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know that's hopefully within the next several months will be ordained by this council.

265
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:53,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, and just to speak very briefly on that, this council has brought forth that draft which had been done at a prior time.

266
00:21:53,709 --> 00:22:15,657
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already had one meeting on it, and it would fill a hole which presently exists in our zoning ordinance in a very beneficial way, because without this proposed ordinance, there's a possibility that this same type of concern could rise up in different incarnations throughout other areas of Medford, and this proposed ordinance would go a long way to address that.

267
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:16,932
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

268
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:17,793
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for coming tonight.

269
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:18,954
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

270
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:19,695
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions?

271
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:21,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

272
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place in file.

273
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:25,880
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

274
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,220
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

275
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,363
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

276
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:39,691
[SPEAKER_42]: 17-580, request for an expenditure from the Law Department claims over $1,000 from accounts 1010151572.

277
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:43,995
[SPEAKER_42]: Present members of the Honorable City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

278
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:51,798
[SPEAKER_42]: We have, is the solicitors here, if you could stay while you're here?

279
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,379
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a claimant.

280
00:22:53,819 --> 00:23:02,182
[SPEAKER_42]: Claimant's name is J. Craig and Charity Roddy, file 69, date of accident was June 7th, 2016, date of settlement June 28th, 2017, request 7500.

281
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:04,804
[SPEAKER_42]: And Mr. Clerk, would you like to elaborate on that?

282
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,348
[SPEAKER_22]: Just very briefly, this is a water claim.

283
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,789
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a blockage in the city line.

284
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:24,133
[SPEAKER_22]: It caused some damage to property owned by the claimants on Sylvia Road.

285
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,755
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see that their damages were actually in excess of $7,500.

286
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:33,718
[SPEAKER_22]: That's because there were some elements of what they were claiming which really weren't part of the water claim.

287
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,683
[SPEAKER_22]: The DPW water department went out to quell the rising water.

288
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,645
[SPEAKER_22]: They weren't able to do it at the first manhole that they got to.

289
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:46,488
[SPEAKER_22]: They were at the second, but by that time, substantial damage was done.

290
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:51,592
[SPEAKER_22]: So we reached an accord on a $15,000 claim to settle it for $7,500.

291
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

292
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,355
[SPEAKER_42]: Any more questions for the clerk on this?

293
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:57,497
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, Mr. Clerk.

294
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,858
[SPEAKER_42]: Move approval.

295
00:23:59,018 --> 00:23:59,539
[SPEAKER_42]: Move approval.

296
00:23:59,819 --> 00:23:59,959
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:02,081
[SPEAKER_42]: By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

298

[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:17,791
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,774
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

314
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,417
[SPEAKER_42]: 17-583, to the Honorable President of Medford City Council.

315
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:41,019
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear Mr. President of the City Councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve on the recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee of the Community Preservation Fund Revenue with the amount of $1,428,649.

316
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:56,811
[SPEAKER_42]: In addition, I respectfully request that your honorable body approve the recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, the Community Preservation Fund Expenditures in the amount of $1,428,649.

317
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:01,334
[SPEAKER_42]: Open space, 142,865.

318
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,054
[SPEAKER_42]: Community housing, 142,865.

319
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,075
[SPEAKER_42]: Historic preservation, 142,865.

320
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:04,175
[SPEAKER_42]: Administration, 71,433.

321
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:07,156
[SPEAKER_42]: General remainder of the fund will be 928,621 dollars for a total of 1,428,649.

322
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:07,796
[SPEAKER_42]: Questions?

323
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,510
[SPEAKER_44]: To the chair.

324
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,791
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilwoman, go ahead.

325
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:40,377
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to point out that we did meet in Committee of the Whole this evening to discuss with the commission, the Community Preservation Commission, the details of this.

326
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:50,225
[SPEAKER_44]: I know that a lot of it's formulated through state law, so I don't know if anybody wants to just give a brief synopsis before we take a vote.

327
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,306
[SPEAKER_42]: I think Roberta Cameron's here?

328
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:51,826
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes.

329
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:58,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

330
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:18,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we are asking for this evening is to appropriate the budget for fiscal year FY18, and we are asking for the minimum appropriation to be placed in reserve for each of the program areas.

331
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:24,259
[SPEAKER_05]: That is affordable housing, open space and recreation, and historic preservation.

332
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:42,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And the maximum amount that can be set aside for administrative expenses, which is 5% of the annual revenue, and the remainder to be transferred to the undesignated reserve, that is that it can be spent in any of the program areas.

333
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:50,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And the administrative funds, if they're not used in this fiscal year, will be returned to the program area fund.

334
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:59,014
[SPEAKER_44]: And then, if I could just follow up, I asked in Committee of the Whole, but I think the public would like to know the time frame, so go over it, or you probably have an answer.

335
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:14,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Community Preservation Commission has been meeting now for two months, and we are in the process of preparing a plan that will enable us to know what the needs, opportunities, and priorities are for the city of Medford.

336
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:20,767
[SPEAKER_05]: The planning process entails a significant outreach process.

337
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:31,480
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at visiting approximately 30 boards and commissions and stakeholder groups individually, as well as holding two public forums that will take place in October.

338
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We will provide as much publicity as we can to try to get as much input as we can from the people of Medford about what we would like to see the CPA funds going toward.

339
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:53,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And the community preservation plan is supposed to, we aim to have it completed in November.

340
00:27:54,622 --> 00:28:11,831
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we can begin to set up a grant application process over the winter and be able to receive grants, consider the different options, and provide a set of recommendations for the first funding round in spring next year.

341
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:13,912
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

342
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:15,193
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Scarpelli.

343
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,474
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm also, thank you.

344
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:18,355
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions?

345
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:21,964
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by?

346
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:26,366
[SPEAKER_44]: Just publicly thank the committee for their hard work.

347
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:30,928
[SPEAKER_44]: Meeting every other week for a few months takes a lot from your families and we appreciate it.

348
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:35,611
[SPEAKER_44]: Whether for or against the CPA, you've worked very hard and it doesn't go unnoticed.

349
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:36,411
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

350
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:37,632
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion.

351
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:41,834
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

352
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:42,495
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

353
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:42,875
[SPEAKER_47]: Aye.

354
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,676
[SPEAKER_42]: Roll call is required.

355
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:48,406
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

356
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:48,827
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

357
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:50,288
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

358
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:50,549
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

359
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:51,590
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knight?

360
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,950
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

361
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:53,372
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Long-Term?

362
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:53,672
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

363
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:54,874
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice-President Montz?

364
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:55,194
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

365
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:56,356
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

366
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:56,616
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

367
00:28:57,177 --> 00:28:57,897
[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

368
00:28:57,998 --> 00:28:58,238
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

369
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,541
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

370
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,943
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

371
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,906
[SPEAKER_42]: 17-572, petition for a sign denial.

372
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,247
[SPEAKER_42]: Reversal by Brian.

373
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:21,821
[SPEAKER_42]: Dugdale, Goulston and Sturs for a Methodist Associates LLC, owner of Meadow Glen Mall 3850, Mystic Valley Parkway, OCD Applications, 201710A-201710P, excessive signage number inside.

374
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:25,284
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox, who is the chairman of the signing committee.

375
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:30,184
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, I believe we have the petitioners before us tonight.

376
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:31,024
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe we do.

377
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:33,486
[SPEAKER_29]: If they can give a brief presentation and a synopsis.

378
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address of the record, please.

379
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:35,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly.

380
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,829
[SPEAKER_21]: John Tuig, New England Development, 75 Park Plaza, Boston.

381
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,950
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to speak just for a minute.

382
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Brian Dugdale, who filed the petition, is to my left.

383
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Paul Sincotta from New England Development.

384
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:50,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because of the tightness of the room, we do have a few plans we'll set up.

385
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:53,257
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe I'll just give a very brief overview before we

386
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:59,962
[SPEAKER_42]: We are enforcing the council rules of ten minutes, so if you could keep your time in ten minutes, I'd be appreciative.

387
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:00,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely true.

388
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:01,944
[SPEAKER_21]: We certainly will.

389
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:03,245
[SPEAKER_21]: We're very excited.

390
00:30:03,265 --> 00:30:07,128
[SPEAKER_21]: I think as people know, Medical Inn Mall has been proceeding in redevelopment.

391
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:10,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a little bit of background on the signage.

392
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:12,772
[SPEAKER_21]: We looked at all the signage that was on the mall today.

393
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:18,674
[SPEAKER_21]: We thought about opportunities to be able to keep it within that sort of total square footage.

394
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:26,938
[SPEAKER_21]: The mall is significantly, I think as you know, set back from Locust Street, and it is a corner parcel.

395
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:31,060
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think, Paul, they're motioning for us to bring it up towards the front.

396
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,642
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit of the history, I think everybody knows the council did approve this in the 1970s.

397
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,183
[SPEAKER_21]: We are bringing in a Wegmans and a Dix.

398
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:44,525
[SPEAKER_21]: What our thought would be, would very briefly touch on what the existing mall signage and what we've proposed.

399
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:48,107
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to show it, there are 16 total signs if you have all the tenants.

400
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:58,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Rather than go sign by sign, item by item, we'll never finish in ten minutes, we're going to try to show it to you in a comprehensive way, where the signs are, how the package comes forward.

401
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:05,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Just by a little bit of background, we expect that the Dicks and the Petco will be opening in September and the Wegmans in November of 2017.

402
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:12,012
[SPEAKER_21]: So the picture that you see up there is what we're proposing to show for the Wegmans.

403
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,113
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll see the Dicks on the left, the Coles on the right.

404
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,095
[SPEAKER_21]: And that is our proposed signage.

405
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:24,659
[SPEAKER_21]: And the plan that Paul has underneath him is one of the plans that we filed, which showed actually all of the signs.

406
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,202
[SPEAKER_21]: If you start on the left, the Marshalls sign, the Petco.

407
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:33,145
[SPEAKER_21]: We were before, Mr. President, the council to get the Petco for the use allowed a while back.

408
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,927
[SPEAKER_21]: There's the Dick's next door, the Wegmans sign, and then the Coles.

409
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:43,750
[SPEAKER_21]: And then on the side, on the Parkway side, we have one sign, which is Coles, and then signs for the others.

410
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:50,774
[SPEAKER_21]: But just to give you a sense of how we approach this, the Meadow Glen Mall sign, for example, on the Parkway, is about 1,530 square feet.

411
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:55,097
[SPEAKER_21]: When you add all the signs up that we're putting on that side, we're a little over 400 square feet.

412
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,338
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did approach it with a sensitivity to

413
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:04,705
[SPEAKER_21]: the amount of signage, but also remembering we're anywhere from 250 to 400 feet off of the roadway.

414
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:11,551
[SPEAKER_21]: And these are all signage that are typical for this type of tenant, typical for this type of location.

415
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:14,835
[SPEAKER_21]: And underneath, and Paul's going to run out of hands,

416
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:37,754
[SPEAKER_21]: that he has, but a little bit of the detail where you can see, again, Marshall's on the left, appreciate the fanning, the Petco in the middle, then over to Dick's, the Wegmans sign, and then you can see along the parkway, what Cole's sign exists there today, the Meadow Glen Mall sign will go away, which was a large sign, and then just have some directional signs, because we are in the corner.

417
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:40,414
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's how it is situated.

418
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:41,835
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll stop there.

419
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:50,677
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm certainly available to answer any questions from the council or any of the members or certainly the chairman of the subcommittee.

420
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:52,017
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

421
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:53,457
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Dello Russo.

422
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:54,557
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. President, thank you.

423
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:06,360
[SPEAKER_51]: Are you aware of anybody expressing any opposition to this schema other than that it's in some spots not conforming according to our code?

424
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:06,980
[SPEAKER_42]: We are not.

425
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:09,654
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. President, are you, if I could?

426
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:11,000
[SPEAKER_42]: I am fine with that, Mr. President.

427
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,004
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you, Mr. President.

428
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:24,454
[SPEAKER_44]: With regards to the lighting in, you know, the residence, I guess you're not really hitting any residence, but is there a time frame where the lighting will be shut off?

429
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:31,058
[SPEAKER_21]: It certainly, the advantage we have in this site is because, again, we're anywhere from 250 to 400 feet back off of Locust.

430
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,219
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't really impact residences.

431
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:39,142
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, certainly there are some condominium folks behind us, but they're behind us.

432
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:43,864
[SPEAKER_21]: And the only things we have in the back are a couple of small packet lights at the loading docks.

433
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:50,026
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no signage there, so we are uniquely situated here from a neighborhood perspective.

434
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:54,107
[SPEAKER_21]: We really aren't near residents and certainly not single family or multifamily.

435
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:54,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

436
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:55,788
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

437
00:33:56,508 --> 00:34:01,289
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, I certainly feel comfortable supporting the majority of the signs here this evening.

438
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:05,771
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that this falls in line with some of the work that we've done in the past at the Fellsway Plaza.

439
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:10,312
[SPEAKER_49]: We've approved some signs at the Fellsway Plaza that actually enhanced the way that the

440
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,198
[SPEAKER_49]: And I think that these signs will do the same thing.

441
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:19,551
[SPEAKER_49]: I certainly have no problem with the signs that are advertising particular businesses, Mr. President, but I do have a problem with sign K.

442
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:22,687
[SPEAKER_49]: And Sign K isn't advertising a particular business.

443
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,009
[SPEAKER_49]: Sign K is advertising wine, liquor, and beer.

444
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:33,214
[SPEAKER_49]: It's going to be located directly across the street from our skating rink, directly across the street from Honell Stadium, and directly across the street from the campus of the McGlynn Andrews School.

445
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:42,800
[SPEAKER_49]: So with that being said, I certainly would support this evening approval of the 15 signs, but I myself personally can't support Sign K. It's not something that's advertising a store.

446
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,801
[SPEAKER_49]: It's advertising a product that's sold inside a store.

447
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:49,564
[SPEAKER_49]: And I think that that is really not the intent of our sign bylaw.

448
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:58,108
[SPEAKER_49]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem supporting the 15 other signs, but I'd move for approval of all signs except the sign K at this point in time.

449
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, through you, just to speak to that.

450
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:10,353
[SPEAKER_21]: As you see often in even stop and shop signs, you will see that they'll have five or six signs along which advertise whether it be a bakery, pharmacy, other activities.

451
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:16,296
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the council's aware and certainly gone through licensing that Wegmans does and it's a big part of their business.

452
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:18,938
[SPEAKER_21]: They provide alcohol.

453
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,240
[SPEAKER_21]: It's anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet.

454
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,025
[SPEAKER_21]: They provide at very advantageous prices, and it's a big point in selling the Wegmans experience.

455
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:30,527
[SPEAKER_21]: We do advertise in a store that size.

456
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,749
[SPEAKER_21]: We have over 100,000 square feet.

457
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:39,795
[SPEAKER_21]: The amount of activities and the different offerings, that's why all of the major folks who have that size store do have the smaller size.

458
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,236
[SPEAKER_21]: You have it existing here in Medford.

459
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:44,757
[SPEAKER_21]: We would ask that the council consider that sign.

460
00:35:44,777 --> 00:35:46,118
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a very big part of their business.

461
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,320
[SPEAKER_21]: They have gone through the processing here.

462
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,522
[SPEAKER_21]: For the licensure to have that ability to be able to sell that, so we would ask the council's support on that sign.

463
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly, respectfully, I understand.

464
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:58,563
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand where I'm coming from.

465
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:01,184
[SPEAKER_49]: It doesn't say turkey, steak, and potatoes either, you know what I mean?

466
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,745
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a big part of Wegmans business too.

467
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:05,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely, I understand.

468
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:06,687
[SPEAKER_21]: But I did want you to know that that was a

469
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:13,370
[SPEAKER_21]: a very significant part of what they're doing, and why they do it, and why, for example, if you go to the Stop and Shop here in Bedford, you'll see those signs too.

470
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:17,692
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Chairman?

471
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:26,456
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, past practice would indicate that this be sent to the Subcommittee on Business, Economic Development, and Science.

472
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:36,080
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, if the Council has a problem with one particular sign, I have no problem sending that one particular sign, or if the Council wants to review the entire project.

473
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,726
[SPEAKER_49]: Like I said, I can live with 15 out of the 16 in 30 seconds, but 16 out of the 16, I can't do.

474
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,067
[SPEAKER_49]: So if we want to exclude a particular sign.

475
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:57,002
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would make a recommendation, Mr. President, that all signs be approved except for the sign that indicates beer and wine, and that that sign be sent to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee for further discussion.

476
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:03,500
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, Chairman of the Sine Committee, seconded by?

477
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,781
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

478
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,183
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

479
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,344
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

480
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,004
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

481
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,285
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

482
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,526
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

483
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:15,249
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll send you a notification for that, for the Sine Committee.

484
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,610
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

485
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:16,990
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

486
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,271
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

487
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:25,700
[SPEAKER_42]: 15, 573, petition for signed denial of reversal by Rafael Batista for global health care services.

488
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,923
[SPEAKER_42]: 5 High Street, Medford, OCD application, 2017 9A.

489
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:37,246
[SPEAKER_42]: Number of signs in 2017 9A exceeds allowable number of signs.

490
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:40,987
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox, Chairman of the Signing Committee.

491
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,468
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Mr. President.

492
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,689
[SPEAKER_42]: Is Rafael Batista here tonight?

493
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:45,169
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes, I am.

494
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,309
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, if I could.

495
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,332
[SPEAKER_29]: The Subcommittee of Business, Economic Development, and Science met on Thursday, July 13th at 5 p.m.

496
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:16,258
[SPEAKER_29]: for the purpose of discussing three signed denial petitions, of which one, paper 7-450, was one that was brought up by the committee, and there wasn't a representative there at the time from Global.

497
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:21,001
[SPEAKER_29]: And, um, we ask that we receive this paper and place it on file.

498
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:34,049
[SPEAKER_29]: So, at this time, Mr. President, I would recommend that, uh, this particular paper be sent back to the Business and Economic Development, right, the new one, correct, uh, for review of the, uh, Business and Economic Development and Assignment Committee.

499
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,371
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, Vice President, uh, Councilor De La Ruza.

500
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:40,673
[SPEAKER_51]: On that motion, Mr. President, I'm particularly concerned about this.

501
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:50,339
[SPEAKER_51]: new configuration that seems to be contrary to the hearsay we have received regarding the policy of the landlord.

502
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,325
[SPEAKER_51]: The landlord has never materialized or participated in any of our discussions regarding these signs which are non-conforming.

503
00:38:58,825 --> 00:38:59,686
[SPEAKER_51]: on this property.

504
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:09,053
[SPEAKER_51]: I respectfully request that in addition to the petitioner that the landlord, the person who makes the decisions about that property, be present at the meeting.

505
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:14,517
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clark, could you please note that and have and make sure that he is invited to the next meeting.

506
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:16,018
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by

507
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:21,725
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox, that it be sent to subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

508
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:23,766
[SPEAKER_44]: Before the roll is called, may I ask a question?

509
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:28,569
[SPEAKER_44]: Through the chair, can you tell me when you opened or when you plan on opening?

510
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,251
[SPEAKER_34]: Global Healthcare?

511
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:30,551
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

512
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:35,414
[SPEAKER_34]: Actually, we have Mr. Enoch, he is the owner of Global, he is here with us tonight.

513
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,676
[SPEAKER_34]: They are open right now.

514
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:38,556
[SPEAKER_34]: They are open.

515
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:40,518
[SPEAKER_34]: They are open.

516
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:48,791
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, I feel like they've, just personal opinion, I think they've changed the scheme to make it conform.

517
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,333
[SPEAKER_41]: The landlord has asked not to above that line.

518
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:55,154
[SPEAKER_41]: So we need the landlord.

519
00:39:55,214 --> 00:40:00,357
[SPEAKER_44]: Otherwise I think the signs look good and hopefully we can get this done for the petitioner sooner than later.

520
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:07,082
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Vice President Mock, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

521
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:07,802
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

522
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:08,202
[SPEAKER_46]: Aye.

523
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:08,623
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

524
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:09,803
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

525
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:12,045
[SPEAKER_42]: This has been referred back to the subcommittee.

526
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,187
[SPEAKER_42]: You will be notified of that meeting.

527
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:21,391
[SPEAKER_34]: So we're not allowed to, excuse me, we're not allowed to do the signing yet until we get the meeting, is that correct?

528
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:21,871
[SPEAKER_34]: That's correct.

529
00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:24,212
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

530
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:24,212
17, 576.

531
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:48,864
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear Mr. President, members of the city council, the city of Medford intends to enter into a power purchase agreement with Select Energy Development LLC to purchase the electricity produced by the solar panels that it will install and maintain on the Medford DPW building located at 21 Jane Street.

532
00:40:49,284 --> 00:41:01,453
[SPEAKER_42]: It is the intention of the city to enter into a 20-year agreement, General Laws Chapter 30B, Subchapter 12, that requires city approval for a contract that exceeds three years.

533
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:06,976
[SPEAKER_42]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to the provisions of General Laws,

534
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:14,701
[SPEAKER_42]: Chapter 3RB, subsection 12, approve and authorize the same effort into an agreement with the term of up to 20 years.

535
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Alicia Hunt is here, will be in attendance to answer your questions.

536
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:23,445
[SPEAKER_42]: Earlier this evening, we did have a subcommittee meeting in regards to this.

537
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:25,266
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

538
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia Hunt, 41 Wasson Street, Medford.

539
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:58,862
[SPEAKER_14]: So one thing that was asked earlier this evening that I wanted to make sure we were clear about was I was asked the Consultant was asked how long it would take to construct the project and they answered well It would take about four to five weeks to put the panels on the building But the actual process from the time we sign the contract till it's operational with all the lead time on purchasing the equipment the final designs the engineering

540
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:04,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the installation and all the inspections to operational can be five to six months.

541
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:14,086
[SPEAKER_14]: We had discussed how the current financing was somewhat contingent on it being operational by December 31st.

542
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:26,053
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of our concerns is that we don't want them to be rushing for the installation during the winter months and to be pushing to get this completed at the end of December.

543
00:42:26,093 --> 00:42:27,874
[SPEAKER_14]: We're concerned about safety for workers.

544
00:42:28,414 --> 00:42:41,194
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are very interested in getting everything signed as quickly as possible so that we can get the, we can not be rushing and have people trying to make that deadline during the installation at the end of it.

545
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:42,929
[SPEAKER_14]: in the middle of the winter.

546
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:44,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

547
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:44,970
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. President.

548
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:47,070
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor De La Rosa.

549
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,191
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. President, first I want to apologize for my absence at the Committee of the Whole meeting.

550
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:57,973
[SPEAKER_50]: Obviously, had I been there, some of my questions that I'm going to ask would have been answered.

551
00:42:58,313 --> 00:42:58,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

552
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:00,013
[SPEAKER_51]: If I could, for the chair, to Ms.

553
00:43:00,073 --> 00:43:03,274
[SPEAKER_51]: Hunt, ask, why the 20-year contract?

554
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,474
[SPEAKER_51]: Could you explain that to me?

555
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:08,775
[SPEAKER_51]: Could you explain what or if there is a reason for doing that?

556
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:10,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

557
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:18,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is that 20-year contracts for solar purchase agreements is the industry standard.

558
00:43:18,715 --> 00:43:21,440
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the industry needs in order to

559
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:24,357
[SPEAKER_14]: make their financing on the project work.

560
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:32,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have with me, the city has hired a solar owner's agent, which is a consultant that we hire to advise us on this.

561
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:38,005
[SPEAKER_14]: He's an expert in the industry, so he could actually speak to that in any more detail if that's helpful.

562
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:53,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is Paul Lyons with Zapotec Energy, and he is the consultant that the city has hired to advise us on these matters.

563
00:43:54,481 --> 00:44:03,490
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, these deals are typically structured 20 years because the equipment itself lasts 20, 25 years.

564
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:12,138
[SPEAKER_27]: And you lock in the savings for the electricity cost for the DPW essentially hold it at nine and a half?

565
00:44:12,158 --> 00:44:12,138
9.8.

566
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:12,879
[SPEAKER_14]: 9.8 cents for 20 years.

567
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,317
[SPEAKER_51]: What if the technology changes so rapidly in that field?

568
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:23,679
[SPEAKER_27]: It will change.

569
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,762
[SPEAKER_51]: How does that affect this thing?

570
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the panels will be pretty much the same.

571
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,497
[SPEAKER_27]: That's where most of the work goes.

572
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:35,678
[SPEAKER_27]: The efficiency is around 16, 18% now.

573
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:40,459
[SPEAKER_27]: Some projects I did 18 years ago, the efficiency was around 11%.

574
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:44,940
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's creeping up gradually, but these will work fine for 20 years.

575
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,022
[SPEAKER_27]: The inverters that do the converting, that technology is advancing.

576
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:54,162
[SPEAKER_27]: The inverters that they put in, they will probably,

577
00:44:57,344 --> 00:45:07,470
[SPEAKER_27]: will probably replace in about 10, 12 years and you'll get a better inverter at that point in terms of reliability.

578
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:10,312
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

579
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,553
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Dello Russo, you happy with that answer?

580
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:15,272
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

581
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:16,873
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Lococo.

582
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:18,194
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, through the chair.

583
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:23,358
[SPEAKER_44]: If you could go over, I think it's important with regards to the savings.

584
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:35,648
[SPEAKER_44]: I know it's like 11,800 that we'll be saving the first year, and then if you maybe want to give a synopsis of the overall savings that has been estimated for the full 20 years.

585
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,470
[SPEAKER_44]: I think that's important for the community to know.

586
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,414
[SPEAKER_44]: Most people are for this project, but I think that's an extra bonus of what we could be saving.

587
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:50,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So we pay on approximately 15 cents a kilowatt hour at DPW now.

588
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:54,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And what they are offering us is 9.8 cents a kilowatt hour.

589
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:57,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be the full price.

590
00:45:57,513 --> 00:46:03,495
[SPEAKER_14]: There would be no other electricity charges to National Grid and for the electricity.

591
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:16,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on the amount of electricity, this would cover 100% of the electricity used at the DPW, and so in the first year, the estimated savings is $11,800.

592
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:31,566
[SPEAKER_14]: We have estimates for the full life of it, but I do like to caveat that in that it makes assumptions as to what the price of electricity will be in 20 years, because the way you know your savings is what would you have paid and what are you paying.

593
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:36,488
[SPEAKER_14]: We would lock in 9.8 cents for the 20-year term.

594
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:40,270
[SPEAKER_14]: We assume there would be an increase in electricity over the 20 years.

595
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:49,075
[SPEAKER_14]: There is also a very slight degradation in the panel, so how much electricity that is produced goes down every year a small amount.

596
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:55,058
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a guarantee that on year 20, that will be making no less

597
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:59,699
[SPEAKER_14]: No less than 85, so whatever it's making today, at least 85%.

598
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:04,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they'll make 90 or 95%, but at least 85% is guaranteed.

599
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:09,942
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can't just take 11,800 and multiply by 20.

600
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:12,223
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a lovely number.

601
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:21,106
[SPEAKER_14]: The number that they've come up with, assuming price of electricity increase and the decrease in electricity output is $455,000 over the life of this contract.

602
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:26,302
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

603
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:38,956
[SPEAKER_44]: With regards to, I think it's important just to point out that Select Energy Development LLC, who we're going to be contracting with, has done over 400 projects in Massachusetts.

604
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,456
[SPEAKER_44]: Is he present tonight as well?

605
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,278
[SPEAKER_14]: He was not able to stay.

606
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,941
[SPEAKER_44]: But he was here to answer questions for us at the subcommittee meeting.

607
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:51,082
[SPEAKER_44]: I have solar panels on my house.

608
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:52,103
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm in full support.

609
00:47:52,203 --> 00:48:04,971
[SPEAKER_44]: And I thank you again for the detailed outline of all our other municipal and school buildings that potentially down the road could as well get solar panels to help with energy costs throughout our schools and municipal buildings.

610
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:05,852
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

611
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:06,492
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Falco.

612
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:11,223
Right, so the

613
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:35,833
[SPEAKER_14]: If we sign the contract now, that gives us, there are many steps in part of the process.

614
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:41,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of it is that they will not incur the capital cost of purchasing the panels unless there's a contract in place.

615
00:48:42,258 --> 00:48:44,380
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good business sense.

616
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,983
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's the installation and then the inspections.

617
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:52,006
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are pieces that sort of, they take the amount of time they take.

618
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,931
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's not a short amount of time.

619
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:57,152
[SPEAKER_14]: We also need permissions from the utilities.

620
00:48:57,673 --> 00:49:01,215
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think that we can get to move along fairly quickly.

621
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:11,581
[SPEAKER_14]: We all believe that if we did this now, we could get this complete by the end of December.

622
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:22,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have to smile and thank the building inspectors a lot to get out there before December 31st to get everything inspected and signed off on.

623
00:49:24,288 --> 00:49:29,632
[SPEAKER_14]: We may have to buy them some pizza to make sure they get out there quick.

624
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:32,694
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do think that we can get it done.

625
00:49:33,214 --> 00:49:36,797
[SPEAKER_14]: We would like to not be rushing any more than we are.

626
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:47,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Their financing for this project is based on it being part of the current Massachusetts State Solar Incentive Program, which is well-defined and well-known.

627
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:49,045
[SPEAKER_14]: We know exactly what it is.

628
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:50,406
[SPEAKER_14]: They have financing.

629
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,287
[SPEAKER_14]: They're ready to go on this project.

630
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:10,083
[SPEAKER_14]: There are the financing system in the state, the incentive program is changing, and it is still not certain enough for any company to be willing to give me locked in pricing to do any project, including as good as this one is, next spring.

631
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:17,331
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many companies that have said, we want to do solar on Medford Municipal Buildings.

632
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:27,784
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I asked them for pricing, well, we'll have to wait until the program is fully defined in, we believe it's going to be November.

633
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,341
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight.

634
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:44,210
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it's also important to point out one of the things that was discussed at the Committee of the Whole earlier this evening was the regional bulk purchasing of the electrical load.

635
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:48,914
[SPEAKER_49]: Maybe you can talk a little bit about that and how that had an impact on being able to secure such a low rate.

636
00:50:49,134 --> 00:50:49,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

637
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:54,619
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an excellent rate for electricity for commercial solar.

638
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,562
[SPEAKER_14]: We are a member of Power Options, which is a non-profit

639
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:05,582
[SPEAKER_14]: purchasing cooperative for electricity, natural gas, and solar in the region.

640
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:11,947
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is open to state entities, municipal, other non-profits.

641
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:15,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Tufts University happens to be a member as well and uses their services.

642
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:23,415
[SPEAKER_14]: They did a solicitation for solar, so it is through this very large purchase.

643
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:28,219
[SPEAKER_14]: that Power Options members are making that this good of a rate has gotten.

644
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:36,907
[SPEAKER_14]: The company has informed me directly, as my consultant has also told me, that they would never have given this good of a rate for a one-off project.

645
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,730
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because it is part of a group solicitation.

646
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:41,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So that.

647
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:54,554
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, so it sounds like this past year in our budget hearings we learned that we were able to save about $300,000 in the provision of our electricity to Esquiz by taking over the maintenance of the poles, right?

648
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:55,015
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah.

649
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:58,436
[SPEAKER_49]: And now with the approval of this, we're going to be saving another, what did you say, $422,000?

650
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:03,100
[SPEAKER_49]: That would be over the life of the contract.

651
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:12,949
[SPEAKER_49]: So in the last three months, say, it's almost close to three quarters of a million dollars that we could save on just the cost of electricity by these two boats.

652
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:13,890
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes, within 20 years.

653
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,572
[SPEAKER_49]: It's still the same amount of money.

654
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:16,573
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. President.

655
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:19,636
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. President.

656
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,220
[SPEAKER_42]: You'll have the opportunity to speak.

657
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:29,502
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you.

658
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:30,983
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Scarpelli.

659
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:35,368
[SPEAKER_41]: Again, I thank some of the other points that Ms.

660
00:52:35,388 --> 00:52:39,532
[SPEAKER_41]: Hunt brought up and I appreciate all your hard work because this is the innovation and

661
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:45,446
[SPEAKER_41]: the progress that we see that we need in the progressive community.

662
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:57,142
[SPEAKER_41]: So I think that talking about the carports, I think that that being, when you look at other land use and other community buildings that

663
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,257
[SPEAKER_41]: that spend so much money in electricity.

664
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:13,725
[SPEAKER_41]: I used, in the earlier meeting, we used the ice hockey rink and the money that it costs to run an ice hockey rink or the lit fields and looking at different ways down the line that I know that Alicia's looking for.

665
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:17,268
[SPEAKER_41]: A carport, if you can just quickly just go over there real quick.

666
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:20,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So right, we would very much like to do carports in Medford.

667
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually had this parking lot pointed out to me as one that would be good for solar.

668
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:34,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm also interested in the lot between the McGlynn and Andrews schools because of how close it is to the wind turbine, it would have such great visibility.

669
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:53,728
[SPEAKER_14]: When you do carports, the financing is somewhat different, the incentives are somewhat different, and there is also the construction concerns of the fact that you do have to do very, you have to dig deep holes to put good foundations in so that they don't get

670
00:53:54,188 --> 00:54:00,531
[SPEAKER_14]: blown away with wind shear, the same wind that makes the turbine good, we don't really like on the solar panels.

671
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:05,794
[SPEAKER_14]: That dirt then has to be carted away and has to be tested.

672
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:16,240
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we do have some concerns about where we are comfortable testing soil in Medford, digging out stuff and opening up additional problems.

673
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,503
[SPEAKER_14]: That said, it is something that we are looking at and we're looking for good projects.

674
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:38,997
[SPEAKER_14]: It is hopeful that under the new structure that's coming out, there will be good incentives for carports that will make it worthwhile, that would be better than doing it now, not to mention it's a more complicated project because of those structural issues.

675
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:40,838
[SPEAKER_41]: Again, I just point out the innovation.

676
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:41,939
[SPEAKER_41]: I appreciate the hard work.

677
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:43,520
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been looking into that as well.

678
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:43,880
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

679
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,420
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

680
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:45,841
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

681
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:46,622
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

682
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:48,483
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Marx.

683
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:50,183
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

684
00:54:50,484 --> 00:55:03,010
[SPEAKER_29]: And Alicia, knowing that the DPW building was built several years back with the ability to take on solar, and it's taken us this many years to get to that stage,

685
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:23,272
[SPEAKER_29]: The addition of a new police station, the addition that we just heard with grant funding from the state for a new public library, is that the intent of the city to, when we build these facilities, to build them not just only with the capability of housing solar, but actually building them with the solar.

686
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:27,837
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is something that I have been discussing with the architects of both projects.

687
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I am on the building committees for both projects, or I'm being consulted on both projects.

688
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:44,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And it is simply a matter of, it's not, while I would always advise a homeowner to purchase solar because they can take tax credits, the city cannot take.

689
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:50,098
[SPEAKER_14]: It does not make financial sense for us to purchase it because of the tax credits.

690
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:52,341
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes sense for us to lease it.

691
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:56,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, it is not literally part of the construction project.

692
00:55:56,045 --> 00:56:00,310
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to enter into this separate agreement with somebody to do the solar panels on the roof.

693
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:11,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I would prefer that we have those negotiations and as the construction of the building is completed, we're then coming in and putting the solar panels on top immediately.

694
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:12,974
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my preference.

695
00:56:13,595 --> 00:56:21,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do that through the help of perhaps power options, having the right consulting on board to help with that.

696
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:24,844
[SPEAKER_14]: It would not literally be part of the project because of

697
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,087
[SPEAKER_14]: between contractors.

698
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:32,690
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll want one contractor to close out and then the other to come in and put the solar on the roof.

699
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:38,113
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would like to have those agreements in place and ready to go as those buildings are complete.

700
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:45,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I did actually discuss it with the police chief, I assured him that my putting solar on the building would not delay his opening.

701
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:52,663
[SPEAKER_14]: It would simply come on and offset his electricity once that building is open.

702
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:53,323
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

703
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:00,202
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we just built this facility, there's no air conditioning.

704
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:05,489
[SPEAKER_42]: All the bodies absorb the air conditioning, I don't know if you know how that works.

705
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,450
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the lights.

706
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,451
[SPEAKER_29]: It may be the lights.

707
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:09,594
[SPEAKER_29]: The lights, yeah.

708
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:16,081
[SPEAKER_29]: Alicia, regarding solar farms.

709
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,795
[SPEAKER_29]: I know we mentioned the carports.

710
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:41,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Has there been any discussion regarding solar farms and the ability to use these farms to, I mean, the DPW building is great, but as you know, we're in a large facility, this is the largest facility in the city, and there are a number of other city-owned buildings that solar would be great, and are there any way we can use solar farms?

711
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:54,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So, to be clear, by a solar farm, are you referencing the idea of a whole lot of ground mount solar that's like next to the building, or are you talking about just larger arrays on the buildings?

712
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,590
[SPEAKER_29]: Either or.

713
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:00,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we definitely want to do larger arrays on the buildings.

714
00:58:00,372 --> 00:58:07,235
[SPEAKER_14]: The roofs of the schools need, they're 17 year roofs, 17 year old roofs.

715
00:58:07,415 --> 00:58:08,316
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had some,

716
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:16,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Consultants looking at them and you need to have a roof that's good for 20 years before you put solar on it.

717
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:19,927
[SPEAKER_14]: The current roofs need to be replaced before we can put solar on it.

718
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:23,270
[SPEAKER_14]: That is an active project in the city.

719
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:27,475
[SPEAKER_14]: The facilities director for the schools and I are meeting with a consultant on that tomorrow actually.

720
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:30,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we need to do the roofs.

721
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:34,453
[SPEAKER_14]: It is our hope to then follow that with solar as soon as the roofs are ready.

722
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:40,077
[SPEAKER_14]: We, however, will need refreshed proposals and new pricing.

723
00:58:40,738 --> 00:58:44,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Power options will have new pricing once the new incentive structure is in place.

724
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:46,883
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we'll need to look at that.

725
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:55,048
[SPEAKER_14]: For ground mount solar, it's either a carport and then you have sort of the structural concerns and the passing and we're looking at what parking lots work.

726
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:59,190
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have room for what is technically considered a solar farm in Medford.

727
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:10,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Typically, and correct me if I'm wrong on this, but that's a whole bunch of ground mount that is surrounded by a fence and that land is not used for anything else.

728
00:59:10,752 --> 00:59:16,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't have open space in Medford that we are willing to give up for just solar.

729
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:22,157
[SPEAKER_14]: We need the ball field space, the soccer fields, the woods.

730
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:25,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So there isn't that kind of open space in the city.

731
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:26,619
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

732
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:27,320
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

733
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,540
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

734
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,722
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have anybody that, did you want to speak?

735
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:36,904
[SPEAKER_42]: Alicia, thank you very much.

736
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:51,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for letting me speak.

737
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

738
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:54,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Jean Neuzil, 35 Parris Street.

739
00:59:56,085 --> 01:00:08,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So while I think solar is a wonderful thing and renewable energy is great, I take exception with having an argument that we're going to save $455,000 by spending $600,000.

740
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:09,356
[SPEAKER_17]: I take umbrage with that.

741
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,942
[SPEAKER_41]: Right, but I don't have information Gina.

742
01:00:18,003 --> 01:00:18,643
[SPEAKER_41]: I just saw you.

743
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:20,144
[SPEAKER_41]: We're not spending anything.

744
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:22,987
[SPEAKER_41]: They are occurring all of the cost Who is they?

745
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:27,691
[SPEAKER_17]: 600 thousand dollars outweighed by whom they get the tax benefits the city couldn't so we're contracting through them and

746
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:36,398
[SPEAKER_44]: We get the savings.

747
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:38,460
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a 20-year contract.

748
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,542
[SPEAKER_17]: And how do we arrive at $455,000?

749
01:00:41,383 --> 01:00:44,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that because of the energy that we're not going to have to buy?

750
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:47,108
[SPEAKER_41]: Because of the rate we're going to...

751
01:00:50,696 --> 01:00:52,558
[SPEAKER_42]: That number may vary a little bit.

752
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:55,101
[SPEAKER_44]: That calculates the increase as well.

753
01:00:55,562 --> 01:00:56,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

754
01:00:56,442 --> 01:01:01,488
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're saying we're going to save $11,000 a month.

755
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:02,088
[SPEAKER_44]: $11,800 the first year.

756
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,009
[SPEAKER_17]: For the first year.

757
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Because instead of spending how much per kilowatt hour?

758
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:08,315
[SPEAKER_17]: 15 cents.

759
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:09,436
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to spend 9.8. 9.8.

760
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:19,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The solar company is buying on our behalf and we're contracting them.

761
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:23,028
[SPEAKER_17]: They will offset the $600,000 by the tax credit.

762
01:01:23,348 --> 01:01:25,250
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's zero out of pocket for us.

763
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:25,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

764
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:25,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

765
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:25,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

766
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,951
[SPEAKER_46]: Appreciate that.

767
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:27,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

768
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:34,690
[SPEAKER_48]: Well, we have one more resident in.

769
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,431
[SPEAKER_32]: Name and address of the record, please.

770
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:37,671
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

771
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:40,552
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

772
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:44,054
[SPEAKER_32]: I just have one question through the chair.

773
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:50,096
[SPEAKER_32]: That fixed rate that's being offered per kilowatt hour, is that locked?

774
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:54,558
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, what happens if something comes up in the future where they could get a lower rate?

775
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,259
[SPEAKER_32]: Could we opt for the lower rate?

776
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,359
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:58,620
[SPEAKER_32]: Ms.

778
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,420
[SPEAKER_32]: Hunter, could you answer that?

779
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:09,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So the 9.8 cents is locked in for the life of the contract.

780
01:02:10,038 --> 01:02:18,203
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't raise the rate because they suddenly have higher expenses and we can't lower the rate because we could have gotten a better deal somewhere else.

781
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:18,984
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

782
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,366
[SPEAKER_42]: On the questions.

783
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:29,211
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion approved by Councilor Lococo and seconded by Councilor Falco.

784
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,172
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

785
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:30,752
[SPEAKER_38]: Aye.

786
01:02:31,172 --> 01:02:31,873
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

787
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:36,051
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

788
01:02:36,071 --> 01:02:36,051
17, 577.

789
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:59,220
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear Mr. President, city council members, I respectfully request or recommend that your Honorable body approve the following home rule petition to be sent to the general court to allow the licensing committee, commission of the city of Medford to grant licenses for sale of alcohol at Chevalier Theater to an entity that operates the theater by way of a contract lease or other agreement with the city of Medford.

790
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,328
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, motion to waive the additional reading and have a brief synopsis by the city solicitor representative of the administration.

791
01:03:04,568 --> 01:03:04,929
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

792
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,651
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knight to waive.

793
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,296
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councilor Del Rose.

794
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:10,077
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor, aye.

795
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:12,521
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Solicitor, could you please give a brief synopsis, please?

796
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:16,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

797
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,583
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't get my address.

798
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:21,586
[SPEAKER_22]: Mark Rumley, City Solicitor, 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

799
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:28,954
[SPEAKER_22]: As the Council knows, the City crafted an RFP for Chevalier Auditorium a few months back.

800
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:39,161
[SPEAKER_22]: And there have been a couple of responses to that RFP that are presently in the process of being fully reviewed and recommendations made to the mayor.

801
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:46,504
[SPEAKER_22]: In any event, one of the things that's come up is the benefit that Chevalier Auditorium would have if there were a single

802
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:50,126
[SPEAKER_22]: liquor license that applied to Chevalier.

803
01:03:50,666 --> 01:04:07,438
[SPEAKER_22]: What occurs right now is that when the Chevalier Commission books an event, generally speaking, if that event wants to offer alcohol to its patrons, it will apply for a one-day license before the Liquor Commission, and it's done on a singular basis.

804
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:27,483
[SPEAKER_22]: If we had a management company under contract with the city to manage Chevalier and Axe and all the rest, it would be very wise to have a liquor license available for them to receive on their application to the licensing commission.

805
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:32,645
[SPEAKER_22]: So really what it would do is to make it singular, but only for that building.

806
01:04:33,685 --> 01:04:42,592
[SPEAKER_22]: It wouldn't be a liquor license that could be used anywhere else and could only be used by the entity that was designated by the city as the manager for that auditorium.

807
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,513
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the purpose of this.

808
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:56,021
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition, there's language in this home rule petition that deals with common vigilance license because as this council knows better than any other body, there are steps to get a common vigilance license that brings a petitioner to you.

809
01:04:56,802 --> 01:05:06,424
[SPEAKER_22]: it would be efficient and economical for a manager to be able to receive from the licensing commission, if they get a liquor license, also a common vitualist license.

810
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:11,765
[SPEAKER_22]: That way, if there was any type of food that was going to be offered to patrons, it can all be done at once.

811
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:21,607
[SPEAKER_22]: And the wisdom of that is that they wouldn't have to break the petitioning process to go to the licensing commission for a liquor license and then to the city council for

812
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:23,527
[SPEAKER_22]: a common vigilance license.

813
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:36,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, analyzing this in the most conservative way, if the manager wasn't a good manager, whatever it is, and we wanted to revoke their agreement, then the liquor license and the common vigilance license would be revoked at the same time.

814
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,551
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's a much more swift and economical way to go.

815
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:43,753
[SPEAKER_22]: And the council understands what a home rule petition is.

816
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:48,514
[SPEAKER_22]: If you pass this, it would go to the state legislature for its action.

817
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:49,274
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

818
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:50,407
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

819
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,088
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, I think this is a step in the right direction.

820
01:05:53,749 --> 01:06:04,094
[SPEAKER_49]: It's another really building block to the long-term success of the Chevalier Theater and also helping revitalize Medford Square and, you know, kind of bringing Chevalier Auditorium up with the times.

821
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:10,436
[SPEAKER_49]: You know, you go to the Somerville Theater in Arlington, both of those theaters over there have the ability to serve alcoholic beverages on premises.

822
01:06:10,617 --> 01:06:13,578
[SPEAKER_49]: And in order for us to compete, I think that this is something we need to do.

823
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:15,239
[SPEAKER_49]: I support it wholeheartedly and I move for approval.

824
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:15,759
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

825
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,820
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Knight for approval.

826
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:20,034
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox.

827
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,995
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. Solicitor, was this supported by the Chevalier Commission?

828
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:24,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, as a matter of fact.

829
01:06:25,256 --> 01:06:34,239
[SPEAKER_22]: I did give the language of this to the head of the Licensing Commission, but the members of the Chevalier Commission were on the evaluation team, and there are three.

830
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:41,822
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't speak for all of them, but I'm very confident in saying that they are in favor of this license and this Home Rule petition.

831
01:06:42,482 --> 01:06:46,524
[SPEAKER_29]: And also, it's my understanding a new management company will be on board.

832
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:49,045
[SPEAKER_29]: Shortly, is that your understanding also?

833
01:06:49,366 --> 01:06:52,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, the use of the word shortly is always a very treacherous.

834
01:06:54,489 --> 01:07:03,476
[SPEAKER_22]: But the reason I say that is there hasn't been a, the committee hasn't made a final recommendation to the mayor, although there are only two, not only, but there are two good proposes.

835
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:12,362
[SPEAKER_22]: And when that recommendation is finally made to the mayor and then she makes a determination as to which one, then it'll move forward.

836
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:15,464
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope that it's shortly also, Councilman.

837
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:16,145
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

838
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:20,806
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

839
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:22,607
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

840
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:26,928
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

841
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:27,168
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

842
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:28,528
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

843
01:07:28,568 --> 01:07:28,648
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

844
01:07:29,288 --> 01:07:29,788
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knight?

845
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:30,088
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

846
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:31,369
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Lonen-Kern?

847
01:07:31,409 --> 01:07:31,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

848
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:32,989
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Marks?

849
01:07:33,089 --> 01:07:33,409
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

850
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:34,570
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

851
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:34,870
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

852
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,290
[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

853
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,730
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

854
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:38,891
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

855
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:39,691
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

856
01:07:39,711 --> 01:07:41,291
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Mr. President.

857
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:41,291
17, 578.

858
01:07:41,911 --> 01:07:43,772
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear Mr. President and members of the City Council,

859
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,596
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a brief synopsis by the State Solicitor.

860
01:07:47,676 --> 01:07:52,042
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Solicitor, if you could please give a brief synopsis on this one also.

861
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:53,463
[SPEAKER_22]: 578 is, yes.

862
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:57,008
[SPEAKER_22]: This is kind of a cousin to the Home Rule petition, and it's this.

863
01:07:57,749 --> 01:08:02,234
[SPEAKER_22]: As I just said, we have two responders to the RFP that was crafted by the city.

864
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:12,245
[SPEAKER_22]: And it just so happens that both responders said that they would prefer a five-year contract initially.

865
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:21,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, as you just heard with solar panels, there's a requirement that the city council approve any term which is longer than three years on a lease or an agreement.

866
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:24,278
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's the purpose of this being before you tonight.

867
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:26,473
[SPEAKER_42]: Questions for the solicitor?

868
01:08:26,913 --> 01:08:27,373
[SPEAKER_42]: Move approval.

869
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:29,654
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Nathan, move approval.

870
01:08:29,674 --> 01:08:30,054
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

871
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:31,934
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox.

872
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:37,595
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think it's appropriate to point out the good work that was done by members of the commission.

873
01:08:38,355 --> 01:08:50,417
[SPEAKER_29]: They did appoint an evaluation team made up of John Costas, Mike Oliver, John Veneziano, Allie Fisk from the Mayor's Office, Ann Marie Irwin from the Mayor's Office, and City Solicitor Rumley.

874
01:08:50,777 --> 01:08:52,378
[SPEAKER_29]: So I appreciate their due diligence.

875
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,698
[SPEAKER_42]: This is what the people have been asking for.

876
01:08:53,718 --> 01:08:54,258
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Councilor.

877
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:54,558
[SPEAKER_42]: Great job.

878
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:57,102
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you Mr. President.

879
01:08:57,142 --> 01:08:57,482
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

880
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:01,127
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record please.

881
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:07,276
[SPEAKER_56]: John Costas, 25 Salem Street, president of the Chevalier Commission.

882
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:14,014
[SPEAKER_56]: I kind of wrote this down so I could be brief, and I thought it was going to be at City Hall, so I'm just going to read it.

883
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,758
[SPEAKER_56]: When I was 23, I stood in this very spot.

884
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:19,600
[SPEAKER_56]: Well, it wasn't this very spot.

885
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,666
[SPEAKER_56]: It was that very spot, requesting the City Council save Chevalier Auditorium.

886
01:09:25,367 --> 01:09:31,229
[SPEAKER_56]: And if you asked me then, at that time, would I be standing here almost 40 years later, I would have laughed.

887
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:32,669
[SPEAKER_56]: It's amazing.

888
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:41,933
[SPEAKER_56]: In the fall of 1980, the City Council gave Chevalier its first major milestone by voting to retain Chevalier Theatre and GMAC Gymnasium.

889
01:09:42,773 --> 01:09:45,954
[SPEAKER_56]: And now it's before you again for another major milestone.

890
01:09:46,794 --> 01:09:51,456
[SPEAKER_56]: This vote will move Chevalier to its rightful place as a professional performing arts center.

891
01:09:52,527 --> 01:10:06,630
[SPEAKER_56]: In the last 40 years, the Chevalier Commission has invested hundreds of thousands of hours and has executed over $3 million in the restoration of Chevalier Theater to create a first-class facility that will be attracted to professional management company.

892
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:08,470
[SPEAKER_56]: We have met our goal.

893
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:20,033
[SPEAKER_56]: This decision will have a tremendous economic impact on Medford Square, not to mention the millions of dollars of revenue that will be generated from the meal and hotel tax that will benefit the taxpayers.

894
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,450
[SPEAKER_56]: And here's the important part.

895
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:32,495
[SPEAKER_56]: It is unfortunate that some of the key players that made this possible, like General Dean Grandy and Dick Ober, are no longer with us to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

896
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:37,157
[SPEAKER_56]: Approving this paper would be one of the biggest things that could happen to the Chevalier Theater.

897
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:38,017
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

898
01:10:38,077 --> 01:10:38,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

899
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:39,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

900
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,319
[SPEAKER_42]: On to motion by Councilor Knight.

901
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,200
[SPEAKER_42]: Roll call.

902
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,480
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, excuse me.

903
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:47,922
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

904
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Jean Neuzil, 35 Parr Street.

905
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I just want to take a moment.

906
01:10:52,806 --> 01:11:05,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I can remember being a young girl, and John and Dick, when we were working on one of the shows for the Mystic Players, brought us young folks in there, and it was nothing like what it is now.

907
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:10,439
[SPEAKER_17]: It was loaded with mold and dust and debris.

908
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing worked right.

909
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:17,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Rat droppings everywhere, and they stood us in the middle of the stage.

910
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,346
[SPEAKER_17]: and they told us their vision.

911
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:24,909
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just think that where they've brought it, I think they should be acknowledged for that.

912
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:35,935
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope and trust that they will pick the right representative to really bring breath back into this theater because it really is a gem for the industry.

913
01:11:35,995 --> 01:11:41,618
[SPEAKER_17]: So, just wanted to let people know that my observations way back then and how far it's come.

914
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:42,538
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

915
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:46,942
[SPEAKER_42]: On to motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

916
01:11:48,023 --> 01:11:48,383
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry.

917
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:50,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

918
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:51,566
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

919
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:53,708
[SPEAKER_19]: May Markybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave.

920
01:11:54,989 --> 01:11:57,110
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be very, very brief.

921
01:11:58,572 --> 01:11:59,452
[SPEAKER_19]: In 1946, Irving Perlman.

922
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:04,737
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know that was a joke. 1946.

923
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:16,989
[SPEAKER_19]: Irving Berlin wrote music for Annie Get Your Gun.

924
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,434
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure a lot of you have seen that production.

925
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:21,716
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been very, very popular.

926
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,522
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was a song there called There's No Business Like Show Business.

927
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:33,145
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I just wanted to say, mention that, because the words go something like this.

928
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:35,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to sing it because I don't want to interrupt you.

929
01:12:35,406 --> 01:12:36,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on, you can sing it.

930
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:37,468
[SPEAKER_19]: No, please.

931
01:12:37,488 --> 01:12:41,330
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no business like show business, like no business I know.

932
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:43,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything about it is appealing.

933
01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:45,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything that traffic will allow.

934
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:50,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Nowhere can you get that happy feeling when you're stealing that extra bow.

935
01:12:51,197 --> 01:12:56,881
[SPEAKER_19]: So my message to the council tonight is, first of all, thank you for the many times you have supported Chevalier.

936
01:12:57,281 --> 01:13:03,845
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to compliment the Chevalier Commission, the Friends of Chevalier, all the volunteers who have gotten us to this point tonight.

937
01:13:04,586 --> 01:13:11,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And my message is the ending of this song, which says, let's go on with the show.

938
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:12,691
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

939
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:19,243
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Falco.

940
01:13:19,803 --> 01:13:21,064
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

941
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:23,306
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

942
01:13:23,346 --> 01:13:23,586
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

943
01:13:24,027 --> 01:13:24,727
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

944
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:24,907
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

945
01:13:25,388 --> 01:13:25,928
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knights?

946
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:26,169
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

947
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:27,430
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Long-Term?

948
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:27,690
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

949
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:28,951
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Marks?

950
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:29,211
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

951
01:13:29,692 --> 01:13:30,412
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scottville?

952
01:13:30,432 --> 01:13:30,672
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

953
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:31,833
[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

954
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:32,234
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

955
01:13:32,854 --> 01:13:34,536
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

956
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:35,657
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

957
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:36,317
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

958
01:13:36,337 --> 01:13:36,357
[SPEAKER_42]: 17-579.

959
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:45,819
[SPEAKER_42]: Premier Stephanie and Burke, licensing of food trucks.

960
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:54,090
[SPEAKER_42]: Dear President Caraviello and members of City Council, this past April, City Council approved food trucks at 10 various events that have.

961
01:13:57,853 --> 01:14:04,219
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, basically, at the beginning of the year we allowed food trucks to come to various events.

962
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:11,765
[SPEAKER_42]: We now have another one that would like to come to a couple of events in August, September, and October.

963
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:15,168
[SPEAKER_42]: And we need approval to allow them to come.

964
01:14:15,989 --> 01:14:16,870
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion, aye.

965
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:16,950
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

966
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:17,790
[SPEAKER_44]: Second?

967
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:19,832
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

968
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,820
[SPEAKER_32]: Name and address of the record, please.

969
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,001
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

970
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:25,921
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

971
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:37,504
[SPEAKER_32]: I would just respectfully ask through the chair that the Board of Health look into this, because there was just a report in the news that in Boston, many trucks were in violation of health codes.

972
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:38,144
[SPEAKER_32]: So please keep that in mind.

973
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:39,944
[SPEAKER_42]: Board of Health inspects all the trucks before they come.

974
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:41,205
[SPEAKER_42]: Excellent, thank you, Mr. President.

975
01:14:41,225 --> 01:14:41,825
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

976
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:44,506
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by?

977
01:14:44,966 --> 01:14:45,266
[SPEAKER_41]: Second.

978

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1133
01:24:25,912 --> 01:24:28,313
[SPEAKER_54]: Greg Gallinopoulos, 24 Marston Street, Medford.

1134
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:28,913
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1135
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:32,835
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyone else in opposition?

1136
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,796
[SPEAKER_55]: Michael Lewis, 133 Pine Ridge Road.

1137
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:36,817
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1138
01:24:38,357 --> 01:24:39,858
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have anyone else in opposition?

1139
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,159
[SPEAKER_42]: Please step forward.

1140
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:48,622
[SPEAKER_58]: Sheila Grant, 92 High Street, Medford.

1141
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:49,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1142
01:24:49,683 --> 01:24:55,887
[SPEAKER_42]: And last call, anyone else in opposition here in the other room?

1143
01:24:56,148 --> 01:24:56,468
[SPEAKER_42]: Hold on.

1144
01:25:02,312 --> 01:25:04,253
[SPEAKER_57]: Colleen Ray, 358 Broadway, Lynn.

1145
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:05,454
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1146
01:25:12,839 --> 01:25:14,740
[SPEAKER_32]: Collin McGowan, 173 Medford Street.

1147
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:15,830
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1148
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:17,351
[SPEAKER_42]: Last call.

1149
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,652
[SPEAKER_42]: Any that are speaking that are not in favor?

1150
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:24,133
[SPEAKER_42]: At this point, we'll close that part of the meeting.

1151
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:26,294
[SPEAKER_42]: And we'll open it up for discussion.

1152
01:25:26,314 --> 01:25:27,395
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1153
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,055
[SPEAKER_42]: City Clerk Flynn, we request permission to hand out to City Council.

1154
01:25:29,075 --> 01:25:36,098
[SPEAKER_42]: Would that be okay?

1155
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:36,438
[SPEAKER_42]: That's fine.

1156
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:50,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Anybody in the audience?

1157
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,840
Thank you, Larry.

1158
01:26:13,656 --> 01:26:15,136
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, thank you.

1159
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:20,018
[SPEAKER_42]: If I could remind you that the ten minute rule is in effect.

1160
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:20,998
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

1161
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:21,919
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

1162
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:23,799
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record please.

1163
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:26,520
[SPEAKER_26]: Michelle Legler, 21 Inglewood Road, Winchester.

1164
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,881
[SPEAKER_42]: Nick Cavazzo, 74A Pleasant Street.

1165
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:29,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1166
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:33,142
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you Mr. President Caraviello for allowing us to be here this evening.

1167
01:26:33,582 --> 01:26:37,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Before we get started, please allow me to start with a personal message.

1168
01:26:37,808 --> 01:26:39,770
[SPEAKER_26]: This process has not been an easy one.

1169
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:45,537
[SPEAKER_26]: It has been a tremendous learning experience filled with both immense joy as well as huge regrets.

1170
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,241
[SPEAKER_26]: And given the chance again, there are many things we would like to do over.

1171
01:26:49,982 --> 01:26:53,104
[SPEAKER_26]: This is our first time entering the business foray.

1172
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:59,768
[SPEAKER_26]: For me personally, I'm a cancer researcher, and as you may have heard, last week we did something really stupid.

1173
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:05,512
[SPEAKER_26]: We sent an email to a few select officials that were worded very dumbly, and for that we apologize.

1174
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:18,975
[SPEAKER_26]: For having said that, we'd like to get to business at hand here because we are very excited to be able to present to you our plans for the doggie daycare so you and the rest of City Council can actually make informed decisions based on the facts.

1175
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:26,876
[SPEAKER_26]: As mentioned, we are Michelle Legler and Nick Cavazos and we own the premier dog walking and pet city company called Dogs for Days.

1176
01:27:27,436 --> 01:27:35,738
[SPEAKER_26]: We are a unique and personalized dog walking company whose sole mission is to provide peace of mind for our clients by allowing dogs to be themselves and have a blast.

1177
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:40,522
[SPEAKER_26]: We offer a range of services from walks to runs, hikes, playgroups, and boarding.

1178
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:46,566
[SPEAKER_26]: At Dogs for Days, we seriously love dogs as if they were our own and would do absolutely anything for them.

1179
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:53,192
[SPEAKER_26]: This isn't just a job for us, it's a complete way of life that we love every single day and we feel blessed to be able to do it.

1180
01:27:53,952 --> 01:28:05,624
[SPEAKER_26]: If you couldn't tell, we are truly passionate animal lovers, and collectively we have over 10 years of animal handling experience with over 100 clients both here in Medford and surrounding neighbors who trust us daily with their fur babies.

1181
01:28:06,284 --> 01:28:14,432
[SPEAKER_26]: It is our goal and deepest desire to be the great state of Medford's provider for not only doggy daycare, but training, overnight boarding, and bathing as well.

1182
01:28:15,353 --> 01:28:16,734
[SPEAKER_26]: Why Medford, you might be thinking.

1183
01:28:17,294 --> 01:28:19,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford, as we know, is a truly beautiful city.

1184
01:28:19,915 --> 01:28:21,236
[SPEAKER_26]: It has a long, rich history.

1185
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:24,958
[SPEAKER_26]: It has the Middlesex Bells, and of course, Jingle Bells was written here.

1186
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:37,284
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford is also home to over 10,000 registered dogs, with an additional 400 to 600 dogs registering each year who desperately want and need a place somewhere close to home to send their fur babies to.

1187
01:28:38,024 --> 01:28:43,487
[SPEAKER_26]: Likewise, given the many people who are moving here daily, they are demanding this type of business be available to them.

1188
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:58,210
[SPEAKER_26]: Due to Medford's zoning ordinances, the available locations for us to choose from are severely limited, but we have actually identified a perfect location as it meets all zoning requirements according to the Code of Ordinance for the City of Medford.

1189
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:05,212
[SPEAKER_26]: If you refer to map one that's being held up right here, the vast majority of Medford is zoned to allow for residencies.

1190
01:29:05,772 --> 01:29:10,153
[SPEAKER_26]: The residential districts are marked clearly in yellow and orange on the official zoning map.

1191
01:29:10,873 --> 01:29:13,474
[SPEAKER_26]: Only a small percentage of land is zoned industrial.

1192
01:29:14,394 --> 01:29:16,635
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford has two main industrial districts.

1193
01:29:17,115 --> 01:29:27,538
[SPEAKER_26]: Both are located on either side of the Wellington Circle, plus there are very few small already impacted streets in those neighborhoods scattered here and there, which regrettably will not work for us.

1194
01:29:27,878 --> 01:29:29,979
[SPEAKER_26]: They are marked in the purple zones on this map.

1195
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:37,901
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, the industrial district in the far corner is taken up by Wellington's T Station, so that land is completely out of the question.

1196
01:29:38,381 --> 01:29:43,143
[SPEAKER_26]: So we are left with only one small section of the purple zone area to place our daycare.

1197
01:29:43,883 --> 01:29:49,308
[SPEAKER_26]: We have worked hard with the buildings department to identify the perfect location that is in an industrial area.

1198
01:29:49,948 --> 01:30:02,639
[SPEAKER_26]: If you refer to map 2, you will see that our building at 29 Linden Street is in a very industrial area and is surrounded by several construction companies, auto body shops, and other industrial type companies.

1199
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:23,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Given that this is an established industrial district already, which contains the normal day-to-day operations that come with such industry, such as large traffic, truck traffic, huge equipment being moved around, and the beeping of vehicles backing up, all the noises and smells associated with industrial equipment and even excessive leaf blowers can be heard at all hours.

1200
01:30:24,637 --> 01:30:28,340
[SPEAKER_26]: You can see on map three what the area actually looks like.

1201
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:40,625
[SPEAKER_26]: I would like to bring to your attention that there are three apartment buildings on Locust Street in the industrial zoned area that received a special permit to be constructed inside this zone.

1202
01:30:41,205 --> 01:30:52,148
[SPEAKER_26]: However, it should also be noted that they were constructed right next to a large construction company which operates heavy machinery, as can be seen in the street view, the brown buildings next to those construction companies.

1203
01:30:52,828 --> 01:31:00,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Dogs for Days chose 29 Linden Street because it is the only suitable property available for our business and is an industrial zoned district.

1204
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:19,423
[SPEAKER_26]: We plan to operate a business that is in high demand for the city of Medford, one in which many of our constituents have expressed a great interest in, and quite frankly, given the numerous and expensive apartment buildings and condos that are going up in and around the city, they're expecting this type of service to be available to them in the city they're moving to.

1205
01:31:19,983 --> 01:31:22,725
[SPEAKER_26]: Now let me have Nick tell you about our building and our plans for it.

1206
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:26,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Here at Dogs for Days, we're very caring and respectful people.

1207
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,790
[SPEAKER_07]: This not only covers how we feel about the dogs, but our neighbors as well.

1208
01:31:30,673 --> 01:31:36,042
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not want to be the noise and smell infested business some may fear will come with bringing a doggy daycare in the neighborhood.

1209
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:39,087
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, I refer you to the renderings of our new building.

1210
01:31:42,218 --> 01:31:45,760
[SPEAKER_07]: as we are very proud of the state-of-the-art design we have put together.

1211
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:50,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also like to note that all of our work has and will be performed by local Medford companies.

1212
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:55,807
[SPEAKER_07]: The building itself requires very minimal time frame for construction, only taking two to three months.

1213
01:31:56,387 --> 01:32:04,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Our contractor will be erecting the additional fencing, knocking down a few walls inside, installing dog washing tubs, and laying down the flooring needed for the dogs.

1214
01:32:04,672 --> 01:32:10,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have K9 Grass, the only company who strictly specializes in dog turf, install our turf in the play area.

1215
01:32:10,944 --> 01:32:14,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it is complete, as you can see in our rendering, it'll look absolutely amazing.

1216
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:18,425
[SPEAKER_07]: However, let's spend some time addressing the potential annoyance to our neighbors.

1217
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:26,850
[SPEAKER_07]: In regard to light, we will be installing our outdoor lighting below fence height facing downwards as not to disturb any of the neighbors and will not be used late into the evening.

1218
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:36,436
[SPEAKER_07]: We have spent a considerable amount of time and research on soundproofing plans, and after speaking with experts who have performed these services on other daycares, we have come up with a great plan.

1219
01:32:37,116 --> 01:32:45,361
[SPEAKER_07]: We've hired New England Soundproofing to install their high-quality reverb material inside that has a noise reduction rating of 1, which is the highest rating you can have.

1220
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: They have installed this soundproofing in other daycares in Burlington, Woburn, and Waltham, all of which have had no complaints from neighbors since the installation.

1221
01:32:54,285 --> 01:33:03,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We already have an 8-foot chain-link fence with privacy slats and will also be erecting an additional 8-foot vinyl fence within the currently existing one to double up on sound reduction.

1222
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:08,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The inner fence will be draped with mass-loaded vinyl, a heavy-duty outdoor soundproofing material.

1223
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:14,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Having two non-see-through fences with soundproofing material filled in between them will create a state-of-the-art sound barrier.

1224
01:33:15,152 --> 01:33:19,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from being a great sound barrier, our fencing will also help prevent dogs from escaping.

1225
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:24,557
[SPEAKER_07]: We have two gates making up our vehicle bay, as well as our electronic gate system in the front of the property.

1226
01:33:25,838 --> 01:33:29,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The ASPCA guideline suggests a one to 15 human to dog ratio.

1227
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:36,386
[SPEAKER_07]: To help with noise reduction, we've decided on a one to 10 ratio to make sure all the dogs are kept happy and have ample room.

1228
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:40,529
[SPEAKER_07]: ASPCA guideline also suggests 75 square feet of space per dog.

1229
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a plan to double that amount to allow 150 square feet per dog to ensure we don't have too many dogs and every dog is given space to play and roam.

1230
01:33:49,686 --> 01:33:54,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We will further discuss with Animal Control what proper maximum capacity should be at our facility.

1231
01:33:54,907 --> 01:33:58,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's also discuss another controversial subject, that of waste and potential smell.

1232
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:03,469
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have several trash bins around the building that are used by many dog parks and other daycares.

1233
01:34:04,069 --> 01:34:08,630
[SPEAKER_07]: These bins also have lids to keep out weather and pests, as well as keep in any odor.

1234
01:34:09,231 --> 01:34:12,251
[SPEAKER_07]: These will not be placed near the property line and will be maintained daily.

1235
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:18,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have weekly pickup for our dumpster that will reside behind two gates that is not accessible or visible to the public.

1236
01:34:19,573 --> 01:34:25,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Our outdoor play area will be lined with specialized dog turf that is made up of antimicrobial material for a cleaner, better smelling environment.

1237
01:34:26,597 --> 01:34:32,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It is fully permeable and has an air grid below to allow proper drainage so that puddles don't form on top and nothing flows into the streets.

1238
01:34:33,802 --> 01:34:37,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Our hours of operation will also help in regards to possible annoyance.

1239
01:34:37,784 --> 01:34:43,488
[SPEAKER_07]: We plan to allow dogs outside to play between the hours of 9 to 5 so that most residents in the neighborhood will already be at work.

1240
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:51,091
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have an overnight attendant there after hours and boarding dogs will be let outside one at a time for bathroom breaks no later than 8 p.m.

1241
01:34:51,211 --> 01:34:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: and no earlier than 6 a.m.

1242
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:53,252
[SPEAKER_07]: the following day.

1243
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:58,153
[SPEAKER_07]: As for traffic concerns, we provide our clients with complimentary drop-off and pickup service.

1244
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:01,734
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we may have some clients who choose to drop off and pick up on their own.

1245
01:35:02,234 --> 01:35:08,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's Chief of Police, Chief Sacco, has informed us that there will be little to no impact on traffic to Linden Street due to our business coming in.

1246
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:12,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I hand you back to Michelle to tell you about the many benefits we will bring to Medford.

1247
01:35:13,369 --> 01:35:13,949
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Nick.

1248
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:20,253
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously, this is not all of our plans, but with the limited time we have here, we tried to provide you with a high-level overview.

1249
01:35:20,794 --> 01:35:31,181
[SPEAKER_26]: We can assure you, as truly passionate dog lovers, that we have carefully, thoroughly, and thoughtfully thought about everything in order to provide a state-of-the-art doggy daycare while being conscientious neighbors.

1250
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:40,507
[SPEAKER_26]: We have spoken with numerous professionals throughout our industry and even checked out daycares all throughout New England in an attempt to learn their best practices so we may apply them themselves.

1251
01:35:41,367 --> 01:35:47,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Lastly, I'd like to spend the remainder of our time highlighting just some of the many benefits our doggie daycare will bring to the City of Medford.

1252
01:35:48,138 --> 01:35:56,030
[SPEAKER_26]: If you are not already aware, the pet industry is a $70 billion a year business and is growing steadily every single year.

1253
01:35:56,651 --> 01:36:03,094
[SPEAKER_26]: As mentioned, there are over 10,000 registered dogs here in Medford, with each year bringing an additional 400 to 600 more.

1254
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:06,435
[SPEAKER_26]: So those numbers only include the registered dogs.

1255
01:36:06,655 --> 01:36:12,918
[SPEAKER_26]: And unfortunately, as we know, many residents do not register dogs, so in reality, that number could even be doubled.

1256
01:36:13,818 --> 01:36:17,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's start with tax revenue that Dogs for Days will plan on bringing to the city of Medford.

1257
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:30,012
[SPEAKER_26]: According to our business plan and several banks that we have spoken with, who are experts in the area, doggy daycares of our caliber bring in anywhere from $1 million to $6 million annual, depending on their size.

1258
01:36:30,672 --> 01:36:42,023
[SPEAKER_26]: We are expected to bring to the City of Medford approximately $35,000 a year, just in taxes, according to Century Bank, who I believe sent you a letter today on our behalf asking for your approval.

1259
01:36:42,724 --> 01:36:45,486
[SPEAKER_26]: Keep in mind, we are not costing the city anything.

1260
01:36:45,927 --> 01:36:51,591
[SPEAKER_26]: There is no additional revenue that the city of Medford will need to spend because Dogs for Days is here.

1261
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:58,076
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, not only will we bring you revenue and taxes, but we will also save the city considerable amount of money.

1262
01:36:58,857 --> 01:37:08,564
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently, the City of Medford has nowhere to house stray dogs that are found, lost, or abandoned, so you are paying the North Shore Animal Hospital in Lynn to house them for you.

1263
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:16,109
[SPEAKER_26]: Since 2012, Medford has paid them approximately $8,200, averaging $650 a year.

1264
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:24,836
[SPEAKER_26]: We would rectify this immediately by teaming up with Animal Control and allow you to place your dogs with us and even help unclayed dogs get adopted.

1265
01:37:25,496 --> 01:37:33,822
[SPEAKER_26]: This will not only save the city additional money, but it will save the residents from having to travel to Lynn should their dogs jump a fence or get lost due to a thunderstorm.

1266
01:37:34,302 --> 01:37:39,045
[SPEAKER_26]: They can drive right down the street and know that a local trusted company has their fur baby safe and sound.

1267
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:52,715
[SPEAKER_26]: We have spoken with your animal control officer who has given us an extensive amount of information regarding the regulations requirements that are needed to be kept in order to provide this service for you, and we look forward to working with him in order to comply.

1268
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:56,676
[SPEAKER_26]: Furthermore, and maybe most importantly, we will be hiring locally.

1269
01:37:57,296 --> 01:38:04,737
[SPEAKER_26]: Nick and I are firm believers in providing high-paying jobs to great employees, and we will be offering a lot of opportunities for the residents of Medford.

1270
01:38:05,277 --> 01:38:10,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Right off the bat, we are looking to hire six to eight people locally, starting at $15 an hour.

1271
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:19,720
[SPEAKER_26]: In addition to jobs, we will also be hosting internships for students studying animal sciences, fostering dogs, and supporting local shelters with food drives and donations.

1272
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:28,684
[SPEAKER_26]: We also plan to team up with local restaurants while hosting yappy hours, events for the communities, come to get to know one another while trying out local restaurants.

1273
01:38:29,545 --> 01:38:35,568
[SPEAKER_26]: For those of you who do not know what a yappy hour is, it is food and drinks with your fellow dog lovers and your dog.

1274
01:38:36,548 --> 01:38:47,499
[SPEAKER_26]: Our state-of-the-art facilities, along with great offers and promotions, will bring people from other communities to spend money here in Medford.

1275
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,621
[SPEAKER_26]: I have one last thing, if I could.

1276
01:38:51,403 --> 01:38:51,783
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1277
01:38:52,203 --> 01:38:59,547
[SPEAKER_26]: So we will diligently comply with 100% of the board as well as Mass General Law and ASPC guidelines.

1278
01:39:00,008 --> 01:39:04,230
[SPEAKER_26]: So lastly, we'd like to thank the many people who have helped and supported us along the way.

1279
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:09,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Our clients, our dog groups, dog walkers, friends, families, and most importantly to all other dogs.

1280
01:39:09,953 --> 01:39:11,074
[SPEAKER_26]: We hope we made you proud.

1281
01:39:11,514 --> 01:39:14,456
[SPEAKER_26]: Please let us know if we can answer any additional questions for you.

1282
01:39:14,676 --> 01:39:15,056
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1283
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:16,837
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1284
01:39:20,033 --> 01:39:20,733
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyone else want to speak?

1285
01:39:20,994 --> 01:39:21,494
[SPEAKER_42]: Any questions?

1286
01:39:21,514 --> 01:39:22,554
[SPEAKER_44]: Do you want to ask questions now?

1287
01:39:39,137 --> 01:39:39,437
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1288
01:39:39,578 --> 01:39:40,178
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilman Locario.

1289
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:43,663
[SPEAKER_44]: Maybe if you could expand a little bit more on the soundproofing.

1290
01:39:43,703 --> 01:39:45,965
[SPEAKER_44]: I know you said there's a soundproofing fence.

1291
01:39:46,085 --> 01:39:50,951
[SPEAKER_44]: Can you tell me at all about any soundproofing in the building as far as overnight?

1292
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:55,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will be lining the building from floor to ceiling with

1293
01:39:56,899 --> 01:40:12,680
[SPEAKER_07]: The reverb material that New England soundproofing provides and as previously stated it's got the highest rating you could possibly get for soundproofing this will be covering the floor the walls and parts of the ceiling as so that dogs will not be barking and I

1294
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we said, they will be kept busy.

1295
01:40:15,743 --> 01:40:18,284
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have calming music inside 24 hours a day.

1296
01:40:19,004 --> 01:40:29,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And if a dog is barking, we have, like we said, we have the human to dog ratio so that one person can take a dog aside and help keep them occupied so that they don't bark.

1297
01:40:31,652 --> 01:40:36,575
[SPEAKER_44]: And then with regards to the lighting, can you explain the hours for the lighting outside?

1298
01:40:36,675 --> 01:40:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so the lighting, we will only use, like we said, the dogs won't be outside later than 8 p.m., so lights will not be on later than 8 p.m.

1299
01:40:48,783 --> 01:40:49,084
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1300
01:40:53,066 --> 01:40:54,647
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, I was gonna go around.

1301
01:40:56,475 --> 01:40:56,795
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1302
01:40:57,616 --> 01:40:58,737
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you for your presentation.

1303
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:03,440
[SPEAKER_41]: What's the max amount of dogs you can house at one time?

1304
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:14,327
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we, with 150 square feet allowed per dog at 7500 square feet of play space, that would generally allow us 100 dogs to be there at once.

1305
01:41:16,068 --> 01:41:17,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, 50 dogs at once.

1306
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:24,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that was the 75 square foot per dog, but we doubled it to allow 50 dogs at once to give them space to roam.

1307
01:41:24,772 --> 01:41:25,312
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies.

1308
01:41:25,472 --> 01:41:36,056
[SPEAKER_26]: And however, I'd just like to add that we have agreed that with Officer Pat Hogan that we would let him make the final determination of what he determines would be the maximum number of dogs allowed there at one time.

1309
01:41:36,636 --> 01:41:40,837
[SPEAKER_26]: ASPC guidelines do say, as Nick mentioned, one dog per 75 square feet.

1310
01:41:41,997 --> 01:41:42,298
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

1311
01:41:44,179 --> 01:41:50,710
[SPEAKER_41]: Now, housing them outside, how many would you house outside during walk time?

1312
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:54,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I actually just ask, because we don't house dogs, I think you mean play?

1313
01:41:57,962 --> 01:42:04,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as stated in the speech, between 9 and 5 the dogs will be allowed outside.

1314
01:42:04,604 --> 01:42:08,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually about 20 or 30 can roam between in and out.

1315
01:42:09,005 --> 01:42:10,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be keeping them busy.

1316
01:42:11,226 --> 01:42:14,387
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be one person for every 10 dogs, which is very easily managed.

1317
01:42:15,147 --> 01:42:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, with people there 24-7, keeping the dogs nice and calm, they have no reason to bark.

1318
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:23,573
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't see on the other side of the fence.

1319
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:26,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, you know, nothing to bark at.

1320
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: They kept busy and nice and tired and having a blast.

1321
01:42:32,059 --> 01:42:37,484
[SPEAKER_41]: As a dog lover and having my own dog, my wife won't let her out of her sight.

1322
01:42:39,566 --> 01:42:50,597
[SPEAKER_41]: But what I did do with so many concerns both for and against, I took a tour of a local kennel doggy daycare.

1323
01:42:52,238 --> 01:43:02,504
[SPEAKER_41]: And one thing that was very evident was a clean facility, but two things that were glaring was the smell of the urine and the dog and the barking.

1324
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:02,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1325
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:15,651
[SPEAKER_41]: And as I talked to the owner as much, as honestly as she could, when you, as she explained to me, when you bring 10 dogs into the play area, the recreation area, as she called it,

1326
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:21,927
[SPEAKER_41]: They all set their scent, so there's constant urinating.

1327
01:43:22,347 --> 01:43:35,022
[SPEAKER_41]: And that was when it was pretty pungent, which they used a chemical spray that continually goes, and they used stone dust that they changed every quarter.

1328
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:41,389
[SPEAKER_41]: And she said it's just been very difficult to mask that.

1329
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:43,170
[SPEAKER_41]: So that's one of my concerns.

1330
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:47,354
[SPEAKER_41]: The other thing is the noise issue.

1331
01:43:48,135 --> 01:43:52,699
[SPEAKER_41]: As she put it, when dogs do come to her facility,

1332
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,563
[SPEAKER_41]: They are stressed for the fact that, especially new dogs.

1333
01:43:57,244 --> 01:44:02,509
[SPEAKER_41]: And we'll have dogs, as I witnessed, that would bark until they're exhausted.

1334
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:10,678
[SPEAKER_41]: And no matter what they try to do as dog caretakers, it was very difficult for them to control.

1335
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:15,783
[SPEAKER_41]: So she was very honest and open with me, and my question to you is that

1336
01:44:16,895 --> 01:44:33,631
[SPEAKER_41]: she finds it very difficult to tell me that she can guarantee anybody in her business where she runs that the dogs aren't going to be loud and the smell of the urine, not using maybe your product might be different, but it was pungent.

1337
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:36,674
[SPEAKER_41]: Now, if you can help me with that, that would be great.

1338
01:44:37,114 --> 01:44:55,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, so if I may I'll answer those in the order they were asked so as far as the smelling urine like We had said and we do have our turf expert here if you'd like to ask him any questions Our turf is specialized so that it is an antimicrobial material It's made so that it's a cleaner better smelling.

1339
01:44:56,299 --> 01:44:59,220
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it's it's not dirty stuff it has a

1340
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:10,429
[SPEAKER_07]: air grid system below it so that when a dog urinates on it, it directly goes beneath and flows to where it drains into the ground.

1341
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:16,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, that being said, they're not peeing on stones that are stuck there all day.

1342
01:45:16,895 --> 01:45:21,219
[SPEAKER_07]: They're peeing and it directly goes straight down and away from where they are.

1343
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:25,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We will also be hosing the property down at least once a day, if not twice a day.

1344
01:45:27,164 --> 01:45:32,926
[SPEAKER_07]: We have fountains in the facility so that water is flowing constantly.

1345
01:45:33,426 --> 01:45:37,268
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not gonna be a dry, smelly place.

1346
01:45:38,608 --> 01:45:46,071
[SPEAKER_07]: With the noise, so when, sorry, if I may, we had our rendering.

1347
01:45:47,691 --> 01:45:49,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my apologies.

1348
01:45:52,495 --> 01:45:55,257
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see in the rendering, we have our vehicle bay.

1349
01:45:55,797 --> 01:46:02,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how we will stop the potential issue of when dogs come in, they just come out and start barking.

1350
01:46:02,642 --> 01:46:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: You pull into the vehicle bay.

1351
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:05,923
[SPEAKER_07]: both of these gates will be closed.

1352
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:13,906
[SPEAKER_07]: The dogs are let into a door into the inside facility where they will, you know, we have this fence right here, so they are let inside.

1353
01:46:14,426 --> 01:46:17,407
[SPEAKER_07]: They run, they do their barking and whatnot.

1354
01:46:17,427 --> 01:46:24,569
[SPEAKER_07]: We try and facilitate that, calm them down, keep them cool, get their energy out, get their barking energy out while they are inside.

1355
01:46:25,069 --> 01:46:29,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we open that gate and they are let outside once they are in a calm and collected manner.

1356
01:46:31,876 --> 01:46:36,197
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, I will tell you, I didn't witness that in that daycare.

1357
01:46:36,738 --> 01:46:37,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You did or did not?

1358
01:46:37,718 --> 01:46:38,078
[SPEAKER_41]: I did not.

1359
01:46:38,598 --> 01:46:40,139
[SPEAKER_41]: Well, we, that's.

1360
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,880
[SPEAKER_41]: I saw that, I mean, I'm just, I know it sounds, I appreciate the hard work.

1361
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:44,740
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, no, absolutely.

1362
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:50,522
[SPEAKER_41]: But I just, once they were let out, there's no guarantees that the dog's gonna stop barking, correct?

1363
01:46:51,087 --> 01:47:16,349
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely and actually if I could just add on to that I mean one of the reasons why Nick and I wanted to open a doggie daycare is visiting some of the places we saw and witnessed what you had and so we asked people right now when we do our play groups where we might have 10-15 dogs we aren't experiencing that and I think it's some of the engagement by us having so many people on our dog to you know a person ratio by us going above and beyond having some of the activity courses and

1364
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:20,333
[SPEAKER_26]: They are running around and playing, so they're not barking because they're in an agility course.

1365
01:47:21,154 --> 01:47:22,435
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're trying to keep them busy.

1366
01:47:22,675 --> 01:47:23,936
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not saying it's going to be perfect.

1367
01:47:23,976 --> 01:47:26,999
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not going to lie to you guys and say there won't be any barking.

1368
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,200
[SPEAKER_26]: We all know dogs bark.

1369
01:47:29,282 --> 01:47:29,602
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1370
01:47:30,663 --> 01:47:31,283
[SPEAKER_31]: Councilor Belco.

1371
01:47:31,324 --> 01:47:32,164
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1372
01:47:32,264 --> 01:47:35,868
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to thank you for your presentation and thank you for your interest in opening up a business here.

1373
01:47:38,295 --> 01:47:42,981
[SPEAKER_31]: So you mentioned earlier that you could possibly have 50 dogs at once.

1374
01:47:43,762 --> 01:47:46,545
[SPEAKER_31]: But you did say, well, maybe 20 or 30 out at one time.

1375
01:47:46,605 --> 01:47:54,515
[SPEAKER_31]: If you had a maximum capacity of 50 dogs at one time, could you possibly have 50 dogs out in that area at one point in time, at the same time?

1376
01:47:55,757 --> 01:47:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to answer?

1377
01:47:57,058 --> 01:47:57,158
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1378
01:47:58,868 --> 01:48:02,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It is possible, but very highly unlikely.

1379
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:11,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, like I said, we have a very large garage-sized space inside, as well as a secondary inside space for the little dogs.

1380
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So say we have 50 dogs there, 15 of them are small dogs, they are in the little dog section, which is mostly inside.

1381
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So the large dogs will be, let's see, 50 dogs minus 15 would be 35.

1382
01:48:25,223 --> 01:48:28,305
[SPEAKER_07]: There would be 35 dogs between the inside and outside space.

1383
01:48:28,866 --> 01:48:35,390
[SPEAKER_07]: The dogs are allowed in and out once they have calmed down, like we said, and we have gone through the inside and after the vehicle bay and whatnot.

1384
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are allowed to roam in and out.

1385
01:48:37,911 --> 01:48:46,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So between that 35 dogs that are left on the in and outside space, some may be napping, some may be playing, some may be outside rolling around.

1386
01:48:47,698 --> 01:48:52,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you won't have all 35 of those dogs running around, barking, playing.

1387
01:48:53,282 --> 01:48:57,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Many are going to be napping or playing tug of war with each other inside.

1388
01:48:57,345 --> 01:49:03,970
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many other things that dogs can do besides just outside playing, because they get tired very easily.

1389
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:09,122
[SPEAKER_31]: And I apologize, I was trying to read this at the same time as you're presenting.

1390
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:12,724
[SPEAKER_31]: So as far as the, what is the inside of that building?

1391
01:49:12,784 --> 01:49:16,406
[SPEAKER_31]: How many rooms are we talking as far as, do you have any insight?

1392
01:49:17,386 --> 01:49:17,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, so.

1393
01:49:19,548 --> 01:49:19,948
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually.

1394
01:49:20,008 --> 01:49:27,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so our architect, can we actually allow him to speak and present to you guys?

1395
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:28,413
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine with me.

1396
01:49:30,325 --> 01:49:33,107
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm Dominic Valenti, 571 Main Street, Bedford.

1397
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:35,209
[SPEAKER_24]: The existing building is a tri-level building.

1398
01:49:53,255 --> 01:50:02,997
[SPEAKER_24]: which is at the bottom of that sheet right there, and which has a new handicap ramp being installed for accessibility, is the office area.

1399
01:50:03,757 --> 01:50:20,241
[SPEAKER_24]: And through a pair of doors that are in the ramp, the dog can either go down the dog slide, or they can be taken down the stairs and into the middle level, which is the garage, the existing garage.

1400
01:50:21,758 --> 01:50:26,740
[SPEAKER_24]: Attached to the middle level is the basement underneath the first floor entryway.

1401
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:33,182
[SPEAKER_24]: So the dogs really are down in, we'll say, the basement level, the garage level.

1402
01:50:34,963 --> 01:50:39,144
[SPEAKER_24]: They enter probably at the upper level, but they're not going to be there.

1403
01:50:39,465 --> 01:50:47,628
[SPEAKER_24]: They're either in the outside plan or inside plan, or the little ones are inside plan, which is down at the basement level.

1404
01:50:52,233 --> 01:50:52,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, thank you very much.

1405
01:50:53,114 --> 01:51:00,821
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as, so I've received a few calls from neighbors saying the space here is industrial space, or it used to be industrial space.

1406
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:02,142
[SPEAKER_31]: It's an industrial zone.

1407
01:51:02,802 --> 01:51:07,366
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you talk a little bit about, because I had a couple people call me about safety.

1408
01:51:08,087 --> 01:51:10,789
[SPEAKER_31]: Since it was at one time industrial, is it safe for dogs?

1409
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:14,332
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you maybe talk a little bit more about the turf as well?

1410
01:51:15,713 --> 01:51:17,914
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you want to take that, sir?

1411
01:51:18,374 --> 01:51:22,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so as far as the street being industrial, yes it is.

1412
01:51:23,275 --> 01:51:34,898
[SPEAKER_07]: The dogs will not be out in the street, so they come in onto our property, and as you can see, so they come in onto our property, which will be clean as this is just pavement.

1413
01:51:34,958 --> 01:51:38,919
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had an environmental study done on the building.

1414
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is safe and good for dogs.

1415
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:47,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this will actually be torn up and put turf down.

1416
01:51:47,264 --> 01:51:53,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of the pavement will actually be torn up, made sure it's safe for the dogs, and the turf is actually laid down.

1417
01:51:53,528 --> 01:52:01,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything will be safe for the dogs, including the inside, which we will have extra flooring laid down to ensure that everything is safe and good for the dogs.

1418
01:52:07,578 --> 01:52:21,919
[SPEAKER_26]: There's an electronically gate that comes all the way through it's actually pretty state-of-the-art very cool So when you first drive on to the property bay, you actually have to go through an electronic service gate so if our vans which can actually

1419
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:29,987
[SPEAKER_26]: be seen right here, come in with a stream of dogs, then they would have, the gate is automatically closed behind them.

1420
01:52:30,548 --> 01:52:37,575
[SPEAKER_26]: As they pull into the auto bay, there is another gate that closes automatically, so they would have to leave two gates.

1421
01:52:38,155 --> 01:52:40,356
[SPEAKER_26]: to go to leave our property.

1422
01:52:40,776 --> 01:52:43,097
[SPEAKER_26]: Our employees will be housed with walkie-talkies.

1423
01:52:43,537 --> 01:52:46,819
[SPEAKER_26]: If an emergency were to arrive, they would be able to talk to one another.

1424
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:50,760
[SPEAKER_26]: But the street right now, as you mentioned, it is a very industrial area.

1425
01:52:51,561 --> 01:52:54,582
[SPEAKER_26]: There are some residentials across the street, but it is very safe.

1426
01:52:54,762 --> 01:52:56,023
[SPEAKER_26]: There are dogs that live there now.

1427
01:52:57,546 --> 01:53:10,560
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as the turf goes, I think of repetitive use if you have 20, 30 dogs here a day that are outside and peeing and whatnot.

1428
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:12,081
[SPEAKER_31]: What's the life expectancy of the turf?

1429
01:53:12,101 --> 01:53:13,062
[SPEAKER_31]: How long is that going to last?

1430
01:53:13,102 --> 01:53:14,704
[SPEAKER_07]: May I have our turf experts speak on that?

1431
01:53:15,404 --> 01:53:15,905
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely.

1432
01:53:18,927 --> 01:53:19,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1433
01:53:19,187 --> 01:53:20,568
[SPEAKER_11]: John Buckley, Mansfield, Massachusetts.

1434
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:24,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the operations director for Evalon, Massachusetts, located in Hanover.

1435
01:53:25,192 --> 01:53:29,214
[SPEAKER_11]: For an application such as this, this is our canine tariff, which we would be installing here.

1436
01:53:29,234 --> 01:53:31,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a tariff specifically designed for this application.

1437
01:53:31,956 --> 01:53:37,741
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing in mind is for basically dog owners, whether it be residential or commercial applications such as this.

1438
01:53:38,962 --> 01:53:52,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Life expectancy of this turf with the amount of dogs and the wear that it's going to take, I would put it at about upwards of 15 years from the time it's installed until it would likely have to be replaced.

1439
01:53:54,075 --> 01:53:58,338
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm just thinking with that many dogs over time, there's definitely a concern about odor.

1440
01:53:58,638 --> 01:53:59,079
[SPEAKER_31]: Sure.

1441
01:53:59,099 --> 01:54:01,600
[SPEAKER_31]: That's in the neighborhood, so that's.

1442
01:54:01,621 --> 01:54:16,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so other doggy daycare facilities that we install this turf at, most try a different route at first, whether it be P-stone, turf that's not applicable for doggy daycares such as this.

1443
01:54:17,052 --> 01:54:21,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And what happens is there's a huge, I know we've already touched upon, a huge drainage problem.

1444
01:54:22,335 --> 01:54:28,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Conventional turfs, if you turn it upside down like this, it just has punch holes that are drain holes.

1445
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:34,461
[SPEAKER_11]: But this, as we hold it up to the light, I don't know if you guys can see that or not, but you can see through it basically.

1446
01:54:34,481 --> 01:54:35,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It's completely permeable.

1447
01:54:36,942 --> 01:54:43,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So liquids pass through this at a rate of over 400 inches of liquid an hour.

1448
01:54:45,166 --> 01:54:47,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Conventional turfs, if someone were to use something else,

1449
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:49,728
[SPEAKER_11]: 30, 40 inches.

1450
01:54:50,749 --> 01:54:52,570
[SPEAKER_11]: So the drainage is impeccable.

1451
01:54:53,431 --> 01:54:59,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Every blade is treated with a product called Alpha San, which is an antimicrobial agent.

1452
01:54:59,215 --> 01:55:07,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So that cuts down on, obviously, bacteria growth and, hence, odors that, again, other facilities experience because they don't have those controls in place.

1453
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:32,510
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as the how is it how high is the fence eight feet Yes, there is currently an eight-foot fence there and we were actually going to erect an additional eight-foot fence So we will have two eight-foot fences there to all the way around all the way around it as far as

1454
01:55:38,393 --> 01:55:41,535
[SPEAKER_31]: I think of 20, 30 dogs, I'm thinking a lot of waste.

1455
01:55:42,536 --> 01:55:47,739
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm thinking of odor, I'm thinking the residents, that could be a major problem.

1456
01:55:48,139 --> 01:55:51,280
[SPEAKER_31]: But you're only removing waste once a week.

1457
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,841
[SPEAKER_31]: That sounds like that could be an issue.

1458
01:55:57,062 --> 01:55:58,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me explain to you.

1459
01:55:59,003 --> 01:56:06,368
[SPEAKER_07]: A typical dog, I believe we spoke about this once before, a typical dog excretes about three quarters pound of waste per day.

1460
01:56:07,128 --> 01:56:11,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we're going to just, let's just average it double the amount of dogs that we would have.

1461
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:19,397
[SPEAKER_07]: If we average it 100 dogs a day, for five days a week, we're open for daycare, it comes to about 375 pounds of waste per week.

1462
01:56:19,777 --> 01:56:20,538
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a lot.

1463
01:56:21,298 --> 01:56:26,727
[SPEAKER_07]: but if it's picked up by our weekly dumpster service, our 10-gallon barrels hold up about 80 pounds of waste.

1464
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:35,941
[SPEAKER_07]: If we only put 65 pounds in those 10-gallon barrels, we'll only have about five to six 10-gallon trash bags a week in our dumpster.

1465
01:56:36,762 --> 01:56:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, you know, five to six bags of trash, that's your average household sometimes.

1466
01:56:41,966 --> 01:56:42,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, people with a lot of trash.

1467
01:56:44,467 --> 01:56:54,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So, five to six, 10 gallon bags of trash in a dumpster that's locked and closed is, and smells, yeah, smells won't escape any of these barrels containing dog waste.

1468
01:56:55,095 --> 01:57:00,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they're only open for a very small amount of time, split second.

1469
01:57:05,008 --> 01:57:14,034
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I was just going to comment into your, Councilor Dela Russa, they are the same exact cans that are currently used at dog parks now.

1470
01:57:14,134 --> 01:57:15,695
[SPEAKER_26]: So they have a safety seal on it.

1471
01:57:16,075 --> 01:57:18,236
[SPEAKER_26]: So smell and odor is not admitted from it.

1472
01:57:19,957 --> 01:57:20,257
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1473
01:57:20,598 --> 01:57:20,978
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1474
01:57:22,459 --> 01:57:23,119
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Locario.

1475
01:57:25,701 --> 01:57:28,362
[SPEAKER_44]: Can you explain, so you explained there's going to be two fences.

1476
01:57:29,243 --> 01:57:31,304
[SPEAKER_44]: Can you explain, it looks like there's a tree buffer.

1477
01:57:33,574 --> 01:57:39,016
[SPEAKER_44]: Is it only going to be on one side of the floor and how tall are the trees going to be?

1478
01:57:39,396 --> 01:57:39,656
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1479
01:57:41,717 --> 01:57:42,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for that question.

1480
01:57:43,237 --> 01:57:51,059
[SPEAKER_26]: So if I may, it would actually be in the back side of the building where right now that's focused.

1481
01:57:51,099 --> 01:57:52,460
[SPEAKER_26]: So we are on Linden Street.

1482
01:57:54,837 --> 01:57:55,638
[SPEAKER_26]: here.

1483
01:57:55,678 --> 01:58:07,068
[SPEAKER_26]: The reason being is such as we actually have a company over here where we would not be able to plant some of the trees, but we will be able to plant them all.

1484
01:58:07,928 --> 01:58:12,733
[SPEAKER_26]: And as they grow, we will install the highest that we can possibly do and we just didn't grow.

1485
01:58:13,571 --> 01:58:18,738
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently this picture, you will see there are trees already there between us and Linden Street.

1486
01:58:19,398 --> 01:58:22,983
[SPEAKER_26]: So we would assume they would go natural over the decades.

1487
01:58:23,003 --> 01:58:25,947
[SPEAKER_26]: We hope to be in the city of Medford to be 15 feet flush trees.

1488
01:58:30,467 --> 01:58:31,188
[SPEAKER_51]: Councilor Russo.

1489
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:32,449
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. President, thank you.

1490
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:39,915
[SPEAKER_51]: I want to thank the petitioners for choosing Medford to open your business and to go through the fine work that you've done.

1491
01:58:39,975 --> 01:58:43,057
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm particularly impressed with the architectural renderings.

1492
01:58:43,678 --> 01:58:45,739
[SPEAKER_51]: You've selected a very good architect, I must say.

1493
01:58:47,721 --> 01:59:02,874
[SPEAKER_51]: I want to get back to and I Not ever my practice to beat a dead horse But I want to get back to one of the press questions that council Scarpelli asked And that is about the noise and sound of dogs.

1494
01:59:02,894 --> 01:59:02,914
[SPEAKER_51]: I

1495
01:59:03,996 --> 01:59:28,723
[SPEAKER_51]: You've made the case and I agree with you that that's a area that has noise in it But this is a new and different type of noise One of the rare moments in each day that I have peace and quiet is early in the morning before the Hecticness of my business gets going I sit out in the back of my office in the garage door and

1496
01:59:29,703 --> 01:59:32,744
[SPEAKER_51]: And it's as close as I get to being in the wilderness.

1497
01:59:32,824 --> 01:59:34,025
[SPEAKER_51]: And there's squirrels.

1498
01:59:34,625 --> 01:59:38,406
[SPEAKER_51]: And the rabbits, which have infested Medford.

1499
01:59:39,246 --> 01:59:42,608
[SPEAKER_51]: And the robins chasing the squirrels.

1500
01:59:43,328 --> 01:59:45,729
[SPEAKER_51]: And the starlings chasing the robins.

1501
01:59:46,129 --> 01:59:48,850
[SPEAKER_51]: And the grackles chasing the sparrows.

1502
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:52,671
[SPEAKER_51]: And so I have a wonderful time enjoying nature.

1503
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:54,432
[SPEAKER_51]: And in the midst of that,

1504
01:59:55,192 --> 02:00:13,285
[SPEAKER_51]: Traversing my property are many of my dear neighbors who walk their dogs through there and they're lovely and one by one they come but when they intersect they get loud and they start to bark and they get a little out of control and

1505
02:00:14,798 --> 02:00:38,804
[SPEAKER_51]: So I notice that, and as someone who doesn't own a dog, I see that in interaction, whether it's right in front of me when people are just stopping by, or at a distance out on the back road behind my office when people are just crossing and avoiding each other to stay away, to keep the dogs away from each other, and going on opposite sides of the street.

1506
02:00:39,384 --> 02:00:43,545
[SPEAKER_51]: So I know Councilor Scarpelli asked about the

1507
02:00:44,305 --> 02:00:46,086
[SPEAKER_51]: the dogs and the noise.

1508
02:00:47,388 --> 02:01:01,078
[SPEAKER_51]: You explained you're receiving a process on how dogs are allowed to come in and they go into a gated area and they have a little time to decompress and acclimate themselves to a new environment.

1509
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:11,947
[SPEAKER_51]: And I'm sure all the smells of other dogs and the course of nature they have between girl dogs and boy dogs and all that gets some of them wound up.

1510
02:01:12,547 --> 02:01:34,635
[SPEAKER_51]: But I'm concerned to add in a neighborhood that is zoned industrial, is zoned for noise, that has, even though by exception, has become and pretends to become even more residential, or at least mixed use.

1511
02:01:35,416 --> 02:01:38,277
[SPEAKER_51]: And so could you just talk again about

1512
02:01:38,937 --> 02:02:08,105
[SPEAKER_51]: the issue of noise and how the addition of a new unique noise other than front end loaders backing up with their little beeps and that type of stuff, which the neighborhood is used to and has grown accustomed to, how does adding and interjecting a new and particular noise, which residents there are not accustomed to,

1513
02:02:08,895 --> 02:02:12,859
[SPEAKER_51]: and how you're going to deal with that.

1514
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:15,122
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your question.

1515
02:02:15,642 --> 02:02:22,069
[SPEAKER_26]: There was two actually, and let me start with the first one for choosing Medford, because we actually have your President Caraviello to thank for that.

1516
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:27,514
[SPEAKER_26]: I had sent him an email in early January, and he replied right away saying, come to Medford.

1517
02:02:27,574 --> 02:02:28,275
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a great city.

1518
02:02:28,355 --> 02:02:31,599
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you, President Caraviello, for being the one to bring us to Medford.

1519
02:02:32,737 --> 02:02:38,202
[SPEAKER_26]: In regards to the noise question, I'd like to refer you to what the street looks like currently now.

1520
02:02:38,682 --> 02:02:44,848
[SPEAKER_26]: You will see that there are several construction companies on the area as our abutters.

1521
02:02:45,308 --> 02:02:47,030
[SPEAKER_26]: Next to us is Cardi Construction.

1522
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:48,711
[SPEAKER_26]: On the other side is Burst Construction.

1523
02:02:49,172 --> 02:02:52,855
[SPEAKER_26]: They are large construction companies that operate

1524
02:02:59,468 --> 02:03:23,000
[SPEAKER_26]: blowers every time we have gone there it's been very hard to hear yourself so I definitely agree that it is a noisy area as it is so our addition of having the dogs probably will add a little bit of noise but what is there currently between the construction companies going and operating in and out we do think that it's actually the perfect place to put a doggy day

1525
02:03:26,222 --> 02:03:35,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to note one thing, that when I was there meeting with the fence guy, I spent about 45 minutes with him, you know, taking tour of the property.

1526
02:03:35,686 --> 02:03:42,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And during that time, as we said previously, there are dogs that live on the street, and you stated that this would be a new noise.

1527
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:50,133
[SPEAKER_07]: During that 45 minutes, one of the residential dogs that lived on the street barked the entire 45 minutes.

1528
02:03:51,013 --> 02:03:54,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this dog, you know, that you're,

1529
02:03:56,259 --> 02:04:01,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, this is no new noise, as people who have dogs have dogs that bark.

1530
02:04:01,483 --> 02:04:21,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And with this business, we'll be taking the barking dogs out of the neighborhoods and out of the houses that are currently barking because they want to get out, they want to play, they want to make friends, bringing them to our facility, getting them nice and tired, and allowing them to get their energy out in the correct and right ways and not just bark all day and annoy their neighbors.

1531
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:28,470
[SPEAKER_42]: Carlos Dello Russo, you finished?

1532
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:30,111
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm done.

1533
02:04:30,451 --> 02:04:30,751
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1534
02:04:31,032 --> 02:04:31,812
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox.

1535
02:04:33,352 --> 02:04:34,253
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1536
02:04:35,713 --> 02:04:55,502
[SPEAKER_29]: Over the past, actually now three years, I have had the unique opportunity to serve on a committee in the community, self-appointed, Patty Flynn's in the audience here, of residents that got together about three years ago and created our own committee to look into the need for a dog park in the city.

1537
02:04:56,342 --> 02:04:57,403
[SPEAKER_29]: And we did our homework.

1538
02:04:57,523 --> 02:05:00,164
[SPEAKER_29]: We found a grant through the Stanton Foundation.

1539
02:05:01,105 --> 02:05:02,626
[SPEAKER_29]: We sent out surveys.

1540
02:05:02,986 --> 02:05:05,428
[SPEAKER_29]: We created a committee pause for method.

1541
02:05:05,848 --> 02:05:07,049
[SPEAKER_29]: We've held fundraisers.

1542
02:05:07,809 --> 02:05:13,893
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can tell you firsthand experience working with this committee and also trying to find a location.

1543
02:05:14,413 --> 02:05:15,954
[SPEAKER_29]: as you just said, the perfect location.

1544
02:05:16,395 --> 02:05:19,417
[SPEAKER_29]: Trying to find a location was the toughest part of it all.

1545
02:05:20,358 --> 02:05:24,020
[SPEAKER_29]: And I won't speak for you, Patty, because you found the grant for us.

1546
02:05:25,421 --> 02:05:29,344
[SPEAKER_29]: But it was the toughest part to find where we could put a dog park.

1547
02:05:29,964 --> 02:05:32,646
[SPEAKER_29]: And naturally, what we've heard already is noise.

1548
02:05:33,607 --> 02:05:40,892
[SPEAKER_29]: We didn't want to be in an area that was surrounded with homes because we knew the neighborhood would come out and say, you know what, we want a dog park, but not in my neighborhood.

1549
02:05:42,193 --> 02:05:46,837
[SPEAKER_29]: We knew that if it was downstream from the park, you're going to get odors and smells and so forth.

1550
02:05:47,318 --> 02:06:04,672
[SPEAKER_29]: So after doing our homework and due diligence and sending out a citywide survey, which I wouldn't expect you to do, but we came to a point of picking behind the McGlynn School on Riverbend Park, which we all believe it's handicap accessible, it's a great location and so forth.

1551
02:06:05,232 --> 02:06:10,217
[SPEAKER_29]: And the primary goal was to stay away from residential homes.

1552
02:06:11,117 --> 02:06:12,478
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think we accomplished that.

1553
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:15,721
[SPEAKER_29]: Right, the new dog park you have on the list.

1554
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:16,762
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm glad to see that.

1555
02:06:19,504 --> 02:06:27,751
[SPEAKER_29]: It's currently under construction and we're looking in the next few months to have a full-fledged dog park in the city for both small and large dogs.

1556
02:06:28,192 --> 02:06:31,635
[SPEAKER_29]: But needless to say, that was the obstacle.

1557
02:06:31,815 --> 02:06:36,279
[SPEAKER_29]: And we sat through countless presentations on the use of turf.

1558
02:06:36,739 --> 02:06:37,699
[SPEAKER_29]: versus peastone.

1559
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:53,246
[SPEAKER_29]: We ultimately visited a number of parks in Arlington and Somerville and found that peastone with proper irrigation was the best solution we felt to eradicate not everything but a lot of the odor.

1560
02:06:54,086 --> 02:06:58,228
[SPEAKER_29]: And that was through the experts and consultants that we brought on board.

1561
02:06:58,929 --> 02:07:02,150
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm a little concerned that even though your turf sounds great,

1562
02:07:03,619 --> 02:07:05,200
[SPEAKER_29]: There is no formal irrigation.

1563
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:09,201
[SPEAKER_29]: I know it leaches through and then it goes somewhere, you said.

1564
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:10,842
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know where that somewhere is.

1565
02:07:11,262 --> 02:07:17,165
[SPEAKER_29]: But it doesn't seem like there's a formal irrigation process, which I know in a dog park,

1566
02:07:17,776 --> 02:07:27,846
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm sure in a type of setting that you have would be paramount to making sure that the odor is subsided to have this irrigation.

1567
02:07:28,207 --> 02:07:32,791
[SPEAKER_29]: So I was wondering if you can answer that irrigation question as well as

1568
02:07:35,013 --> 02:07:36,094
[SPEAKER_29]: I know you're before us tonight.

1569
02:07:36,975 --> 02:07:37,576
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm interested.

1570
02:07:37,596 --> 02:07:39,738
[SPEAKER_29]: Are there other sites that you looked at in the community?

1571
02:07:39,798 --> 02:07:46,666
[SPEAKER_29]: Are there other areas that you say, you know what, this would be a great area, but we were unable to do this or that?

1572
02:07:47,767 --> 02:07:49,509
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I'd be interested in seeing other

1573
02:07:50,069 --> 02:07:58,015
[SPEAKER_29]: Our committee for years said that, and we estimated at the time we had over 9,000 dogs in the city.

1574
02:07:58,575 --> 02:08:06,101
[SPEAKER_29]: And as the city clerk would attest to you, we register, license probably 350 dogs, 400 dogs a year.

1575
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:11,865
[SPEAKER_29]: And the reason why it's not because people don't want to license their dog is because we're not a dog-friendly city.

1576
02:08:12,905 --> 02:08:14,147
[SPEAKER_29]: Really, it's true.

1577
02:08:15,148 --> 02:08:28,960
[SPEAKER_29]: And the purpose of creating a dog park was actually to make it more of a dog friendly city and also by the creation, giving an incentive to people if they want to use the park, they have to register their dog.

1578
02:08:29,638 --> 02:08:32,644
[SPEAKER_29]: and so forth, and that will pay for the maintenance and so forth, the upkeep.

1579
02:08:33,145 --> 02:08:43,022
[SPEAKER_29]: So I was wondering if you could answer the irrigation process and also what other locations did you look at and the reason why they weren't selected?

1580
02:08:43,337 --> 02:09:03,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So before Michelle touches on that subject, and we bring our turf guy, just along the lines of when you said you guys surveyed the entire city, obviously two people couldn't accomplish something like that, but we did make an attempt to go door-to-door, and we got many petitions signed for people who would like this, so I would like to submit this to you guys, if that is possible.

1581
02:09:05,174 --> 02:09:05,634
[SPEAKER_35]: To the clerk.

1582
02:09:05,714 --> 02:09:09,697
[SPEAKER_26]: So let me just discuss, because you asked great questions about council parties,

1583
02:09:16,629 --> 02:09:18,132
[SPEAKER_44]: You have to talk in the microphone.

1584
02:09:18,873 --> 02:09:19,735
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, we have it.

1585
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:36,382
[SPEAKER_26]: As you guys know, the zoning, and you in particularly, Officer Marks, that this is a very tough place to choose.

1586
02:09:36,863 --> 02:09:43,145
[SPEAKER_26]: The only place that we could actually choose is in that purple area down in the bottom area right here.

1587
02:09:43,325 --> 02:09:47,487
[SPEAKER_26]: If you see, it is marked industrial, the very bottom corner right there.

1588
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:54,009
[SPEAKER_26]: The two industrial locations are the Wellington Square and this other particular area for us.

1589
02:09:54,469 --> 02:10:01,992
[SPEAKER_26]: And so, unfortunately, the real estate that has been available to us, there was only two properties that we were able to choose from.

1590
02:10:02,952 --> 02:10:04,673
[SPEAKER_26]: One of them was not deemed suitable.

1591
02:10:05,033 --> 02:10:06,273
[SPEAKER_26]: It was too large.

1592
02:10:06,653 --> 02:10:13,616
[SPEAKER_26]: And to be honest with you, we actually tried to acquire it, but our bank, after looking, who was the expert in this, said it was not feasible.

1593
02:10:13,996 --> 02:10:17,517
[SPEAKER_26]: So, 29 Linden Street was the only property that we were actually left with.

1594
02:10:18,117 --> 02:10:23,502
[SPEAKER_26]: If we could identify another place, I can tell you on a personal level, we would take it.

1595
02:10:23,923 --> 02:10:34,252
[SPEAKER_26]: We absolutely have looked and scoured and continue, our real estate has continued to look for other places, but this particular building absolutely perfectly suits not only our needs,

1596
02:10:34,572 --> 02:10:37,454
[SPEAKER_26]: but your residence needs as well as where it's located.

1597
02:10:37,954 --> 02:10:43,657
[SPEAKER_26]: The new Petco is right down the street from there, as well as the dog park is about two blocks away.

1598
02:10:44,037 --> 02:10:46,518
[SPEAKER_26]: So it is a perfect location on that sense.

1599
02:10:47,839 --> 02:11:03,588
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as, again, like I said, other sites, we have continued throughout the last nine, 10 months to look as new real estate becomes available, but as you know, Medford is a very, very hot city right now, and there isn't a lot of buildings for sale and or for lease, unfortunately.

1600
02:11:05,269 --> 02:11:10,412
[SPEAKER_26]: As regards to peastone and irrigation, so I would like to turn that over to you to respond to that.

1601
02:11:10,652 --> 02:11:14,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I can comment on the peastone and lack of an irrigation system.

1602
02:11:15,516 --> 02:11:19,979
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the facilities that we go into that are very similar to this in size.

1603
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:23,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually removed peastone because the owners have found it's not working.

1604
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:24,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It smells.

1605
02:11:25,241 --> 02:11:25,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Dogs eat it.

1606
02:11:26,022 --> 02:11:27,042
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not safe for them.

1607
02:11:27,582 --> 02:11:31,084
[SPEAKER_11]: They want, you know, a safe product such as the canine turf here.

1608
02:11:31,104 --> 02:11:37,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's been several instances that we've done that, even one this year, a place called the Secret Garden East Bridgewater.

1609
02:11:37,627 --> 02:11:43,050
[SPEAKER_11]: We removed yard upon yard upon yard of their peastone and replaced it with our canine grass.

1610
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:46,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Lack of an irrigation system I can address.

1611
02:11:47,412 --> 02:12:06,003
[SPEAKER_11]: In the seven years that we've been installing this, we've never had a smell complaint from a place and we've never had a place say that they felt they needed to add an irrigation system that just hosing the turf down on a daily basis was sufficient and that a system such as that did not need to be added to a facility.

1612
02:12:07,444 --> 02:12:12,487
[SPEAKER_29]: So just if I can add then, where exactly, once it goes underneath your dog turf,

1613
02:12:13,242 --> 02:12:15,285
[SPEAKER_29]: does it go into your property?

1614
02:12:15,646 --> 02:12:17,468
[SPEAKER_29]: Does it just leach into the ground directly below?

1615
02:12:17,488 --> 02:12:18,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it'll just go in the substrate.

1616
02:12:19,792 --> 02:12:22,936
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not draining to a particular area, there's no slope where it may drain to?

1617
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:48,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's I don't think anything would ever get quick enough to run off and to get to one particular area There's yeah, you know, there's I mean there is some there is some slope to the property as I know when I was there But yeah, I mean nothing's gonna be flowing enough in that manner that you know that it's gonna kind of congregate to one area I should say Another question I have is

1618
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:55,842
[SPEAKER_29]: What other type of services will you be providing at that particular site?

1619
02:12:56,022 --> 02:12:58,183
[SPEAKER_29]: Will you be doing dog walking?

1620
02:12:58,223 --> 02:12:59,704
[SPEAKER_29]: Will you be doing any type of grooming?

1621
02:13:00,164 --> 02:13:01,964
[SPEAKER_29]: Will there be any type of other services offered?

1622
02:13:02,484 --> 02:13:03,745
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, do you want to take it?

1623
02:13:04,145 --> 02:13:05,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, absolutely.

1624
02:13:05,125 --> 02:13:07,786
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be providing a multitude of services.

1625
02:13:07,906 --> 02:13:11,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We have two grooming tubs downstairs for doggy baths.

1626
02:13:12,287 --> 02:13:13,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be having training after

1627
02:13:15,068 --> 02:13:16,628
[SPEAKER_07]: a certain amount of time once we hire a trainer.

1628
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:24,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We will also be providing walks, so some of our employees will be out walking the dogs that can't come to the daycare.

1629
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:29,031
[SPEAKER_07]: We provide runs and hikes in the woods that won't be at the facility.

1630
02:13:29,791 --> 02:13:36,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And as previously stated, we have an agility course, so we have some agility ramps for the dogs to do as well.

1631
02:13:36,093 --> 02:13:38,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss anything?

1632
02:13:39,214 --> 02:13:40,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, those are all of our services.

1633
02:13:41,737 --> 02:13:46,999
[SPEAKER_29]: And just if I could, what is your cost for an average stay?

1634
02:13:49,020 --> 02:13:50,361
[SPEAKER_26]: What our overhead cost is?

1635
02:13:50,681 --> 02:13:58,424
[SPEAKER_29]: If I'm a client, what does it cost me to take my dog there and have him run?

1636
02:13:58,444 --> 02:13:59,745
[SPEAKER_29]: $35 a day.

1637
02:13:59,765 --> 02:14:02,606
[SPEAKER_29]: $35, and that covers, that's not any grooming, correct?

1638
02:14:02,686 --> 02:14:07,688
[SPEAKER_26]: That is not grooming, but that would be pick up, drop off services and an entire day of daycare.

1639
02:14:08,555 --> 02:14:10,337
[SPEAKER_29]: And what percent of your business is overnight?

1640
02:14:10,577 --> 02:14:11,798
[SPEAKER_29]: Who are your house dogs overnight?

1641
02:14:12,579 --> 02:14:15,582
[SPEAKER_26]: It's actually a small percentage of our business, to be honest with you.

1642
02:14:15,622 --> 02:14:24,711
[SPEAKER_26]: Most people require daycare, so I would say we're looking more in the 20% of people who will want boarding.

1643
02:14:24,731 --> 02:14:26,533
[SPEAKER_29]: So 20% of your business is overnight?

1644
02:14:29,263 --> 02:14:34,467
[SPEAKER_26]: Other places right now, and it goes to the amount of dogs, most places are looking for daycare.

1645
02:14:34,508 --> 02:14:36,849
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a lot of clients here who can tell you how we operate.

1646
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:39,612
[SPEAKER_26]: We pick up their dog eight, nine o'clock in the morning.

1647
02:14:39,972 --> 02:14:45,797
[SPEAKER_26]: We exercise them, be it whether they want us to hike or fels, and then we drop them off when they come home, five or six.

1648
02:14:46,197 --> 02:14:48,940
[SPEAKER_26]: Sometimes they want it at three, depending on what the hours are.

1649
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:52,042
[SPEAKER_26]: When the wife comes home, the kids come home, so there's always a cycle of kids.

1650
02:14:52,483 --> 02:14:57,387
[SPEAKER_26]: The boarding is more when people go away, so it is not a big percentage of our business.

1651
02:14:58,093 --> 02:15:01,874
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, and what off-street parking do you have?

1652
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:06,256
[SPEAKER_26]: Linden Street is a public parking place.

1653
02:15:06,976 --> 02:15:07,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it off-street?

1654
02:15:07,857 --> 02:15:08,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, off-street.

1655
02:15:08,537 --> 02:15:09,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Off-street, yes.

1656
02:15:09,497 --> 02:15:14,919
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a parking lot in the front, behind our front electronic gate.

1657
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:23,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it allows, as far as we have been able to test, between about four and five cars in the parking lot at once.

1658
02:15:24,463 --> 02:15:26,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So no one will need to park on the street.

1659
02:15:26,425 --> 02:15:29,027
[SPEAKER_07]: They can come right in, drop the dog off, and then leave.

1660
02:15:29,187 --> 02:15:34,491
[SPEAKER_07]: We have drop off hours so that people aren't coming in and out at all times of day.

1661
02:15:35,592 --> 02:15:45,440
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we previously stated, that about 80 or 90% of our clients do use the complimentary pick up and drop off service because most others charge for that.

1662
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people really love the fact that we just come right to them, pick the dog up.

1663
02:15:50,744 --> 02:15:54,767
[SPEAKER_07]: and so we won't have much foot traffic or parking out front needed.

1664
02:15:57,208 --> 02:16:01,090
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you could speak a little more about, I wasn't aware there was a basement in this building.

1665
02:16:01,451 --> 02:16:01,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1666
02:16:01,931 --> 02:16:07,014
[SPEAKER_29]: The dogs have access to go down through some type of shaft, you said, or something like that?

1667
02:16:07,354 --> 02:16:10,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, it is not a shaft.

1668
02:16:11,737 --> 02:16:12,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I guarantee you.

1669
02:16:12,537 --> 02:16:15,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you would like to hold this up.

1670
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:22,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, let me get my bearings straight here.

1671
02:16:25,423 --> 02:16:28,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect, okay, so this is the front office to our building.

1672
02:16:28,644 --> 02:16:39,948
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the chance to come down and go down into the basement, so there is a stairway that goes right down under our basement area, and there is also a doggie ramp that is a nice gentle slope, it is not a shaft.

1673
02:16:40,968 --> 02:16:49,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they have the choice to come down into the basement where, you know, it's technically a basement, but it has several windows.

1674
02:16:49,050 --> 02:16:57,292
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say several, it's about 15 windows lining the whole basement because it is semi, the ceiling is above ground level.

1675
02:16:58,192 --> 02:17:03,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they have the chance to come down into the basement and down into the large garage area.

1676
02:17:05,193 --> 02:17:07,354
[SPEAKER_29]: Is the facility completely air conditioned?

1677
02:17:07,774 --> 02:17:08,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and heated.

1678
02:17:14,916 --> 02:17:15,276
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

1679
02:17:17,657 --> 02:17:19,318
[SPEAKER_44]: One last follow-up through the chair.

1680
02:17:19,798 --> 02:17:26,000
[SPEAKER_44]: With regards to, that was actually going to be a question of mine too, where does the pee go?

1681
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:36,724
[SPEAKER_44]: With regards to if the turf expert can explain, you had mentioned that you haven't got any complaints about the smell or odor, especially if it's washed down once per day.

1682
02:17:38,024 --> 02:17:46,470
[SPEAKER_44]: But what are you comparing that to as far as how large of projects have you done, how many facilities, what number of dogs have they housed?

1683
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:51,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would compare that to very similar projects such as this.

1684
02:17:52,454 --> 02:17:55,716
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done facilities that have upwards of 80 to 100 dogs a day.

1685
02:17:56,477 --> 02:17:57,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Some smaller, only 20 to 25.

1686
02:17:58,178 --> 02:18:01,020
[SPEAKER_11]: But certainly have done facilities larger than this one.

1687
02:18:02,541 --> 02:18:05,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we haven't experienced complaints such as that.

1688
02:18:06,643 --> 02:18:07,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1689
02:18:07,604 --> 02:18:08,425
[SPEAKER_42]: I have a couple of questions.

1690
02:18:10,086 --> 02:18:11,868
[SPEAKER_42]: Your hours of operation are going to be what?

1691
02:18:20,415 --> 02:18:27,461
[SPEAKER_26]: So we plan to have hours of operation between 9 to 5 where most residents will be at work.

1692
02:18:30,065 --> 02:18:33,687
[SPEAKER_26]: it really will be a 24-hour facility that we would have attendance at the whole time.

1693
02:18:33,747 --> 02:18:37,450
[SPEAKER_42]: No, but what time will people be able to bring their dog to you?

1694
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:38,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1695
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:38,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yep.

1696
02:18:38,991 --> 02:18:50,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so we plan to have a one-hour drop-off time before opening, so between 8 and 9, and between 5 and 6 is when people are allowed to come and pick up and drop off their dogs.

1697
02:18:50,898 --> 02:18:53,320
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so no one will be coming like at 10 o'clock at night?

1698
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,720
[SPEAKER_07]: No, absolutely not.

1699
02:18:56,642 --> 02:18:58,723
[SPEAKER_42]: Question, what do you do in the winter?

1700
02:19:01,016 --> 02:19:01,897
[SPEAKER_42]: When you have 50 dogs.

1701
02:19:02,957 --> 02:19:06,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So we shovel and snowblow, basically.

1702
02:19:07,199 --> 02:19:10,081
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, how does that chair hold in the winter?

1703
02:19:13,047 --> 02:19:14,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the turf's fine in the winter.

1704
02:19:15,008 --> 02:19:21,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's perfectly capable of being shoveled, snowblowed, so any conventional means of snow removal works just as well on the turf.

1705
02:19:21,792 --> 02:19:28,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you get snow off of it and there's some sun beating down on it, it's not going to be frozen throughout the whole winter.

1706
02:19:28,176 --> 02:19:33,159
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just as comfortable and safe for the dogs in the winter as it is in the other three months of the year.

1707
02:19:33,559 --> 02:19:37,061
[SPEAKER_42]: What happens to the drainage when the dogs are peeing and the ground is frozen?

1708
02:19:38,693 --> 02:19:43,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, I don't know if everyone is able to see this good enough.

1709
02:19:43,179 --> 02:19:47,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I hold this up to the light here, you can see through all that right there.

1710
02:19:47,645 --> 02:19:56,736
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have a permeable product, and then we put down the base that's underneath it, the gravel base that's underneath it.

1711
02:19:58,197 --> 02:20:01,339
[SPEAKER_11]: liquids is still able to... It's going to freeze right on top of it.

1712
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:10,845
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a lot of stone, so there's a lot of stone in there, so liquids can still permeate that, because you're always going to have voids and stuff in stone, it can still go through there.

1713
02:20:10,885 --> 02:20:13,727
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's 365 days a year it's able to drain.

1714
02:20:17,009 --> 02:20:19,710
[SPEAKER_42]: I have pictures of Linden Street with cars.

1715
02:20:22,632 --> 02:20:26,975
[SPEAKER_42]: One side is completely full, almost to the top, and the other side is resident only parking.

1716
02:20:28,552 --> 02:20:34,579
[SPEAKER_42]: If people stop parking cars on both sides, you're going to have 50 cars a day going down there.

1717
02:20:35,077 --> 02:20:35,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1718
02:20:35,678 --> 02:20:37,259
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, thank you for that question.

1719
02:20:37,279 --> 02:20:37,979
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple of things.

1720
02:20:38,219 --> 02:20:44,024
[SPEAKER_26]: One, as mentioned, probably 90 percent of our clients do pick up and drop off, so we will have very minimal.

1721
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:46,246
[SPEAKER_26]: Cars actually go there.

1722
02:20:46,646 --> 02:20:48,707
[SPEAKER_26]: It's more of a two-second.

1723
02:20:48,787 --> 02:20:52,430
[SPEAKER_26]: Somebody would run in, drive into our property, drop off the dog.

1724
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:54,512
[SPEAKER_26]: We normally will meet them at their end, and they're gone.

1725
02:20:55,132 --> 02:21:02,378
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe, additionally, Chief Sacco, who has come down to visit our facility and felt that dogs for days would not pose any impact to traffic.

1726
02:21:02,858 --> 02:21:06,040
[SPEAKER_26]: for our building in there, and included that in his report as well.

1727
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,921
[SPEAKER_26]: We're very cognizant of that.

1728
02:21:08,321 --> 02:21:17,585
[SPEAKER_26]: This is an important street for us, so we wouldn't want it lined with a bunch of people, hence why we do have, and hopefully maybe you guys have even seen some of our vehicles driving throughout the city of Medford now.

1729
02:21:17,965 --> 02:21:23,208
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why we do require pickup, or we actually offer the pickup and drop-offs, so we don't have a bunch of congestion.

1730
02:21:24,241 --> 02:21:30,925
[SPEAKER_42]: Getting back to the winter, when the dogs aren't able to, well, are you going to be able to house 50 dogs, 60 dogs in that building?

1731
02:21:32,366 --> 02:21:37,168
[SPEAKER_42]: I have a dog also, and now he gets in the winter, he gets cold, he goes out the door, he says, I'm not going out.

1732
02:21:39,129 --> 02:21:39,370
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yes.

1733
02:21:40,690 --> 02:21:45,553
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, we have a lot of dogs with cute little Christmas sweaters, and so, yes.

1734
02:21:45,853 --> 02:22:04,927
[SPEAKER_26]: The answer is yes, and we will have a very state-of-the-art facility that will have not only air conditioning and heating, we have a very respectable Medford construction gentleman who has done this at several other places, who's providing state-of-the-art air conditioning and heating, and particularly for winter, so that there won't be a problem with dogs going outside.

1735
02:22:04,947 --> 02:22:09,130
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm concerned about keeping them in the building.

1736
02:22:09,450 --> 02:22:15,175
[SPEAKER_42]: Maybe you're saying this is winter, you might get a couple of days where you're not gonna have time to clear the outside.

1737
02:22:16,565 --> 02:22:18,105
[SPEAKER_42]: Where do you walk these dogs?

1738
02:22:21,226 --> 02:22:28,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I just want to note that, so before this, I worked at a doggie daycare that had no inside facility.

1739
02:22:29,067 --> 02:22:31,028
[SPEAKER_07]: They had about 30,000 square feet outside.

1740
02:22:31,128 --> 02:22:37,549
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been around for 20 years, working through the winter and through the summer, and they house about 200 dogs a day outside, and they've had zero,

1741
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:44,771
[SPEAKER_07]: issue with winter dogs.

1742
02:22:45,092 --> 02:22:54,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Some dogs don't necessarily want to play, but if you keep them moving, you keep them active, they stay warm, you make sure that we bring the cold dogs inside.

1743
02:22:54,560 --> 02:23:02,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the amount of space that we have, we could definitely house a certain amount of dogs that need to be inside and need to be outside.

1744
02:23:02,987 --> 02:23:05,769
[SPEAKER_42]: So you feel that 50 would be your maximum amount of dog you have there?

1745
02:23:06,069 --> 02:23:06,249
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1746
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:08,011
[SPEAKER_42]: And how many do you plan to board at night?

1747
02:23:08,865 --> 02:23:17,376
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, it would be based on need, but I would think there would be, if we look at our competition, they'd have anywhere from like 10 to 15, 20 dogs.

1748
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:23,203
[SPEAKER_42]: If I had to ask you now, what would your maximum be of dogs staying over?

1749
02:23:25,744 --> 02:23:30,106
[SPEAKER_26]: We would hope it would be more, but I would estimate right now that we're estimating about 20 dogs.

1750
02:23:30,126 --> 02:23:31,706
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 would be the max to stay open.

1751
02:23:31,726 --> 02:23:32,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Complete max.

1752
02:23:32,346 --> 02:23:32,906
[SPEAKER_26]: Complete max.

1753
02:23:33,126 --> 02:23:38,228
[SPEAKER_07]: On average, your average boarding is between one and 10.

1754
02:23:39,788 --> 02:23:45,430
[SPEAKER_07]: A very, very, very busy weekend is 10 or 15, and it's a weekend.

1755
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the whole month, it's just a couple of days, and it's not excessive in any way.

1756
02:23:53,167 --> 02:23:55,187
[SPEAKER_42]: And how many people are you going to have during the day?

1757
02:23:56,528 --> 02:23:57,868
[SPEAKER_26]: How many employees we will have?

1758
02:23:58,308 --> 02:24:00,928
[SPEAKER_26]: So we were looking that we will have probably ten.

1759
02:24:01,729 --> 02:24:02,489
[SPEAKER_42]: So... Oh, no.

1760
02:24:02,609 --> 02:24:04,749
[SPEAKER_42]: Like, say... And they will... We will have ten employees.

1761
02:24:04,789 --> 02:24:08,250
[SPEAKER_42]: On a normal Tuesday morning, and you get 50 dogs, how many employees do you have?

1762
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:08,730
[SPEAKER_42]: Five.

1763
02:24:08,750 --> 02:24:08,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Five.

1764
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:12,951
[SPEAKER_42]: So you feel that one person can handle ten dogs?

1765
02:24:13,491 --> 02:24:13,891
[SPEAKER_42]: Absolutely.

1766
02:24:13,931 --> 02:24:14,411
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

1767
02:24:14,751 --> 02:24:17,731
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, that's less than the ratio of ASPCI and LICE.

1768
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:17,951
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1769
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:20,632
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1770
02:24:21,758 --> 02:24:22,819
[SPEAKER_07]: May I note one more thing?

1771
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:26,682
[SPEAKER_07]: That's five employees plus the two of us.

1772
02:24:27,402 --> 02:24:36,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So whether you believe that they can or can't handle, there's always two extra people there to handle any additional need for the dogs.

1773
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:39,952
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, well you said that one of you is not a dog trainer.

1774
02:24:41,370 --> 02:24:43,152
[SPEAKER_26]: No, we're not dog trainers.

1775
02:24:43,232 --> 02:24:47,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Are these people that are going to be there, they're going to have dog experience?

1776
02:24:47,836 --> 02:24:49,397
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, well, yes.

1777
02:24:49,437 --> 02:24:53,380
[SPEAKER_42]: Are they just going to be, you know, 20-year-old kids, you know, walking dogs?

1778
02:24:53,601 --> 02:24:53,681
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1779
02:24:53,701 --> 02:24:57,824
[SPEAKER_07]: We generally only hire people with dog experience and we train them very well.

1780
02:24:58,285 --> 02:25:07,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually spend about two weeks training each boy to ensure that they are good with the dogs and good with the clients and to make sure that they actually do know what they're doing.

1781
02:25:09,096 --> 02:25:12,959
[SPEAKER_26]: And if I may, just to go back to walking the dogs, twofold on that.

1782
02:25:13,259 --> 02:25:16,021
[SPEAKER_26]: One, the walking dog is a service that we offer now.

1783
02:25:16,261 --> 02:25:21,464
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not necessarily people come to Dogs for Days at 29 Linden Street to have their dog walked.

1784
02:25:21,825 --> 02:25:24,326
[SPEAKER_26]: We bring our cars over, we walk dogs in a group.

1785
02:25:24,686 --> 02:25:34,373
[SPEAKER_26]: The other reason why we chose this area, if I may, refer you to this map, is there is down across the street,

1786
02:25:38,419 --> 02:25:44,341
[SPEAKER_26]: So we will be bringing dogs into our bay, put them in the car, and walk them over here.

1787
02:25:44,401 --> 02:25:45,802
[SPEAKER_26]: We won't necessarily walk them.

1788
02:25:45,822 --> 02:25:47,862
[SPEAKER_42]: So you'll be taking your dogs to our new dog park?

1789
02:25:48,903 --> 02:25:49,063
No.

1790
02:25:49,303 --> 02:25:52,184
[SPEAKER_46]: If Patty will let us.

1791
02:25:56,072 --> 02:26:00,116
[SPEAKER_42]: No, I'm not joking, but you'll be taking 20 dogs to a dog park?

1792
02:26:00,136 --> 02:26:01,618
[SPEAKER_07]: No, absolutely not.

1793
02:26:01,738 --> 02:26:03,280
[SPEAKER_07]: What we meant was dogs, no.

1794
02:26:03,981 --> 02:26:06,443
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was actually saying that we would walk them along.

1795
02:26:13,653 --> 02:26:26,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we would take them out two by two, three by three, and just if they need be, they will go on a walk with an employee, not 20 at once.

1796
02:26:26,585 --> 02:26:28,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1797
02:26:30,669 --> 02:26:30,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1798
02:26:33,172 --> 02:26:33,392
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

1799
02:26:34,683 --> 02:26:35,183
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

1800
02:26:35,824 --> 02:26:43,129
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee on zoning tonight before us, we have a hearing, a public hearing on a special permit.

1801
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:47,913
[SPEAKER_49]: And this hearing is governed by chapter 48, section nine of the general laws.

1802
02:26:48,694 --> 02:27:00,943
[SPEAKER_49]: And if we take a look at chapter 48, section nine of the general laws, you know, it will say that the special special permit granting authority has the right to allow nonconforming multifamily residential use in an industrially zoned district.

1803
02:27:02,729 --> 02:27:09,630
[SPEAKER_49]: It goes on to say that in order to do that, the Special Permit Granting Authority has to find that this non-conforming multifamily residential use is in the public interest.

1804
02:27:10,271 --> 02:27:17,452
[SPEAKER_49]: So that happened, and we have a facility on Locust Street now, a multifamily residential use on Locust Street that directly abuts this property, Mr. President.

1805
02:27:18,292 --> 02:27:27,214
[SPEAKER_49]: And as we read Chapter 48, Section 9, which this hearing is being governed under, it says that the non-conforming use shall not adversely affect the existing industrial uses

1806
02:27:28,014 --> 02:27:33,659
[SPEAKER_49]: and provided further that future permitted uses will not be noxious to the non-conforming multifamily residential use.

1807
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:50,973
[SPEAKER_49]: So here before us this evening, we're gonna be asked the question on this application as to whether or not this particular site's an appropriate location, whether or not, as developed, it will not adversely affect the neighborhood, and whether or not there'll be no nuisance or serious hazards to pedestrians and to vehicles.

1808
02:27:52,538 --> 02:27:56,060
[SPEAKER_49]: We're also being asked the question as to whether or not these are adequate and appropriate facilities.

1809
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:59,081
[SPEAKER_49]: Now, Mr. President, I personally have no problem with the facilities.

1810
02:27:59,121 --> 02:28:01,242
[SPEAKER_49]: I think they are adequate and appropriate for this type of business.

1811
02:28:02,923 --> 02:28:09,886
[SPEAKER_49]: I do have serious concerns about whether or not this is going to be a nuisance or a serious hazard to pedestrians and to vehicles on Linden Street.

1812
02:28:10,026 --> 02:28:11,567
[SPEAKER_49]: Linden Street's a dead-end street, Mr. President.

1813
02:28:12,207 --> 02:28:16,949
[SPEAKER_49]: We have the petitioner here before us saying that they're going to have five employees plus two other people there.

1814
02:28:16,969 --> 02:28:17,570
[SPEAKER_49]: That's seven people.

1815
02:28:18,150 --> 02:28:23,454
[SPEAKER_49]: They have parking, as they said already, for five bays of cars that's locked between two electronic gates, Mr. President.

1816
02:28:23,534 --> 02:28:28,937
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that's going to create a serious nuisance and a serious hazard to pedestrians and to vehicles alike on that street.

1817
02:28:30,018 --> 02:28:36,542
[SPEAKER_49]: Secondly, Mr. President, as we look at this, you know, we have to say the use as developed will not adversely affect the neighborhood.

1818
02:28:36,822 --> 02:28:40,325
[SPEAKER_49]: And I don't think anybody behind this rail can say with 100 percent certainty that that's going to happen.

1819
02:28:40,805 --> 02:28:42,186
[SPEAKER_49]: I think we all have questions about noise.

1820
02:28:42,226 --> 02:28:43,427
[SPEAKER_49]: We all have questions about smell.

1821
02:28:43,487 --> 02:28:44,648
[SPEAKER_49]: We all have questions about traffic now.

1822
02:28:45,942 --> 02:28:50,645
[SPEAKER_49]: Also, Mr. President, as we look at this, the question is whether or not this is an appropriate location for such a use.

1823
02:28:51,145 --> 02:28:54,788
[SPEAKER_49]: This directly abuts a multifamily residential use.

1824
02:28:55,528 --> 02:28:59,190
[SPEAKER_49]: And the people who live in that building have come up and expressed concern, Mr. President.

1825
02:29:00,111 --> 02:29:04,834
[SPEAKER_49]: People that live there now, residents of this community, have said that this is something that they don't want in their own backyard.

1826
02:29:05,434 --> 02:29:06,915
[SPEAKER_49]: And I can understand why, Mr. President.

1827
02:29:07,055 --> 02:29:10,777
[SPEAKER_49]: I certainly think that the petitioners have done an excellent job in putting together a strong business plan.

1828
02:29:10,797 --> 02:29:14,460
[SPEAKER_49]: The petitioners have done an excellent job in putting together something that's going to be successful.

1829
02:29:15,808 --> 02:29:20,990
[SPEAKER_49]: I just don't think this is the appropriate location, Mr. President, and it's for those reasons that I'm not going to be able to support this paper this evening.

1830
02:29:21,491 --> 02:29:21,791
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

1831
02:29:23,652 --> 02:29:24,352
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions?

1832
02:29:26,873 --> 02:29:27,874
[SPEAKER_42]: Would anybody else like to speak?

1833
02:29:30,255 --> 02:29:30,935
[SPEAKER_42]: Please come forward.

1834
02:29:44,888 --> 02:29:45,988
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

1835
02:29:46,008 --> 02:29:47,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1836
02:29:47,309 --> 02:29:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 10 Brigitte Avenue in Medford.

1837
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:52,111
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jack McGoldrick, and Medford starts with me.

1838
02:29:53,032 --> 02:29:54,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a small business owner in Medford.

1839
02:29:55,173 --> 02:29:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a small ad agency called McGoldrick Marketing.

1840
02:29:58,394 --> 02:30:02,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the board of directors of Cache in Medford, board of directors of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

1841
02:30:03,136 --> 02:30:13,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School Advisory Committee for the Business, Technology, and Marketing Program and the Media Technology Program, which this beautiful new studio is the housing of.

1842
02:30:15,041 --> 02:30:19,944
[SPEAKER_02]: As a business owner, I have a couple of hard and fast rules about clients I'll work with, and I'm nervous.

1843
02:30:21,685 --> 02:30:24,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't work for clients who sell cigarettes or guns, period.

1844
02:30:25,808 --> 02:30:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'll agree to work with clients based on their individual merits.

1845
02:30:30,310 --> 02:30:38,695
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started my business in Medford, I was approached by three women whom I hold in the highest esteem, Susan Altman, Susan Fairchild, and Charlotte Scuderi.

1846
02:30:39,155 --> 02:30:40,916
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to start a civic pride program.

1847
02:30:41,437 --> 02:30:43,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We came up with the phrase, Medford starts with me.

1848
02:30:44,746 --> 02:30:52,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it never got legs, but nevertheless, the words Medford starts with me are something you can think about when you vote for this simple permit.

1849
02:30:54,275 --> 02:30:58,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It means pretty obviously that I have the power to do my part to help make Medford a better place.

1850
02:30:59,659 --> 02:31:00,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to choosing who I'll work with.

1851
02:31:02,313 --> 02:31:06,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So since opening my ad agency in Medford, I think I've chosen one.

1852
02:31:06,634 --> 02:31:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with the Mystic Valley chapter of the NAACP, Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, Cache in Medford, the Medford Chamber of Commerce, the Mystic Art Gallery, Made in Medford, Families Anonymous, Medford Community Housing, Team Medford, and the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition.

1853
02:31:25,456 --> 02:31:33,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone in this room and everyone who will eventually watch at home will agree without a doubt that I've chosen to work with good people who do good things for Medford.

1854
02:31:34,299 --> 02:31:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: While I've recently chosen to work with Dogs for Days, I've gotten to know Nick and Michelle in the process.

1855
02:31:39,281 --> 02:31:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do good things for Medford.

1856
02:31:42,102 --> 02:31:50,205
[SPEAKER_02]: As you, the esteemed city councilors of the city of Medford, you have a golden opportunity to show your constituents that you want to do good things for Medford.

1857
02:31:51,983 --> 02:31:55,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick and Michelle just want to open a mom and pop business in an industrial district.

1858
02:31:56,166 --> 02:31:56,526
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1859
02:31:56,706 --> 02:31:57,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't?

1860
02:31:58,167 --> 02:32:08,994
[SPEAKER_02]: This district is zoned for businesses that need a place, as many people have said, to operate heavy machinery, to drive their trucks and cranes and forklifts and tow trucks and backhoes and other dirty, noisy things.

1861
02:32:09,715 --> 02:32:14,418
[SPEAKER_02]: To know that they're able to earn a living running these types of businesses because they're in an industrial district.

1862
02:32:15,098 --> 02:32:22,426
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Medford zoning also dictates that an industrial district is the proper place for Dogs for Days to establish their business.

1863
02:32:22,987 --> 02:32:26,051
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a residential district, even though there are residential buildings in it.

1864
02:32:26,251 --> 02:32:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an industrial district.

1865
02:32:28,794 --> 02:32:35,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You can easily discern from the extremely detailed and well thought out plans that they have presented to you that this business will be an exemplary one.

1866
02:32:36,662 --> 02:32:46,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take a dirty, empty lot and turn it into a shiny example of the kind of business Medford so desperately needs and that the people of Medford so eagerly want.

1867
02:32:47,411 --> 02:32:49,112
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be great neighbors to everyone around them.

1868
02:32:49,793 --> 02:32:53,656
[SPEAKER_02]: This currently sad, run-down property will become a place of great happiness.

1869
02:32:55,413 --> 02:33:13,402
[SPEAKER_02]: There's absolutely no reason I can think of to deny this simple request for a permit so that a small mom-and-pop business like Dogs for Days can fulfill their dream of providing a happy place for the thousands of dog owners in Medford to let their dogs stay, play, become socialized, and be treated well by people who simply want to do just that.

1870
02:33:13,902 --> 02:33:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, do the right thing and vote in favor of this permit.

1871
02:33:24,442 --> 02:33:25,623
[SPEAKER_42]: name and address to the record please.

1872
02:33:26,084 --> 02:33:34,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi my name is Kayla Heinrichsen and I live on 34 Grove Street Medford Massachusetts and I disapprove of this motion.

1873
02:33:36,375 --> 02:33:43,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Well good evening council members and and president and city clerk and I would like to

1874
02:33:44,683 --> 02:33:57,833
[SPEAKER_15]: commend the previous speaker for their very detailed research, for their very fluid and detailed presentation, but I do have a few problems with the business model and such, so I'll read this that I wrote.

1875
02:33:59,976 --> 02:34:10,307
[SPEAKER_15]: For the past few months, a number of colleagues and myself have been volunteering at Daily Care, a local dog daycare company, and have greatly enjoyed the opportunity.

1876
02:34:10,628 --> 02:34:16,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Volunteering with Daily Care involves exercising and interacting with a small group of dogs whom we have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with.

1877
02:34:18,316 --> 02:34:21,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Each dog is well taken care of according to their individualized needs.

1878
02:34:21,921 --> 02:34:33,918
[SPEAKER_15]: However, it has come to attention that this proprietorship, as well as other local businesses, have been threatened by a larger corporate entity that may harm the dog sitting businesses around the Medford area without the benefit of real economic growth.

1879
02:34:34,878 --> 02:34:49,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Furthermore, Mr. Gavazos has challenged small dog owners who do not need a permit to gain unneeded permits for their business models as a business smear, which I'll get to later, which they also referenced in the beginning of their speech.

1880
02:34:50,794 --> 02:34:57,335
[SPEAKER_15]: We propose to keep these businesses intact, focusing on care for each dog and providing a genuine and flexible volunteering setting.

1881
02:34:58,176 --> 02:35:09,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Within the present community-based setting of area dog sitters, each dog receives constant attention and their owners receive consistent feedback on their behavior every day of their attendance in the program.

1882
02:35:09,698 --> 02:35:19,240
[SPEAKER_15]: The higher rates and fewer numbers of clients per each business in the Medford area maintains a higher quality of individualized care and attention than a larger corporation would be able to provide

1883
02:35:19,675 --> 02:35:29,864
[SPEAKER_15]: to provide, even though this isn't necessarily a corporation, it is a much larger business than the current dog sitting businesses in the area.

1884
02:35:29,884 --> 02:35:42,815
[SPEAKER_15]: A larger entity's arrival would create a surplus of dogs and lower the rate per dog, resulting in an inequity of care and potential negligence among the volunteers and staff.

1885
02:35:42,895 --> 02:35:45,417
[SPEAKER_15]: I know they mentioned, just based on what I've heard,

1886
02:35:47,268 --> 02:35:50,652
[SPEAKER_15]: they were going to have 10 dogs per person.

1887
02:35:50,773 --> 02:35:55,158
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a maximum of about five dogs per person, and we just have more companies.

1888
02:35:55,759 --> 02:36:04,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, I noticed that they charge $35 per dog at their daycare, where as we charge the most expensive

1889
02:36:04,777 --> 02:36:06,558
[SPEAKER_15]: local daycare in the area charges $35.

1890
02:36:07,978 --> 02:36:17,222
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're getting cheaper and more individualized care for a smaller number of dogs, and we're actually looking for business right now.

1891
02:36:17,282 --> 02:36:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: We have plenty of room to grow at daily care.

1892
02:36:20,984 --> 02:36:31,712
[SPEAKER_15]: The structures of current dog-sitting businesses in the area are also set up to accommodate each volunteer's schedule and abilities very flexibly, while still acting as an opportunity to care for and learn about K-9 behavior.

1893
02:36:32,312 --> 02:36:43,801
[SPEAKER_15]: In a more corporate setting, there would be a natural increase in volunteer volume, consequently requiring more lengthy screening processes, longer waiting times before starting the work, and an overall more business-like character.

1894
02:36:44,662 --> 02:36:54,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, staff and volunteer inclusion into the programs would likely be based more on vocational paperwork rather than first-hand observations of the handler's abilities by the business owner.

1895
02:36:55,851 --> 02:37:05,118
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleagues and I, for example, have had little formal job experience over the past year, yet have handled animals extensively during that period.

1896
02:37:05,818 --> 02:37:11,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Thus, we're excited on hearing about the opportunity to work with animals at Daily Care, the business that we volunteer for.

1897
02:37:12,523 --> 02:37:12,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1898
02:37:12,703 --> 02:37:20,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Daley takes great care in accommodating our needs, driving us to and from her home each time we work, saving us hours on public transportation.

1899
02:37:21,405 --> 02:37:29,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, my colleagues and my work at Daley Care has enriched our sense of community, interacting widely with members of the pet-only community at dog parks and on trails.

1900
02:37:30,626 --> 02:37:33,607
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have used the dog park on occasions.

1901
02:37:35,047 --> 02:37:40,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Furthermore, Mr. Gabat, this is getting to more what they were referencing in the beginning of their speech,

1902
02:37:41,813 --> 02:38:02,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Furthermore, Mr. Gavazos has indicated that all Kenan-related proprietorships in the Medford area must obtain a license before beginning business, which he implied to us via email, which he sent to my manager, Margaret Daly, and a few other small business owners in the Medford area, which I will eventually get to.

1903
02:38:04,620 --> 02:38:17,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Although this may be true for a large doggy daycare enterprise, dog walking itself requires no license in the Medford area, also enabling these owners to board up three dogs at night at their places of establishment.

1904
02:38:18,191 --> 02:38:31,281
[SPEAKER_15]: It becomes apparent then that Mr. Gavazos merely pressured small businesses with his attainment of a special license in order to have them out on the grounds of needing permits they are not otherwise required to have.

1905
02:38:32,642 --> 02:38:48,108
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleagues and I greatly rely on the authenticity of our business model and hope that Mr. Gavatsas does not further interfere with a highly genuine, flexible, and individualized small proprietorship, among which there are at least three in the area, and they are thriving right now.

1906
02:38:48,128 --> 02:38:55,351
[SPEAKER_15]: We're actually, as I mentioned before, we're looking for new businesses, or we're looking for new clients as we speak.

1907
02:38:58,111 --> 02:39:21,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Although the service may be appreciated in Winchester, the longstanding, and I understand that Winchester is not the prize location, the ideal location for the business, the longstanding small businesses in Medford do not need more competition or smearing in order to protect care, nor does the council need to award Mr. Gavazza a special permit to deny us our rights.

1908
02:39:23,788 --> 02:39:34,635
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll see here that the owner and all my associates have signed a petition, an informal petition, which you may actually have.

1909
02:39:34,875 --> 02:39:36,936
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll go, do I still have time?

1910
02:39:36,956 --> 02:39:40,038
[SPEAKER_42]: You have the full moment.

1911
02:39:40,058 --> 02:39:40,438
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1912
02:39:40,999 --> 02:39:46,282
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll go further into the email smearing event.

1913
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,481
[SPEAKER_42]: She has the floor.

1914
02:39:48,501 --> 02:39:49,361
[SPEAKER_42]: Let her finish.

1915
02:39:49,421 --> 02:39:53,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, my owner, my manager is in the other room.

1916
02:39:53,863 --> 02:39:55,925
[SPEAKER_15]: She has the email right now if you want to check it.

1917
02:39:56,585 --> 02:40:13,314
[SPEAKER_15]: But basically, he mentioned that an animal control officer went to one of the small business owners' home, which was also a place of business, and said that her facilities were not intact, that she was doing

1918
02:40:16,546 --> 02:40:21,551
[SPEAKER_15]: unethical practices and such where that, of course, never happened.

1919
02:40:21,992 --> 02:40:25,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, they have apologized, but that was right before this meeting.

1920
02:40:25,956 --> 02:40:30,721
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it really makes me question the business ethics of the owners.

1921
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:36,868
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if they're willing to pull something that little, you know, if they're willing to pull off something that

1922
02:40:38,194 --> 02:40:40,576
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you're waiting to chime in.

1923
02:40:40,837 --> 02:40:42,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1924
02:40:42,839 --> 02:40:57,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I don't mean to attack them personally, but ethics-wise, business ethics-wise, I view that as, you know, just kind of a behind-the-scenes, dirty, under-the-table playing.

1925
02:40:57,632 --> 02:40:59,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas we tend to...

1926
02:41:01,035 --> 02:41:02,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I have the floor?

1927
02:41:03,358 --> 02:41:03,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1928
02:41:03,798 --> 02:41:04,419
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1929
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:08,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas, you know, we are longstanding businesses.

1930
02:41:08,243 --> 02:41:09,644
[SPEAKER_15]: We have great reputations.

1931
02:41:11,927 --> 02:41:14,990
[SPEAKER_15]: And which also brings me to another point is that

1932
02:41:15,555 --> 02:41:32,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Before Mr. Gavazos, what I've heard from other business owners in the area, before Mr. Gavazos and his partner started this business, he was actually part of a failed company, which didn't make it and received horrible reviews.

1933
02:41:32,644 --> 02:41:34,685
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think we're here to attack anybody.

1934
02:41:34,985 --> 02:41:35,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1935
02:41:35,505 --> 02:41:35,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1936
02:41:36,166 --> 02:41:36,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1937
02:41:37,126 --> 02:41:39,527
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was just kind of doing my research.

1938
02:41:41,148 --> 02:41:44,670
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, this company has only been around for a year and I applaud them for their efforts.

1939
02:41:45,070 --> 02:41:46,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do applaud them.

1940
02:41:47,111 --> 02:41:55,895
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that they have a lot more to learn about the business aspect of the operation of doggie sitting, doggie daycare and such.

1941
02:41:56,816 --> 02:41:58,437
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also think that

1942
02:41:59,615 --> 02:42:10,101
[SPEAKER_15]: they could find a different location if they really wanted to without disrupting the community setting, the community-based setting of businesses around the Medford area that already exist.

1943
02:42:10,141 --> 02:42:11,762
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, what's my time?

1944
02:42:13,864 --> 02:42:14,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1945
02:42:14,564 --> 02:42:17,426
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want, okay, all right, I'll go fast.

1946
02:42:17,786 --> 02:42:19,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1947
02:42:21,228 --> 02:42:23,850
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and also about the stress of the dogs.

1948
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:30,456
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli, you actually mentioned the stress and that is a really big part.

1949
02:42:31,117 --> 02:42:34,180
[SPEAKER_15]: And I actually have a firsthand view of that.

1950
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:41,186
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a dog at one of our, at our facility that had a huge barking problem.

1951
02:42:41,246 --> 02:42:43,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And then when I started volunteering,

1952
02:42:44,756 --> 02:42:48,778
[SPEAKER_15]: that eventually seceded or that ceased.

1953
02:42:48,958 --> 02:42:55,560
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, it takes a lot of individualized care and attention to deal with this.

1954
02:42:55,620 --> 02:43:00,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you have 10 dogs per person, that's not individualized care.

1955
02:43:00,262 --> 02:43:02,763
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not say individualized care for me.

1956
02:43:05,252 --> 02:43:10,734
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, I guess, in conclusion, I would emphasize the business ethics of the owners.

1957
02:43:11,975 --> 02:43:20,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And I worry about them overcharging or undercharging for the animals that they take care of.

1958
02:43:20,117 --> 02:43:22,658
[SPEAKER_15]: And I worry about the animals themselves.

1959
02:43:22,718 --> 02:43:28,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they're willing to do something like that, what are they willing to do to the animals?

1960
02:43:28,801 --> 02:43:31,782
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, I worry about, you know,

1961
02:43:33,255 --> 02:43:43,882
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I just don't think that this is going to make a big financial difference in the area to allow a permit for dogs for days.

1962
02:43:44,042 --> 02:43:48,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we charge the same thing, but for more individualized care and better care in the end.

1963
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:49,660
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1964
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:50,781
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the director, please.

1965
02:43:50,941 --> 02:43:53,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

1966
02:43:54,162 --> 02:43:58,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also the owner of Cosmopolitan Real Estate and we deal with a lot of tenants in the city of Medford.

1967
02:43:59,604 --> 02:44:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to ask you to side on housing.

1968
02:44:02,485 --> 02:44:04,086
[SPEAKER_03]: We are having a housing crisis.

1969
02:44:04,146 --> 02:44:10,028
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not have enough housing for the people that want to live here, for the people that can afford to live here.

1970
02:44:10,529 --> 02:44:12,589
[SPEAKER_03]: The price of housing has gotten outrageous.

1971
02:44:13,190 --> 02:44:15,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone keeps talking about Locust Street.

1972
02:44:15,471 --> 02:44:18,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember when those buildings were gonna go up.

1973
02:44:19,092 --> 02:44:25,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford was excited because it got rid of a lot of the auto body shops, and it brought in some housing that we needed.

1974
02:44:26,154 --> 02:44:32,696
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as Linden Ave always being industrial, I have been informed by one of the neighbors, and I did do some home research.

1975
02:44:33,236 --> 02:44:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Linden Ave was originally built back in the 1800s as the boarding houses for the people that worked on the ships.

1976
02:44:39,918 --> 02:44:43,379
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the history behind that, I would defer to the historical society.

1977
02:44:43,939 --> 02:44:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: The families that are down there, the tenants that are there,

1978
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,904
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't choose to live in an industrial neighborhood.

1979
02:44:50,345 --> 02:44:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where they can afford to live.

1980
02:44:52,889 --> 02:45:00,601
[SPEAKER_03]: To put something like this on Linden Avenue directly across the street from an eight-unit building that was built in 1880.

1981
02:45:02,384 --> 02:45:04,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Those tenants are only going to be able to put up with so much.

1982
02:45:05,366 --> 02:45:07,807
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a tired city after all the airplanes.

1983
02:45:07,967 --> 02:45:10,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy that those have started to succeed.

1984
02:45:10,729 --> 02:45:14,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to live next to a daycare for dogs, and I don't think most people will.

1985
02:45:15,212 --> 02:45:19,494
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot that 57,000 people will agree upon, but I think that is one point.

1986
02:45:19,934 --> 02:45:21,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to live next to it.

1987
02:45:21,916 --> 02:45:30,281
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as a special permit, I do believe that this body, whatever people were on it at that time, when they said to have a dog kennel,

1988
02:45:31,121 --> 02:45:33,564
[SPEAKER_03]: or livestock, you need to have a special permit.

1989
02:45:34,124 --> 02:45:38,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think the reason was because they wanted to make sure it was going to go in the right location.

1990
02:45:39,169 --> 02:45:48,559
[SPEAKER_03]: There is other property that is available for rent in the city of Medford that is a much more suitable location that does not abut residential homes.

1991
02:45:49,019 --> 02:45:53,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just ask that you think about the people that live in those homes, the tenants.

1992
02:45:53,162 --> 02:45:55,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if the owner built it with spot zoning.

1993
02:45:56,104 --> 02:45:59,126
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that live in the buildings all have a right to peace.

1994
02:45:59,507 --> 02:46:01,468
[SPEAKER_03]: They're okay with some noise during the day.

1995
02:46:01,888 --> 02:46:07,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Linden Ave, those tenants and those landlords and those trucking companies, they've got their own jive going.

1996
02:46:07,773 --> 02:46:09,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It works over there.

1997
02:46:09,594 --> 02:46:15,858
[SPEAKER_03]: To bring in a daycare for dogs, I think it's going to upset the neighborhood and there's only so much the people can handle.

1998
02:46:16,539 --> 02:46:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the people that are living in the apartment building right behind it, I don't want to look out my back window and see 50 dogs behind me.

1999
02:46:24,664 --> 02:46:25,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to smell it.

2000
02:46:25,684 --> 02:46:26,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to put up with it.

2001
02:46:27,305 --> 02:46:34,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Those people chose to live there, but if they went another 100 feet down a Lumiere, they're going to be paying another $1,000 a month.

2002
02:46:34,610 --> 02:46:38,373
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this is coming down to affordability and keeping Medford home for all.

2003
02:46:39,869 --> 02:46:40,209
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2004
02:46:45,534 --> 02:46:46,555
[SPEAKER_32]: Name and address of the record, please.

2005
02:46:48,613 --> 02:46:49,654
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2006
02:46:49,954 --> 02:46:51,815
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2007
02:46:51,955 --> 02:47:00,019
[SPEAKER_32]: Just to address the need for more businesses in Medford, you can go across this city and see tons of empty storefronts.

2008
02:47:00,699 --> 02:47:12,545
[SPEAKER_32]: Bringing in a new business that's offering jobs, that's more revenues for the city of Medford, could be used to offset other things that we need, like police and equipment for the firefighters and fixing streets and roads.

2009
02:47:13,026 --> 02:47:13,746
[SPEAKER_32]: That's number one.

2010
02:47:13,766 --> 02:47:16,728
[SPEAKER_32]: Number two, I think Nick and Michelle made a really good case.

2011
02:47:17,468 --> 02:47:25,378
[SPEAKER_32]: to address some of the points that were just made about a lack of smell, about a lack of noise, about it being a good location.

2012
02:47:26,379 --> 02:47:33,408
[SPEAKER_32]: In reference to what Councilor Knight brought up under the Mass State Laws, I've seen this body of proof permits

2013
02:47:33,868 --> 02:47:38,893
[SPEAKER_32]: with stipulations that in six months we'll revisit it to take a look at what the impact was.

2014
02:47:39,574 --> 02:47:42,197
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that you would consider that in considering this business.

2015
02:47:42,237 --> 02:47:48,803
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think these people want to spend a million dollars and then in six months and have a poor impact.

2016
02:47:48,823 --> 02:47:50,305
[SPEAKER_42]: What if that would happen?

2017
02:47:50,545 --> 02:47:52,647
[SPEAKER_42]: Or hours of work stipulations.

2018
02:47:52,667 --> 02:47:53,448
[SPEAKER_42]: That's not an option.

2019
02:47:53,468 --> 02:47:55,410
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not an option for these people.

2020
02:47:56,491 --> 02:48:00,333
[SPEAKER_32]: But I say that based upon the fact that they've done their homework and they've done their research.

2021
02:48:00,393 --> 02:48:05,276
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm confident that within a few months, you won't find the adverse impacts.

2022
02:48:05,657 --> 02:48:08,118
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, these people are loving their dogs.

2023
02:48:08,458 --> 02:48:10,460
[SPEAKER_32]: This is going to be a good business for Medved.

2024
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,082
[SPEAKER_32]: Me personally, I would love to live right next door.

2025
02:48:15,223 --> 02:48:16,144
[SPEAKER_32]: to a dog kennel.

2026
02:48:16,645 --> 02:48:17,265
[SPEAKER_32]: I love dogs.

2027
02:48:17,285 --> 02:48:19,308
[SPEAKER_32]: I've grown up with dogs my whole life.

2028
02:48:19,688 --> 02:48:20,950
[SPEAKER_32]: I lost my dog last summer.

2029
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:22,511
[SPEAKER_32]: I got another one three weeks later.

2030
02:48:22,952 --> 02:48:25,475
[SPEAKER_32]: I think this is nothing but a win-win for the city of Medford.

2031
02:48:25,915 --> 02:48:29,299
[SPEAKER_32]: I strongly urge this board to approve this permit.

2032
02:48:29,619 --> 02:48:30,921
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

2033
02:48:30,981 --> 02:48:31,642
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

2034
02:48:40,771 --> 02:48:41,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address of the wreckage, please.

2035
02:48:42,271 --> 02:48:44,772
[SPEAKER_28]: Ray DeLovo, Woodside Road in Medford.

2036
02:48:45,752 --> 02:48:57,795
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have a lot to say about the mechanics of this whole thing, but I want to tell you that we have a red-boned coonhound that sits by the front window in the morning and waits for them to come.

2037
02:48:58,956 --> 02:48:59,636
[SPEAKER_28]: She won't even eat.

2038
02:49:01,256 --> 02:49:04,077
[SPEAKER_28]: As soon as she sees that truck, she gets so excited.

2039
02:49:05,243 --> 02:49:09,087
[SPEAKER_28]: All you have to do is open the door, and she doesn't even run in the street.

2040
02:49:09,567 --> 02:49:11,569
[SPEAKER_28]: They know she doesn't even need a leash.

2041
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:15,634
[SPEAKER_28]: She goes right to the back of that truck and jumps right in there.

2042
02:49:17,355 --> 02:49:23,482
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know two other people in this entire world that will take better care of a dog than those two people.

2043
02:49:24,288 --> 02:49:25,768
[SPEAKER_28]: They are very, very good.

2044
02:49:26,028 --> 02:49:26,628
[SPEAKER_28]: They care.

2045
02:49:27,809 --> 02:49:29,709
[SPEAKER_28]: They bring them back at the right time.

2046
02:49:29,749 --> 02:49:31,189
[SPEAKER_28]: They pick them up at the right time.

2047
02:49:31,509 --> 02:49:33,130
[SPEAKER_28]: They are very, very astute people.

2048
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:38,471
[SPEAKER_28]: So as far as the right people to do this, they're in.

2049
02:49:39,171 --> 02:49:39,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2050
02:49:46,752 --> 02:49:47,793
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2051
02:49:48,253 --> 02:49:50,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Jennifer Keenan, 250 Grove Street.

2052
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:52,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.

2053
02:49:53,090 --> 02:49:54,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an 11-year resident of Medford.

2054
02:49:55,211 --> 02:50:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also a local real estate agent, the newest member of the Medford Historical Commission, and an avid dog lover.

2055
02:50:02,033 --> 02:50:06,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I wholly support the proposed business, Dogs for Days, and their proposed location.

2056
02:50:06,394 --> 02:50:10,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I would kindly ask the members of the council to approve their special permit.

2057
02:50:11,055 --> 02:50:16,877
[SPEAKER_06]: My family, and I suspect other Medford families, would benefit greatly from having a doggie daycare here in Medford.

2058
02:50:17,497 --> 02:50:21,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the daycare we send our dog to is located out of town.

2059
02:50:21,878 --> 02:50:25,440
[SPEAKER_06]: We would love to be able to support a business in town here in Medford.

2060
02:50:26,121 --> 02:50:28,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We are very excited for the new dog park that is currently being built.

2061
02:50:29,363 --> 02:50:33,045
[SPEAKER_06]: This daycare is the perfect next step for those of us with furry children.

2062
02:50:34,441 --> 02:50:48,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, during these recent times of active talk regarding zoning and a master plan and other changes happening in Medford, for better or for worse, this is a great example of a business trying to open in an appropriately zoned area.

2063
02:50:49,267 --> 02:50:56,930
[SPEAKER_06]: We should support this kind of development and encourage other business owners to do the same, not discourage them or make them feel unwelcome in any way.

2064
02:50:57,730 --> 02:51:05,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I strongly urge and respectfully ask the council members to approve their special permit and let this well-needed business open its doors for the residents of Medford.

2065
02:51:05,846 --> 02:51:06,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2066
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,121
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the wreckage, please, sir.

2067
02:51:23,362 --> 02:51:27,385
[SPEAKER_54]: Name, first of all, I apologize, I left my hearing aid on the kitchen table.

2068
02:51:29,047 --> 02:51:30,828
[SPEAKER_54]: So make sure you talk loud enough.

2069
02:51:31,309 --> 02:51:32,590
[SPEAKER_54]: I'll let you borrow mine if you want.

2070
02:51:32,610 --> 02:51:38,295
[SPEAKER_54]: My name, you want my name, is Albert A. Massascusa, 27 Local Street, Apartment 3.

2071
02:51:39,296 --> 02:51:46,103
[SPEAKER_54]: I've lived in Local Street for 95 years, except for five years I went in World War II.

2072
02:51:47,705 --> 02:51:55,407
[SPEAKER_54]: And I've had, I've opposed a dog kennel in that area before.

2073
02:51:55,427 --> 02:52:01,348
[SPEAKER_54]: 25 or 30 years ago, Dr. DeCristoforo wanted to open a kennel on Locust Street.

2074
02:52:02,208 --> 02:52:04,289
[SPEAKER_54]: And it was a big crowd to oppose it.

2075
02:52:05,069 --> 02:52:15,691
[SPEAKER_54]: So after a long debate, I told the council, when these dogs start barking, these people are gonna call each and every one of you

2076
02:52:17,587 --> 02:52:19,489
[SPEAKER_54]: in any time of the day or night.

2077
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:26,393
[SPEAKER_54]: The council defeated the kennel seven to nothing.

2078
02:52:27,774 --> 02:52:36,760
[SPEAKER_54]: Another thing I want to tell you, Mr. Dougherty put a fortune in building them three well-kept apartment houses.

2079
02:52:37,361 --> 02:52:39,722
[SPEAKER_54]: Everybody squawked about Locust Street.

2080
02:52:40,062 --> 02:52:42,324
[SPEAKER_54]: No sidewalk, this and that.

2081
02:52:42,604 --> 02:52:43,925
[SPEAKER_54]: He made it beautiful.

2082
02:52:44,605 --> 02:52:46,547
[SPEAKER_54]: Now they want to put,

2083
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:51,542
[SPEAKER_54]: a kennel in back of it, which doesn't seem fair at all.

2084
02:52:52,282 --> 02:53:04,188
[SPEAKER_54]: And if you want to put a kennel in Method, it should be on either Commercial Street, Mystic Avenue, or in back of Stop and Shop in a food agency, away from the homes.

2085
02:53:04,728 --> 02:53:12,712
[SPEAKER_54]: If people will tell you barking doesn't carry, if you've got two minutes, I'm going to tell you a little story about barking.

2086
02:53:13,623 --> 02:53:16,384
[SPEAKER_54]: Years ago, they used to walk the beat, the police.

2087
02:53:17,264 --> 02:53:19,785
[SPEAKER_54]: And Locust Street was Officer Bell's beat.

2088
02:53:20,746 --> 02:53:22,846
[SPEAKER_54]: And we had a big German shepherd.

2089
02:53:23,647 --> 02:53:29,749
[SPEAKER_54]: And Officer Bell was way up with the bowling alley where Stop and Shop is now.

2090
02:53:30,709 --> 02:53:33,790
[SPEAKER_54]: And he heard this German shepherd bark way up there.

2091
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:38,752
[SPEAKER_54]: And he ran down to Locust Street and had broken into one of the buildings.

2092
02:53:39,867 --> 02:53:42,891
[SPEAKER_54]: Now I really expect a down vote from you people.

2093
02:53:43,492 --> 02:53:44,573
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you very much.

2094
02:53:44,794 --> 02:53:45,134
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2095
02:53:49,746 --> 02:53:50,566
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

2096
02:53:50,987 --> 02:54:04,436
[SPEAKER_48]: Back several months ago, several months ago, Albert, the council, myself and Councilor Penter, I believe, if he's still around here, had put forward a council resolution to congratulate you.

2097
02:54:04,596 --> 02:54:08,298
[SPEAKER_49]: The Medford City Council had put forward a resolution to congratulate you some months back.

2098
02:54:14,583 --> 02:54:16,086
[SPEAKER_54]: Several months ago.

2099
02:54:16,206 --> 02:54:17,650
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes about the metal.

2100
02:54:17,710 --> 02:54:19,915
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm really ashamed of the council the type of

2101
02:54:29,898 --> 02:54:31,639
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm a knight, right now, I'm a knight.

2102
02:54:32,299 --> 02:54:32,899
[SPEAKER_48]: Me too.

2103
02:54:32,939 --> 02:54:33,920
[SPEAKER_48]: Medal of Honor.

2104
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:35,261
[SPEAKER_54]: I know, I know.

2105
02:54:35,301 --> 02:54:42,124
[SPEAKER_54]: Mr. Dello Russo, he met the Councilor for coming in to give me the medal.

2106
02:54:42,544 --> 02:54:45,886
[SPEAKER_54]: He met him down the hallway and he told him all about it.

2107
02:54:45,906 --> 02:54:48,507
[SPEAKER_54]: Do you think he'd mention it in front of the Councilor?

2108
02:54:49,207 --> 02:55:13,945
[SPEAKER_48]: never well the council did mention it Albert myself a Councilor and Councilor pet to put it forward to so we asked you to come down and we wanted to congratulate you and since we have you here tonight hopefully give you a round of applause thank you sir and it's also Albert's 95th birthday

2109
02:55:18,290 --> 02:55:18,931
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2110
02:55:22,854 --> 02:55:23,815
[SPEAKER_44]: Comic relief.

2111
02:55:23,915 --> 02:55:25,136
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2112
02:55:25,416 --> 02:55:29,980
[SPEAKER_08]: ComEd, Palmezano, 43 Brackett Street, Medford.

2113
02:55:30,040 --> 02:55:33,183
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I'd like to thank the council and the clerk.

2114
02:55:34,104 --> 02:55:36,205
[SPEAKER_08]: We're bringing a piece of the city up here with you every week.

2115
02:55:36,305 --> 02:55:37,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a pain.

2116
02:55:38,286 --> 02:55:39,366
[SPEAKER_08]: We all appreciate it.

2117
02:55:39,867 --> 02:55:45,329
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, also born and raised in the city and have a business on Locust Street.

2118
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,350
[SPEAKER_08]: September will be 25 years.

2119
02:55:49,808 --> 02:55:51,110
[SPEAKER_08]: on a permit by this council.

2120
02:55:51,751 --> 02:55:56,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I have nothing against these people, and that's a great idea and what a presentation they put on.

2121
02:55:58,319 --> 02:56:06,248
[SPEAKER_08]: But to quote the backing up dirty backhoes and forklifts and all, that stops at 6 o'clock at night.

2122
02:56:07,189 --> 02:56:21,201
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no there's no 24-hour garages or 24-hour backing up trucks or what have you It's that own now you want to put 400 units next door to us with a garage people complain about it we

2123
02:56:22,822 --> 02:56:41,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Neighbors out back of us came and made a deal if you will and you know you live in Medford You don't want to go home and smell paint when you have a barbecue Okay that I won't spray past 4 30 at night anymore We worked it out But I don't really don't think that area and also washing it off.

2124
02:56:41,548 --> 02:56:42,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's it go?

2125
02:56:42,149 --> 02:56:42,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know

2126
02:56:44,415 --> 02:56:46,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, you know, there's no drains.

2127
02:56:46,296 --> 02:56:51,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it keep it on the property and you get it pumped out or something, or that's just going right down the sidewalk?

2128
02:56:51,917 --> 02:56:56,899
[SPEAKER_08]: There's supposed to be, you know, like I said, clarification maybe on that through you, Mr. President.

2129
02:56:57,599 --> 02:57:08,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, you're trying to, three years ago, you had Eddie's want to do the bakery where my golf house, where Corvino's is, and they wouldn't let them go around the clock.

2130
02:57:11,105 --> 02:57:16,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think if it was daycare, okay, fine, the gate's locked by 8 o'clock at night, whatever, same as that.

2131
02:57:17,310 --> 02:57:22,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have your quiet enjoyment over there and 60 families that are up against it.

2132
02:57:22,615 --> 02:57:23,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's nothing against these people.

2133
02:57:23,976 --> 02:57:24,677
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great idea.

2134
02:57:24,697 --> 02:57:28,020
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go in business and take your chance, go, I love you.

2135
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:29,801
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just, I don't see it working.

2136
02:57:30,302 --> 02:57:30,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for your minutes.

2137
02:57:39,619 --> 02:57:48,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members of the council, I think the petitioners did a great job putting forth their proposal and their business plan.

2138
02:57:48,563 --> 02:57:53,646
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I don't think they've met the threshold that Chapter 40 requires.

2139
02:57:54,206 --> 02:57:57,328
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it would be derogatory to the neighborhood in general.

2140
02:57:58,128 --> 02:58:02,852
[SPEAKER_20]: people have spent a lot of money, you know, improving the local street area.

2141
02:58:03,272 --> 02:58:09,537
[SPEAKER_20]: You have some great apartment buildings, and as Kelly Catalo said, you know, we need housing for our citizens.

2142
02:58:09,597 --> 02:58:13,921
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't necessarily need a dog kennel, so to speak.

2143
02:58:14,441 --> 02:58:18,325
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would respectfully urge you to vote no on this proposal.

2144
02:58:18,585 --> 02:58:18,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2145
02:58:18,945 --> 02:58:19,305
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2146
02:58:23,969 --> 02:58:24,770
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion?

2147
02:58:33,573 --> 02:58:34,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address of the record, please.

2148
02:58:35,336 --> 02:58:36,438
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is C.J.

2149
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:36,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Daugherty.

2150
02:58:37,039 --> 02:58:39,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 14 Riling Pond Road in Lincoln, Mass.

2151
02:58:40,004 --> 02:58:45,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Up until two years ago, I was a lifelong resident of Medford, Saltonstall Road, Grove Street, Woburn Street.

2152
02:58:48,095 --> 02:58:52,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford is where my family settled when I was born, and we're still a huge part of the city, I like to think.

2153
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:56,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I often joke that the city of Medford is a third of my personality.

2154
02:58:57,204 --> 02:58:58,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I care about it passionately.

2155
02:58:59,946 --> 02:59:00,927
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's an honor to speak here.

2156
02:59:01,267 --> 02:59:03,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally, I really enjoy public speaking.

2157
02:59:03,349 --> 02:59:04,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of you know that.

2158
02:59:05,311 --> 02:59:09,715
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm nervous today, because in my house growing up, we didn't watch the Red Sox or the Bruins or the Celtics.

2159
02:59:10,336 --> 02:59:11,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We watched city council meetings.

2160
02:59:12,505 --> 02:59:18,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So Councilor Penta, Councilor Mayocco, Maloney were bigger stars to me than Wade Boggs and Robert Parish and Mike Greenwell.

2161
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:20,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's intimidating to be here.

2162
02:59:20,687 --> 02:59:23,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Had it been in the hall, I would have been a little more nervous.

2163
02:59:24,148 --> 02:59:32,270
[SPEAKER_10]: In growing up and watching those meetings, there were hours of debate on small issues like whether or not neon lights should be allowed on Mystic Avenue.

2164
02:59:34,091 --> 02:59:41,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Penta would frequently lose his mind because he wanted what was right for the city, and that wasn't what was necessarily right for the businesses.

2165
02:59:43,418 --> 02:59:51,820
[SPEAKER_10]: And it always stuck with me that the level of stewardship historically shown by this council mattered, that the people of Medford mattered to this council.

2166
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:57,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And today, we've all sat here and heard arguments for and against.

2167
02:59:58,461 --> 03:00:04,903
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard support ranging far and wide from all areas of this city and beyond.

2168
03:00:07,060 --> 03:00:14,445
[SPEAKER_10]: but none from Hall Street, none from Linden Ave, none from Locust Street, none from Riverside Ave, very few, if any, from Wellington.

2169
03:00:16,046 --> 03:00:25,012
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very easy to live on North Cedar Road, to live in Winchester, to live in Andover, and say, this city needs these dog parks.

2170
03:00:25,613 --> 03:00:26,733
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to be there.

2171
03:00:28,394 --> 03:00:31,957
[SPEAKER_10]: They go home, or they don't even go to this neighborhood.

2172
03:00:31,997 --> 03:00:33,358
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know where Linden Street is.

2173
03:00:35,191 --> 03:00:40,232
[SPEAKER_10]: A van comes and their coonhound comes running and they go away and they come back at the end of the day.

2174
03:00:42,033 --> 03:00:54,256
[SPEAKER_10]: In the, and I'll speak just on a side note, the apartments that I'm here to represent, in the construction company with the beeping trucks that I also represent, are spoken of like dirty words tonight.

2175
03:00:56,456 --> 03:00:57,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Those apartments are there.

2176
03:00:58,377 --> 03:00:59,277
[SPEAKER_10]: People live there.

2177
03:00:59,637 --> 03:01:01,458
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 57 units, approximately 128 people.

2178
03:01:03,794 --> 03:01:06,535
[SPEAKER_10]: These people wake up in the morning and have their coffee there.

2179
03:01:06,996 --> 03:01:09,317
[SPEAKER_10]: They read their children bedtime stories there.

2180
03:01:09,957 --> 03:01:11,838
[SPEAKER_10]: They aren't inconvenient facts.

2181
03:01:12,659 --> 03:01:13,379
[SPEAKER_10]: They're people.

2182
03:01:13,579 --> 03:01:14,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They're citizens of Medford.

2183
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:17,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them work the second shift.

2184
03:01:17,181 --> 03:01:18,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them work the third shift.

2185
03:01:18,722 --> 03:01:19,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them sleep during the day.

2186
03:01:21,268 --> 03:01:24,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It was discussed that there'll be weekend boarding.

2187
03:01:24,591 --> 03:01:26,953
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when most of the weekend boarding will happen.

2188
03:01:27,353 --> 03:01:28,614
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when everyone's home.

2189
03:01:29,095 --> 03:01:31,597
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when you expect peace and quiet around the clock.

2190
03:01:32,117 --> 03:01:34,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when our construction companies don't operate.

2191
03:01:34,639 --> 03:01:38,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Furthermore, having a proximity to construction companies

2192
03:01:39,350 --> 03:01:43,111
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been discussed like we're building buildings at our facilities.

2193
03:01:43,972 --> 03:01:51,874
[SPEAKER_10]: We leave at 7 and come back at 5, unless there's a snow emergency in which we have to start our vehicles to come up here so that school opens the next day.

2194
03:01:53,055 --> 03:01:56,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Construction doesn't happen in the location of the construction facility.

2195
03:01:57,276 --> 03:02:02,838
[SPEAKER_10]: The only construction that's happening now could be addressed by the party that was here initially, because they're rebuilding Meadow Glen Mall.

2196
03:02:06,110 --> 03:02:09,791
[SPEAKER_10]: constant noise from landscaping, the lawn gets cut once a week.

2197
03:02:10,331 --> 03:02:13,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you time it right, there's landscaping on Locust Street.

2198
03:02:13,492 --> 03:02:14,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Beyond that, that's it.

2199
03:02:15,012 --> 03:02:18,893
[SPEAKER_10]: All those industrial companies that are there open in the morning and close at night.

2200
03:02:19,593 --> 03:02:22,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not—Cardi isn't doing test boring in their own parking lot.

2201
03:02:23,934 --> 03:02:25,154
[SPEAKER_10]: They go to Winchester.

2202
03:02:25,194 --> 03:02:26,135
[SPEAKER_10]: They go to Burlington.

2203
03:02:26,415 --> 03:02:27,515
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not doing it right there.

2204
03:02:29,496 --> 03:02:40,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Furthermore, when we talk, I am not a dog turf expert, but I'd say there are very few people who know more about digging dirt in Medford than I do, particularly in that exact proximity.

2205
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:45,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford substrate there is clay, which is not permeable.

2206
03:02:45,935 --> 03:02:48,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Furthermore, the water table is down two feet.

2207
03:02:49,195 --> 03:02:53,256
[SPEAKER_10]: clay, Mr. President, will freeze and will not permeate.

2208
03:02:53,876 --> 03:03:04,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question of it's great that their magic carpet will permeate water, but it will not go anywhere, especially that it's not, in fact, water.

2209
03:03:05,399 --> 03:03:14,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless, I can't imagine a scenario where this board

2210
03:03:15,436 --> 03:03:20,819
[SPEAKER_10]: can sit here and approve a business that directly impacts citizens.

2211
03:03:23,301 --> 03:03:27,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And especially when it's only gonna benefit such a small percentage of them.

2212
03:03:28,204 --> 03:03:42,412
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're saying that we live in a city of 57,000 people, if we're gonna have 50 dogs a day, five days a week, if there's turnover every day, at most they're gonna service 250 dogs.

2213
03:03:44,418 --> 03:03:45,619
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a minuscule percentage.

2214
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:52,183
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a small just point of reference, I'm sorry if I'm off point here.

2215
03:03:53,283 --> 03:03:57,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The notion that this business is gonna save the city of Medford money.

2216
03:03:58,967 --> 03:04:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I contacted the animal control office.

2217
03:04:01,828 --> 03:04:03,910
[SPEAKER_10]: On average they spend about $2,000 a year.

2218
03:04:04,650 --> 03:04:09,413
[SPEAKER_10]: That is three cents per person in Medford is what we pay to house these animals.

2219
03:04:10,674 --> 03:04:12,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that is an asinine,

2220
03:04:14,741 --> 03:04:17,022
[SPEAKER_10]: point to make when saying this is going to be great for the city.

2221
03:04:17,882 --> 03:04:22,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, that property generates revenue as real estate tax anyway.

2222
03:04:23,424 --> 03:04:27,325
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as though this business is going to dramatically change that assessment.

2223
03:04:28,085 --> 03:04:29,506
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already generating tax.

2224
03:04:29,906 --> 03:04:33,227
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not this company that goes in there, someone else will buy it.

2225
03:04:33,327 --> 03:04:35,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone else will operate a business there.

2226
03:04:36,088 --> 03:04:38,789
[SPEAKER_10]: it will be improved regardless of who goes in.

2227
03:04:39,289 --> 03:04:46,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think it's fair to punish the residents there, who again, are people.

2228
03:04:46,851 --> 03:04:49,252
[SPEAKER_10]: They're women, they're men, they're children, they're families.

2229
03:04:50,252 --> 03:04:57,195
[SPEAKER_10]: They love Medford for such a small percentage of people who are gonna benefit from it.

2230
03:04:57,695 --> 03:05:02,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we take note of who came to support it, at least 10 of them aren't from Medford.

2231
03:05:02,936 --> 03:05:04,757
[SPEAKER_10]: So of the 50 dogs, 40 of them

2232
03:05:05,829 --> 03:05:06,950
[SPEAKER_10]: don't have a Medford accent.

2233
03:05:09,491 --> 03:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, I humbly request that this board takes all that into consideration and says no to this permit.

2234
03:05:16,575 --> 03:05:16,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2235
03:05:17,016 --> 03:05:21,818
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2236
03:05:21,838 --> 03:05:22,639
[SPEAKER_42]: Does anyone else have to speak?

2237
03:05:27,455 --> 03:05:28,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, another busy night for me.

2238
03:05:29,236 --> 03:05:30,717
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2239
03:05:30,757 --> 03:05:31,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Gene Yuzo, 35 Parris Street.

2240
03:05:32,717 --> 03:05:39,281
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to say, when the night first began, that I was skeptical and thought that this was a really bad idea.

2241
03:05:40,101 --> 03:05:40,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I did.

2242
03:05:41,702 --> 03:05:52,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Simply because it abuts a property that's a residential property, and I think that, as others have said, it is important that you have quiet enjoyment of your premises.

2243
03:05:52,967 --> 03:05:54,828
[SPEAKER_17]: But then I watched the presentation,

2244
03:05:55,888 --> 03:05:57,710
[SPEAKER_17]: and the details of construction.

2245
03:05:58,571 --> 03:06:08,298
[SPEAKER_17]: The fact that they're going to have double walls of fencing that have insulation between them to help buffer the sound of the dogs.

2246
03:06:08,919 --> 03:06:10,160
[SPEAKER_17]: The fact that they're going to have

2247
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:22,606
[SPEAKER_17]: the largest trees they possibly can install in the back to create a barrier that separates that residential unit from the new property that they're looking to put.

2248
03:06:23,406 --> 03:06:27,028
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact that they're going to also do insulation internally

2249
03:06:27,928 --> 03:06:29,989
[SPEAKER_17]: and do some traffic control with the animals.

2250
03:06:30,649 --> 03:06:47,434
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, it seems that of all of the different presentations I've seen over the past few years, for businesses and residents and various developments, that aside from one other that I can think of, this one has been very thoughtfully put together.

2251
03:06:48,514 --> 03:06:56,437
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, I would say at this juncture, I'm leaning more towards looking at the fact that it's an industrial place

2252
03:06:57,859 --> 03:07:17,502
[SPEAKER_17]: They're looking to use it in an industrial or commercial use, which is what it's intended for, and we can look to find a way to work with them together as a business that isn't a negative or net negative solution as residential units tend to be because it costs more to educate.

2253
03:07:18,162 --> 03:07:22,666
[SPEAKER_17]: children in those apartments than it does for a commercial property to run.

2254
03:07:23,146 --> 03:07:24,908
[SPEAKER_17]: We need a delicate balance between.

2255
03:07:25,668 --> 03:07:32,154
[SPEAKER_17]: And this group of individuals are coming to the city of Medford because they see that as an opportunity.

2256
03:07:33,054 --> 03:07:40,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have other things that are looking to go on Locust Street that we say shouldn't be there because Locust Street is industrial.

2257
03:07:44,118 --> 03:07:46,681
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got a bit of a mixed message going on here.

2258
03:07:48,183 --> 03:08:01,237
[SPEAKER_17]: I would think that, you know, if it's the overnight issue that's truly the issue, it's a nominal amount of the business for this group of people, perhaps they would be willing to rethink that.

2259
03:08:01,957 --> 03:08:16,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And although it's a million dollar investment, I'm sure that a gradual increase, not 100 dogs, not 50 right away, but maybe you look at 25 or 30, and you revisit it in three or six months for that additional 25 or 30.

2260
03:08:17,598 --> 03:08:18,498
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a give and take.

2261
03:08:18,578 --> 03:08:20,019
[SPEAKER_17]: There has to be a compromise.

2262
03:08:20,179 --> 03:08:23,600
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel like there could be a compromise to be reached here.

2263
03:08:24,080 --> 03:08:26,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And I hope that you guys consider that.

2264
03:08:26,581 --> 03:08:32,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that said, if we can find a middle ground, I would think that it would be a great thing for the city of Medford.

2265
03:08:33,042 --> 03:08:33,402
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2266
03:08:37,724 --> 03:08:37,944
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2267
03:08:39,847 --> 03:08:42,649
[SPEAKER_30]: Patty Flynn, 139 Grand Ave, Bedford, Mass.

2268
03:08:43,549 --> 03:08:44,470
[SPEAKER_30]: I wasn't going to speak.

2269
03:08:45,010 --> 03:08:45,671
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll make it brief.

2270
03:08:46,631 --> 03:08:51,234
[SPEAKER_30]: I think if I, first, if I was a resident, I keep hearing about the residents of Linden Street.

2271
03:08:51,714 --> 03:08:52,435
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't see them.

2272
03:08:53,676 --> 03:08:54,236
[SPEAKER_30]: Where are they?

2273
03:08:55,337 --> 03:08:56,317
[SPEAKER_30]: If they're so opposed to it.

2274
03:08:56,337 --> 03:08:57,418
[SPEAKER_42]: The gentleman just left.

2275
03:08:57,438 --> 03:08:59,719
[SPEAKER_30]: He's on Locust Street, and he can't hear.

2276
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:03,902
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry, but where are the residents that are opposing them?

2277
03:09:05,543 --> 03:09:05,743
[SPEAKER_30]: Huh?

2278
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:10,693
[SPEAKER_30]: Where are they?

2279
03:09:12,597 --> 03:09:17,247
[SPEAKER_30]: If it was me and I was bothered by something that was going to move next to me, I'd be here.

2280
03:09:18,642 --> 03:09:19,382
[SPEAKER_30]: I've said my piece.

2281
03:09:20,022 --> 03:09:24,283
[SPEAKER_30]: I think we need businesses in Medford, and I think it'd be a disservice not to grant it.

2282
03:09:24,703 --> 03:09:24,923
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2283
03:09:24,943 --> 03:09:26,044
[SPEAKER_42]: Point of information, Mr. President.

2284
03:09:26,064 --> 03:09:27,824
[SPEAKER_42]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

2285
03:09:28,524 --> 03:09:36,326
[SPEAKER_41]: Just to address that constituent, I did receive phone calls and emails from people from Linden and Locust Street.

2286
03:09:36,746 --> 03:09:47,928
[SPEAKER_41]: So, just like I received messages from the outside, so I think that we're, you know, they've sent their message to the people they elected to make sure that we understand where they stand.

2287
03:09:48,788 --> 03:09:51,311
[SPEAKER_41]: I appreciate everybody that came out tonight, so thank you.

2288
03:09:51,331 --> 03:09:52,432
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2289
03:09:52,592 --> 03:09:54,553
[SPEAKER_40]: Carla LoQuante, 49 Lorena Road.

2290
03:09:55,114 --> 03:09:55,835
[SPEAKER_40]: What city do you live in?

2291
03:09:56,095 --> 03:09:56,815
[SPEAKER_40]: Winchester, Mass.

2292
03:09:56,855 --> 03:09:57,136
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2293
03:09:57,176 --> 03:10:04,282
[SPEAKER_40]: And I have been grateful and customers of Michelle and Nick for a few years.

2294
03:10:05,323 --> 03:10:11,909
[SPEAKER_40]: I have been in business for 27 years and I have been a resident of Mass and my parents are still residents and we're dog lovers.

2295
03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:15,232
[SPEAKER_40]: From where I sit, we are in

2296
03:10:16,008 --> 03:10:19,449
[SPEAKER_40]: Forget Medford, forget Winchester, forget Malden, forget Lynn.

2297
03:10:19,869 --> 03:10:24,051
[SPEAKER_40]: We are in America, and we are here to make a living.

2298
03:10:25,011 --> 03:10:29,392
[SPEAKER_40]: They want to make a beautiful facility, state of the art.

2299
03:10:29,952 --> 03:10:34,554
[SPEAKER_40]: They're crossing their T's, they're dotting their I's, they're coming before you humbled and asking.

2300
03:10:35,334 --> 03:10:37,355
[SPEAKER_40]: Please let us run a business.

2301
03:10:37,975 --> 03:10:39,235
[SPEAKER_40]: We will do what you want us to do.

2302
03:10:39,616 --> 03:10:40,436
[SPEAKER_40]: What is wrong with that?

2303
03:10:41,691 --> 03:10:43,673
[SPEAKER_40]: Every other business has to start somewhere.

2304
03:10:44,473 --> 03:10:46,295
[SPEAKER_40]: Like I said, I started 27 years ago.

2305
03:10:46,755 --> 03:11:05,550
[SPEAKER_40]: I can't believe the past six months it's been this much angst and dialogue over creating something that is legal and necessary for young people, young people that I'm not, coming into Medford for beautiful property, beautiful condos, through realtors.

2306
03:11:06,051 --> 03:11:08,733
[SPEAKER_40]: I would think a service business makes complete sense.

2307
03:11:12,483 --> 03:11:13,343
[SPEAKER_49]: Point of information, Mr. President?

2308
03:11:13,623 --> 03:11:14,804
[SPEAKER_49]: Point of information, Councilor Knighton.

2309
03:11:14,824 --> 03:11:16,845
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't think it's the nature of the business that's anybody's concern.

2310
03:11:16,905 --> 03:11:18,305
[SPEAKER_49]: It is the very nature.

2311
03:11:18,345 --> 03:11:19,326
[SPEAKER_49]: No, it's the location.

2312
03:11:19,366 --> 03:11:21,086
[SPEAKER_49]: It's not the nature, it's the location of the business.

2313
03:11:21,287 --> 03:11:22,387
[SPEAKER_40]: As was spoken earlier, sir.

2314
03:11:22,407 --> 03:11:24,268
[SPEAKER_49]: That's why it's required to go through a special permitting process.

2315
03:11:24,288 --> 03:11:27,389
[SPEAKER_40]: And I understand that, and that's what they're doing here, and I completely understand that.

2316
03:11:27,429 --> 03:11:28,690
[SPEAKER_40]: I respect, I understand you.

2317
03:11:29,070 --> 03:11:30,010
[SPEAKER_40]: But they have showed you.

2318
03:11:30,370 --> 03:11:31,931
[SPEAKER_40]: They have looked, and they're still looking.

2319
03:11:32,531 --> 03:11:37,552
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the perfect location, real estate is what is available at the time.

2320
03:11:38,092 --> 03:11:39,032
[SPEAKER_40]: And this is where they are.

2321
03:11:39,052 --> 03:11:46,974
[SPEAKER_49]: Right, it's a perfect location for them to operate a business that they're proposing and they're coming before the council and they're asking us whether or not we feel it's a perfect location.

2322
03:11:47,754 --> 03:11:49,174
[SPEAKER_40]: But it is a perfect location.

2323
03:11:49,855 --> 03:11:50,415
[SPEAKER_48]: In your opinion.

2324
03:11:53,915 --> 03:11:54,276
[SPEAKER_40]: That's it.

2325
03:11:54,476 --> 03:11:54,736
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2326
03:11:54,756 --> 03:11:58,216
[SPEAKER_40]: I hope you vote for them because if you don't, I think that's a very sad day in Medford.

2327
03:11:58,556 --> 03:11:59,137
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

2328
03:11:59,397 --> 03:11:59,957
[SPEAKER_40]: For business.

2329
03:12:00,237 --> 03:12:00,837
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

2330
03:12:08,919 --> 03:12:10,040
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2331
03:12:10,060 --> 03:12:13,061
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm Mary Ellen Daugherty.

2332
03:12:13,141 --> 03:12:15,402
[SPEAKER_35]: I live at 173 Wilburn Street in Medford.

2333
03:12:15,962 --> 03:12:18,263
[SPEAKER_35]: I failed to pass these to you.

2334
03:12:18,303 --> 03:12:20,884
[SPEAKER_35]: These are... Larry will take care of them.

2335
03:12:27,019 --> 03:12:39,585
[SPEAKER_35]: I just want to say really briefly that the reason that this kind of facility is so difficult to place is because it's not neighborhood friendly.

2336
03:12:40,026 --> 03:12:41,286
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not people friendly.

2337
03:12:41,746 --> 03:12:44,648
[SPEAKER_35]: So it has a hard time finding a home.

2338
03:12:45,808 --> 03:12:47,029
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's all I have to say.

2339
03:12:47,629 --> 03:12:48,010
Thank you.

2340
03:12:48,070 --> 03:12:48,370
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2341
03:12:54,411 --> 03:12:55,952
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

2342
03:12:56,412 --> 03:13:00,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Charlene Duffy Saulnier, 14 Tontine Street in West Medford.

2343
03:13:02,797 --> 03:13:05,579
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this is my first city council meeting.

2344
03:13:05,599 --> 03:13:10,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in Medford all my life, and I should have been here before.

2345
03:13:12,439 --> 03:13:20,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But I actually am the administrator for the Middlesex Fells Reservation Dog Owners Group.

2346
03:13:22,941 --> 03:13:29,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I am also one of the Martab board members.

2347
03:13:30,403 --> 03:13:34,924
[SPEAKER_09]: We advise the governor about how to use money for trails for DCR.

2348
03:13:36,705 --> 03:13:40,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not representing either of those institutions when I sit here tonight.

2349
03:13:42,528 --> 03:13:52,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say that when I first met Michelle and Nick, I was introduced to them by some dog lovers who had done a lot of work in the Medford community.

2350
03:13:53,313 --> 03:14:05,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was very excited because I think if you look at the fact that if there are 57,000 of us and 10,000 of us are dog owners, then obviously that's a big percentage of the population.

2351
03:14:06,428 --> 03:14:18,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think that Medford could use, we could do to be more dog friendly because so many of our citizens own dogs.

2352
03:14:20,293 --> 03:14:32,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that they did an amazing presentation and that they put in a lot of effort to their presentation.

2353
03:14:32,772 --> 03:14:49,125
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to say, from the perspective of, you know, Fels Dog, the Fels Dog group, which I'm co-administering, we started with about 20 members, and in the time that I've been running it, we're up to about 750.

2354
03:14:50,005 --> 03:14:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's a pretty active group, you know, they try to keep the Fels clean, they do a lot of educating and things like that.

2355
03:14:57,951 --> 03:15:11,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was frantically at work one day when I got a lot of phone calls and texts saying that some pretty bad things had happened to a few of the dog walkers in Medford.

2356
03:15:13,235 --> 03:15:23,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And the gist of it was that some people in Medford had extended a hand and said, let us tell you what the story is about local business.

2357
03:15:28,070 --> 03:15:36,796
[SPEAKER_09]: they actually offered their services to help these folks get moving forward, and then found their names on a list that went to the dog officer.

2358
03:15:37,497 --> 03:15:45,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I honestly can't, I can only say that all of the parties involved have confirmed to me that that's exactly what happened.

2359
03:15:46,622 --> 03:15:54,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I had an hour and a half long conference call with Dogs for Days and they never once said they didn't do it.

2360
03:15:54,285 --> 03:16:00,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they started their presentation tonight by saying that they wish that they had not done that.

2361
03:16:00,427 --> 03:16:02,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's good behavior.

2362
03:16:02,048 --> 03:16:04,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's the behavior that you look for in a business.

2363
03:16:06,069 --> 03:16:10,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But conversely, I can't honestly sit here and say, no, I don't think they should be here.

2364
03:16:11,231 --> 03:16:13,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I should hope that they learned from what happened.

2365
03:16:14,692 --> 03:16:22,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And I should hope that they would honor the people that are here, rather than, you know, try to push them aside.

2366
03:16:22,595 --> 03:16:28,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Because despite what the other gal said, I don't think that there's so many dogs in Medford.

2367
03:16:29,017 --> 03:16:30,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's going to be that much competition.

2368
03:16:30,897 --> 03:16:33,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's plenty of business for everybody.

2369
03:16:33,578 --> 03:16:37,559
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do really believe that it's a business that we need.

2370
03:16:37,679 --> 03:16:39,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really good business model.

2371
03:16:40,901 --> 03:16:44,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And if run appropriately, I think it would be helpful for the city.

2372
03:16:46,206 --> 03:16:48,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty much what I have to say.

2373
03:16:49,249 --> 03:16:49,589
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2374
03:16:52,892 --> 03:16:58,938
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any further discussion?

2375
03:17:02,754 --> 03:17:11,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read you a letter from Shipley Mason, Vice President of Century Bank.

2376
03:17:12,064 --> 03:17:12,864
[SPEAKER_42]: We all have that letter.

2377
03:17:13,545 --> 03:17:15,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'd like to read it so everybody can hear.

2378
03:17:15,747 --> 03:17:17,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was emailed to all of you today.

2379
03:17:18,530 --> 03:17:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: July 18, 2017.

2380
03:17:18,911 --> 03:17:22,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Councilors of the City of Medford, Mass.

2381
03:17:23,820 --> 03:17:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be deciding on whether to grant a special permit to Dogs for Days LLC to allow them to open up their doggie daycare business at 29 Linden Street, Medford, Mass., this evening.

2382
03:17:33,644 --> 03:17:43,248
[SPEAKER_02]: As a senior vice president at Century Bank who has funded several of these types of ventures in the past, I can assure you that this business model will bring both benefits and revenue to the City of Medford.

2383
03:17:43,629 --> 03:17:46,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The common dog in Everett, which Century Bank also funded,

2384
03:17:47,130 --> 03:17:49,012
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a good model for you to compare this with.

2385
03:17:49,492 --> 03:17:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Medford has developed a lot of residential apartments and condos in the past year, and people need an outlet for their pets in the city rather than going to another town.

2386
03:17:58,240 --> 03:18:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Moreover, upscale tenants and buyers, the people who are choosing to move here, are expecting this type of amenity to be available in their city.

2387
03:18:06,247 --> 03:18:12,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that I am not available to attend the special permit hearing tonight in person, as I am leaving for vacation this afternoon with my family.

2388
03:18:13,634 --> 03:18:21,182
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you have any questions about the amount of revenue or other benefits this type of venture will bring to the city, please do not hesitate to reach me.

2389
03:18:21,362 --> 03:18:22,303
[SPEAKER_02]: He has his phone number.

2390
03:18:22,884 --> 03:18:30,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I have met with Michelle Legler from Dogs for Days personally, and I believe she will be a smart, hardworking business owner who will benefit the community.

2391
03:18:31,092 --> 03:18:39,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I am hoping that everyone in the City Council can see that this business will meet a growing demand for services from both the existing and many of the City's new residents.

2392
03:18:40,087 --> 03:18:43,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, Shipley C. Mason, Senior Vice President, Central Bank.

2393
03:18:44,474 --> 03:18:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2394
03:18:49,694 --> 03:18:50,855
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address of the record, please.

2395
03:18:50,876 --> 03:18:51,416
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2396
03:18:51,456 --> 03:18:54,180
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you who don't know me, Heather Champney Anderson.

2397
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:59,947
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 102 Brooks Street in Medford, and I did not come here tonight for this particular discussion.

2398
03:19:00,888 --> 03:19:07,757
[SPEAKER_18]: But what has distressed me as I sit and listen to this is that I am totally confused.

2399
03:19:08,558 --> 03:19:20,605
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, I've heard almost every one of you speak specifically to encouraging and developing more business, new business, and small business in Medford on more than one occasion.

2400
03:19:21,485 --> 03:19:23,887
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, many of your platforms have been based upon this.

2401
03:19:24,367 --> 03:19:43,819
[SPEAKER_18]: At the same time, I have been very active in the last 35 years in the community around a number of activities where citizens have come forward concerned about their neighborhoods, concerned about changes within their neighborhoods, concerned about things much worse than noise in their neighborhoods.

2402
03:19:44,060 --> 03:19:50,764
[SPEAKER_18]: And quite honestly, they have not found satisfaction with the council or some of its decisions.

2403
03:19:51,681 --> 03:20:02,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I have observed over 35 years that it does seem that there has been, and I'm not speaking to you as individuals now, because it's 35 years and some of you probably weren't even out of school.

2404
03:20:04,774 --> 03:20:08,197
[SPEAKER_18]: I am concerned, of course you were one of those.

2405
03:20:10,665 --> 03:20:16,568
[SPEAKER_18]: that I am concerned that the rules don't apply equally and evenly to everyone.

2406
03:20:17,609 --> 03:20:25,353
[SPEAKER_18]: We would not even be having this discussion had there not been a change to the industrial zoning approval in the first place.

2407
03:20:26,578 --> 03:20:40,301
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm having great difficulty in understanding why rules apply to certain individuals in the community or certain businesses in the community and not necessarily do the rules apply to others.

2408
03:20:40,761 --> 03:20:50,862
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's, I understand what a difficult position it is for all of you to have constituents who are calling, who are saying, not in my backyard, don't make noise here.

2409
03:20:50,922 --> 03:20:53,163
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know that you've all had this before.

2410
03:20:53,963 --> 03:21:12,527
[SPEAKER_18]: It is time to move Medford forward in a new direction, not to play the same 35-year-old politics that we've been hearing, and to please, let's apply rules evenly, let's not search desperately for there's going to be four ounces extra P here and, you know, two pounds of whatever here.

2411
03:21:12,587 --> 03:21:22,529
[SPEAKER_18]: These are people who have clearly brought forward a business plan, which in my opinion and experience is way more sophisticated than many of the business plans that have been brought before you.

2412
03:21:23,509 --> 03:21:49,085
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm here speaking as a citizen just concerned about what I hear and what I've seen over 35 years and really excited by the possibility of what I felt was happening in the city that we were actually moving forward looking at what was going to happen in the city now and in the future and not just consistently responding to certain issues in certain ways.

2413
03:21:49,325 --> 03:21:51,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And I am really tired of the

2414
03:21:52,047 --> 03:22:03,051
[SPEAKER_18]: These of us who are Medford versus the rest of the world, the bottom line is you're selling your properties in this community to people who have not been born here at greatly inflated prices.

2415
03:22:03,371 --> 03:22:05,531
[SPEAKER_18]: People are making money all over the place.

2416
03:22:06,132 --> 03:22:07,852
[SPEAKER_18]: It is time to stop.

2417
03:22:08,532 --> 03:22:10,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to ask the question.

2418
03:22:10,893 --> 03:22:14,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this property eventually becoming more valuable for more development?

2419
03:22:15,277 --> 03:22:17,579
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't mean development of an industrial nature.

2420
03:22:17,859 --> 03:22:30,490
[SPEAKER_18]: People have already been making, many developers have come in who are not Medford residents and who have made bucks off all of us all and the rest of us in those communities and those neighborhoods have been impacted and not always in a positive way.

2421
03:22:31,150 --> 03:22:32,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't we please move forward?

2422
03:22:32,971 --> 03:22:34,452
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an industrial area.

2423
03:22:34,752 --> 03:22:36,253
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a legitimate business.

2424
03:22:36,533 --> 03:22:37,313
[SPEAKER_18]: These are people.

2425
03:22:37,774 --> 03:22:40,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care about the competitive issue.

2426
03:22:40,275 --> 03:22:41,816
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, competition is competition.

2427
03:22:42,336 --> 03:22:48,379
[SPEAKER_18]: We have pet walkers and people who board animals in their home in our neighborhood over in West Medford.

2428
03:22:48,940 --> 03:22:50,380
[SPEAKER_18]: They do not have any licenses.

2429
03:22:50,481 --> 03:22:52,802
[SPEAKER_18]: No one has asked us about the barking, et cetera.

2430
03:22:53,422 --> 03:22:54,503
[SPEAKER_18]: No one has complained.

2431
03:22:55,423 --> 03:23:01,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there is room for a formal business, a big business of this sort, as well as for the small businesses.

2432
03:23:01,764 --> 03:23:12,606
[SPEAKER_18]: But my bottom line is my concern is where is this council and where is the future of Medford going, and are we going to treat all people in a way that is fair and equal?

2433
03:23:13,506 --> 03:23:13,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2434
03:23:13,766 --> 03:23:23,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2435
03:23:23,488 --> 03:23:24,608
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any further discussion?

2436
03:23:33,117 --> 03:23:38,083
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm Mike Lewis, 133 Pyramid Road, Medford, Mass.

2437
03:23:38,804 --> 03:23:41,828
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm a commissioner for the Medford Housing Authority on the CPC as well.

2438
03:23:42,368 --> 03:23:43,409
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm a dog owner.

2439
03:23:43,429 --> 03:23:44,050
[SPEAKER_55]: I have two dogs.

2440
03:23:44,070 --> 03:23:44,751
[SPEAKER_55]: I love them to death.

2441
03:23:46,733 --> 03:23:53,622
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm just here, I would support these residents, because if it's not this place, it's going to be where the housing authority is.

2442
03:23:53,663 --> 03:23:55,905
[SPEAKER_55]: That's where they typically put these types of businesses.

2443
03:23:56,767 --> 03:24:00,351
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm here to support those residents, even if they're not particularly here.

2444
03:24:02,343 --> 03:24:09,086
[SPEAKER_55]: The amount of noise, just because there's construction there, doesn't mean you add on additional 30, 40, 50 dogs.

2445
03:24:09,586 --> 03:24:13,968
[SPEAKER_55]: In addition, like the gentleman previously said, those construction companies, they shut down at night.

2446
03:24:14,569 --> 03:24:21,052
[SPEAKER_55]: Overnight dogs, if anyone had dogs near them during the Fourth of July, the fireworks, those dogs go nuts.

2447
03:24:21,112 --> 03:24:21,792
[SPEAKER_55]: I mean, my own do.

2448
03:24:23,013 --> 03:24:25,955
[SPEAKER_55]: So I just think it's just, I think the business plan is great.

2449
03:24:25,995 --> 03:24:27,856
[SPEAKER_55]: I think they did a fantastic job.

2450
03:24:28,677 --> 03:24:29,977
[SPEAKER_55]: I just don't think the area's right.

2451
03:24:30,518 --> 03:24:37,543
[SPEAKER_55]: In addition, I would say my dog walker called me in tears about fictitious claims made to the dog officer.

2452
03:24:37,983 --> 03:24:44,648
[SPEAKER_55]: So this company that wants to come in and do all these great things, they're going to bad mouth all the current businesses in Medford.

2453
03:24:45,228 --> 03:24:47,630
[SPEAKER_55]: and bring some bad publicity to them.

2454
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:52,433
[SPEAKER_55]: To me, that's just not the right foot you want to make coming to the city.

2455
03:24:52,913 --> 03:24:58,457
[SPEAKER_55]: So it's disconcerting that they're saying, oh, we're professional, we do this, we do that, oh, look at this turf, we got all this stuff.

2456
03:24:59,057 --> 03:25:07,463
[SPEAKER_55]: Yet we're going to make false claims and waste the city resources of the dog officer and make false claims about the businesses that have been in Medford for a number of years.

2457
03:25:10,465 --> 03:25:10,825
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2458
03:25:12,226 --> 03:25:13,287
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyone else wishing to speak?

2459
03:25:20,942 --> 03:25:28,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I know everyone's tired and wanna go home, but I just wanna speak on behalf of Nick and Michelle, and I'm in Winchester right now, but I lived in Medford for two years and Somerville for one.

2460
03:25:29,206 --> 03:25:30,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this city, I know this city.

2461
03:25:30,627 --> 03:25:31,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at Tufts University.

2462
03:25:31,768 --> 03:25:33,949
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom's a high school teacher at Medford High.

2463
03:25:34,829 --> 03:25:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a great opportunity for this town.

2464
03:25:37,791 --> 03:25:45,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that whatever concerns you guys have, I think as far as parking goes and other residents, I'm sure they can figure it out and work with the city.

2465
03:25:45,435 --> 03:25:48,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll have an off-site lot and they'll have you guys book them in.

2466
03:25:50,297 --> 03:25:50,938
[SPEAKER_04]: bring people in.

2467
03:25:52,458 --> 03:25:57,661
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the residents go, I don't think they'll have, like he said, there was a dog barking there for 45 minutes.

2468
03:25:57,801 --> 03:26:00,663
[SPEAKER_04]: If no one complained about that, I don't think it's a huge issue.

2469
03:26:01,283 --> 03:26:09,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they said they were gonna shut down at 6 p.m., the same as the construction company, and all the dogs will go inside, they'll do individual walks outside.

2470
03:26:09,768 --> 03:26:14,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fair, and they said, what is it, one for soundproofing?

2471
03:26:16,885 --> 03:26:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be a level one.

2472
03:26:18,307 --> 03:26:19,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone will hear that.

2473
03:26:20,009 --> 03:26:21,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, truly don't.

2474
03:26:21,531 --> 03:26:23,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that plan looks solid.

2475
03:26:23,473 --> 03:26:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks on point.

2476
03:26:25,115 --> 03:26:29,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, to their character, I think they are just amazing people.

2477
03:26:29,141 --> 03:26:34,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a dog that was super leash aggressive, and I asked Nick to take care of her and try to train her.

2478
03:26:35,128 --> 03:26:56,880
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't charge me any extra just for the love and the passion this is their passion and she's amazing now i can take her anywhere do anything with her she's an amazing dog i don't think that i think that they are solid people this is their passion they're here to create business for the city and to bring a great aspect to the city and i think that they're willing to work with you guys in the city

2479
03:26:57,380 --> 03:27:00,042
[SPEAKER_04]: and everyone else around them, because this is their passion project.

2480
03:27:00,102 --> 03:27:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they want to do.

2481
03:27:01,243 --> 03:27:02,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they want to bring to the city.

2482
03:27:03,245 --> 03:27:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think that we should be in support of them.

2483
03:27:06,087 --> 03:27:06,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

2484
03:27:06,747 --> 03:27:07,068
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2485
03:27:12,372 --> 03:27:13,613
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion?

2486
03:27:16,638 --> 03:27:17,018
[SPEAKER_42]: Questions?

2487
03:27:17,659 --> 03:27:20,140
[SPEAKER_42]: Any questions?

2488
03:27:21,640 --> 03:27:23,021
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2489
03:27:23,041 --> 03:27:27,923
[SPEAKER_44]: I appreciate everybody coming and letting us know where you stand.

2490
03:27:27,943 --> 03:27:31,805
[SPEAKER_44]: I would love to see some compromise.

2491
03:27:31,845 --> 03:27:33,946
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't know how the council stands.

2492
03:27:33,966 --> 03:27:41,249
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not sure if the votes are there or not, but have you created different financial models to

2493
03:27:42,103 --> 03:27:48,245
[SPEAKER_44]: potentially not do overnights and close at six o'clock, or not take 50 dogs at first.

2494
03:27:48,545 --> 03:28:01,890
[SPEAKER_44]: We have granted special permits for, with six month reviews, with a year review, and I, not that we can do that to you, I know you probably invested not just one million on the building, but additional money.

2495
03:28:03,611 --> 03:28:10,354
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's hard to negotiate tonight, because we don't, we have the land owners there, but we don't have the residents that live there.

2496
03:28:11,514 --> 03:28:21,517
[SPEAKER_44]: and I'll speak personally, that I like to hear from residents who are going to be affected by certain projects because they come first, but at the same time they're not here.

2497
03:28:21,617 --> 03:28:24,618
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just wanted to maybe ask you if you can speak to that.

2498
03:28:25,719 --> 03:28:29,240
[SPEAKER_44]: Is there any wiggle room, maybe a little negotiation we can

2499
03:28:30,141 --> 03:28:30,761
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely.

2500
03:28:31,222 --> 03:28:32,603
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you for the question.

2501
03:28:32,964 --> 03:28:34,585
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me address first the residents.

2502
03:28:35,026 --> 03:28:40,331
[SPEAKER_26]: So we actually did go down Linden Street and speak to the residents of actually Linden Street.

2503
03:28:41,212 --> 03:28:51,203
[SPEAKER_26]: I do speak Spanish in addition to English and we spoke to several people that spoke in English and Spanish and our concerns were that we heard was we have a dog, it's not a problem.

2504
03:28:51,543 --> 03:28:55,445
[SPEAKER_26]: We also spoke with Cardi and they did not have a concern as well too.

2505
03:28:55,525 --> 03:29:01,007
[SPEAKER_26]: In fact, they encouraged us, wished us best of luck, gave us a handshake and said, you know, we hope to have you as neighbors here.

2506
03:29:01,367 --> 03:29:05,169
[SPEAKER_26]: So we did speak quite a bit to the actual Linden Street residents.

2507
03:29:06,029 --> 03:29:08,170
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as compromise, absolutely.

2508
03:29:08,870 --> 03:29:14,333
[SPEAKER_26]: As Nick and I have said numerous times, we're really here to build a business and to work with the city of Medford.

2509
03:29:14,713 --> 03:29:19,355
[SPEAKER_26]: So this much talked about email, which we do have copies here for you.

2510
03:29:20,176 --> 03:29:21,917
[SPEAKER_26]: As Brianna you were actually copying on it.

2511
03:29:22,018 --> 03:29:35,532
[SPEAKER_26]: You do know that we actually inquired If we could look at would we need a permit for just doing daycare or do you need a permit solely just for doing for boarding and the response was you need a permit for

2512
03:29:35,772 --> 03:29:39,433
[SPEAKER_26]: Whether you do daycare or boarding, there absolutely was no difference.

2513
03:29:39,834 --> 03:29:42,855
[SPEAKER_26]: So from a business model perspective, yes, I have sat down.

2514
03:29:42,895 --> 03:29:45,136
[SPEAKER_26]: I do actually have another bank here as well.

2515
03:29:45,516 --> 03:29:50,598
[SPEAKER_26]: Brookline Bank, Century Bank, and Eastern Bank have all worked revenue models with me.

2516
03:29:51,198 --> 03:29:58,909
[SPEAKER_26]: And so the boarding, as I mentioned before, is not a substantial portion of our business, so we would be willing to look at different revenue models.

2517
03:29:59,250 --> 03:30:04,818
[SPEAKER_26]: However, having said that, according from VIVUSA, we would still require the same permit.

2518
03:30:04,838 --> 03:30:06,841
[SPEAKER_26]: There would be absolutely no difference in that.

2519
03:30:09,887 --> 03:30:14,528
[SPEAKER_44]: So, what are the models that you've approved?

2520
03:30:14,588 --> 03:30:15,668
[SPEAKER_26]: Removing boarding.

2521
03:30:15,888 --> 03:30:24,670
[SPEAKER_26]: We would look at removing overnight boarding, but the permit, the way that the city ordinances are for Medford, the permit is the same whether we offer it or not.

2522
03:30:24,770 --> 03:30:28,931
[SPEAKER_26]: So, if you do a daycare in the city of Medford, you do require a special permit.

2523
03:30:29,671 --> 03:30:36,633
[SPEAKER_44]: And then, I guess my other concern would be an irrigation system or some sort of, I mean, have you priced any of those?

2524
03:30:38,263 --> 03:30:47,811
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I actually tried to speak to a construction company that is here that actually specializes in that and they were not interested in further conversations with us.

2525
03:30:48,211 --> 03:30:55,897
[SPEAKER_26]: So we would like to explore that model further to try and figure out what we really would like to do is work with local Medford companies.

2526
03:30:56,577 --> 03:30:57,877
[SPEAKER_26]: and have those companies.

2527
03:30:57,957 --> 03:31:04,379
[SPEAKER_26]: Right now, I know there was a lot of discussions about our street, and so our neighbor across the street is a 24-hour towing company.

2528
03:31:04,939 --> 03:31:10,440
[SPEAKER_26]: We had tried to talk with him about who does he use, how does he work with traffic, DPW, next door.

2529
03:31:10,640 --> 03:31:19,742
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody we have worked with has been tried to local, so we would like the local sewage experts, who I believe are CJ Doherty Construction, they specialize in this.

2530
03:31:20,102 --> 03:31:25,243
[SPEAKER_26]: We actually would like to work with them and make sure that we have the proper sewage for our building.

2531
03:31:31,242 --> 03:31:39,714
[SPEAKER_44]: I guess to ask the building owner, would closing at five or six change the scenario at all?

2532
03:31:40,054 --> 03:31:41,777
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's no scenario.

2533
03:31:42,698 --> 03:31:44,340
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Pandora's box scenario.

2534
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:45,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I speak for you?

2535
03:31:45,302 --> 03:31:45,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

2536
03:31:46,583 --> 03:31:47,445
[SPEAKER_43]: Come to the podium, please.

2537
03:32:01,228 --> 03:32:14,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So, from our perspective, as CJ had already incorporated, runoff from a dog waste facility is not sewerage.

2538
03:32:15,401 --> 03:32:16,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a whole other matter.

2539
03:32:16,662 --> 03:32:18,504
[SPEAKER_10]: We wouldn't just come up with a plan, you'd need an engineer.

2540
03:32:19,025 --> 03:32:22,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Beyond that, from a compromise standpoint of whether or not

2541
03:32:24,263 --> 03:32:28,986
[SPEAKER_10]: any of the real estate LLCs would find a way to negotiate this working.

2542
03:32:29,466 --> 03:32:30,227
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer is no.

2543
03:32:30,967 --> 03:32:40,694
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no scenario, this is not a Pandora's box situation, where they've openly said we're doing half of what the EPA or the ASPCA recommends.

2544
03:32:41,935 --> 03:32:43,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think any reasonable person

2545
03:32:44,800 --> 03:32:50,605
[SPEAKER_10]: In their scenario, if business is booming like they anticipate, will not slowly escalate beyond that.

2546
03:32:51,426 --> 03:32:57,371
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a scenario, once the door is opened and we unleash the dogs, they're not going back in.

2547
03:32:58,092 --> 03:33:06,940
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a permanent decision where they will have an ongoing business in a neighborhood with residents, whether it's overwhelmingly zoned otherwise.

2548
03:33:07,960 --> 03:33:13,243
[SPEAKER_10]: There are residents on Linden, there are residents on Locust Street, many of whom have signed the petition that was handed to you earlier.

2549
03:33:13,363 --> 03:33:18,225
[SPEAKER_10]: A letter from one resident on Linden included, who couldn't attend because she works.

2550
03:33:19,326 --> 03:33:21,907
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no scenario in which this moves forward.

2551
03:33:23,252 --> 03:33:24,953
[SPEAKER_10]: that it doesn't become an ongoing problem.

2552
03:33:25,574 --> 03:33:36,982
[SPEAKER_10]: When Michelle visited my office and we spoke outside, she had said to me, it's overwhelmingly supported by our neighbors, most of whom close their doors and go home at five or seven.

2553
03:33:37,803 --> 03:33:43,727
[SPEAKER_10]: She also stated that the number one complaint of apartment owners and developers in the city was dogs barking.

2554
03:33:45,361 --> 03:33:52,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had stated to her at that time, that's interesting because we do not allow dogs because in an apartment environment, they're a nuisance.

2555
03:33:52,943 --> 03:33:59,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So now under her proposal, we're solving other people's problems by creating one in a new area.

2556
03:34:01,066 --> 03:34:08,688
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to acknowledge that the dog across the street that barks for 45 minutes will incite your dogs to bark all day.

2557
03:34:09,701 --> 03:34:14,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who has a dog has heard their dog bark and then a crescendo across the neighborhood.

2558
03:34:14,684 --> 03:34:15,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And that goes around and around.

2559
03:34:16,225 --> 03:34:21,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So for us to think this is a problem solely on Linden and Locust is foolish.

2560
03:34:22,069 --> 03:34:26,893
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a situation where once one dog goes, there's nothing stopping it from being 125.

2561
03:34:27,893 --> 03:34:34,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, for our residents, who I'm representing, that's non-starter.

2562
03:34:34,838 --> 03:34:35,739
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't allow that.

2563
03:34:36,951 --> 03:34:41,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they get the permit and they choose to hire us, we need to get a design.

2564
03:34:42,596 --> 03:34:50,942
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, there's no variation of this proposal that we can be okay with.

2565
03:34:53,484 --> 03:34:55,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no, that's it.

2566
03:34:56,967 --> 03:34:57,267
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2567
03:34:57,928 --> 03:35:03,913
[SPEAKER_44]: My only comment to that is when you say it's a permit and if they get it, they'll just expand.

2568
03:35:04,485 --> 03:35:07,186
[SPEAKER_44]: We as a council can put restrictions on that permit.

2569
03:35:07,206 --> 03:35:19,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, but if I tried to talk to you right now and I had put my phone down on a YouTube sound of dogs barking, it's only two dogs, but you and I wouldn't be able to communicate.

2570
03:35:19,971 --> 03:35:24,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether it's 50 dogs or 100 dogs, once it starts, once they're there,

2571
03:35:25,841 --> 03:35:31,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The people who live on Linden Ave, who I realize aren't necessarily here, most of them speak Spanish.

2572
03:35:31,286 --> 03:35:32,487
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not be legal citizens.

2573
03:35:32,847 --> 03:35:34,328
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not feel comfortable coming here.

2574
03:35:34,969 --> 03:35:35,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.

2575
03:35:35,990 --> 03:35:36,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm speaking for them.

2576
03:35:40,874 --> 03:35:41,474
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a problem.

2577
03:35:41,514 --> 03:35:43,676
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still people, there's still residents, there's still our neighbors.

2578
03:35:46,979 --> 03:35:47,620
[SPEAKER_10]: The dogs aren't.

2579
03:35:48,694 --> 03:35:51,157
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other facilities, there are facilities in Malden, there are facilities all over.

2580
03:35:51,197 --> 03:35:53,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Do a Google search of doggie daycare.

2581
03:35:53,601 --> 03:35:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: The map is pretty full.

2582
03:35:55,283 --> 03:35:56,665
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be right here.

2583
03:35:59,368 --> 03:35:59,729
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2584
03:36:03,874 --> 03:36:04,235
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2585
03:36:05,737 --> 03:36:06,438
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion?

2586
03:36:09,852 --> 03:36:13,114
[SPEAKER_17]: I only have one last thought to add.

2587
03:36:13,674 --> 03:36:20,757
[SPEAKER_17]: We can either talk tonight about some type of special variance for dogs, or we'll be at the ZBA in a couple of months talking about another 10 story building.

2588
03:36:21,457 --> 03:36:21,778
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2589
03:36:23,658 --> 03:36:28,121
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any further discussion?

2590
03:36:28,341 --> 03:36:28,901
[SPEAKER_42]: Any more questions?

2591
03:36:31,062 --> 03:36:31,222
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

2592
03:36:32,082 --> 03:36:37,545
[SPEAKER_42]: You've already spoken twice on this matter, and that's the, we said at the beginning that that would be limited to two times.

2593
03:36:38,962 --> 03:36:40,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any further discussion on this matter?

2594
03:36:42,965 --> 03:36:43,966
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion in the debate, Mr. President.

2595
03:36:43,986 --> 03:36:45,007
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a motion on the table.

2596
03:36:45,027 --> 03:36:47,248
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, between the council.

2597
03:36:47,489 --> 03:36:49,190
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, we need to discuss it.

2598
03:36:50,851 --> 03:36:54,794
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a motion on the table to approve the permit.

2599
03:36:55,875 --> 03:36:57,116
[SPEAKER_44]: Who put that motion forward?

2600
03:36:57,156 --> 03:36:57,937
[SPEAKER_42]: We're looking for one.

2601
03:37:00,198 --> 03:37:01,900
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any further discussion amongst the council?

2602
03:37:02,240 --> 03:37:03,061
[SPEAKER_42]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

2603
03:37:03,761 --> 03:37:05,282
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knight for approval.

2604
03:37:05,302 --> 03:37:05,743
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

2605
03:37:08,493 --> 03:37:11,494
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you have any concerns, Councilwoman?

2606
03:37:11,554 --> 03:37:12,855
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions?

2607
03:37:12,875 --> 03:37:34,403
[SPEAKER_44]: I still do have a concern about the irrigation portion, and it is being explored, so whether that means we wait till we get, I mean, that's one of the, putting restrictions and an irrigation system are two things that I think need to be discussed amongst the council.

2608
03:37:40,702 --> 03:37:45,683
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

2609
03:37:45,763 --> 03:37:46,824
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm open to discussion.

2610
03:37:47,204 --> 03:37:48,644
[SPEAKER_53]: What's the discussion, Mr. President?

2611
03:37:49,064 --> 03:37:55,466
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn has concerns about the irrigation system that is in place on the property there.

2612
03:37:55,606 --> 03:37:58,447
[SPEAKER_50]: What does she propose, Mr. President?

2613
03:37:59,387 --> 03:38:00,568
[SPEAKER_44]: Just a lot has been discussed.

2614
03:38:00,648 --> 03:38:02,208
[SPEAKER_44]: I hear that there's potential clay.

2615
03:38:03,109 --> 03:38:05,530
[SPEAKER_44]: We hear the rock versus the grass.

2616
03:38:05,550 --> 03:38:08,370
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm sure there is clay, Mr. President, if I might throw the chair.

2617
03:38:08,390 --> 03:38:09,531
[SPEAKER_51]: There's clay everywhere in that area.

2618
03:38:09,571 --> 03:38:11,071
[SPEAKER_51]: See, there is clay everywhere.

2619
03:38:11,551 --> 03:38:15,552
[SPEAKER_51]: My building is atop a bed of clay that wobbles and shakes.

2620
03:38:16,072 --> 03:38:19,213
[SPEAKER_44]: But 50 dogs may not be peeing on your property.

2621
03:38:19,273 --> 03:38:20,013
[SPEAKER_51]: They do not.

2622
03:38:20,033 --> 03:38:28,315
[SPEAKER_52]: I have about five or six that pee there regularly, Madam Councilor, along with the rabbits and squirrels that I mentioned earlier.

2623
03:38:33,043 --> 03:38:33,904
[SPEAKER_49]: Move the question, Mr. President.

2624
03:38:34,665 --> 03:38:36,066
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knight.

2625
03:38:37,227 --> 03:38:40,211
[SPEAKER_42]: Second by Councilor Dello Russo.

2626
03:38:42,073 --> 03:38:47,819
[SPEAKER_42]: As everyone knows, this is a special permit, and it does require five votes for approval.

2627
03:38:48,579 --> 03:38:50,241
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call.

2628
03:38:50,281 --> 03:38:50,662
[SPEAKER_44]: If I may.

2629
03:38:52,537 --> 03:38:57,600
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't believe I'm ready to vote on it unless I get an irrigation system.

2630
03:38:57,620 --> 03:39:03,524
[SPEAKER_44]: And we discuss reducing the hours, especially at first.

2631
03:39:05,265 --> 03:39:10,808
[SPEAKER_44]: Like it's been said, there's 57 units abutting the property.

2632
03:39:10,828 --> 03:39:15,031
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm awaiting a motion here.

2633
03:39:15,391 --> 03:39:16,792
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion on the table.

2634
03:39:16,812 --> 03:39:17,492
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion on the table.

2635
03:39:17,512 --> 03:39:18,393
[SPEAKER_42]: It's been seconded.

2636
03:39:18,453 --> 03:39:18,913
[SPEAKER_42]: Call the roll.

2637
03:39:19,193 --> 03:39:19,854
[SPEAKER_42]: It's been seconded.

2638
03:39:20,154 --> 03:39:22,055
[SPEAKER_42]: Call the roll.

2639
03:39:24,348 --> 03:39:26,651
[SPEAKER_42]: If you have any further discussion, now is the time.

2640
03:39:26,671 --> 03:39:27,091
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President.

2641
03:39:31,376 --> 03:39:32,397
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Mox.

2642
03:39:33,017 --> 03:39:33,978
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you Mr. President.

2643
03:39:33,998 --> 03:39:42,868
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been on the council a number of years and I've been through the building of new schools.

2644
03:39:43,662 --> 03:39:48,204
[SPEAKER_29]: which was a contentious issue, taking neighborhood schools and making centralized schools.

2645
03:39:49,185 --> 03:39:57,289
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been through issues relative to building a new police station, a new DPW, you know, and the list goes on and on.

2646
03:39:58,130 --> 03:40:04,513
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can honestly tell you, this issue, in my opinion, has taken a life of its own.

2647
03:40:05,773 --> 03:40:08,535
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, having the

2648
03:40:11,295 --> 03:40:12,916
[SPEAKER_29]: foresight of prior votes.

2649
03:40:14,337 --> 03:40:31,549
[SPEAKER_29]: I recall back, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago now, and I think Councilor Longo was on the council at the time with me, that we took a vote as a council to not approve a tattoo parlor that wanted to come into Forest Street in Method Square.

2650
03:40:32,630 --> 03:40:33,991
[SPEAKER_29]: And people might say, what is he talking about?

2651
03:40:34,891 --> 03:40:36,252
[SPEAKER_29]: This has some relevance.

2652
03:40:38,553 --> 03:40:41,095
[SPEAKER_29]: At the time, we were looking at revitalizing the square.

2653
03:40:41,715 --> 03:40:50,240
[SPEAKER_29]: And there was a lot of discussion about putting lucky tattoos on Forest Street, across from Chevalier, right next to a dialys center and so forth.

2654
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:57,764
[SPEAKER_29]: Right across from the Method Y Boys and Girls Club.

2655
03:40:58,704 --> 03:41:02,808
[SPEAKER_29]: And at the time, I was one member, and we voted it down, Mr. President.

2656
03:41:03,389 --> 03:41:04,770
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't know if you recall this or not.

2657
03:41:06,112 --> 03:41:11,397
[SPEAKER_29]: We did not give an adequate enough reason for voting down a special permit.

2658
03:41:12,458 --> 03:41:16,542
[SPEAKER_29]: And sure enough, the petitioner took us to court.

2659
03:41:17,463 --> 03:41:32,263
[SPEAKER_29]: and won a financial settlement in court because we didn't provide enough information on why we were against something that was legally zoned and, you know, there was no reason why

2660
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:37,121
[SPEAKER_29]: We didn't vote to put it there, more or less.

2661
03:41:38,081 --> 03:41:43,383
[SPEAKER_29]: And the only reason why I bring that up, Mr. President, is, you know, I live the closest to that.

2662
03:41:43,423 --> 03:41:45,503
[SPEAKER_29]: I live on Wellington Road, right off of Riverside Ave.

2663
03:41:45,563 --> 03:41:49,885
[SPEAKER_29]: I come out on my street, and I can be at that location in five minutes by walk.

2664
03:41:51,925 --> 03:41:59,026
[SPEAKER_29]: And originally, and I've always taken this course of action, is that the neighborhood comes first.

2665
03:41:59,827 --> 03:42:03,967
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, if there's people there, residents, I want to hear from them, they come first.

2666
03:42:04,907 --> 03:42:18,690
[SPEAKER_29]: And with that being said, I am comfortable right now with the fact that many of the issues that I think were going to be potential issues, like we had with the building of the new dog park,

2667
03:42:19,636 --> 03:42:23,498
[SPEAKER_29]: noise, smell, you name it, seem to be addressed.

2668
03:42:23,538 --> 03:42:24,539
[SPEAKER_29]: Are they addressed 110%?

2669
03:42:25,559 --> 03:42:26,160
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely not.

2670
03:42:26,580 --> 03:42:27,920
[SPEAKER_29]: But they seem to be addressed.

2671
03:42:28,721 --> 03:42:41,988
[SPEAKER_29]: And as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, we always like to look for compromise, and I thought that was a good compromise, maybe removing the overnight boarding, or add some other stipulations, which we can do by right, on a special permit.

2672
03:42:42,808 --> 03:42:43,829
[SPEAKER_29]: And it is enforceable.

2673
03:42:45,310 --> 03:42:48,832
[SPEAKER_29]: And we can call back any special permit if they don't adhere to it.

2674
03:42:49,755 --> 03:43:17,161
[SPEAKER_29]: So based on the information that we were presented tonight, based on the fact that there is a need in the community, in my opinion, based on the fact that I believe, and I know there was some contentious stuff going back and forth, I think there's enough business, as was mentioned, in the community to not only accommodate a dog for days, but every other dog business in the community that does dog walking or so forth.

2675
03:43:19,701 --> 03:43:24,666
[SPEAKER_29]: Based on that knowledge that I have and the fact that I believe this could work.

2676
03:43:24,706 --> 03:43:39,340
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President in that area I will support that tonight and Like I said, it's it's not an easy issue At the beginning they were talking about a yappy hour and I think this council will need a yappy hour and

2677
03:43:41,556 --> 03:43:48,281
[SPEAKER_29]: after we take a vote on this tonight, because it did come to a contentious way.

2678
03:43:48,321 --> 03:43:51,063
[SPEAKER_29]: And I've known the Daugherties for a lot of years.

2679
03:43:51,083 --> 03:43:51,964
[SPEAKER_29]: They're good people.

2680
03:43:51,984 --> 03:43:52,984
[SPEAKER_29]: They're good business owners.

2681
03:43:53,325 --> 03:43:56,347
[SPEAKER_29]: I know a lot of the people that are opposed, a lot of people in favor.

2682
03:43:56,947 --> 03:43:59,109
[SPEAKER_29]: And in my opinion, I have to do what my heart tells me.

2683
03:43:59,789 --> 03:44:03,331
[SPEAKER_29]: And my heart's telling me, what right do we have to keep them out?

2684
03:44:03,971 --> 03:44:05,272
[SPEAKER_29]: I realize there's residents there.

2685
03:44:05,652 --> 03:44:06,573
[SPEAKER_29]: It's zoned for it.

2686
03:44:07,373 --> 03:44:08,634
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there a need in the community?

2687
03:44:09,795 --> 03:44:13,897
[SPEAKER_29]: If this was servicing everyone from Winchester and no method people, I'd say, you know what?

2688
03:44:14,557 --> 03:44:15,878
[SPEAKER_29]: Winchester, you don't want a CVS?

2689
03:44:15,898 --> 03:44:16,678
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll give you a dog.

2690
03:44:18,780 --> 03:44:21,061
[SPEAKER_29]: We'll give you, you can take a dog kennel.

2691
03:44:22,122 --> 03:44:23,823
[SPEAKER_29]: But that's not the case, Mr. President.

2692
03:44:23,843 --> 03:44:35,710
[SPEAKER_29]: This is going to service many, many Medford residents, and I think it can be done in a fashion that will be amendable to the abutters, which we always want to make sure the abutters are on notice.

2693
03:44:37,371 --> 03:44:41,134
[SPEAKER_29]: So for those reasons, Mr. President, I will support this petition today.

2694
03:44:41,254 --> 03:44:41,494
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2695
03:44:45,640 --> 03:44:46,381
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2696
03:44:46,861 --> 03:44:51,644
[SPEAKER_41]: I just, you know, this is, I do not question the presentation.

2697
03:44:51,664 --> 03:44:52,705
[SPEAKER_41]: The presentation was great.

2698
03:44:53,746 --> 03:45:04,153
[SPEAKER_41]: What I do question, since I've been on the council for almost two years now, a very important topic that we've been talking about probably on a weekly basis, that's zoning.

2699
03:45:05,073 --> 03:45:07,295
[SPEAKER_41]: And people that have come up in support of this.

2700
03:45:08,475 --> 03:45:20,643
[SPEAKER_41]: were the same people that helped us see the negative impact of negative zoning and how one project can negatively affect a neighborhood or people in those neighborhoods.

2701
03:45:20,663 --> 03:45:29,909
[SPEAKER_41]: I made a decision then that I would make sure that I do my due diligence when it comes to my vote.

2702
03:45:31,650 --> 03:45:35,913
[SPEAKER_41]: I visited a county and I appreciate the due diligence,

2703
03:45:39,713 --> 03:46:05,072
[SPEAKER_41]: The smell and the noise that I heard, and that was 11.30 in the afternoon, personally that I saw, whether it's not their daycare, whether it isn't their daycare, from what I've witnessed, my opinion, and listening to the residents of Locust Street, not the Doherty's, the residents that live in there, that have repeatedly told me

2704
03:46:06,038 --> 03:46:09,300
[SPEAKER_41]: This isn't a dog-friendly unit.

2705
03:46:09,900 --> 03:46:13,562
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't allow dogs, we don't want dogs in here, and that's why they rent there.

2706
03:46:15,022 --> 03:46:20,205
[SPEAKER_41]: And talking to Linden residents that have the same concerns and same issues.

2707
03:46:22,106 --> 03:46:34,832
[SPEAKER_41]: So, way back when we decided to sue our own zoning board to protect the residents in that neighborhood, and now sitting before us, a situation that I have to put a vote on?

2708
03:46:35,975 --> 03:46:43,001
[SPEAKER_41]: that affects residents of our community, that I don't care if it's, the boarding issue doesn't bother me.

2709
03:46:44,142 --> 03:47:01,656
[SPEAKER_41]: During the day, that the residents that called me and talked to me, that talked about the noise of possibly 50 dogs in one area, I don't care what fencing, what proofing they have, my expertise of a dog owner, they get loud.

2710
03:47:03,722 --> 03:47:21,871
[SPEAKER_41]: And from what my experts telling me in my field that I work with turf specialists, whatever the turf specialist says, there isn't a turf out there that will mask the odor of 50 dogs laying their scent down during a hot summer day.

2711
03:47:23,272 --> 03:47:24,532
[SPEAKER_41]: So I did my homework.

2712
03:47:26,569 --> 03:47:32,273
[SPEAKER_41]: It's funny because I get angry with residents who come up here and point their finger and say, shame on you, we want to move Medford forward.

2713
03:47:32,734 --> 03:47:34,675
[SPEAKER_41]: So do we, but at what cost?

2714
03:47:36,096 --> 03:47:36,797
[SPEAKER_41]: At what cost?

2715
03:47:38,318 --> 03:47:42,121
[SPEAKER_41]: Because if it was my neighborhood, I'll speak open.

2716
03:47:42,681 --> 03:47:46,084
[SPEAKER_41]: I wouldn't want it, because it'll affect my neighborhood.

2717
03:47:47,669 --> 03:47:49,832
[SPEAKER_41]: So I will not support this.

2718
03:47:50,052 --> 03:47:57,502
[SPEAKER_41]: And I apologize because I think it's a great plan, but for that area and for what I've seen, I just don't, I can't support it.

2719
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,060
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Belco?

2720
03:48:08,460 --> 03:48:09,281
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2721
03:48:09,501 --> 03:48:11,982
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to thank everybody for coming down.

2722
03:48:12,022 --> 03:48:19,445
[SPEAKER_31]: No matter what side you are on tonight, it's always good to see civic participation and people coming just to, you know, let us know how you feel, for or against.

2723
03:48:20,325 --> 03:48:24,787
[SPEAKER_31]: And this is a rather, it's a very interesting issue.

2724
03:48:25,207 --> 03:48:28,268
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's one that, you know, I feel, I felt torn about.

2725
03:48:28,288 --> 03:48:30,269
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, it's, I'm a dog owner.

2726
03:48:30,489 --> 03:48:31,669
[SPEAKER_31]: I own a beagle hound.

2727
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:32,710
[SPEAKER_31]: I love him.

2728
03:48:32,730 --> 03:48:33,590
[SPEAKER_31]: He's part of the family.

2729
03:48:35,951 --> 03:48:38,232
[SPEAKER_31]: My kids love him, and he's a great dog.

2730
03:48:38,732 --> 03:48:43,775
[SPEAKER_31]: And I love the passion that you bring to this tonight.

2731
03:48:45,155 --> 03:48:50,878
[SPEAKER_31]: Your maps, your sketches, I mean, you've obviously done your research.

2732
03:48:52,018 --> 03:48:56,180
[SPEAKER_31]: And you can tell you're passionate about this, and that's very impressive.

2733
03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:03,223
[SPEAKER_31]: And I come back to also saying, this is a great idea.

2734
03:49:04,289 --> 03:49:10,853
[SPEAKER_31]: This is, it's an idea I think that, yes, Medford could use, but I'm torn on the location.

2735
03:49:11,153 --> 03:49:25,302
[SPEAKER_31]: I really am, because I do see that, you know, although it's an industrial zone, you have apartment buildings there, you have homes, and that's the part that really, really, I struggle with, because I know,

2736
03:49:27,942 --> 03:49:33,627
[SPEAKER_31]: For example, I know this year we've had neighborhood meetings, police meetings in each of the neighborhoods.

2737
03:49:33,667 --> 03:49:40,573
[SPEAKER_31]: And as we've gone through neighborhood to neighborhood, people really care about their neighborhood and really care what happens in their neighborhood.

2738
03:49:41,394 --> 03:49:47,299
[SPEAKER_31]: And I have received phone calls and emails on this as well, both for and against.

2739
03:49:50,257 --> 03:49:57,480
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, so I really do struggle with this decision, but at the end, you know, for me it comes down to the neighborhood.

2740
03:49:57,820 --> 03:50:06,864
[SPEAKER_31]: And it comes down to, you know, is this going to have a positive or negative impact on, you know, I don't want to say the quality of life, but it does to some point.

2741
03:50:06,884 --> 03:50:08,125
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, because if you're hearing

2742
03:50:08,845 --> 03:50:09,586
[SPEAKER_31]: barking all the time.

2743
03:50:09,626 --> 03:50:11,907
[SPEAKER_31]: I know my dog, I mean, he's part hound.

2744
03:50:12,067 --> 03:50:20,493
[SPEAKER_31]: When he starts going, he's barking and it can definitely be disruptive.

2745
03:50:20,553 --> 03:50:23,916
[SPEAKER_31]: When I hear 50 dogs, at the end of the day, 50 dogs is 50 dogs.

2746
03:50:24,776 --> 03:50:30,740
[SPEAKER_31]: And if they're kind of all going at the same time, that's going to be loud, inside or outside.

2747
03:50:34,601 --> 03:50:44,202
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, I love that you're passionate about this, but I think it's a great idea, I just think it's a bad location, and that's what it comes down to me.

2748
03:50:45,315 --> 03:50:47,656
[SPEAKER_31]: And I do love the idea.

2749
03:50:48,216 --> 03:50:56,060
[SPEAKER_31]: I wish it was a place where there was just no apartment buildings and there were no homes that were near this.

2750
03:50:57,181 --> 03:50:58,361
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I do think it's a great idea.

2751
03:50:58,681 --> 03:51:00,302
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think it's something that the city could use.

2752
03:51:00,983 --> 03:51:03,304
[SPEAKER_31]: And I honestly do struggle with this.

2753
03:51:03,344 --> 03:51:04,684
[SPEAKER_31]: I know I've talked to you both about this.

2754
03:51:07,549 --> 03:51:20,893
[SPEAKER_31]: But at the end of the day, to me it's the neighborhoods and to have this, even though it's an industrial neighborhood, in many ways, because there are apartment buildings there and there are homes there, in many ways it's kind of like a residential neighborhood.

2755
03:51:21,613 --> 03:51:26,455
[SPEAKER_31]: And getting back to the other argument of zoning, zoning needs to be looked at.

2756
03:51:26,495 --> 03:51:27,755
[SPEAKER_31]: We've talked about this many times.

2757
03:51:28,235 --> 03:51:32,237
[SPEAKER_31]: Zoning has not been looked at in this city in 50 years and it needs to be addressed.

2758
03:51:33,197 --> 03:51:35,738
[SPEAKER_31]: So I cannot support this.

2759
03:51:37,819 --> 03:51:38,520
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2760
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:44,130
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'll give my last two cents here, but I've been a dog owner almost my whole life.

2761
03:51:44,251 --> 03:51:45,934
[SPEAKER_42]: I still have a dog.

2762
03:51:49,752 --> 03:51:53,653
[SPEAKER_42]: I share the same concerns with Councilor Falco, that this is a neighborhood thing.

2763
03:51:53,873 --> 03:51:57,554
[SPEAKER_42]: If this was one street over, I don't think I'd ever, I wouldn't have a problem with it.

2764
03:51:57,894 --> 03:52:07,196
[SPEAKER_42]: I know exactly where the Common Dog is, and I know, again, that's a, there are no houses over there, and for those of you who don't know, many of you know Larry White.

2765
03:52:08,016 --> 03:52:11,717
[SPEAKER_42]: It's about 100 yards from Larry White's building off the parkway in Everett.

2766
03:52:11,917 --> 03:52:12,797
[SPEAKER_42]: I know exactly where it is.

2767
03:52:13,457 --> 03:52:14,797
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, if this was on Hall Street,

2768
03:52:17,698 --> 03:52:21,259
[SPEAKER_42]: where there are no homes or commercial street without no homes, I wouldn't have a problem with either.

2769
03:52:21,279 --> 03:52:30,360
[SPEAKER_42]: But where there are homes in the front and the back of you, I do have a problem with that because the neighbors are what count in the city.

2770
03:52:31,701 --> 03:52:31,801
No.

2771
03:52:33,781 --> 03:52:35,101
Move the question.

2772
03:52:36,241 --> 03:52:39,602
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm on the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

2773
03:52:40,762 --> 03:52:43,002
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2774
03:52:43,243 --> 03:52:43,883
[SPEAKER_42]: What's the motion?

2775
03:52:45,363 --> 03:52:45,823
[SPEAKER_42]: For the permit.

2776
03:52:49,590 --> 03:52:52,092
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I thought there was a motion for approval.

2777
03:52:53,113 --> 03:52:53,713
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor, it is.

2778
03:52:53,933 --> 03:52:54,994
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight made a motion for approval.

2779
03:52:55,014 --> 03:52:55,474
[SPEAKER_42]: For approval.

2780
03:52:55,654 --> 03:52:55,835
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2781
03:52:56,055 --> 03:52:56,295
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

2782
03:52:57,676 --> 03:52:58,557
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

2783
03:52:58,757 --> 03:52:58,997
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2784
03:52:59,617 --> 03:53:00,338
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

2785
03:53:00,458 --> 03:53:00,618
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

2786
03:53:01,259 --> 03:53:01,799
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knight?

2787
03:53:01,859 --> 03:53:02,059
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

2788
03:53:03,080 --> 03:53:03,880
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Long-Term?

2789
03:53:04,021 --> 03:53:04,201
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

2790
03:53:05,402 --> 03:53:06,122
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Marks?

2791
03:53:06,182 --> 03:53:06,462
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2792
03:53:07,023 --> 03:53:07,803
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2793
03:53:08,103 --> 03:53:08,284
[SPEAKER_47]: No.

2794
03:53:09,304 --> 03:53:10,005
[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

2795
03:53:10,105 --> 03:53:10,285
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

2796
03:53:11,606 --> 03:53:18,231
[SPEAKER_42]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative, motion fails.

2797
03:53:22,085 --> 03:53:22,405
[SPEAKER_42]: I have reasons.

2798
03:53:22,425 --> 03:53:22,986
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you want them now?

2799
03:53:23,926 --> 03:53:25,788
[SPEAKER_50]: Motion for a brief recess, Mr. President.

2800
03:53:25,988 --> 03:53:28,189
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo for a five-minute recess.

2801
03:53:28,230 --> 03:53:29,450
[SPEAKER_42]: I have my reasons whenever you want them.

2802
03:53:49,285 --> 03:53:52,627
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

2803
03:53:54,128 --> 03:53:55,469
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, what do we got left here?

2804
03:53:55,489 --> 03:54:01,893
[SPEAKER_42]: We got that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.

2805
03:54:06,747 --> 03:54:17,071
[SPEAKER_42]: 17568, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council to send the deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Honorable Judge Lee Johnson on his recent passage.

2806
03:54:17,091 --> 03:54:28,736
[SPEAKER_42]: Judge Johnson was appointed to the District Court in September 2001 by then acting Governor Jane Swift and was appointed first justice in the Malden District Court where he served with distinction until he retired in 2016.

2807
03:54:28,776 --> 03:54:32,377
[SPEAKER_42]: He was the first African American to serve in that position at the court.

2808
03:54:32,677 --> 03:54:34,358
[SPEAKER_42]: His tenure as first justice was the longest

2809
03:54:34,958 --> 03:54:36,979
[SPEAKER_42]: duration in the history of the Marlins District Court.

2810
03:54:37,019 --> 03:54:47,206
[SPEAKER_42]: For over 10 years, Judge Johnson was instrumental in the successful probation of the drug court session that empowered many defendants to leave productive drug-free lives.

2811
03:54:47,266 --> 03:54:47,967
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight.

2812
03:54:48,527 --> 03:54:52,009
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, I think that the resolution sums itself up.

2813
03:54:52,109 --> 03:54:53,750
[SPEAKER_49]: Judge Lee Johnson passed away recently.

2814
03:54:53,770 --> 03:54:57,993
[SPEAKER_49]: He was a great, great public servant, a great person, and a great individual, Mr. President.

2815
03:54:58,013 --> 03:54:59,374
[SPEAKER_49]: He went above and beyond the call of duty.

2816
03:54:59,958 --> 03:55:01,460
[SPEAKER_49]: to provide for his constituencies.

2817
03:55:01,801 --> 03:55:12,013
[SPEAKER_49]: As the first justice of the Malden District Court, he did an excellent thing in implementing drug court, Mr. President, and instead of putting individuals in the system, he got them assistance and treatment.

2818
03:55:12,511 --> 03:55:17,175
[SPEAKER_49]: And I think that's a compassionate and humane way of going about things, and it's become the norm, Mr. President.

2819
03:55:17,195 --> 03:55:23,800
[SPEAKER_49]: So I'd like to extend our deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Lee Johnson, a longtime Medford resident, on his recent passing.

2820
03:55:24,280 --> 03:55:24,641
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2821
03:55:24,701 --> 03:55:36,410
[SPEAKER_42]: And before we do that, we have one other one offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Rosemary Alfie on her recent passing.

2822
03:55:36,470 --> 03:55:37,010
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Knight.

2823
03:55:37,891 --> 03:55:39,131
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2824
03:55:39,191 --> 03:55:50,914
[SPEAKER_49]: It's ironic that we're here this evening having our meeting in Medford High School because this is where I first met Rosemary Alfie when she was Mr. Maskell's administrative assistant, as Mr. Maskell was the submaster and Ms.

2825
03:55:50,994 --> 03:55:52,715
[SPEAKER_49]: Alfie worked there on the second floor of the B building.

2826
03:55:53,215 --> 03:56:01,477
[SPEAKER_49]: She recently passed away unexpectedly at age 85, and I just want to say that she was someone that made my days in high school a little bit brighter every day that I came to school and I got to see her face.

2827
03:56:02,043 --> 03:56:05,985
[SPEAKER_49]: She was certainly someone that made my day a little bit easier and made things go a lot smoother for me in high school.

2828
03:56:06,005 --> 03:56:07,827
[SPEAKER_49]: So I'm very, very grateful to have her as a friend.

2829
03:56:07,867 --> 03:56:09,308
[SPEAKER_49]: And I'm very, very sad that she is gone.

2830
03:56:09,348 --> 03:56:10,268
[SPEAKER_49]: And she will be sadly missed.

2831
03:56:10,308 --> 03:56:11,709
[SPEAKER_49]: I ask my council colleagues to join me.

2832
03:56:11,809 --> 03:56:13,330
[SPEAKER_42]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

2833
03:56:21,995 --> 03:56:22,236
Thank you.

2834
03:56:22,436 --> 03:56:30,781
[SPEAKER_42]: I must suspend the rules, take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.

2835
03:56:32,652 --> 03:56:36,254
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

2836
03:56:36,294 --> 03:56:36,934
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2837
03:56:37,254 --> 03:56:37,334
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

2838
03:56:37,934 --> 03:56:38,615
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2839
03:56:39,675 --> 03:56:40,155
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2840
03:56:41,916 --> 03:56:45,298
[SPEAKER_42]: We have communications from the Mayor.

2841
03:56:49,380 --> 03:56:50,460
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, you want to take the end?

2842
03:56:50,700 --> 03:56:51,641
[SPEAKER_48]: No, communicate, that's what I meant.

2843
03:56:51,701 --> 03:56:52,161
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm sorry.

2844
03:56:52,730 --> 03:56:56,811
[SPEAKER_42]: Communications from the mayor.

2845
03:56:56,831 --> 03:57:04,313
[SPEAKER_42]: 17577, dear Mr. President, city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following home rule petition.

2846
03:57:04,333 --> 03:57:08,814
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh no, I'm sorry, we already did that, I apologize.

2847
03:57:10,294 --> 03:57:12,595
[SPEAKER_42]: We skipped around so many, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

2848
03:57:12,615 --> 03:57:13,475
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2849
03:57:13,515 --> 03:57:15,155
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2850
03:57:15,175 --> 03:57:16,896
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me see, hold on.

2851
03:57:17,096 --> 03:57:16,896
17582?

2852
03:57:17,116 --> 03:57:16,896
581.

2853
03:57:17,176 --> 03:57:16,896
581. 17581.

2854
03:57:25,033 --> 03:57:31,996
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President and City Council, I respectfully request— Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a brief synopsis done by the financial director.

2855
03:57:32,436 --> 03:57:35,037
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor De La Ruza.

2856
03:57:35,057 --> 03:57:35,958
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor, aye.

2857
03:57:36,318 --> 03:57:36,418
Aye.

2858
03:57:37,378 --> 03:57:38,039
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2859
03:57:38,759 --> 03:57:40,320
[SPEAKER_42]: Brief synopsis by the City Treasurer.

2860
03:57:45,403 --> 03:57:45,963
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2861
03:57:47,464 --> 03:57:52,586
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a very straightforward $2,075,000 loan through the MWRA.

2862
03:57:53,366 --> 03:58:07,372
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a 10-year loan at 0% interest, and it's for an engineering project, and our city engineer, Cassandra Kunalitis, is here with me tonight, and she'll be able to answer all the specifics with regard to the project itself.

2863
03:58:08,066 --> 03:58:08,386
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

2864
03:58:09,447 --> 03:58:10,328
[SPEAKER_49]: Finance question, Mr. President?

2865
03:58:11,189 --> 03:58:11,649
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

2866
03:58:12,730 --> 03:58:12,870
[SPEAKER_49]: Ms.

2867
03:58:12,890 --> 03:58:22,038
[SPEAKER_49]: Zerwan, can you explain what impact this is going to have, if appropriated this evening, on the schedule of bonded indebtedness and the plans to hopefully construct a new police station and fire station?

2868
03:58:22,679 --> 03:58:24,260
[SPEAKER_37]: There's no impact on that whatsoever.

2869
03:58:24,280 --> 03:58:31,327
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a 0% loan, and the loan payments will be paid through retained earnings.

2870
03:58:34,822 --> 03:58:37,504
[SPEAKER_49]: So zero impact on our ability to bond in the future.

2871
03:58:37,524 --> 03:58:39,145
[SPEAKER_49]: We're still on the same track as we were.

2872
03:58:39,746 --> 03:58:43,649
[SPEAKER_49]: And what was that last part I missed, I'm sorry?

2873
03:58:44,189 --> 03:58:46,491
[SPEAKER_37]: The loan payments will be paid through retained earnings.

2874
03:58:46,511 --> 03:58:47,591
[SPEAKER_49]: Retained earnings, okay, excellent.

2875
03:58:48,252 --> 03:58:49,153
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

2876
03:58:49,173 --> 03:58:50,433
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2877
03:58:50,454 --> 03:58:51,674
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions for the treasurer?

2878
03:58:54,076 --> 03:58:57,319
[SPEAKER_42]: If we could have the city engineer speak on this.

2879
03:59:05,050 --> 03:59:06,491
[SPEAKER_39]: Good evening, or should I say good morning?

2880
03:59:09,934 --> 03:59:16,058
[SPEAKER_39]: So the last time I was here for a loan through the MWRA was 2013.

2881
03:59:16,098 --> 03:59:21,923
[SPEAKER_39]: And we come back again because there are a number of infrastructure projects for water.

2882
03:59:22,586 --> 03:59:43,124
[SPEAKER_39]: that need to be done, some in advance of roadway work, such as Grove Street and Evans Street, and others that are necessary for reasons of large leak history, you know, tuberculation, reduced volume, reduced pressure for firefighting, and seeking improved water quality.

2883
03:59:43,744 --> 03:59:50,170
[SPEAKER_39]: The handout that you have tonight represents a summary of work that was issued for a contract for bids

2884
03:59:50,865 --> 04:00:01,137
[SPEAKER_39]: a three-year contract that is about to be awarded to a company called Joseph P. Cardello and Son, should you approve the application that's before you.

2885
04:00:02,338 --> 04:00:07,404
[SPEAKER_39]: There is also some money left over in the MWRA account that will be applied to some projects that we have.

2886
04:00:08,282 --> 04:00:10,123
[SPEAKER_39]: in anticipation.

2887
04:00:10,363 --> 04:00:22,129
[SPEAKER_39]: Like I said before, Evans Street and Grove Street, there's a project on Mystic Valley Parkway to clean and line a pipe that is needed to provide improved flow to the local street area and to Wellington.

2888
04:00:24,770 --> 04:00:26,411
[SPEAKER_39]: So that's the piece of it.

2889
04:00:26,591 --> 04:00:32,014
[SPEAKER_39]: In the loan application, there is also a funding request for a hydraulic model citywide.

2890
04:00:32,637 --> 04:00:34,579
[SPEAKER_39]: It's time that the city did something like that.

2891
04:00:34,639 --> 04:00:35,640
[SPEAKER_39]: It's been several years.

2892
04:00:35,820 --> 04:00:40,204
[SPEAKER_39]: In fact, as long as I've worked here, there has been no citywide hydraulic model.

2893
04:00:40,244 --> 04:00:46,110
[SPEAKER_39]: There's just been site-specific hydraulic models done, and the authority very much recommends that you undertake one.

2894
04:00:46,830 --> 04:00:47,911
[SPEAKER_39]: We're also requesting $200,000

2895
04:00:50,106 --> 04:00:53,290
[SPEAKER_39]: for the change out of privately owned led services.

2896
04:00:53,990 --> 04:00:56,874
[SPEAKER_39]: This would be something that we're going to view as a pilot program.

2897
04:00:57,414 --> 04:01:06,705
[SPEAKER_39]: We're anticipating issuing a extra work order with the contractor and we're going to look at lines that are led

2898
04:01:07,325 --> 04:01:16,467
[SPEAKER_39]: Line lead services on the public side and try to change out the private side as well the logistics for the Payment from the customer.

2899
04:01:16,987 --> 04:01:24,609
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe it's a reimbursement or a pass-through that would be worked out with the city administration There's going to be a mechanism for doing that.

2900
04:01:25,049 --> 04:01:26,650
[SPEAKER_39]: But right now we start with 200,000.

2901
04:01:27,110 --> 04:01:30,370
[SPEAKER_39]: I know you're familiar that there's a loan program That's a hundred million dollars.

2902
04:01:31,051 --> 04:01:36,732
[SPEAKER_39]: The authority has said that that is a safe and potentially endless supply of money should we need in the future

2903
04:01:37,252 --> 04:01:47,796
[SPEAKER_39]: And we are, in the meantime, doing an inventory of private side lead lines to the best of our ability, and we'll be conducting some surveys in the future to see if those people still have lead services.

2904
04:01:49,057 --> 04:01:50,518
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm happy to answer questions.

2905
04:01:51,378 --> 04:01:52,118
[SPEAKER_41]: Councilor Scott Belli.

2906
04:01:52,178 --> 04:01:58,361
[SPEAKER_41]: If I can, just again, I hate to keep hopping on it, but Evans Street and Parra Street, is that on?

2907
04:01:58,681 --> 04:01:59,821
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, that's in here.

2908
04:02:01,702 --> 04:02:06,205
[SPEAKER_39]: Evans is probably the first street they'll undertake, Evans and Grove.

2909
04:02:06,265 --> 04:02:15,212
[SPEAKER_39]: Now, Parris Street, we have to bundle that as part of a Chapter 90 project, so it's not just the water, but it's also the construction of the road.

2910
04:02:15,732 --> 04:02:18,714
[SPEAKER_39]: But getting the water done, getting the water funding is the first step.

2911
04:02:19,014 --> 04:02:20,695
[SPEAKER_41]: So how long before that project?

2912
04:02:20,735 --> 04:02:23,758
[SPEAKER_41]: Because I've been telling the people that it's any date, and this is...

2913
04:02:25,361 --> 04:02:27,922
[SPEAKER_41]: I have a bid opening tomorrow.

2914
04:02:28,502 --> 04:02:34,504
[SPEAKER_41]: We have a bid opening tomorrow for complete streets So what we're doing with complete streets is potentially funding.

2915
04:02:34,584 --> 04:02:34,604
[SPEAKER_41]: I

2916
04:02:47,392 --> 04:02:54,633
[SPEAKER_39]: It was a $400,000 grant, as you all are familiar with, but the scope has changed and gotten better, so the actual budget is higher.

2917
04:02:55,233 --> 04:03:02,955
[SPEAKER_39]: The idea is that we're gonna supplement that money with Chapter 90 money, which will tell us how much we have left over to fund Paris and Pinkham Streets.

2918
04:03:03,575 --> 04:03:06,576
[SPEAKER_39]: So it could be a fall bid, or it could be a spring bid.

2919
04:03:06,656 --> 04:03:07,136
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know.

2920
04:03:07,156 --> 04:03:11,837
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know.

2921
04:03:11,857 --> 04:03:12,997
[SPEAKER_41]: My irritation is bad.

2922
04:03:14,549 --> 04:03:16,632
[SPEAKER_41]: This was supposed to be done years ago.

2923
04:03:17,413 --> 04:03:18,835
[SPEAKER_41]: The water lines were changed out.

2924
04:03:19,296 --> 04:03:20,858
[SPEAKER_41]: They were supposed to come in the next spring.

2925
04:03:21,619 --> 04:03:23,161
[SPEAKER_41]: Residents, I talked to every day.

2926
04:03:24,298 --> 04:03:29,624
[SPEAKER_41]: And then it was said that we're gonna do it recently, then it was gonna be done by the spring.

2927
04:03:30,425 --> 04:03:32,387
[SPEAKER_41]: And I was saying probably not the fall.

2928
04:03:33,268 --> 04:03:37,152
[SPEAKER_41]: So I just have to know, if you can just get back to me, just let me know.

2929
04:03:37,172 --> 04:03:45,801
[SPEAKER_41]: If it's not till next year, somebody just tell me that I can tell these residents that it's not next year because this is what makes us look bad as a community.

2930
04:03:46,582 --> 04:03:53,809
[SPEAKER_41]: When we sit there and we're told what we're supposed to be doing and it comes back and we get, you know, again, it's not ready yet.

2931
04:03:54,490 --> 04:03:56,292
[SPEAKER_41]: So, thank you.

2932
04:03:56,352 --> 04:04:00,716
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, just to clarify, the gas needs were done, not the water lines.

2933
04:04:00,736 --> 04:04:03,399
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, but the street was supposed to be done two years ago.

2934
04:04:03,959 --> 04:04:04,740
[SPEAKER_41]: That's what they told me.

2935
04:04:04,800 --> 04:04:06,562
[SPEAKER_41]: So, I think they told us.

2936
04:04:07,122 --> 04:04:07,683
[SPEAKER_41]: Maybe I'm wrong.

2937
04:04:10,325 --> 04:04:12,026
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

2938
04:04:12,046 --> 04:04:15,970
[SPEAKER_49]: So I know Councilor Schapiro just asked about Evans and Paris, and I'm just a little confused.

2939
04:04:15,990 --> 04:04:17,651
[SPEAKER_49]: So where are we exactly on Evans again?

2940
04:04:18,932 --> 04:04:29,640
[SPEAKER_39]: This loan application and the contract we issued, and also we did have a waterworks contract that went out last year, and the contractor walked away.

2941
04:04:30,321 --> 04:04:32,543
[SPEAKER_39]: So last year we were supposed to get Evans Street done.

2942
04:04:33,713 --> 04:04:39,980
[SPEAKER_39]: but because there was a lag of more than 90 days in awarding the contract, the contractor did not have to take the project.

2943
04:04:40,100 --> 04:04:40,941
[SPEAKER_49]: When did the contract ago?

2944
04:04:42,131 --> 04:04:43,192
[SPEAKER_39]: Where did the contractor go?

2945
04:04:43,492 --> 04:04:46,134
[SPEAKER_39]: He went in late fall, actually.

2946
04:04:46,174 --> 04:04:47,535
[SPEAKER_39]: He declined to take the project.

2947
04:04:47,555 --> 04:04:54,100
[SPEAKER_39]: He agreed to take it, he said he would do it, and then we couldn't reach him to schedule anything or to have him sign any of the contract language.

2948
04:04:54,541 --> 04:04:57,543
[SPEAKER_39]: We wrote to him, we gave him a drop-dead date to respond to us.

2949
04:04:57,563 --> 04:05:01,226
[SPEAKER_39]: When he did not respond, we knew that we had to put the project out to bid again.

2950
04:05:01,326 --> 04:05:03,368
[SPEAKER_39]: So this project was rebid from last year's.

2951
04:05:04,168 --> 04:05:07,251
[SPEAKER_39]: And because of staffing changes, there was a lag period in which

2952
04:05:07,750 --> 04:05:09,452
[SPEAKER_39]: he had the ability to walk away from it.

2953
04:05:09,692 --> 04:05:11,454
[SPEAKER_49]: Was any of that information shared with us?

2954
04:05:11,874 --> 04:05:12,615
[SPEAKER_39]: I believe so.

2955
04:05:12,675 --> 04:05:14,116
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't recall seeing it.

2956
04:05:15,438 --> 04:05:18,261
[SPEAKER_49]: You know, I echo Councilor Scarpelli's sentiment on Evans Street.

2957
04:05:18,281 --> 04:05:18,981
[SPEAKER_49]: This needs to get done.

2958
04:05:19,001 --> 04:05:21,404
[SPEAKER_49]: It's been something we've been beating our chests about now since November.

2959
04:05:22,505 --> 04:05:23,726
[SPEAKER_49]: You know, it's almost been a year.

2960
04:05:23,786 --> 04:05:24,727
[SPEAKER_49]: Even longer.

2961
04:05:24,847 --> 04:05:25,288
[SPEAKER_49]: Even longer.

2962
04:05:26,308 --> 04:05:29,230
[SPEAKER_49]: So with that being said, I'd like to see that get done as soon as possible.

2963
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:35,713
[SPEAKER_49]: And I'd like to ask that we get quarterly reports on the status of the Evans Street paving project, Mr. President.

2964
04:05:36,073 --> 04:05:36,353
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

2965
04:05:36,793 --> 04:05:37,454
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Dello Russo.

2966
04:05:37,474 --> 04:05:42,596
[SPEAKER_53]: Mr. President, seeing that it's past my bedtime, I'd like to move approval.

2967
04:05:43,476 --> 04:05:45,137
[SPEAKER_42]: Through the chair, I have questions.

2968
04:05:45,157 --> 04:05:46,898
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Lococo.

2969
04:05:46,938 --> 04:05:49,439
[SPEAKER_44]: My first question is with regard to the funding.

2970
04:05:49,959 --> 04:05:50,200
[SPEAKER_44]: Sorry.

2971
04:05:51,515 --> 04:05:54,297
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm getting it all together myself.

2972
04:05:54,317 --> 04:05:58,959
[SPEAKER_44]: $2,075,000, is that what we requested specifically or did we request more and not get it?

2973
04:05:59,559 --> 04:06:01,220
[SPEAKER_39]: No, that's what we're requesting specifically.

2974
04:06:01,861 --> 04:06:11,546
[SPEAKER_44]: And so, how does the MWRA evaluate the amount you requested or was given?

2975
04:06:11,566 --> 04:06:19,971
[SPEAKER_44]: Because I appreciate the outline of a few streets that are going to get done and certain projects that are going to get done.

2976
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:27,666
[SPEAKER_44]: do we have, is there anything at City Hall that outlines exactly which streets are gonna be done and how much, you know, the proposal is?

2977
04:06:28,967 --> 04:06:29,207
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2978
04:06:29,367 --> 04:06:30,028
[SPEAKER_44]: So we, okay.

2979
04:06:30,608 --> 04:06:32,850
[SPEAKER_44]: Maybe if we, could we get a copy of that?

2980
04:06:35,092 --> 04:06:35,813
[SPEAKER_43]: Would this be it?

2981
04:06:36,093 --> 04:06:47,023
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, and, well, this isn't by number, I mean, because what I'm concerned with is replacement of residential lead water services with copper tubing, but one, two, and three don't,

2982
04:06:47,980 --> 04:07:04,783
[SPEAKER_44]: all under 1A don't list streets, so it's really, it's very good that this work's gonna get done, but as one Councilor, I would like to know where that's, how much is gonna be put towards 1, 2, and 3, and where the work is gonna be done.

2983
04:07:07,025 --> 04:07:10,507
[SPEAKER_39]: Under year one, it explains each street that would be worked on.

2984
04:07:10,587 --> 04:07:13,649
[SPEAKER_39]: Under year two, it explains each street that's programmed for year two.

2985
04:07:14,310 --> 04:07:19,033
[SPEAKER_39]: Under year three, and then Paris and Pinkert's a different package because that's designed already.

2986
04:07:19,594 --> 04:07:21,155
[SPEAKER_39]: That's already on the shelf ready to go.

2987
04:07:21,195 --> 04:07:22,976
[SPEAKER_39]: That's not part of this Water Works contract.

2988
04:07:26,879 --> 04:07:28,960
[SPEAKER_39]: So what we have is $929,000 left over from the previous borrowing.

2989
04:07:32,292 --> 04:07:34,834
[SPEAKER_39]: We're going to spend that money, we're going to reallocate that money.

2990
04:07:34,854 --> 04:07:37,257
[SPEAKER_39]: I've already talked to MWRA, they've already agreed to it.

2991
04:07:37,697 --> 04:07:41,641
[SPEAKER_39]: We're reallocating it to use toward these projects that are going up first.

2992
04:07:42,442 --> 04:07:47,807
[SPEAKER_39]: We're supplementing that $920,000 to move Grove Street up because Grove Street needs to be built.

2993
04:07:48,411 --> 04:07:51,353
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, we had the gas main done, and we were anticipating doing the water main.

2994
04:07:51,834 --> 04:07:54,976
[SPEAKER_39]: However, the contract fell apart, so we're rebidding it again this year.

2995
04:07:55,557 --> 04:08:03,083
[SPEAKER_39]: We're adding the hydraulic model, we're adding the lead service lines, and like I said, we're adding Paris and Pinkert because that project is designed.

2996
04:08:03,103 --> 04:08:11,029
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so the main, the beginning of the correspondence then is further explained.

2997
04:08:11,769 --> 04:08:12,890
[SPEAKER_44]: Through each year?

2998
04:08:13,110 --> 04:08:13,330
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2999
04:08:13,410 --> 04:08:14,490
[SPEAKER_44]: That makes more sense.

3000
04:08:14,590 --> 04:08:18,172
[SPEAKER_39]: And then we can add other projects as we need to because this is not limited.

3001
04:08:18,212 --> 04:08:28,237
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a everything but the kitchen sink type contract that we're putting in there if we need any spot repair work, the sewer, the catch basin or anything, we can have it done.

3002
04:08:29,198 --> 04:08:31,819
[SPEAKER_39]: It's a good mechanism, it's a reliable contractor.

3003
04:08:32,479 --> 04:08:41,104
[SPEAKER_39]: We are, you know, we've checked his references, he's putting all his bonds together so as soon as we have the funding for the full three years,

3004
04:08:41,784 --> 04:08:42,545
[SPEAKER_39]: We're good to go.

3005
04:08:45,348 --> 04:08:45,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Who's the contractor?

3006
04:08:46,569 --> 04:08:48,992
[SPEAKER_39]: Joseph P. Caraviello and Sons.

3007
04:08:49,032 --> 04:08:51,234
[SPEAKER_39]: He's the lowest eligible builder.

3008
04:08:51,254 --> 04:08:52,976
[SPEAKER_42]: I have two questions.

3009
04:08:53,757 --> 04:08:54,758
[SPEAKER_42]: What is the hydraulic project?

3010
04:08:55,873 --> 04:08:56,814
[SPEAKER_39]: Hydraulic pressure?

3011
04:08:56,834 --> 04:08:56,894
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3012
04:08:57,814 --> 04:08:59,676
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm sorry, you mean the hydraulic model?

3013
04:08:59,796 --> 04:09:00,056
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

3014
04:09:00,596 --> 04:09:09,282
[SPEAKER_39]: What that does is it looks at the entire city, so it takes a snapshot of where the pressure and volume problems are.

3015
04:09:09,302 --> 04:09:11,663
[SPEAKER_39]: We're also doing something called unidirectional flushing.

3016
04:09:11,683 --> 04:09:14,265
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a DPW effort, it's not really an engineering effort.

3017
04:09:14,385 --> 04:09:23,511
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm here representing the Department of Public Works, putting out the contract and the design on their behalf, on the water and sewer superintendents' behalf.

3018
04:09:23,531 --> 04:09:24,772
[SPEAKER_39]: You run a hydraulic model,

3019
04:09:25,292 --> 04:09:26,954
[SPEAKER_39]: to find out where your weak spots are.

3020
04:09:27,394 --> 04:09:34,039
[SPEAKER_39]: We did one in West Medford some years back and found out that we really needed to improve the water mains so we could have better flows and pressure.

3021
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:36,842
[SPEAKER_39]: We still have a couple of projects to do there, one of them being pitcher.

3022
04:09:37,883 --> 04:09:44,188
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, we're raising the gallons per minute from inadequate to 1,000, 1,300, 1,500 gallons per minute.

3023
04:09:44,208 --> 04:09:45,109
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

3024
04:09:46,610 --> 04:09:47,271
[SPEAKER_42]: One other question.

3025
04:09:47,631 --> 04:09:48,311
[SPEAKER_42]: Cutting and patching.

3026
04:09:49,463 --> 04:09:53,168
[SPEAKER_42]: Are any of these streets going to be paved in full that are being done here?

3027
04:09:53,428 --> 04:09:55,271
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, Evans is going to be pulverized.

3028
04:09:55,351 --> 04:10:04,503
[SPEAKER_39]: The reason why we could not pave Evans Street before because the macadam was so big and you have to do the water mains are neck down to be about this small in diameter.

3029
04:10:05,020 --> 04:10:08,742
[SPEAKER_39]: So if we just paved it, we'd be digging it up promptly to repair leaks.

3030
04:10:08,782 --> 04:10:10,303
[SPEAKER_39]: So we're going to crush Evans.

3031
04:10:11,084 --> 04:10:14,606
[SPEAKER_39]: We are repaving Grove.

3032
04:10:14,626 --> 04:10:15,987
[SPEAKER_42]: For repavement?

3033
04:10:16,347 --> 04:10:19,910
[SPEAKER_39]: Not crushing, but I believe it's going to be repaved.

3034
04:10:20,690 --> 04:10:21,491
[SPEAKER_39]: milled and paved.

3035
04:10:21,711 --> 04:10:22,312
[SPEAKER_42]: Milled and paved.

3036
04:10:22,332 --> 04:10:23,433
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, and some other streets.

3037
04:10:23,633 --> 04:10:26,655
[SPEAKER_39]: Streets like Vista, probably not paving in full.

3038
04:10:26,935 --> 04:10:30,818
[SPEAKER_39]: There's a mix of different types of treatments for the road surface once we're done.

3039
04:10:31,459 --> 04:10:36,663
[SPEAKER_39]: Parris Street, Pinker Street, full reconstruction, sidewalks, trees, drainage.

3040
04:10:39,305 --> 04:10:39,805
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President.

3041
04:10:40,546 --> 04:10:41,166
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Falco.

3042
04:10:41,246 --> 04:10:42,026
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3043
04:10:42,046 --> 04:10:49,030
[SPEAKER_31]: If I may, with regard to the hydraulic model, so how long does that take and do the results come back to you?

3044
04:10:49,610 --> 04:10:51,031
[SPEAKER_39]: The results come back to us, yes.

3045
04:10:51,651 --> 04:11:00,115
[SPEAKER_39]: We're using some of the information that we're getting from the unidirectional flushing that's starting slowly but moving on.

3046
04:11:01,593 --> 04:11:04,978
[SPEAKER_39]: where the weak spots are in the city or areas that we do need to do work.

3047
04:11:05,459 --> 04:11:09,785
[SPEAKER_39]: So it's a month's, it's not a year's long effort, it's a month's effort.

3048
04:11:10,286 --> 04:11:12,509
[SPEAKER_39]: We have some good data, but we have to supplement that.

3049
04:11:13,567 --> 04:11:14,788
[SPEAKER_31]: So when would that begin?

3050
04:11:15,609 --> 04:11:25,538
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as the hydraulic model, when could we expect some sort of report back that says these are the pain points, these neighborhoods or these streets.

3051
04:11:26,499 --> 04:11:36,249
[SPEAKER_31]: You go up into the heights and you hear complaints all the time with regard to pressure and people not being able to take a shower or flush the toilet without losing water somewhere.

3052
04:11:38,170 --> 04:11:49,405
[SPEAKER_31]: It would be nice to see some sort of a report that we could get that, you know, we could just be able to identify and then, you know, I would assume when you get that report back, you come up with some sort of a plan moving forward, right?

3053
04:11:50,175 --> 04:11:50,496
[SPEAKER_39]: Correct.

3054
04:11:50,536 --> 04:12:06,370
[SPEAKER_39]: In fact, when I read the last time I did a three-year, I put together this three-year contract before we started adding streets and taking some streets out, the plan was to do Fulton Street, you know, to upgrade that line, because once you improve that line, then you're improving service to the heights.

3055
04:12:06,791 --> 04:12:11,875
[SPEAKER_39]: We already know, I mean, anecdotally and empirically, we know some areas that are called the spots already.

3056
04:12:13,617 --> 04:12:14,697
[SPEAKER_39]: a citywide sweep.

3057
04:12:15,337 --> 04:12:23,879
[SPEAKER_39]: And when you're asking do we have any information now, we have some results from the unidirectional flushing that took place in the Heights that we can share.

3058
04:12:23,899 --> 04:12:36,981
[SPEAKER_39]: Depending on when we hire somebody and we can go out for engineering services, you know, as soon as we want to, we could have results in by, I'd say, late fall and perhaps spring.

3059
04:12:37,161 --> 04:12:41,202
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, I'd have to talk to the consultant and see what their schedule is and what they recommend.

3060
04:12:42,441 --> 04:12:42,661
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3061
04:12:43,722 --> 04:12:44,042
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3062
04:12:44,182 --> 04:12:44,682
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

3063
04:12:45,462 --> 04:12:46,443
[SPEAKER_29]: Vice President Mox.

3064
04:12:46,543 --> 04:12:47,363
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3065
04:12:47,383 --> 04:12:48,063
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'll be quick.

3066
04:12:49,024 --> 04:12:52,845
[SPEAKER_29]: The privately owned lead services, this is not the first time we've offered this.

3067
04:12:53,666 --> 04:12:55,486
[SPEAKER_29]: And I believe the last amount was roughly $200,000.

3068
04:12:55,707 --> 04:13:00,188
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you explain a little more on how it works?

3069
04:13:01,089 --> 04:13:06,391
[SPEAKER_29]: If I know I have a lead line that's coming into my home, what am I eligible for?

3070
04:13:06,411 --> 04:13:10,473
[SPEAKER_29]: Is this some type of 0 percent finance loan that I'm getting through this?

3071
04:13:11,213 --> 04:13:20,376
[SPEAKER_39]: Right in the past, people had to hire a contractor on their own, so the only part we took care of was the publicly owned piece, from the sidewalk to the main.

3072
04:13:21,216 --> 04:13:25,377
[SPEAKER_39]: But now we're saying to people, we would offer you a pass through.

3073
04:13:25,417 --> 04:13:39,402
[SPEAKER_39]: We're not sure of the exact mechanics just yet, but there are a few individuals that I've spoken to, and I'm sure there will be more that will come out, who would like to see some type of a program that allows them to pay over time, whether it's an attachment to their water bill, or it's broken into sections.

3074
04:13:40,302 --> 04:13:44,626
[SPEAKER_39]: We're flexible and neutral, I think, at this point on how it's all going to work.

3075
04:13:45,327 --> 04:13:50,231
[SPEAKER_39]: And then once we do know that, then we can roll that out to a larger audience and see how it works.

3076
04:13:50,652 --> 04:14:02,943
[SPEAKER_39]: It's the kind of project that takes more time and effort because you really have to pay attention to any disruption to somebody's property, make sure it's restored properly, make sure that you coordinate with people individually.

3077
04:14:04,802 --> 04:14:15,390
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't recall the numbers, but last I remember there were hundreds, if not maybe even thousands of lead lines still in the city, privately owned lead lines.

3078
04:14:16,370 --> 04:14:24,697
[SPEAKER_29]: And from what I recall, it's roughly five to six grand, and I'm not sure if that's on the city side as well as the individual homeowner.

3079
04:14:25,397 --> 04:14:30,700
[SPEAKER_29]: So, when we're talking 200,000, we're not talking many homes that can take advantage of this.

3080
04:14:30,920 --> 04:14:31,460
[SPEAKER_39]: You're correct.

3081
04:14:31,801 --> 04:14:41,046
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, what Fred Lasky told us a couple years back is that the MWRA provides lead-free water 30 miles to our home.

3082
04:14:41,826 --> 04:14:51,595
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the leaching point is the 10 feet from the street into my home where possible lead that sits in the pipe for a period of time can leach.

3083
04:14:52,615 --> 04:15:03,425
[SPEAKER_29]: And I find that shocking that it travels 30 miles with no lead contaminants, but it'll possibly pick up lead 10 feet from my house into my house.

3084
04:15:03,805 --> 04:15:05,967
[SPEAKER_39]: Or in your house, because of the solder.

3085
04:15:06,107 --> 04:15:07,007
[SPEAKER_29]: Or in the house, correct.

3086
04:15:07,027 --> 04:15:07,348
[SPEAKER_29]: And the fixtures.

3087
04:15:07,768 --> 04:15:08,108
[SPEAKER_29]: Correct.

3088
04:15:09,169 --> 04:15:11,811
[SPEAKER_29]: So I support that wholeheartedly.

3089
04:15:12,231 --> 04:15:14,212
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to see some figures.

3090
04:15:15,053 --> 04:15:18,955
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know if it was you or Dawn Ouellette that provided the last set of figures.

3091
04:15:19,016 --> 04:15:19,976
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a while back.

3092
04:15:20,497 --> 04:15:22,758
[SPEAKER_29]: But how many lead service lines there are in the community.

3093
04:15:23,659 --> 04:15:27,061
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that'd be pretty interesting to find out.

3094
04:15:27,561 --> 04:15:30,263
[SPEAKER_29]: And maybe if, how are you gonna get this out to the public?

3095
04:15:30,303 --> 04:15:32,585
[SPEAKER_29]: How are they gonna be aware that this is out?

3096
04:15:33,347 --> 04:15:37,751
[SPEAKER_39]: Well, right now, because as you mentioned, it's not a large amount of money.

3097
04:15:38,732 --> 04:15:43,176
[SPEAKER_39]: We have individuals who have called in about the program.

3098
04:15:43,436 --> 04:15:46,939
[SPEAKER_39]: The MWRA launched it last July, so it's about a year old.

3099
04:15:47,599 --> 04:15:58,569
[SPEAKER_39]: And it has had some problem getting off the grounds with other cities and towns, so we're going to use the information that they've garnered to help us design something that's more

3100
04:16:00,222 --> 04:16:01,242
[SPEAKER_39]: you know, more foolproof.

3101
04:16:02,042 --> 04:16:20,027
[SPEAKER_39]: But if you said, for example, we have an estimate of potentially 600 services, then we would reach out to people that we think may still have a lead mind, you know, and then ask them if they wanted to be part of this program, and then start taking it on one service at a time.

3102
04:16:20,047 --> 04:16:24,088
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, almost for the 200,000 on a first come, first serve basis.

3103
04:16:24,628 --> 04:16:28,171
[SPEAKER_39]: Not everybody has wanted to do the work.

3104
04:16:28,291 --> 04:16:35,757
[SPEAKER_39]: Every time we do a project and we change out the public side, every single homeowner is approached and asked if they want to change out their service.

3105
04:16:36,097 --> 04:16:37,078
[SPEAKER_39]: Some of them refuse.

3106
04:16:37,838 --> 04:16:46,285
[SPEAKER_39]: Some of them do it later, some of them do it at the same time with that contractor for a better price because he's already paid mobilization, he's already there on site.

3107
04:16:47,143 --> 04:16:49,224
[SPEAKER_39]: So we try to wrap it into the project anyway.

3108
04:16:49,264 --> 04:16:50,664
[SPEAKER_39]: We can't force anybody to do it.

3109
04:16:51,524 --> 04:16:59,827
[SPEAKER_39]: I have a letter, almost a form letter saying we strongly recommend that you do this and this is the time to do it and we get some done.

3110
04:16:59,847 --> 04:17:05,109
[SPEAKER_29]: I think if people were aware that possibly they could roll it into their bill.

3111
04:17:06,229 --> 04:17:14,733
[SPEAKER_29]: Over a period of time so they don't feel the impact that may be helpful to get more people on board And just one one quick thing the leak detection.

3112
04:17:15,034 --> 04:17:20,196
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that's been an issue for a while We were told that this company is on board now.

3113
04:17:20,256 --> 04:17:20,816
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that correct?

3114
04:17:21,777 --> 04:17:22,597
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, thank you

3115
04:17:29,511 --> 04:17:30,833
[SPEAKER_50]: Move to the question, Mr. President.

3116
04:17:31,033 --> 04:17:31,273
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

3117
04:17:31,694 --> 04:17:35,138
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

3118
04:17:35,158 --> 04:17:35,739
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk.

3119
04:17:36,039 --> 04:17:36,540
[SPEAKER_24]: First reading.

3120
04:17:37,581 --> 04:17:39,403
[SPEAKER_42]: For the first reading, please call the roll.

3121
04:17:42,727 --> 04:17:43,288
[SPEAKER_42]: Just woke me up.

3122
04:17:50,730 --> 04:17:51,511
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

3123
04:17:51,551 --> 04:17:51,851
[SPEAKER_47]: Yay.

3124
04:17:52,532 --> 04:17:53,212
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

3125
04:17:53,533 --> 04:17:53,793
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3126
04:17:54,213 --> 04:17:54,634
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knight?

3127
04:17:54,814 --> 04:17:55,034
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3128
04:17:55,675 --> 04:17:56,356
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Kern?

3129
04:17:56,476 --> 04:17:56,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

3130
04:17:57,417 --> 04:17:58,237
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Monk?

3131
04:17:58,277 --> 04:17:58,578
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3132
04:17:59,158 --> 04:17:59,859
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3133
04:17:59,879 --> 04:18:00,099
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3134
04:18:02,241 --> 04:18:04,283
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

3135
04:18:04,764 --> 04:18:06,566
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion takes its first reading.

3136
04:18:06,586 --> 04:18:14,033
[SPEAKER_42]: 17582, dear Mr. President, city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body

3137
04:18:14,774 --> 04:18:24,122
[SPEAKER_42]: approve the following transfer of $1,500,000 to be transferred from water and sewer retained earnings to a water sewer capital project account.

3138
04:18:25,010 --> 04:18:31,572
[SPEAKER_42]: The amount of $1.5 million is needed for replacement of water mains, valves, and appurtenances in the City of Medford.

3139
04:18:32,052 --> 04:18:39,754
[SPEAKER_42]: Finance Director Aleesha Nunley and Engineering Director Cassandra Coulis are on present to answer any of the council's questions regarding the matter.

3140
04:18:40,014 --> 04:18:45,015
[SPEAKER_42]: The remaining valves in the water sewer retained earnings after this transfer will be $5,476,978.

3141
04:18:45,115 --> 04:18:45,635
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening.

3142
04:18:53,458 --> 04:18:57,860
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening, Councilors.

3143
04:18:58,000 --> 04:18:58,420
[SPEAKER_36]: Good morning.

3144
04:18:58,480 --> 04:19:05,163
[SPEAKER_36]: This is 1.5 is in addition to that $2 million, so we wanted to do the $2 million loan at 0% and then pay the remainder with retained earnings.

3145
04:19:08,444 --> 04:19:08,924
[SPEAKER_36]: To the Chair.

3146
04:19:08,944 --> 04:19:09,865
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, go ahead.

3147
04:19:09,885 --> 04:19:10,745
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Lohman, go ahead.

3148
04:19:12,766 --> 04:19:20,489
[SPEAKER_44]: To the Chair, so what we were given tonight, which is the summary of work, is estimated to cost a total of $4,000?

3149
04:19:20,529 --> 04:19:21,609
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean $4 million?

3150
04:19:24,879 --> 04:19:28,160
[SPEAKER_38]: The contract, Caraviello's contract is 3.463 million.

3151
04:19:28,180 --> 04:19:28,440
[SPEAKER_38]: 3.463 million.

3152
04:19:28,460 --> 04:19:32,661
[SPEAKER_38]: So almost 3.5, and then the 200,000 for the lead service would bring it to 3.7.

3153
04:19:32,742 --> 04:19:35,442
[SPEAKER_36]: So what are we doing with the extra monies?

3154
04:19:55,021 --> 04:19:56,642
[SPEAKER_44]: Sorry, I'm taking these, my calculator.

3155
04:19:57,802 --> 04:20:12,668
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, the little bit of what is extra, some things within the loan program, like you had asked, I believe, what was chosen by the MWRA, some items are considered to be included and eligible by MWRA, some items are not.

3156
04:20:14,629 --> 04:20:16,590
[SPEAKER_36]: So there's a little cushion there for that.

3157
04:20:16,730 --> 04:20:24,273
[SPEAKER_36]: Also, we have $125,000 in the budget towards this as well for water meters and MTUs.

3158
04:20:26,190 --> 04:20:28,391
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't hear that, I'm sorry, I was calculating the numbers.

3159
04:20:28,471 --> 04:20:31,891
[SPEAKER_39]: Say that one more time, I'm sorry.

3160
04:20:31,931 --> 04:20:43,114
[SPEAKER_39]: There's $225,000 in the loan application, there's 125,000 in the budget currently for new water meters, large meters, residential meters, and the meter reading devices.

3161
04:20:48,856 --> 04:20:51,776
[SPEAKER_44]: So you have 3.463,200,000 for the lead service, and then additional money's needed?

3162
04:20:55,535 --> 04:21:01,297
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, and there's money already in the loan program, there's leftover money that we're going to reallocate.

3163
04:21:04,379 --> 04:21:06,960
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, I guess the numbers just aren't adding up to me.

3164
04:21:07,480 --> 04:21:17,064
[SPEAKER_44]: With the leftover money, the 2.75 million and the 1.5 million, that adds up to four and a half million.

3165
04:21:18,244 --> 04:21:19,425
[SPEAKER_44]: And I see us only spending

3166
04:21:21,985 --> 04:21:22,606
[SPEAKER_44]: $3,600,000.

3167
04:21:22,105 --> 04:21:22,606
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, $3,600,000.

3168
04:21:22,646 --> 04:21:29,951
[SPEAKER_44]: We have the hydraulic model, we have Paris and Pinkert Street.

3169
04:21:41,641 --> 04:21:45,124
[SPEAKER_44]: That's why I think I asked earlier, just like the breakdown.

3170
04:21:45,184 --> 04:21:57,195
[SPEAKER_44]: I appreciate this, but it's 11.30 and to just start reading things that contain millions of dollars, I would ask what is the timeline for this?

3171
04:21:57,235 --> 04:22:05,923
[SPEAKER_44]: Can we have a Committee of the Whole meeting before our August meeting and take a vote on this paper then, once everything is completely understood?

3172
04:22:08,775 --> 04:22:13,610
[SPEAKER_44]: We can get a better breakdown of the money portion of it and where it's being spent and on what.

3173
04:22:14,078 --> 04:22:16,159
[SPEAKER_44]: I feel like I'm doing calculating work.

3174
04:22:16,619 --> 04:22:23,841
[SPEAKER_36]: If I may, through the chair, she already has a contract out there, so we would like to get the work done as soon as possible.

3175
04:22:24,341 --> 04:22:34,904
[SPEAKER_36]: I would absolutely be open to provide all of the Councilors with a breakdown of all the funds, but the faster we can actually get out there and start to get the work done and get that infrastructure moving, then we can start the paving.

3176
04:22:34,924 --> 04:22:36,704
[SPEAKER_36]: I would really hate for it to go too long.

3177
04:22:37,564 --> 04:22:39,585
[SPEAKER_44]: And I understand that,

3178
04:22:41,088 --> 04:22:48,394
[SPEAKER_44]: to vote for 1.5 million to be taken out of water and sewer retained earnings, and maybe we only need a million, it's a big difference.

3179
04:22:48,574 --> 04:22:50,075
[SPEAKER_44]: No, you're gonna need 1.5.

3180
04:22:50,675 --> 04:22:51,296
[SPEAKER_44]: You're gonna need it.

3181
04:22:51,376 --> 04:22:56,520
[SPEAKER_44]: So you're gonna need the four and a half million dollars to do all this work.

3182
04:22:56,540 --> 04:22:57,881
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, yes.

3183
04:22:58,421 --> 04:22:59,582
[SPEAKER_39]: And what's in the application.

3184
04:22:59,622 --> 04:22:59,923
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

3185
04:23:01,324 --> 04:23:02,304
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a combined.

3186
04:23:03,889 --> 04:23:04,809
[SPEAKER_39]: It's supplemental.

3187
04:23:05,410 --> 04:23:10,392
[SPEAKER_39]: So this is the contract and then we have water meters and meter reading devices.

3188
04:23:10,432 --> 04:23:11,873
[SPEAKER_39]: We have Paris and Pinkert Street.

3189
04:23:12,853 --> 04:23:16,495
[SPEAKER_39]: We have the hydraulic model and we have the private lead services.

3190
04:23:17,475 --> 04:23:22,378
[SPEAKER_39]: So what I shared with you tonight is a summary of the work in the contract, the three-year contract.

3191
04:23:25,553 --> 04:23:26,693
[SPEAKER_39]: So it's not everything.

3192
04:23:27,314 --> 04:23:36,577
[SPEAKER_39]: And I know it seems a little confusing, and I apologize for that, but it's a piecing together of different funding sources to do all of this work.

3193
04:23:36,957 --> 04:23:44,720
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's correct in that we do, I don't even know, it's going to be exactly 1.5, we might be slightly short.

3194
04:23:45,441 --> 04:23:46,921
[SPEAKER_39]: It's not that we'll have too much money.

3195
04:23:49,302 --> 04:23:51,263
[SPEAKER_39]: I can vouch for that as I look at my notes.

3196
04:23:53,465 --> 04:24:12,758
[SPEAKER_44]: I just think when we're talking about $4.5 million worth of projects that were probably definitely needed within the city, and we don't get any documentation on it except two lines in our council agenda until tonight, which obviously we didn't have time to read because we had lengthy discussions on other issues.

3197
04:24:12,778 --> 04:24:14,680
[SPEAKER_39]: Do you all have the application directions after tonight?

3198
04:24:21,494 --> 04:24:25,835
[SPEAKER_37]: Through the chair, Councilor, if I could help you with that a little bit.

3199
04:24:25,955 --> 04:24:26,235
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

3200
04:24:26,415 --> 04:24:40,357
[SPEAKER_37]: So, the 3.5 million that's needed for the three-year contract and some other little things that you have in there, like the hydraulic model, is 3.5 million.

3201
04:24:40,457 --> 04:24:48,919
[SPEAKER_37]: And then there's an additional 200,000 that we would like to include the lead replacement program, for the lead replacement program.

3202
04:24:49,519 --> 04:24:52,561
[SPEAKER_37]: we're at 3.7 million.

3203
04:24:53,201 --> 04:25:04,087
[SPEAKER_37]: The loan through the MWRA is for 2.075 million, so that gets us, if you take that from the 3.7 million, that leaves a difference of 1.625.

3204
04:25:08,026 --> 04:25:08,526
[SPEAKER_37]: Did you get that?

3205
04:25:08,726 --> 04:25:09,807
[SPEAKER_37]: Are you with me?

3206
04:25:11,048 --> 04:25:14,009
[SPEAKER_37]: Gotcha.

3207
04:25:14,089 --> 04:25:19,572
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, so from that 1.625, 125,000 was in the budget.

3208
04:25:21,053 --> 04:25:25,676
[SPEAKER_37]: So we'd free up that money that was in the budget for water main replacement.

3209
04:25:26,256 --> 04:25:33,740
[SPEAKER_37]: So we take that 125 out, we're at 1.5 million, which is where we need to take from retained earnings.

3210
04:25:36,186 --> 04:25:40,687
[SPEAKER_37]: So that would pay for all of what we need right now.

3211
04:25:43,908 --> 04:25:49,490
[SPEAKER_44]: And what about the $929,000 left over from the last time we borrowed from the MWRA?

3212
04:25:49,550 --> 04:25:58,112
[SPEAKER_37]: That's authorized unissued debt that we can use through MMDT to, I believe you were gonna use that for Harris and Pinkert as a separate project?

3213
04:25:58,192 --> 04:25:59,313
[SPEAKER_39]: It's all supplemental.

3214
04:26:00,033 --> 04:26:02,854
[SPEAKER_39]: When you bid a job like this, you don't say give me a price for

3215
04:26:03,794 --> 04:26:06,057
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't know if it's fair to say that.

3216
04:26:17,705 --> 04:26:21,768
[SPEAKER_44]: So you give him how many feet of pipe we need.

3217
04:26:21,808 --> 04:26:23,929
[SPEAKER_39]: Total feet of pipe and he gives me a number.

3218
04:26:24,270 --> 04:26:31,194
[SPEAKER_39]: So I can't tell you how much he bid on Grove Street compared to some other street because he doesn't do it that way.

3219
04:26:31,214 --> 04:26:32,195
[SPEAKER_39]: He's giving you totals.

3220
04:26:32,855 --> 04:26:35,998
[SPEAKER_39]: So we have backup estimates that we put together.

3221
04:26:36,758 --> 04:26:39,299
[SPEAKER_39]: for an engineer's estimate, it summarizes.

3222
04:26:40,159 --> 04:26:42,800
[SPEAKER_39]: And ours was actually higher than what he bid.

3223
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:45,981
[SPEAKER_39]: So he came in lower, but I just don't want to prorate it.

3224
04:26:46,121 --> 04:26:48,621
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't think that would be the way to go.

3225
04:26:49,361 --> 04:26:55,803
[SPEAKER_44]: So... So if you were to give the council pricing, it would be broken down a different way.

3226
04:26:55,823 --> 04:26:58,484
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, it wouldn't be the same thing.

3227
04:26:58,564 --> 04:27:00,024
[SPEAKER_39]: It would be estimates.

3228
04:27:00,965 --> 04:27:05,906
[SPEAKER_39]: I mean, we could actually, you know, we're going to use the budget numbers, you know, for the...

3229
04:27:06,986 --> 04:27:10,707
[SPEAKER_39]: The meters will cost whatever they cost within the $225,000.

3230
04:27:12,128 --> 04:27:18,769
[SPEAKER_39]: The estimate for the lead services is estimating $5,000 a service, but they may get a price of $6,000.

3231
04:27:18,809 --> 04:27:20,150
[SPEAKER_39]: We might have one at $7,000, one at $4,000.

3232
04:27:21,470 --> 04:27:27,592
[SPEAKER_39]: We don't know until we go house by house, case by case, how much each one of those will cost.

3233
04:27:29,388 --> 04:27:34,691
[SPEAKER_39]: And the idea would be come up with a bid in the future that would say, here is a relatively simple change out.

3234
04:27:34,731 --> 04:27:37,933
[SPEAKER_39]: Here's a more medium level change out.

3235
04:27:37,973 --> 04:27:39,114
[SPEAKER_39]: Here's a complicated one.

3236
04:27:39,174 --> 04:27:40,715
[SPEAKER_39]: Give us three prices for each.

3237
04:27:41,415 --> 04:27:43,876
[SPEAKER_39]: So we can then partition it out better.

3238
04:27:44,497 --> 04:27:45,057
Okay.

3239
04:27:46,318 --> 04:27:46,578
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

3240
04:27:48,679 --> 04:27:49,480
[SPEAKER_46]: Councilor Dello Russo.

3241
04:27:50,000 --> 04:28:04,355
[SPEAKER_51]: Mr. President, I just want to say that I'm sure the people of Medford can enthusiastically look forward to these improvements that are coming to the neighborhoods and in the city.

3242
04:28:04,775 --> 04:28:06,297
[SPEAKER_51]: Many of them long sought after.

3243
04:28:06,317 --> 04:28:09,820
[SPEAKER_51]: I endorse the efforts of the

3244
04:28:12,142 --> 04:28:18,526
[SPEAKER_51]: engineers office and the financial offices that are putting together these great deals throughout the community.

3245
04:28:19,126 --> 04:28:20,167
[SPEAKER_51]: I have one question.

3246
04:28:20,827 --> 04:28:23,668
[SPEAKER_51]: If I may, to either Ms.

3247
04:28:23,728 --> 04:28:37,015
[SPEAKER_51]: Irwin or Nunley, the $1.5 million that we're going to take out of retained earnings, will the use of that and the debt payment that will come out of

3248
04:28:39,817 --> 04:28:55,711
[SPEAKER_51]: retained earnings in any way alter our profile for loan orders in the future or make our ability to bond and repay those bonds on those major capital products any weaker.

3249
04:28:56,532 --> 04:28:58,374
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you for your foresight and your preparation.

3250
04:28:58,394 --> 04:28:59,475
[SPEAKER_51]: Move approval, Mr. President.

3251
04:28:59,735 --> 04:29:02,978
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Dela Ruta, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3252
04:29:03,658 --> 04:29:05,260
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3253
04:29:07,722 --> 04:29:08,643
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Dello Russo?

3254
04:29:08,864 --> 04:29:09,264
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3255
04:29:09,605 --> 04:29:10,326
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Falco?

3256
04:29:10,426 --> 04:29:10,666
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

3257
04:29:11,087 --> 04:29:11,608
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Knight?

3258
04:29:11,668 --> 04:29:11,928
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3259
04:29:12,589 --> 04:29:13,410
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Wendell Kern?

3260
04:29:13,831 --> 04:29:14,091
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

3261
04:29:14,772 --> 04:29:15,574
[SPEAKER_47]: Vice President Marks?

3262
04:29:15,614 --> 04:29:15,974
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3263
04:29:16,315 --> 04:29:17,116
[SPEAKER_47]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3264
04:29:19,419 --> 04:29:19,720
[SPEAKER_42]: Absent.

3265
04:29:20,441 --> 04:29:21,202
[SPEAKER_47]: President Caraviello?

3266
04:29:21,322 --> 04:29:21,523
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

3267
04:29:24,461 --> 04:29:26,282
[SPEAKER_42]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

3268
04:29:27,343 --> 04:29:28,183
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3269
04:29:28,563 --> 04:29:30,064
[SPEAKER_51]: Motion to adjourn, Mr. President.

3270
04:29:30,084 --> 04:29:32,566
[SPEAKER_44]: Reports from committee, 17584.

3271
04:29:32,866 --> 04:29:35,248
[SPEAKER_42]: Unfortunately, Mr. Dello Russo, we do have some more things under there.

3272
04:29:35,728 --> 04:29:37,469
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, Councilor Montgomery, what did you want?

3273
04:29:37,509 --> 04:29:42,733
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, we have a few other people that'd like to speak, and we have one petition for a sign.

3274
04:29:43,553 --> 04:29:45,615
[SPEAKER_42]: I think that's with Councilor Marks, which would be... 17584.

3275
04:29:47,782 --> 04:29:52,704
[SPEAKER_42]: We're already here.

3276
04:29:52,724 --> 04:29:57,086
[SPEAKER_42]: 17584, Subcommittee on Business, Economic Development and Science Report, July 13th.

3277
04:29:57,266 --> 04:30:00,867
[SPEAKER_42]: The purpose was to review and discuss signs in our reversal petition.

3278
04:30:01,207 --> 04:30:05,349
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Marks, who is the chairman of that committee, would you like to give us a report?

3279
04:30:05,669 --> 04:30:12,472
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, Mr. President, the subcommittee on business, economic development, and science met Thursday, July 13th at 5 p.m.

3280
04:30:13,412 --> 04:30:25,138
[SPEAKER_29]: for the purpose of three signed denial petitions, of which paper 17-553, the ultimate tango, was approved as resubmitted to this council.

3281
04:30:26,538 --> 04:30:28,219
[SPEAKER_29]: And the other two papers, 17-452 and 17-450,

3282
04:30:35,642 --> 04:30:40,785
[SPEAKER_29]: were received and placed on file, Mr. President, because the petitioners were not present.

3283
04:30:41,466 --> 04:30:42,527
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

3284
04:30:42,547 --> 04:30:44,368
[SPEAKER_29]: So I move approval on that report.

3285
04:30:45,629 --> 04:30:47,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. President, I second that.

3286
04:30:48,521 --> 04:30:52,204
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3287
04:30:52,385 --> 04:30:53,085
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3288
04:30:53,345 --> 04:30:53,666
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3289
04:30:54,026 --> 04:30:55,087
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3290
04:30:55,607 --> 04:30:57,809
[SPEAKER_52]: Motion approval on that sign, Mr. President.

3291
04:30:57,829 --> 04:31:00,031
[SPEAKER_52]: Motion on the approval of the sign.

3292
04:31:00,211 --> 04:31:02,814
[SPEAKER_52]: As was amended and discussed in committee.

3293
04:31:03,414 --> 04:31:06,797
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by second Councilor Knight.

3294
04:31:06,917 --> 04:31:07,598
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3295
04:31:07,778 --> 04:31:07,978
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3296
04:31:08,299 --> 04:31:09,019
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3297
04:31:09,319 --> 04:31:10,100
[SPEAKER_42]: Congratulations.

3298
04:31:10,420 --> 04:31:11,281
[SPEAKER_42]: Keep dancing.

3299
04:31:14,084 --> 04:31:14,906
[SPEAKER_25]: August 1st.

3300
04:31:15,346 --> 04:31:16,028
[SPEAKER_42]: August 1st.

3301
04:31:16,488 --> 04:31:16,949
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3302
04:31:17,330 --> 04:31:18,051
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3303
04:31:18,151 --> 04:31:20,195
[SPEAKER_42]: All right.

3304
04:31:20,335 --> 04:31:22,539
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

3305
04:31:27,441 --> 04:31:40,584
[SPEAKER_42]: 17574, petition by Andrew P. Castagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, to address the council about making America a democracy again, starting in Medford.

3306
04:31:40,604 --> 04:31:43,865
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Castagnetti, if I can remind you, the 10 minute rule is in effect.

3307
04:31:47,326 --> 04:31:47,646
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, sir.

3308
04:31:47,666 --> 04:31:48,346
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much.

3309
04:31:59,632 --> 04:32:03,814
[SPEAKER_33]: Andrew Paul Castagnetti, 23 Cushman Street Method Massachusetts.

3310
04:32:05,355 --> 04:32:07,296
[SPEAKER_33]: Good evening honorable city councilors.

3311
04:32:09,357 --> 04:32:10,838
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, almost good morning.

3312
04:32:10,858 --> 04:32:11,879
[SPEAKER_33]: It's almost midnight.

3313
04:32:14,020 --> 04:32:19,103
[SPEAKER_33]: God bless America for allowing me to file my petition and speak on this matter with our first amendment right.

3314
04:32:20,083 --> 04:32:23,325
[SPEAKER_33]: I promise to be brief as possible and not ad lib.

3315
04:32:25,327 --> 04:32:32,012
[SPEAKER_33]: Therefore, I'll read from my teleprompter of handwritten notes before me.

3316
04:32:32,673 --> 04:32:34,254
[SPEAKER_33]: I only need about eight minutes.

3317
04:32:36,035 --> 04:32:39,358
[SPEAKER_33]: If the phone works, it's 1151 for the record.

3318
04:32:43,001 --> 04:32:45,483
[SPEAKER_33]: Are we a democracy or not a democracy?

3319
04:32:45,763 --> 04:32:46,724
[SPEAKER_33]: That is my question.

3320
04:32:47,385 --> 04:32:52,629
[SPEAKER_33]: An extreme concern here in 02155 and for all of the United States of America.

3321
04:32:53,678 --> 04:33:03,121
[SPEAKER_33]: Number two, for example, I must read two letters that were issued from the City of Medford Board of Health.

3322
04:33:03,901 --> 04:33:14,024
[SPEAKER_33]: The first letter was sent, I'm not sure of the date because it's not dated, from Mary Ann O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health.

3323
04:33:15,245 --> 04:33:18,626
[SPEAKER_33]: It states, the Board of Health recently voted to implement

3324
04:33:20,070 --> 04:33:22,852
[SPEAKER_33]: proposed changes to Medford tobacco regulations.

3325
04:33:23,692 --> 04:33:28,255
[SPEAKER_33]: As of July 10, 2017, the proposed changes will become effective.

3326
04:33:29,796 --> 04:33:34,098
[SPEAKER_33]: And in the bottom, it's directed towards private clubs.

3327
04:33:34,859 --> 04:33:39,701
[SPEAKER_33]: Smoking prohibited in private clubs slash memberships associations.

3328
04:33:41,162 --> 04:33:44,064
[SPEAKER_33]: Another letter was also sent out thereafter.

3329
04:33:44,604 --> 04:33:45,665
[SPEAKER_33]: What date, I don't know.

3330
04:33:46,025 --> 04:33:47,186
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not dated, again.

3331
04:33:49,563 --> 04:33:51,324
[SPEAKER_33]: Same department, same director.

3332
04:33:52,325 --> 04:33:55,588
[SPEAKER_33]: It states, Board of Health notice to private clubs.

3333
04:33:56,088 --> 04:34:05,335
[SPEAKER_33]: The Medford Board of Health voted at the June meeting to postpone the enactment of the private club smoking ban for six months until after the next election.

3334
04:34:09,078 --> 04:34:12,721
[SPEAKER_33]: Three, it seems very undemocratic, you'd think.

3335
04:34:14,158 --> 04:34:19,277
[SPEAKER_33]: Before I continue, I'll disclose I am an officer at the Sons of Italy in Winchester, Massachusetts.

3336
04:34:20,320 --> 04:34:24,202
[SPEAKER_33]: And yes, the club did ban smoking, November of 016.

3337
04:34:25,123 --> 04:34:30,506
[SPEAKER_33]: However, the private club membership voted amongst themselves in a democratic election period.

3338
04:34:31,087 --> 04:34:36,630
[SPEAKER_33]: Furthermore, the Winchester town government never dictated any such order.

3339
04:34:37,231 --> 04:34:45,396
[SPEAKER_33]: And also, our club did allow a special area for the people to go and enjoy their medicine, smoking.

3340
04:34:47,938 --> 04:34:50,799
[SPEAKER_33]: With thoughtful respect, thank you to the sons of Italy.

3341
04:34:51,500 --> 04:34:55,762
[SPEAKER_33]: Number five, look, we understand that smoking is a nasty addictive habit.

3342
04:34:56,382 --> 04:35:00,765
[SPEAKER_33]: My belief is nicotine is the most addictive drug on earth.

3343
04:35:01,465 --> 04:35:04,487
[SPEAKER_33]: They say smoking kills people and may indeed be killing me.

3344
04:35:05,167 --> 04:35:10,830
[SPEAKER_33]: However, did anyone ever think that this nicotine medicine kept me alive for 66 years?

3345
04:35:11,930 --> 04:35:12,551
[SPEAKER_33]: And many others.

3346
04:35:13,477 --> 04:35:14,398
[SPEAKER_33]: especially U.S.

3347
04:35:14,778 --> 04:35:21,163
[SPEAKER_33]: soldiers who are now veterans, a la VFW, American Legion, and more.

3348
04:35:21,984 --> 04:35:36,316
[SPEAKER_33]: Six, by the way, my point of factual information, when I started smoking in 1962, cigarettes was 28 cents a pack, the same price as a gallon of gasoline at Dick's Esso at Tufts Park.

3349
04:35:37,344 --> 04:35:41,606
[SPEAKER_33]: OK, so gas is now $2.10 a gallon.

3350
04:35:42,246 --> 04:35:49,429
[SPEAKER_33]: But a package of smokes is five times more than that in Texas.

3351
04:35:50,409 --> 04:35:57,753
[SPEAKER_33]: Costing the most addicted and poorest people in society more than $10 per package.

3352
04:35:58,813 --> 04:36:03,195
[SPEAKER_33]: PS, most of that $10 is federal, state, local taxes.

3353
04:36:04,008 --> 04:36:10,933
[SPEAKER_33]: hello, if we all stop smoking, the government will lose billions in tax revenue.

3354
04:36:11,373 --> 04:36:23,922
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't even want to think how and what the government would tax to recoup the huge tax loss, especially with Proposition 2.5 in effect in Massachusetts.

3355
04:36:24,282 --> 04:36:26,423
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Barbara Anderson.

3356
04:36:26,543 --> 04:36:27,224
[SPEAKER_33]: Rest her soul.

3357
04:36:29,196 --> 04:36:32,459
[SPEAKER_33]: 6A, please don't get too lost in what I just said.

3358
04:36:33,179 --> 04:36:36,402
[SPEAKER_33]: But at that time, I really felt that way, and I still do.

3359
04:36:39,524 --> 04:36:42,146
[SPEAKER_33]: In closing, sorry, I'm going to have to ad lib now.

3360
04:36:45,108 --> 04:36:57,698
[SPEAKER_33]: Once, I agree with the past councilor, President Robert Mayorko, when he once said, leave the people alone.

3361
04:37:01,455 --> 04:37:04,999
[SPEAKER_33]: I remember it because it was the only time I agreed with a man.

3362
04:37:08,402 --> 04:37:10,705
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll never forget it, but that never happened.

3363
04:37:10,725 --> 04:37:10,705
8.

3364
04:37:12,406 --> 04:37:17,432
[SPEAKER_33]: It seems Big Brother, the government, has its own nasty habit.

3365
04:37:19,158 --> 04:37:21,539
[SPEAKER_33]: of putting their nose in people's private business.

3366
04:37:22,419 --> 04:37:23,700
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, again, and again.

3367
04:37:24,100 --> 04:37:41,186
[SPEAKER_33]: It is appalling to me and many other voters when our so-called leaders dictate to our VFW veterans of way too many wars, demanding that we cease from smoking in our private club.

3368
04:37:41,587 --> 04:37:45,048
[SPEAKER_33]: This is not fair and very undemocratic.

3369
04:37:46,114 --> 04:37:50,356
[SPEAKER_33]: We, the member peoples, are very capable to vote amongst ourselves.

3370
04:37:51,237 --> 04:38:13,908
[SPEAKER_33]: Furthermore, these fellow veterans who sacrificed life and limb and much more that I couldn't even comprehend, and we don't want to walk a mile on this show, I'm sure, unless you already have, you don't want to go back there, are the only reason we are not speaking German on the East Coast or Japanese on the West Coast and maybe even Mexican up to the Mason-Dixon line.

3371
04:38:16,446 --> 04:38:23,010
[SPEAKER_33]: Number nine, you know when I started kindergarten at the Hancock School, I no speak of the English at all.

3372
04:38:23,851 --> 04:38:25,552
[SPEAKER_33]: I spoke a Northern Italian dialect.

3373
04:38:26,353 --> 04:38:32,617
[SPEAKER_33]: Eventually I picked up your English as my second language without an ESL teacher.

3374
04:38:33,097 --> 04:38:39,902
[SPEAKER_33]: But I do remember quite well those 50s teachers told me, this country is based on democracy.

3375
04:38:43,142 --> 04:38:58,045
[SPEAKER_33]: However, I've learned since then that this may be the biggest lie of all time, because it seems to be capitalism rules, and therefore trumps over our so-called democracy.

3376
04:38:58,866 --> 04:39:01,126
[SPEAKER_33]: So please, back off.

3377
04:39:02,827 --> 04:39:04,487
[SPEAKER_33]: Leave us alone.

3378
04:39:06,048 --> 04:39:16,479
[SPEAKER_33]: And finally, number 10, my fellow VFW members asked me to ask you all, will you stand on this matter now tonight, July 18th, 2017?

3379
04:39:22,778 --> 04:39:24,159
[SPEAKER_33]: This is from seven minutes ago.

3380
04:39:24,379 --> 04:39:24,499
[SPEAKER_33]: It's 11.58.

3381
04:39:25,199 --> 04:39:30,962
[SPEAKER_42]: You have about four minutes left, three minutes left, three minutes left.

3382
04:39:30,982 --> 04:39:31,843
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't want that much time.

3383
04:39:31,863 --> 04:39:33,243
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't want that much time.

3384
04:39:33,263 --> 04:39:34,584
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm going to repeat number 10, however.

3385
04:39:34,604 --> 04:39:35,604
[SPEAKER_33]: I got to get off track.

3386
04:39:35,725 --> 04:39:36,725
[SPEAKER_42]: We have our timer going.

3387
04:39:36,945 --> 04:39:37,405
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, sir.

3388
04:39:39,226 --> 04:39:52,013
[SPEAKER_33]: My fellow VFW members, including the top three, Commander Down, and in succession, they asked me to ask you all, where you stand on this matter now, tonight,

3389
04:39:53,008 --> 04:39:54,309
[SPEAKER_33]: before the next general election.

3390
04:39:55,470 --> 04:39:56,311
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for listening.

3391
04:40:12,960 --> 04:40:20,304
[SPEAKER_49]: important to point out that when the Massachusetts State Legislature passed the public smoking ban back in the early 2000s, they exempted private clubs.

3392
04:40:20,864 --> 04:40:23,045
[SPEAKER_49]: And they exempted private clubs and they allowed local control.

3393
04:40:23,725 --> 04:40:26,306
[SPEAKER_49]: And they vested that local control into the local boards of health.

3394
04:40:28,027 --> 04:40:37,812
[SPEAKER_49]: Personally, I think if they were going to implement the ban, back then the legislature should have either implemented a ban or not implemented a ban, but they left these certain low-hanging fruit, as we'll call them.

3395
04:40:38,345 --> 04:40:38,906
[SPEAKER_49]: that are out there.

3396
04:40:38,946 --> 04:40:48,634
[SPEAKER_49]: So what's happened here in the City of Medford is we've had a couple of changes at the Office of the Board of Health, a couple of changes at the members of the Board of Health, and they've brought this proposal forward and they voted on it.

3397
04:40:49,214 --> 04:41:00,523
[SPEAKER_49]: It's my understanding that when the proposal went through, there were a number of individuals that were very upset in these private club settings about learning of the fact that smoking is going to be banned in these facilities that they've been smoking in for a long time.

3398
04:41:01,184 --> 04:41:06,328
[SPEAKER_49]: So in response to that, the administration felt as though it would make sense and the Board of Health felt as though it would make sense to sit down

3399
04:41:06,778 --> 04:41:12,965
[SPEAKER_49]: and give a period of time for people to have dialogue and exchange some conversation about the situation, Mr. Castagnetti.

3400
04:41:13,306 --> 04:41:25,880
[SPEAKER_49]: So as of right now, it's my understanding that the reason why the moratorium was put in place on the ban was to allow for the stakeholders, the people at the VFW, the people at the American Legion, the people down at the Amici Club, the people over at the Sons of Italy,

3401
04:41:26,460 --> 04:41:35,307
[SPEAKER_49]: and every other private club, the Elks, for example, to come and get to the table and sit down with the Board of Health and talk about what's going on and why this is happening and why they're seeking to implement it.

3402
04:41:35,868 --> 04:41:44,795
[SPEAKER_49]: And I understand there's also been some discussion about doing what they've done over in Winchester at your private club, which is designated smoking areas, so on and so forth.

3403
04:41:44,835 --> 04:41:47,537
[SPEAKER_49]: So right now it's actually a work in progress, Mr. Castagnetti.

3404
04:41:47,557 --> 04:41:55,283
[SPEAKER_49]: It's my understanding that the Board of Health is meeting with the leadership of the clubs, or has met with the leadership of the clubs, and they're going to continue to keep them informed.

3405
04:41:56,063 --> 04:41:59,844
[SPEAKER_49]: on the ongoing deliberations and discussions and include them in these conversations.

3406
04:42:00,944 --> 04:42:02,025
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for your response.

3407
04:42:02,105 --> 04:42:02,625
[SPEAKER_33]: Anyone else?

3408
04:42:07,806 --> 04:42:14,148
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's time to start another party call, not we the people, you the people.

3409
04:42:14,948 --> 04:42:17,449
[SPEAKER_33]: Because democracy doesn't seem to be working.

3410
04:42:18,980 --> 04:42:25,603
[SPEAKER_33]: I know we're a minority, and we're looked upon as- I know, I know Woobin did the same thing.

3411
04:42:25,623 --> 04:42:29,825
[SPEAKER_42]: Woobin has a, they have a special room for smokers.

3412
04:42:29,885 --> 04:42:33,747
[SPEAKER_42]: There is some room for- It's the most addictive drug in the world.

3413
04:42:33,807 --> 04:42:35,408
[SPEAKER_33]: My mother died from smoking.

3414
04:42:35,688 --> 04:42:36,829
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a tough, tough topic.

3415
04:42:36,849 --> 04:42:38,730
[SPEAKER_33]: I know exactly where you're coming from.

3416
04:42:38,790 --> 04:42:44,092
[SPEAKER_33]: Maybe I should just throw my hat in the ring for the first time ever tomorrow morning and put my papers up at city council.

3417
04:42:44,853 --> 04:42:45,233
[SPEAKER_33]: Good luck.

3418
04:42:46,641 --> 04:42:48,862
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much, Mr. Castagnetti.

3419
04:42:49,582 --> 04:42:55,124
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to be received and placed on file, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3420
04:42:55,184 --> 04:42:55,864
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3421
04:42:55,884 --> 04:42:56,144
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3422
04:42:56,404 --> 04:42:58,145
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3423
04:42:58,165 --> 04:43:03,747
[SPEAKER_42]: 15 by 7-5, petition by Robert M. Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass., to address the council.

3424

[SPEAKER_42]: to discuss a review of a home rule petition to amend Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 44, Section 16 A and B, inclusive of the local legislative option provision as it relates to the Community Preservation Act and the Community Preservation Act Trust Fund.

3425
04:43:24,414 --> 04:43:30,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, it was my intent to address this council on Tuesday, July 18th.

3426
04:43:31,096 --> 04:43:32,736
[SPEAKER_25]: This is now Wednesday.

3427
04:43:33,416 --> 04:43:39,982
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Dello Russo is tired, he wants to go home, so I'd like to table this to our August meeting.

3428
04:43:40,042 --> 04:43:41,103
[SPEAKER_42]: And the council thanks you for that.

3429
04:43:43,365 --> 04:43:44,225
[SPEAKER_42]: And we thank you for that also.

3430
04:43:44,245 --> 04:43:45,066
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, I'll vote for that.

3431
04:43:46,647 --> 04:43:50,391
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to table Mr. Penta's request to the August meeting.

3432
04:43:50,411 --> 04:43:51,131
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3433
04:43:51,411 --> 04:43:51,712
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3434
04:43:52,352 --> 04:43:54,454
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we did everything.

3435
04:43:57,156 --> 04:43:58,337
[SPEAKER_42]: Papers in the hands of the clerk.

3436
04:44:05,912 --> 04:44:16,630
[SPEAKER_42]: 17, 585, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Christopher and Caitlin Murphy on the birth of their first child, Sadie Elizabeth.

3437
04:44:17,844 --> 04:44:18,544
[SPEAKER_49]: Councilor Knight.

3438
04:44:18,864 --> 04:44:21,485
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, rather self-explanatory resolution.

3439
04:44:21,525 --> 04:44:27,548
[SPEAKER_49]: Very recently, Chris Murphy, one of the city's members of the Parks Commission, recently had his first child.

3440
04:44:27,588 --> 04:44:29,368
[SPEAKER_49]: He and his wife, Caitlin, had their first child.

3441
04:44:29,448 --> 04:44:31,569
[SPEAKER_49]: And he's a very happy, proud dad.

3442
04:44:31,609 --> 04:44:32,489
[SPEAKER_49]: Caitlin's very healthy.

3443
04:44:32,509 --> 04:44:33,490
[SPEAKER_49]: The baby's very healthy.

3444
04:44:33,530 --> 04:44:38,151
[SPEAKER_49]: And I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate them and wish them the best of luck in their new endeavor.

3445
04:44:38,832 --> 04:44:39,152
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

3446
04:44:41,193 --> 04:44:41,453
[SPEAKER_49]: All right.

3447
04:44:41,893 --> 04:44:44,115
[SPEAKER_49]: He's still up, by the way, now that he had the baby.

3448
04:44:44,155 --> 04:44:44,575
[SPEAKER_42]: Absolutely.

3449
04:44:44,615 --> 04:44:45,315
[SPEAKER_42]: He's still up.

3450
04:44:46,036 --> 04:44:48,177
[SPEAKER_49]: I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

3451
04:44:48,197 --> 04:44:48,357
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded.

3452
04:44:48,697 --> 04:44:49,777
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

3453
04:44:49,797 --> 04:44:50,438
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3454
04:44:50,638 --> 04:44:50,978
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3455
04:44:51,018 --> 04:44:51,738
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3456
04:44:52,179 --> 04:45:03,965
[SPEAKER_42]: Offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the potholes at the intersection of Locust and Riverside Ave and Riverside Ave and Middlesex Street be filled in the interest of public safety.

3457
04:45:04,345 --> 04:45:05,285
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox.

3458
04:45:06,865 --> 04:45:09,806
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

3459
04:45:09,866 --> 04:45:10,487
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3460
04:45:10,667 --> 04:45:10,807
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3461
04:45:11,107 --> 04:45:11,907
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3462
04:45:12,428 --> 04:45:19,551
[SPEAKER_42]: Offered by Councilor Marks, being resolved that the area around Placid Park tennis court be paved in the interest of public safety.

3463
04:45:19,971 --> 04:45:21,272
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Vice President Mox.

3464
04:45:21,912 --> 04:45:23,233
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

3465
04:45:24,533 --> 04:45:30,256
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyone that's been on this council for a number of years will know this has been an issue of many of the neighbors in the area.

3466
04:45:31,056 --> 04:45:34,958
[SPEAKER_29]: When it rains heavily, that particular area gets flooded out.

3467
04:45:35,629 --> 04:45:43,753
[SPEAKER_29]: And it makes it almost impossible for people trying to use the park to either go to the tennis courts or gain access into the tot lot in the park.

3468
04:45:44,273 --> 04:45:55,599
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would ask that, once and for all, Mr. President, that the area surrounding the tennis courts on Century Street Extension be repaved in the interest of public safety.

3469
04:45:57,440 --> 04:45:59,922
[SPEAKER_49]: Mr. President, I would certainly second that motion.

3470
04:45:59,982 --> 04:46:07,909
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it's a great idea, and I'd like to add that if they do pave it, that they stripe it as well, so that we can have defined parking spots there, because it does get a little haphazard during the busy season.

3471
04:46:09,537 --> 04:46:14,740
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Vice President Mox as amended by Councilor Knight.

3472
04:46:15,100 --> 04:46:15,800
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3473
04:46:15,980 --> 04:46:16,381
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3474
04:46:16,481 --> 04:46:17,421
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3475
04:46:18,522 --> 04:46:29,127
[SPEAKER_42]: Offered by Vice President Mox, it resolves that the recent construction on 3rd Street from 3rd and Riverside is during the Pell's Way be discussed.

3476
04:46:29,287 --> 04:46:30,168
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Mox.

3477
04:46:30,528 --> 04:46:33,550
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President, this is the second time I've offered this resolution.

3478
04:46:34,090 --> 04:46:43,596
[SPEAKER_29]: As we're all aware, that end of 3rd Street from Riverside Ave to the Fellsway has been dug up over the last two and a half years.

3479
04:46:44,557 --> 04:46:53,422
[SPEAKER_29]: And from what I'm being told, the repaving that has been done, which is shoddy work, is the final repaving that's going to get done.

3480
04:46:53,862 --> 04:46:59,906
[SPEAKER_29]: And I would ask that the city go out there immediately, the clerk of the works or the billing department,

3481
04:47:00,466 --> 04:47:09,537
[SPEAKER_29]: and take a look at what's been paved and offer a better solution, Mr. President, than currently exists there for residents.

3482
04:47:11,577 --> 04:47:11,877
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

3483
04:47:11,897 --> 04:47:15,178
[SPEAKER_42]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3484
04:47:15,498 --> 04:47:16,239
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3485
04:47:16,459 --> 04:47:16,699
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

3486
04:47:17,159 --> 04:47:18,039
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3487
04:47:18,819 --> 04:47:21,820
[SPEAKER_42]: Records were passed to Councilor Falco.

3488
04:47:22,320 --> 04:47:26,962
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Falco, at this late hour, how did you find those records, if you can still read them?

3489
04:47:27,142 --> 04:47:34,684
[SPEAKER_31]: Mr. President, yes, I was able to read them and I have actually a couple of amendments to make to the records.

3490
04:47:34,764 --> 04:47:37,865
[SPEAKER_42]: If you'd like to table them and give them to the clerk for next week, that would be,

3491
04:47:39,345 --> 04:47:42,547
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, I can just read them out now.

3492
04:47:42,647 --> 04:48:07,022
[SPEAKER_31]: So there's just two points that were missing, and it had to do with 17-512, which was the city budget, and so if we could just add that Councilor Scarpelli disclosed that he has a relative employed by the schools, and that is reflected in the school budget, and then myself, Councilor Falco, disclosed that he had a relative employed by the city, and that is reflected in the city budget.

3493
04:48:08,402 --> 04:48:11,343
[SPEAKER_31]: Motion to approve is amended.

3494
04:48:11,363 --> 04:48:14,284
[SPEAKER_31]: These are the amendments.

3495
04:48:14,484 --> 04:48:16,905
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Falco to adjourn.

3496
04:48:16,925 --> 04:48:17,505
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

3497
04:48:18,966 --> 04:48:19,146
[SPEAKER_41]: No.

3498
04:48:20,586 --> 04:48:23,127
[SPEAKER_42]: First we have to approve the amendments.

3499
04:48:23,967 --> 04:48:25,828
[SPEAKER_42]: Approve as amended by Councilor Falco.

3500
04:48:26,308 --> 04:48:26,908
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

3501
04:48:27,148 --> 04:48:27,928
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor, aye.

3502
04:48:28,028 --> 04:48:28,849
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

3503
04:48:29,249 --> 04:48:30,529
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion by Councilor Falco.

3504
04:48:30,849 --> 04:48:31,569
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.
