    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=403.566">Yeah,</a>  I mean, it's huge for us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=405.727">Like,</a>  I don't think you get into the restaurant business if you don't like being a part of the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=410.008">You</a>  know, you don't make that much money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=412.729">If</a>  you do it right, you can make a living. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=414.27">But</a>  it's not like you're just swimming in cash. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=416.41">So</a>  you really do it for the people you do it because you want to see your friends come in every single day because you want to be a part of their life and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=424.612">be</a>  there for the good times and be there for the bad times. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=427.424">And</a>  we feel like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=429.337">you</a>  know, all the credit goes to Colleen, because when we took over the place, I mean, it was already established. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=435.442">Like,</a>  we have people coming in, generations of people telling us how much they love this place and what it means to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=442.689">And</a>  then I think, you know, we've kind of been able to start to attract that next generation, you know, the people who have never been to Medford or, you know, a lot of people are moving into Medford now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=450.796">And</a>  so there's a lot of new families and stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=453.498">And</a>  they need to learn about us and see what kind of, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=455.82">place</a>  that we can be for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=457.261">So</a>  we absolutely love the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=459.361">We</a>  want to be as central as we can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=462.082">Our</a>  location is awesome in terms of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=464.863">We're</a>  right near the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=466.364">Like</a>  I said, we're right near the theater, right near the highway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=470.265">So</a>  people just want to come to us, and we want to accept them in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=476.773">And</a>  just going off the whole community aspect, since we bought the place in December of 2018, I started to reach out to folks that I just found on Instagram, like people that were either doing crafts or art. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=492.545">And</a>  they didn't have a brick and mortar to sell or even just meet people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=496.911">And</a>  so we would offer our space, and be a pop up space for a lot of people so I our first pop up was in March of 2019. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=505.662">And</a>  it's really exciting because. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=508.585">one</a>  of the people that were our regulars, Claire, she ended up opening up her own brick and mortar called Trove. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=515.328">And</a>  I think she was on your podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=516.869">So</a>  it's just really cool to see the connections and how she started. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=520.35">And</a>  the company was a different name at that time, but it was obviously the beginnings of what she was hoping to have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=526.933">And</a>  so I was really happy to see that we were able to support her and also get to know her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=532.455">And</a>  that's what the pop-ups have been doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=534.436">And</a>  so we think that's really a great part of the community.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=537.998">Yeah,</a>  so it's sort of like uplifting maybe the smaller businesses that don't have the same like, you know, brick and mortar space, as you said. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=544.761">You</a>  also sell, is it Mystic Coffee Roasters?</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=547.943">We</a>  do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=548.503">Yes,</a>  yes, Sharon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=550.444">Well,</a>  she used to have the space in the square and then there was that fire in her roaster. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=554.667">But,</a>  you know, she just loved making the coffee so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=558.008">She</a>  was like, well, I'm going to move somewhere else and still make my coffee and ship it down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=562.691">And,</a>  you know, we get to be that space that that sells it for us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=565.692">So</a>  that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=567.953">What</a>  are your favorite things to eat at Colleen's? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=570.875">What</a>  are your favorite items on the menu? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=574.437">I'd</a>  say the Peyton is one of my favorite sandwiches. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=576.498">That's</a>  the turkey sandwich, pretty traditional, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, honey mustard, Swiss cheese. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=583.581">The</a>  Teddy is also one of my favorites, the prosciutto with mozzarella, roasted red peppers, olive tapenade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=591.303">But,</a>  you know, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the black and white fraps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=595.126">You</a>  know, that's probably my, my go-to out of all the items. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=598.528">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=599.609">A</a>  black and white frap? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=600.91">Um,</a>  so a frap, uh, some, some people call it a milkshake, but it's essentially ice cream, um, syrup and milk blended together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=608.875">And</a>  a black and white is when you take vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=612.738">So</a>  you kind of get the best of both worlds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=615.12">And,</a>  uh, yeah, I remember, I remember that was like the first frap my grandmother ever made for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=620.281">And</a>  I don't think I ever bothered to try any other ones. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=622.522">I</a>  said, yeah, let's stick with it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=626.245">It's</a>  a lot of good memories.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=627.225">You're</a>  bringing up around food and Colleen's and just sort of, I mean, well, that's, that's what food does for people, you know, it, um, it links you to your childhood, you know, to your, to your past. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=638.733">Um,</a>  you know, we've done a lot of traveling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=641.014">We've</a>  been to a lot of places. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=641.975">We</a>  always try to eat the food wherever we go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=644.737">And</a>  then, you know, when you kind of go somewhere local or you go to like that little place in town and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=650.133">It</a>  tastes just like what you had somewhere else, and it really transports you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=654.459">It's</a>  the power of food.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=660.327">Vicky,</a>  did you have a favorite item or favorite thing to eat?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=664.342">Yeah,</a>  well, I love the Peyton. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=666.424">And</a>  also the names of the sandwiches, we just named them after our relatives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=670.767">So</a>  Peyton's my niece, and Teddy is our son. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=675.792">But</a>  I really love the soups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=677.533">So</a>  the soups are really delicious. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=680.495">We</a>  have creamy tomato that's really nice in the winter with the grilled cheese. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=686.3">I</a>  really like the butternut squash soup. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=688.642">um</a>  and then just like the ice cream i i love ice cream so i mean when i when i married a chef i was very good and now he owns the restaurant and i help him with that and i own it too so and now you get ice cream too yeah now i get ice cream whenever i'm craving it especially when i was like pregnant i was like bring home ice cream for me</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=708.594">Yeah,</a>  that's dangerous to have that sort of source of unlimited ice cream.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=712.415">Well,</a>  it's actually it's been kind of funny because, you know, we don't have any ice cream now because we've been closed for the last eight weeks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=720.377">And</a>  yeah, you kind of forget like, you know, what life is like when you don't just have it on tap and you can just get it whenever you want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=727.019">You</a>  know, I have to like think about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=728.239">Do</a>  I want to get it at the supermarket? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=729.979">It's</a>  like, yeah, it's not the same. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=731.14">This</a>  is good.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=732.28">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=733.522">Yeah,</a>  I was wondering if like you have any thoughts about kind of hopes for your kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=736.804">It</a>  sounds like they're little, they'll probably grow up kind of around the restaurant and in the restaurant and kind of what you hope for them in that experience.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=744.009">Yeah,</a>  I mean, you know, of course, there's part of me that, you know, hopes they'll follow in my footsteps, and they'll want to take over the business and, and all that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=752.054">But</a>  I think, you know, when you realize just from talking to other parents and sort of seeing it for yourself is just how important it is to just like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=759.776">support</a>  them no matter what they want to do and like not try to push your stuff on them too much and um you know just be there and i'll say this they're definitely going to work there when they're young like they might not have much of a choice about that um they'll have to help out but you know once they they become old enough they can decide what they want to do with their lives and we'll be there to hopefully the restaurant you know will support us enough that we can support them you know that's that's the game</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=789.531">Well,</a>  I wonder if you want to share anything about what's happening at Colleen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=792.653">So</a>  it sounds like you're doing some renovations, going to reopen soon.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=796.394">We</a>  are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=797.035">We</a>  are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=798.495">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=799.036">So</a>  this renovation we had when we bought the place five years ago, that was always like the thought was like, OK, you know, buy it now and then we'll renovate and we'll kind of make it ours and we'll sort of, you know, build off what Colleen did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=814.155">And</a>  I think originally we kind of thought that might happen in the first year, but you know there's the first year of your of your business and you have to give a lot to learn we certainly did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=822.945">And</a>  then I think the second year was coven so then you know that kind of throws everything up up and down and then you have to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=830.094">understand</a>  what the world looks like after that and like how do restaurants fit into that space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=834.018">So,</a>  you know, it's taken us a minute, but four and a half years in, we've done it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=841.787">We've</a>  done our renovation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=843.208">We</a>  have essentially kept the bones, but just, you know, cleaned it up a little bit and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=849.913">For</a>  me, the thing that always frustrated me coming from like a kitchen standpoint, like a back of the house standpoint was just how the flow never felt right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=857.979">It</a>  didn't feel efficient. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=860.001">You</a>  know, we always would make it work, but it was always a little chaotic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=863.823">And</a>  I want something that, you know, is easy to replicate and something that's easy to train people on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=872.11">And</a>  so we've essentially taken the area that was our semi-private dining room, and we've turned that into a full kitchen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=880.196">It's</a>  enclosed, so I'll have my whole team back there, and I can really work with them and help train them so that everything works smoothly even when we're not there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=889.701">And</a>  then the front is really Vicky's sort of vision of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=894.003">I</a>  don't know if she wants to tell you about that, all the cool things we have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=899.165">I</a>  mean, I really like to support local artists, so we've hired local artists to do the windows. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=905.648">We</a>  are hiring local artists to do some of the inside art. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=909.39">We're</a>  hoping to maybe use some local artists to just decorate the shop and kind of rotate out anyone that wants to kind of put their art up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=918.054">So</a>  that's something I'm trying to coordinate and then bringing back the pop ups is really important to me so having a space that sort of appeals to everybody and can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=927.758">be</a>  easily transformed into that space for them is really important to me.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=935.121">And</a>  we got a cool new countertop, straight across. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=938.383">I</a>  don't know if people remember the old countertop, but it was sort of like leveled up and down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=943.205">So</a>  it was like only a small area where you could like sit, but now we've made it much bigger to try to get that old school diner feel.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=951.048">I</a>  think I saw a sneak peek on Instagram.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=954.209">Yeah,</a>  a couple of pictures floating out there.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=956.21">Yeah,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=957.41">And</a>  it sounds like, again, you're integrating the community into the design, into what you include on the inside, and the pop-ups, and all of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=965.033">And</a>  one theme that we try to weave through all of our interviews is just this idea of inclusivity and diversity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=972.676">And</a>  we did talk about community, but I wonder, Colin, you mentioned it earlier, what you've noticed and a change in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=980.619">and</a>  what you maybe hope for for Medford and as a part of Medford to see in terms of like that theme of diversity and inclusivity.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=990.012">Yeah,</a>  well, I mean, you know, on our end, you know, we're just a restaurant in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=995.896">And</a>  I like to think that we serve like everyone in the city, both like the old and the new. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1001.979">Like</a>  I said, we have a lot of generational guests here as we kind of grab the newer people ourselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1008.964">And</a>  so, you know, something a restaurant can do is just sort of be a place for everyone where everyone can see each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1014.947">And</a>  you can have, I think, more respect for somebody if you see them and they're not just, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1019.57">the</a>  other that you hear about or that you think you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1023.292">And</a>  then on our end, you know, just from like our hiring, I always try to, I always say I look, I always try to hire the person who I think this job would be most helpful to, as opposed to like the person that's going to help us the most, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1037.381">So</a>  we just look for good kids that want to learn, you know, that maybe don't have the experience yet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1044.485">And,</a>  you know, we could give them something and, you know, they could take that and do great things in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1051.264">I</a>  know how important it is, you know, for inclusivity and for everybody to feel like this is a place for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1056.868">And,</a>  you know, all of our, you know, we had the Black Lives Matter sign up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1062.112">I</a>  know we have a lot of inclusive, like, signs up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1065.595">That's</a>  all Vicky. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1066.456">You</a>  know, she sources this from, like, usually, like, local artists that make this stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1070.719">And</a>  then she brings it into the space to kind of give us the identity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1074.542">So</a>  she kind of ties it in, I think, tastefully and it's not so much like sort of like loud and in your face. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1081.128">It's</a>  just sort of telling everyone like, yeah, this is for everybody, you know, it's ice cream.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1086.392">And</a>  I think what's really important is our staff, too, and making sure they feel welcome, because I think if our staff feel really good and they feel welcome and they feel like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1095.94">they</a>  can be themselves, then that's going to exude to the guests, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1099.243">The</a>  guests are going to feel taken care of because they're getting taken care of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1102.886">And</a>  so I think we have a lot of folks on our staff that are non-binary that have they pronouns and we really emphasize like feeling comfortable to not only use your pronouns that you're comfortable with, but like correct us if we make mistakes, let's have a dialogue or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1119.198">And</a>  just have even with our guests to write it so it can be a really nice way to just learn from each other and in a safe environment hopefully that's like that's what we aim to be right a safe environment for everyone, where we can have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1134.357">uh</a>  dialogue and be open with each other.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1137.139">It</a>  sounds like what you, like Colin, how you described your relationship to Colleen, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1140.902">Like</a>  a place where you could sort of learn and grow and like figure out what you like and enjoyed and wanted to do and even if some of your staff don't decide to buy Colleen's from you one day, you know, it sounds like they're like a like a nice mentorship experience, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1155.292">A</a>  place to feel safe, like they can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1157.533">be</a>  who they want to be and interact with the community in that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1160.395">And</a>  I have to say like your signage does stand out like I think especially during COVID when we weren't going into a lot of places, but you could see sort of what everyone was representing from the outside. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1170.641">It</a>  was like it was really nice to see and definitely stood out in the square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1175.925">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1176.685">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1177.746">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1178.486">You</a>  want to say when you anticipate to reopen?</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1182.351">Uh,</a>  so we are slated for Tuesday. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1185.635">What</a>  did we say it was the 18th? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1187.677">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1188.498">Uh,</a>  we have some inspections that, you know, we have to go through to make sure everything's above board, but we feel pretty confident that we'll pass those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1196.348">And</a>  then, yeah, we're going to open on Tuesday and then we'll be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1199.632">We'll</a>  be closed Mondays, I think, for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1202.374">It's</a>  just important for us and our family that we have one day where the restaurant is not open and could possibly need us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1210.659">But</a>  we're going to start opening on Tuesdays now, which we haven't been for the last few years, and just try to be open as much as possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1219.505">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1219.965">Do</a>  you do like a summer hiring? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1221.547">Do</a>  you do like you have more staff in the summer?</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1224.329">Yeah,</a>  typically, though, with the summer, it's a lot of just kids coming back, you know, so like you get your senior year in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1230.854">And</a>  at that point, you're pretty well trained and you're good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1233.456">And</a>  then you go off to college. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1234.937">So</a>  in the summer comes around, it's just kind of easy to take those kids and plug them in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1238.7">It's</a>  like right here's 10 minutes to refresh you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1240.421">And</a>  now you can just go ahead and do the job.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1243.063">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1243.418">kind</a>  of like a reunion then for some of those.</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1245.239">Yeah,</a>  yeah, it is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1246.2">No,</a>  usually like the new hires are at the beginning of the school year, end of the summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1252.043">That's</a>  when the fresh crop comes in.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1253.584">Yeah,</a>  everyone settling into the new year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1256.926">Well,</a>  anything else that you all want to mention before we wrap up for today?</p>

    <p>[L-hLu0ibDYc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1261.317">I</a>  just want to say thank you for having us, letting us talk about our space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1266.98">This</a>  has a lot of meaning to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1270.642">I</a>  obviously have a huge history with the space, but I think doing this renovation and now we really get to tie Vicki into it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1278.205">And,</a>  you know, this can become like more of like our space, which is really what I always wanted it to be, because it's a lot if it's just yours, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1286.009">So</a>  I need someone to actually take some of that burden to have Vicky on board. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1290.111">And,</a>  you know, just to yeah, just to see her there and really have her own it is great for me.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G5PHSZGnjQ6es3yZ7oxpR?t=1297.214">It</a>  sounds exciting, and I'm excited to see it and to eat some ice cream.</p>
