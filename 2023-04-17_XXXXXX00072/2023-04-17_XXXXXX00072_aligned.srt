Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,274
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,776
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:46,561
Thank you so much both for joining me today.

10
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,043
I wonder if you could just start by introducing yourself.

11
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:52,086
So say your name and pronouns just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:55,490
My name is Vicky Burgoyne.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,772
I use she series pronouns.

14
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:03,457
And I am co owner of Colleen's ice cream and sandwich shop in Medford Square.

15
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:09,083
And I am Colin Burgoyne, the other owner of Colleen's and I use he him.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,740
Thank you.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:18,164
So we'll get into some more about Colleen's, but I'm going to ask you both the same question that I ask everyone on the podcast.

18
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:22,046
So what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:25,068
And I'll just pause to say that Colleen's has come up a bunch.

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,289
So I'm curious to see what you guys, what your answer is.

21
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:29,870
Very nice.

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,071
Well, thank you to everybody that brings us up.

23
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:34,315
Yeah.

24
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:37,276
I mean, in Medford, there's like two places that come to mind.

25
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:53,124
Um, I know I'm only supposed to pick one, but there's like right next to us, there's four pizza, which opened up, um, within this year and they make like a great pizza, like when you're in the mood and they're all kind of like, you know, they're good for maybe one person or so.

26
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,485
So you can kind of get a couple of different varieties, which I like.

27
00:01:56,445 --> 00:02:02,068
Um, and then there's deep cuts deli too, which makes like one of the best Cuban sandwiches, uh, I've ever had.

28
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:02,268
So.

29
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:08,747
It'd be tough to choose between the two of them, but I am more partial to pizza, so we go for pizza.

30
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,588
That's the South Shore bar pizza, right?

31
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:14,949
Yeah, which you don't see a lot of, which I think is nice, because it's different.

32
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,790
I think some North Shore loyalists around here, too.

33
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:20,291
Yeah, yeah.

34
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:21,291
Nice.

35
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:23,592
And Deep Cut's moving closer to you guys.

36
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:24,352
They are, yeah.

37
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:25,553
Yeah, they're going to be right in the square.

38
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:26,593
Awesome.

39
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:27,854
Great.

40
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:28,734
And Vicky, what about you?

41
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:33,411
So there's so many to name, but I will narrow it down to Goldilocks.

42
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,213
I just love their bagels.

43
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:40,898
We stock up and the owners are really nice, Lindsay and Ed.

44
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:48,946
And then another place I know I'm only supposed to pick one too, but I love Ebisuya, the little market with the fresh sushi.

45
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,708
It's so nice to have that there.

46
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,030
And so I'm very happy to be in the square.

47
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,156
great.

48
00:02:54,196 --> 00:03:05,899
Yeah, I've talked to like a few owners of uh different types of places in the square and it seems like there's a lot of like camaraderie and uh like friendliness between businesses which it sounds like you're all supporting each other which is great.

49
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:12,181
Well, I've always said, you know, there's like 50, 000 people in Medford and there's not one restaurant that can handle all of them.

50
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:19,403
So, there's no reason for us to be at each other's throats like there's there's plenty of people and plus with the Chevalier coming in, we get lots of tourists now too.

51
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,224
So, yeah, we can be in this together.

52
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:23,365
Great.

53
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:26,348
So yeah, I was hoping that you would tell us a little bit about calling.

54
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:29,931
So a little bit about the history, how you guys came to be owners.

55
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:30,211
Yeah.

56
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:36,937
Um, well, I can tell you, you know, it was my first job when I was, uh, I think I got hired when I was 15 years old.

57
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,560
So that's, um, God, what is that?

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,281
Like 2002, 2003, something like that.

59
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:41,721
And.

60
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:45,967
You know, I fell in love with it.

61
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,848
I fell in love with the industry.

62
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:53,709
Um, I stayed on until I went to college and even then I would go back on weekends and work there.

63
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:01,971
Um, and it wasn't until, you know, I was at a crossroads in college and had to decide like, all right, you know, what do I want to do here?

64
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,252
Um, you know, what do I like to do?

65
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:09,073
And I was like, well, you know, I love working at Colleen's, so why don't I get in the restaurant business?

66
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,954
And, you know, from then Colleen and I stayed in touch.

67
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:23,077
and it was uh about five years ago almost that she reached out and you know she was looking to retire and sort of focus on her health and uh yeah we decided to make the jump.

68
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,597
So you're not related to Colleen.

69
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:28,678
I kind of wondered about Colin and Colleen if there was a relationship.

70
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:32,660
Yeah no just uh serendipitous I guess but no Colleen um

71
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,232
You know, she never had kids of her own.

72
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:41,594
You know, we always used to say she had plenty of us working at the restaurant and really the restaurant was her baby.

73
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,574
I mean, she gave everything to that place.

74
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:46,255
She loved being in the square.

75
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:47,975
You know, quick story about her.

76
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:53,917
She, I think she was like 20 something when she was the manager of the Brighams that was there originally.

77
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:58,798
And it was like the lowest performing Brighams in all of like the company.

78
00:04:59,318 --> 00:04:59,858
She came in.

79
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:04,462
she made it the most profitable out of all the Brighams.

80
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:10,368
They gave her an award, I think they called it the Spirit Award, something like, it was like $10,000 or $15,000.

81
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,610
But back in the day, that was a lot of money.

82
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,932
She used that money to eventually buy the business herself.

83
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:19,577
And when Brighams went under, she said, my space is still good.

84
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,498
So we're going to keep selling ice cream here.

85
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,640
Wow.

86
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:24,742
And Vicky, would you add anything?

87
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:40,211
So I met Colin in 2010 and I just remember him saying, he's telling me stories about, you know, working at Colleen's and how much he loved it and how she was a mentor to so many people and how he learned to work really hard.

88
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,371
And she taught him a lot about restaurants.

89
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:47,632
And so, and I've always, I just enjoy going to restaurants and I enjoy eating.

90
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,053
And so that was like one of my favorite things to do.

91
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:59,998
Um, when I was asked to kind of help out with being in the restaurant, I was, I was absolutely excited because I enjoy the, uh, taking care of people.

92
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:01,840
I like that aspect of hospitality.

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,943
I like that the space is sort of that third place that people can go to, um, and just for the community to gather.

94
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,184
So I am very happy to be part of it right now.

95
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:10,945
Yeah.

96
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,170
Thank you.

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:34,443
Yeah, I feel like ice cream shops and sandwich shops are like do tend to be like really like big hubs and small communities right where I remember the ice cream shop it where I grew up every they had like pictures of all the like youth sports teams every year like that whoever won the like, you know, most games or whatever and it's like I think a place that people have like a lot of pride in and so I kind of wonder for you.

98
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:43,026
both like kind of what your hope is in terms of like an impact on the community or how you interact with the community as as owners of Colleen's.

99
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,407
Yeah, I mean, it's huge for us.

100
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:49,988
Like, I don't think you get into the restaurant business if you don't like being a part of the community.

101
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,669
You know, you don't make that much money.

102
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,150
If you do it right, you can make a living.

103
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,350
But it's not like you're just swimming in cash.

104
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,933
So you really do it for the people you do it because you want to see your friends come in every single day because you want to be a part of their life and

105
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,762
be there for the good times and be there for the bad times.

106
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:08,549
And we feel like

107
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:15,282
you know, all the credit goes to Colleen, because when we took over the place, I mean, it was already established.

108
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:21,147
Like, we have people coming in, generations of people telling us how much they love this place and what it means to them.

109
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:30,555
And then I think, you know, we've kind of been able to start to attract that next generation, you know, the people who have never been to Medford or, you know, a lot of people are moving into Medford now.

110
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:32,257
And so there's a lot of new families and stuff.

111
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,159
And they need to learn about us and see what kind of,

112
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,161
place that we can be for them.

113
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,321
So we absolutely love the community.

114
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:41,942
We want to be as central as we can.

115
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:44,403
Our location is awesome in terms of that.

116
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:45,864
We're right near the schools.

117
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:50,205
Like I said, we're right near the theater, right near the highway.

118
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:53,646
So people just want to come to us, and we want to accept them in.

119
00:07:56,773 --> 00:08:11,210
And just going off the whole community aspect, since we bought the place in December of 2018, I started to reach out to folks that I just found on Instagram, like people that were either doing crafts or art.

120
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:16,330
And they didn't have a brick and mortar to sell or even just meet people.

121
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:24,841
And so we would offer our space, and be a pop up space for a lot of people so I our first pop up was in March of 2019.

122
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:26,923
And it's really exciting because.

123
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:34,708
one of the people that were our regulars, Claire, she ended up opening up her own brick and mortar called Trove.

124
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,849
And I think she was on your podcast.

125
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:40,290
So it's just really cool to see the connections and how she started.

126
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:46,473
And the company was a different name at that time, but it was obviously the beginnings of what she was hoping to have.

127
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:52,075
And so I was really happy to see that we were able to support her and also get to know her.

128
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,376
And that's what the pop-ups have been doing.

129
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:57,017
And so we think that's really a great part of the community.

130
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:04,421
Yeah, so it's sort of like uplifting maybe the smaller businesses that don't have the same like, you know, brick and mortar space, as you said.

131
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,923
You also sell, is it Mystic Coffee Roasters?

132
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:08,283
We do.

133
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,164
Yes, yes, Sharon.

134
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:14,066
Well, she used to have the space in the square and then there was that fire in her roaster.

135
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,968
But, you know, she just loved making the coffee so much.

136
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:22,631
She was like, well, I'm going to move somewhere else and still make my coffee and ship it down.

137
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:25,672
And, you know, we get to be that space that that sells it for us.

138
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:26,132
So that's great.

139
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:30,855
What are your favorite things to eat at Colleen's?

140
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,976
What are your favorite items on the menu?

141
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,458
I'd say the Peyton is one of my favorite sandwiches.

142
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:42,821
That's the turkey sandwich, pretty traditional, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, honey mustard, Swiss cheese.

143
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:49,484
The Teddy is also one of my favorites, the prosciutto with mozzarella, roasted red peppers, olive tapenade.

144
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:54,825
But, you know, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the black and white fraps.

145
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,527
You know, that's probably my, my go-to out of all the items.

146
00:09:58,528 --> 00:09:58,988
What's that?

147
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,389
A black and white frap?

148
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:08,135
Um, so a frap, uh, some, some people call it a milkshake, but it's essentially ice cream, um, syrup and milk blended together.

149
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,698
And a black and white is when you take vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.

150
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,159
So you kind of get the best of both worlds.

151
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,843
And, uh, yeah, I remember, I remember that was like the first frap my grandmother ever made for me.

152
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,202
And I don't think I ever bothered to try any other ones.

153
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,644
I said, yeah, let's stick with it.

154
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,205
It's a lot of good memories.

155
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:37,852
You're bringing up around food and Colleen's and just sort of, I mean, well, that's, that's what food does for people, you know, it, um, it links you to your childhood, you know, to your, to your past.

156
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,974
Um, you know, we've done a lot of traveling.

157
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:41,935
We've been to a lot of places.

158
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,717
We always try to eat the food wherever we go.

159
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:49,720
And then, you know, when you kind of go somewhere local or you go to like that little place in town and

160
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:54,439
It tastes just like what you had somewhere else, and it really transports you.

161
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,802
It's the power of food.

162
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,431
Vicky, did you have a favorite item or favorite thing to eat?

163
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:06,264
Yeah, well, I love the Peyton.

164
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:10,707
And also the names of the sandwiches, we just named them after our relatives.

165
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,930
So Peyton's my niece, and Teddy is our son.

166
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,333
But I really love the soups.

167
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,735
So the soups are really delicious.

168
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:25,840
We have creamy tomato that's really nice in the winter with the grilled cheese.

169
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,802
I really like the butternut squash soup.

170
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:47,353
um and then just like the ice cream i i love ice cream so i mean when i when i married a chef i was very good and now he owns the restaurant and i help him with that and i own it too so and now you get ice cream too yeah now i get ice cream whenever i'm craving it especially when i was like pregnant i was like bring home ice cream for me

171
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:52,395
Yeah, that's dangerous to have that sort of source of unlimited ice cream.

172
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:59,477
Well, it's actually it's been kind of funny because, you know, we don't have any ice cream now because we've been closed for the last eight weeks.

173
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:06,398
And yeah, you kind of forget like, you know, what life is like when you don't just have it on tap and you can just get it whenever you want.

174
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,219
You know, I have to like think about it.

175
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,919
Do I want to get it at the supermarket?

176
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,100
It's like, yeah, it's not the same.

177
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,260
This is good.

178
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah.

179
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:16,744
Yeah, I was wondering if like you have any thoughts about kind of hopes for your kids.

180
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:23,448
It sounds like they're little, they'll probably grow up kind of around the restaurant and in the restaurant and kind of what you hope for them in that experience.

181
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:31,833
Yeah, I mean, you know, of course, there's part of me that, you know, hopes they'll follow in my footsteps, and they'll want to take over the business and, and all that.

182
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:39,098
But I think, you know, when you realize just from talking to other parents and sort of seeing it for yourself is just how important it is to just like,

183
00:12:39,776 --> 00:13:06,332
support them no matter what they want to do and like not try to push your stuff on them too much and um you know just be there and i'll say this they're definitely going to work there when they're young like they might not have much of a choice about that um they'll have to help out but you know once they they become old enough they can decide what they want to do with their lives and we'll be there to hopefully the restaurant you know will support us enough that we can support them you know that's that's the game

184
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:12,613
Well, I wonder if you want to share anything about what's happening at Colleen.

185
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,594
So it sounds like you're doing some renovations, going to reopen soon.

186
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:16,735
We are.

187
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:17,295
We are.

188
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:19,016
Yeah.

189
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:32,622
So this renovation we had when we bought the place five years ago, that was always like the thought was like, OK, you know, buy it now and then we'll renovate and we'll kind of make it ours and we'll sort of, you know, build off what Colleen did.

190
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:41,604
And I think originally we kind of thought that might happen in the first year, but you know there's the first year of your of your business and you have to give a lot to learn we certainly did.

191
00:13:42,945 --> 00:13:48,551
And then I think the second year was coven so then you know that kind of throws everything up up and down and then you have to.

192
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,958
understand what the world looks like after that and like how do restaurants fit into that space.

193
00:13:54,018 --> 00:14:00,525
So, you know, it's taken us a minute, but four and a half years in, we've done it.

194
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,188
We've done our renovation.

195
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:09,315
We have essentially kept the bones, but just, you know, cleaned it up a little bit and

196
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:17,939
For me, the thing that always frustrated me coming from like a kitchen standpoint, like a back of the house standpoint was just how the flow never felt right.

197
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:18,880
It didn't feel efficient.

198
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,343
You know, we always would make it work, but it was always a little chaotic.

199
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:30,809
And I want something that, you know, is easy to replicate and something that's easy to train people on.

200
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:39,095
And so we've essentially taken the area that was our semi-private dining room, and we've turned that into a full kitchen.

201
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:48,240
It's enclosed, so I'll have my whole team back there, and I can really work with them and help train them so that everything works smoothly even when we're not there.

202
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:53,983
And then the front is really Vicky's sort of vision of things.

203
00:14:54,003 --> 00:14:58,745
I don't know if she wants to tell you about that, all the cool things we have.

204
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:04,848
I mean, I really like to support local artists, so we've hired local artists to do the windows.

205
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:08,370
We are hiring local artists to do some of the inside art.

206
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:17,534
We're hoping to maybe use some local artists to just decorate the shop and kind of rotate out anyone that wants to kind of put their art up.

207
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:26,998
So that's something I'm trying to coordinate and then bringing back the pop ups is really important to me so having a space that sort of appeals to everybody and can

208
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:34,721
be easily transformed into that space for them is really important to me.

209
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:38,263
And we got a cool new countertop, straight across.

210
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:43,185
I don't know if people remember the old countertop, but it was sort of like leveled up and down.

211
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:50,488
So it was like only a small area where you could like sit, but now we've made it much bigger to try to get that old school diner feel.

212
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,509
I think I saw a sneak peek on Instagram.

213
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,970
Yeah, a couple of pictures floating out there.

214
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,190
Yeah, that's great.

215
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:04,553
And it sounds like, again, you're integrating the community into the design, into what you include on the inside, and the pop-ups, and all of that.

216
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:12,276
And one theme that we try to weave through all of our interviews is just this idea of inclusivity and diversity.

217
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:20,039
And we did talk about community, but I wonder, Colin, you mentioned it earlier, what you've noticed and a change in the community.

218
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:29,304
and what you maybe hope for for Medford and as a part of Medford to see in terms of like that theme of diversity and inclusivity.

219
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:34,635
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, on our end, you know, we're just a restaurant in the city.

220
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:40,779
And I like to think that we serve like everyone in the city, both like the old and the new.

221
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:48,383
Like I said, we have a lot of generational guests here as we kind of grab the newer people ourselves.

222
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:54,387
And so, you know, something a restaurant can do is just sort of be a place for everyone where everyone can see each other.

223
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,890
And you can have, I think, more respect for somebody if you see them and they're not just,

224
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,811
the other that you hear about or that you think you know.

225
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:17,341
And then on our end, you know, just from like our hiring, I always try to, I always say I look, I always try to hire the person who I think this job would be most helpful to, as opposed to like the person that's going to help us the most, you know.

226
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:24,105
So we just look for good kids that want to learn, you know, that maybe don't have the experience yet.

227
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:29,028
And, you know, we could give them something and, you know, they could take that and do great things in the world.

228
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:36,848
I know how important it is, you know, for inclusivity and for everybody to feel like this is a place for them.

229
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:41,992
And, you know, all of our, you know, we had the Black Lives Matter sign up.

230
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:45,575
I know we have a lot of inclusive, like, signs up.

231
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:46,316
That's all Vicky.

232
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:50,199
You know, she sources this from, like, usually, like, local artists that make this stuff.

233
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,281
And then she brings it into the space to kind of give us the identity.

234
00:17:54,542 --> 00:18:00,907
So she kind of ties it in, I think, tastefully and it's not so much like sort of like loud and in your face.

235
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:06,232
It's just sort of telling everyone like, yeah, this is for everybody, you know, it's ice cream.

236
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:14,379
And I think what's really important is our staff, too, and making sure they feel welcome, because I think if our staff feel really good and they feel welcome and they feel like

237
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,203
they can be themselves, then that's going to exude to the guests, right?

238
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:22,285
The guests are going to feel taken care of because they're getting taken care of.

239
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:38,798
And so I think we have a lot of folks on our staff that are non-binary that have they pronouns and we really emphasize like feeling comfortable to not only use your pronouns that you're comfortable with, but like correct us if we make mistakes, let's have a dialogue or

240
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:53,416
And just have even with our guests to write it so it can be a really nice way to just learn from each other and in a safe environment hopefully that's like that's what we aim to be right a safe environment for everyone, where we can have.

241
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:56,619
uh dialogue and be open with each other.

242
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:00,882
It sounds like what you, like Colin, how you described your relationship to Colleen, right?

243
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:15,251
Like a place where you could sort of learn and grow and like figure out what you like and enjoyed and wanted to do and even if some of your staff don't decide to buy Colleen's from you one day, you know, it sounds like they're like a like a nice mentorship experience, right?

244
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,813
A place to feel safe, like they can

245
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,035
be who they want to be and interact with the community in that way.

246
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:30,581
And I have to say like your signage does stand out like I think especially during COVID when we weren't going into a lot of places, but you could see sort of what everyone was representing from the outside.

247
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:34,704
It was like it was really nice to see and definitely stood out in the square.

248
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,265
Thank you.

249
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:36,945
Yeah.

250
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:37,966
Great.

251
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,708
You want to say when you anticipate to reopen?

252
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:45,595
Uh, so we are slated for Tuesday.

253
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,617
What did we say it was the 18th?

254
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:47,938
Yes.

255
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:55,607
Uh, we have some inspections that, you know, we have to go through to make sure everything's above board, but we feel pretty confident that we'll pass those.

256
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:59,212
And then, yeah, we're going to open on Tuesday and then we'll be.

257
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,354
We'll be closed Mondays, I think, for the foreseeable future.

258
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:09,298
It's just important for us and our family that we have one day where the restaurant is not open and could possibly need us.

259
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:18,184
But we're going to start opening on Tuesdays now, which we haven't been for the last few years, and just try to be open as much as possible.

260
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:19,765
Awesome.

261
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,487
Do you do like a summer hiring?

262
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:23,548
Do you do like you have more staff in the summer?

263
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:30,814
Yeah, typically, though, with the summer, it's a lot of just kids coming back, you know, so like you get your senior year in high school.

264
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,915
And at that point, you're pretty well trained and you're good.

265
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:34,456
And then you go off to college.

266
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:38,419
So in the summer comes around, it's just kind of easy to take those kids and plug them in.

267
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,361
It's like right here's 10 minutes to refresh you.

268
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,482
And now you can just go ahead and do the job.

269
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:43,163
Yeah.

270
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,219
kind of like a reunion then for some of those.

271
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,920
Yeah, yeah, it is.

272
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,403
No, usually like the new hires are at the beginning of the school year, end of the summer.

273
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,204
That's when the fresh crop comes in.

274
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,846
Yeah, everyone settling into the new year.

275
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,708
Well, anything else that you all want to mention before we wrap up for today?

276
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:06,640
I just want to say thank you for having us, letting us talk about our space.

277
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,622
This has a lot of meaning to me.

278
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:17,525
I obviously have a huge history with the space, but I think doing this renovation and now we really get to tie Vicki into it.

279
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:25,449
And, you know, this can become like more of like our space, which is really what I always wanted it to be, because it's a lot if it's just yours, you know.

280
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,891
So I need someone to actually take some of that burden to have Vicky on board.

281
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:35,894
And, you know, just to yeah, just to see her there and really have her own it is great for me.

282
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,916
It sounds exciting, and I'm excited to see it and to eat some ice cream.

283
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:41,837
Yes.

284
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:42,197
Yes.

285
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,237
We can't wait to see you there.

286
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:44,258
All right.

287
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:45,198
Well, thank you both so much.

288
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:45,999
Thank you.

289
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:46,319
Thank you.

290
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:56,645
