1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,693
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:11,573
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,955
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,997
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:20,359
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,504
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:32,406
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,908
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,533
All right, thanks for being here with me today.

10
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:49,175
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:51,716
Sure, thanks so much for having me.

12
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,256
My name is Zida Ortiz.

13
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,737
She, her, aya pronouns.

14
00:00:56,737 --> 00:01:05,560
I am originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and came here to the Boston area to go to school, and currently live in Malden, Massachusetts.

15
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:12,023
And I am running to be the next state representative for the 35th Middlesex, which includes Medford and Malden.

16
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:13,043
Thanks for having me.

17
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:14,195
Yeah, thank you.

18
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:22,842
And so I know you're a Malden resident, but I'll ask you the same question we ask everyone on this podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford, and what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,704
See, now this is a hard question.

20
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:27,405
You're already hitting me with something pretty hard.

21
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:32,209
My initial go-to Medford place is Tenoch.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,290
I love a good torta.

23
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:40,835
And everyone who works there is Mexican, so I get to get a little taste of home every time I go.

24
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:47,576
But I'm not gonna lie, I love a burger at Snappy Patty's and a nice Caesar salad too.

25
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:55,139
So I've got a few little spots I like to go to over there, depending on the flavor I have in my mouth.

26
00:01:55,738 --> 00:02:02,023
Yeah, I feel like El Tacuba has really overshadowed Tenoche recently, so we don't hear as much of it, but it is a very popular one here.

27
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:11,810
I just love, again, it's a quick, the greatest stuff about Mexican food is you can have a sit down meal or a quick grab and go.

28
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:18,795
And to me, the grab and go is always kind of, we're always on the move, so we got to keep it moving even when we're eating.

29
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,492
Yeah, I imagine you're very busy these days.

30
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:29,917
So, um, yes, yeah, I wonder if you could just sort of talk us through a little bit about how you arrived at this moment sort of what's motivating you to run for this position.

31
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:31,297
Sure, thanks.

32
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,179
Well, you know, I've always been a helper.

33
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:35,620
As I mentioned.

34
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:42,134
I'm a child of Mexican American immigrants and growing up in Oklahoma, there weren't a lot of us.

35
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:50,298
So serving our community and taking care of one another was something that was really important to my parents and a lesson that they taught me.

36
00:02:51,278 --> 00:03:02,584
We were fortunate enough to, with a good paying union job, my father was able to get, became a member of the machinist union and we were solidly middle class.

37
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:04,365
So it was always important to help those

38
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,602
around us that weren't doing as well.

39
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:13,825
That public service followed me through my college years.

40
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,646
And obviously, as an adult, you have to start figuring out how to take care of yourself.

41
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,047
So I did that for a few years.

42
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,909
But I was always interested in advocating for different things.

43
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,551
Reproductive rights was something that was really under attack in the 90s with

44
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:34,786
taxon clinics and things like that, so I was an escort for a while.

45
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:43,893
I had a lot of gay friends, and when marriage equality came up, it was something that was really important to me as well, so I advocated for that.

46
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,256
And I realized that I still had that yearning.

47
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:53,159
I was working in healthcare as an administrator, and I was doing help there.

48
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:55,621
I was helping people get tests approved.

49
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,963
I was helping people understand and navigate

50
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:13,500
the dizzying insurance systems or the scary diagnosis that they were facing and being able to really interpret and break it down into very simple language so they understood what was next and how we get to what the next step is.

51
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:21,885
And that all changed for me when my mother-in-law got sick and I had to be the interpreter for our family.

52
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:27,368
Like I was the one that was explaining to my husband and his family what was going on with his mom.

53
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:34,360
and ended up having to leave my job to care for my mother.

54
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:56,739
And with that caretaker role, it really opened my eyes to how desperately our healthcare system is broken and also how we're not taking care, unless you have a support system, an internalized support system, as a society, we're not taking care of people who are elderly, ill, disabled, and that we really needed to do something about it.

55
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:03,541
And I remember sitting at my mother-in-law's hospital bed when I told her I quit my job.

56
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,302
She was just devastated.

57
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,584
She was like, why would you do that?

58
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,604
You need a job.

59
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,206
And I said, no, we need to take care of you.

60
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,308
And that's the priority right now.

61
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:21,075
And I said, as God is my witness, I don't know how and I don't know when and I don't know how I'm gonna get there, but I want my job to be eliminated.

62
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:25,779
I don't think an insurance verification specialist is something that needs to exist in the universe.

63
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,310
And it seems corny, but it's kind of how I got started.

64
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:47,419
And I took care of her and she only survived maybe about a year after I quit my job, but she passed away and four months later, Trump got elected and it just put a fire under my tail.

65
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,381
And I was like, this is it, this is what I have to do.

66
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:53,503
I don't know what I'm gonna do, I don't know how I'm gonna do it, but I dove in.

67
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,264
And I became a full-time activist.

68
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,880
And activism came so naturally to me.

69
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:09,143
And I never realized how much I had been advocating and pushing things along in my natural just way of being.

70
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:16,646
And I, as an activist, as a full-time activist, I jumped into it 110%.

71
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:24,468
And with that activism, I was able to not only start to advocate, you know, against the Trump

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,559
immigration deportation machine.

73
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:33,721
I was able to stand up for, you know, the Muslim ban, women's rights, all sorts of things.

74
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:41,604
And I realized that on the federal level, we had a great group of Congress people, you know, like they were fighting for the same thing.

75
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:48,966
So it seemed ridiculous to constantly be calling Catherine Clark to save the ADA or save this or save that.

76
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:54,248
And so I found the State House was a place that I could really evoke change.

77
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:17,438
And at the State House, I started lobbying for things like the Safe Communities Act, which was a bill that would ensure due process for everyone in this country, which in, again, I'm not a constitutional law person, but in my eyes, it should be expanded to cover anyone who resides in this country, full stop.

78
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:18,899
Everyone should have their day.

79
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:36,787
And then, again, just little by little, I started advocating and working, and I was able to become a leader in the Indivisible movement, and I helped found the Indivisible Massachusetts State Group, and I was part of their board.

80
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:45,593
I also started doing work with MoveOn nationally and was able to work on different presidential elections, things like that.

81
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:49,555
I was a proud supporter of JuliÃ¡n Castro last 2020.

82
00:07:51,684 --> 00:08:01,061
But that work also helped me realize that it was really happening on the ground, the closer as you, as we mentioned earlier, the closer you get to municipal work.

83
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:06,660
the more localized it is, the more change you can actually create.

84
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:15,906
And with that, I got really involved during the pandemic, as you said, with a mutual aid group.

85
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:28,534
And we, I was one of the founders of a mutual aid group in Malden, which we were able to help hundreds of people, again, navigate a dizzying system, figuring out how to fill out unemployment.

86
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:31,756
You know, people were immediately unemployed and had no idea, had never been

87
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,883
without a job and didn't know how to file for unemployment.

88
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:40,664
People didn't know how to file for RAFT or any of the other housing monies that were out there.

89
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:54,187
And every day we were getting calls from people who were either food insecure, housing insecure, scared of how to manipulate and manage through the government stuff.

90
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,548
And we were able to find support for them.

91
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:11,513
We created a food pantry out of the Kung Fu Academy here in Malden and, you know, distributed hundreds of meals, not only, you know, the meals on wheel stuff, but we were able to create culturally competent meals for folks.

92
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,274
So we had a

93
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:22,201
We had a Chinese, we had the Chinese elders day where we would, and it was one of my favorite things to do is to deliver meals to Chinese elders every Friday afternoon.

94
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:29,305
And, you know, making sure we had masa on hand and other, you know, ethnically competent foods.

95
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:37,610
And that work really taught me that advocacy, when paired with government work, you can really evoke change.

96
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:52,380
advocating for housing rights and figuring out how to keep people in their house, I was able to push the mayor here in Malden to create a moratorium on evictions.

97
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,562
And we were the first city in the state to do that.

98
00:09:56,182 --> 00:10:01,586
And with that work, I was able to build upon that and we created the housing stability department here.

99
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:08,195
And in that in that creation since I believe 2000 I'm sorry 2021 we've been able to keep 2000 people in their homes.

100
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,576
not just in Malden, but in their actual home that they still live in.

101
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:25,083
And it's an amazing, it's amazingly transformative to see that, you know, you have this idea and then watch it kind of grow.

102
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:34,891
It's not, I didn't imagine I would create a bureaucracy or a department, but to be able to solve the problem of keeping people in their house was so,

103
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:45,858
monumental to me that it really proved to me that, you know, one person with enough support and enough gumption can make things make change.

104
00:10:47,419 --> 00:11:00,607
That being said, to run for office, I never thought that I was the front of the store kind of person, but I've really been compelled and asked by so many of my neighbors, like, why aren't you leading?

105
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:05,709
And honestly, the question is, it turned out to be a really good question.

106
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,133
They say that you have to ask women at least seven times to run for office before they do.

107
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:20,580
And, you know, I had a lot of family obligations that kind of held me back from really trying to put my all into this.

108
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:26,205
And those, you know, having long conversations with my family, they are ready, and so I was ready.

109
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,273
Oh, it's a great, great story.

110
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:32,055
Sorry, was there anything else you're gonna add?

111
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,917
No, no, no, I just yeah, I didn't like I'm like, you're talking too much.

112
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:39,120
You should know.

113
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,381
No, no, no one wants to hear me.

114
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:47,547
I think it's a it's a really nice like picture of how you sort of saw what the needs were in your community and you like acted on them and

115
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:48,968
made some of them happen.

116
00:11:48,988 --> 00:12:02,953
I also, it feels like, you know, Malden as a city is doing a great job in terms of, you know, prioritizing like equity and inclusion and I really loved how you talked about the culturally appropriate meals.

117
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:10,518
You know, I think that's definitely something that Medford is working on a little bit, but could definitely use some support there.

118
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:21,746
I kind of wonder how you think about just those themes of equity inclusion and how that, you know, that position in the state house could help, you know, with more progress in those areas.

119
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,907
Yeah, I mean, let's be honest.

120
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:29,491
Again, part of the, you know, the whole MAGA movement is to move us all back, right?

121
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:29,971
Like,

122
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:45,804
when that man came down on that escalator and basically called me and the rest of, you know, other Mexicans, murderers, rapists, and thieves, like, it put a chill down my spine.

123
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:59,271
And I've always been Mexican, I'm always, you know, like, luckily I live in New England, so sometimes I look a little paler, so maybe I pass, but it is something that I've always been, you know, it's something that I face.

124
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,292
And again, it's nothing like facing

125
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:05,447
the problems that our Black brothers and sisters face.

126
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,508
But I have been stopped by the police.

127
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:08,548
I have been harassed.

128
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,150
I have been a victim of police violence.

129
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,271
So I relate and understand.

130
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:18,554
And so I think that I bring that type of lens into this work.

131
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:23,777
And obviously, when the Black Lives Matter movement really got going,

132
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,313
It was, I thought, transformative.

133
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:32,696
And I wish that that energy was still kind of moving us forward.

134
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,797
I think that it's kind of died down.

135
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:44,944
But to my work that I've done with the lens of equity inclusion, I was part of a

136
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:50,834
racial equity group here in Malden that was able to start having conversations.

137
00:13:50,934 --> 00:14:01,980
Because honestly, I think that that's one of the biggest problems that we have, is that we don't have a common language and a common understanding of what bias and prejudice and racism is.

138
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,181
And I think people don't know what they don't know.

139
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:10,784
And so even just starting with conversations, and some people would be like, no, we need action.

140
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:23,890
And I'm like, right, but if we can't start at a solid baseline of what we all understand to be true, and how to name, like, when someone says this is offensive to me, you shouldn't argue with them.

141
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,351
It's offensive to them.

142
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,672
Accept that.

143
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:53,558
apologize and and learn just like that's it sounds super basic but like I tell people this all the time racial equity work 90% of it is internalized you need to do your work you shouldn't be policing other people you need to call people in because that's the other thing that I think that happens a lot in in in the movement is that people

144
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,520
want people to be all on the same level.

145
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,621
And we're all on a journey.

146
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:01,064
We're on the, I call it the road to enlightenment.

147
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,147
And we're not all in the same place.

148
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:05,130
And so we have to

149
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,453
not accept racism, but just correct kindly.

150
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,555
I always say correction is a kindness.

151
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:23,846
And I'm telling you this, that you're saying something that is offensive to other people so that you don't offend somebody and that they also don't like lose their mind on you because you've said something offensive.

152
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:29,011
Like I'm trying to save you from creating harm and having that guilt and harm to carry.

153
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:38,936
So I do think that that's something that we absolutely, as a city, country, nation, state, everyone has to do this work.

154
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:44,699
And if we're going to really, and it has to center the humanity of each other.

155
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,721
I mean, because in the end, that's what racism is.

156
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,843
It's a dehumanization of another person because they're different than you.

157
00:15:54,003 --> 00:16:04,308
And I think when you frame it like that, it kind of takes the energy out of like, you're calling me a racist, you're calling me a bigot, you're calling me, you know, whatever.

158
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,150
And it's really about seeing, you know, everyone's human.

159
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:08,870
Yeah.

160
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,810
No, thank you.

161
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:17,874
And so in terms of that and sort of the bigger picture, are there different priorities that you have in terms of making change if you were elected?

162
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,140
Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest, you know, the State House is still very male dominated.

163
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,369
There's, you know, not a lot of women, not a lot of people of color.

164
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:36,029
Not a lot of everything but guys named Brad or Dan.

165
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:43,751
And so it's going to be a challenge, and it is a male-dominated, you know, politics is a male-dominated space.

166
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:47,513
So understanding that and bringing that lens in.

167
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:58,517
Some of the priorities I would have that didn't get past this cycle, officially ended last week, is, again,

168
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:04,972
I center a lot of the work that I want to do ideally around healthcare, but sometimes other things take a priority.

169
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,774
Maternal health is something that I think needs to take a priority.

170
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:28,527
I myself was, you know, a victim of bias in the healthcare system as a patient and almost died two times during obstetrical issues that I had.

171
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:35,004
And I know for a fact that there was, you know, again, some biases going on.

172
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,765
I was told, oh, you can't be in that much pain, you know.

173
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:47,887
And when I passed out and came to, the first thing I remember hearing is the nurse telling me there's no way you can be in that much pain, saying, well, I guess you got the attention you wanted, huh?

174
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,688
Like I was attention seeking by passing out.

175
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:56,650
But I'd lost a liter of blood, so that is why I was unconscious.

176
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:06,429
It seems like very trivial, but this is the experience of black and brown women, especially in healthcare.

177
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:11,191
And that hospital, to its credit, has done a lot of work to get better.

178
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:14,192
But I don't think it needs to be hospital, hospital.

179
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:16,633
I think it needs to be a kind of a statewide movement that we do.

180
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:26,540
And then in general, women's health, where, you know, nobody invests in what does this medicine do to women, what, you know, with our hormones and things like that.

181
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:36,282
So I think in that aspect, you know, again, it's an intersectionality of both being a feminist and caring about racial equity.

182
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:45,745
Other things that I think definitely need to be addressed with regards to is housing.

183
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,934
housing situation is terrible and also it affects black and brown people even tougher.

184
00:18:55,516 --> 00:19:01,880
The rental rate here in Malden is 57% and I believe it's 48% in Medford.

185
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:07,184
So that is a lot of people who can't afford to get

186
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,006
to get onto the path of home ownership and to have generational wealth that they can pass down.

187
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:21,369
And so I think addressing the housing crisis, but with the lens of racial equity is something that needs to be focused on as well.

188
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:30,272
I think too, especially in Medford or sometimes Medford, it's the renters are pretty underrepresented in terms of like the impact on the community.

189
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,893
And so I think having a representation at the state level would be really powerful.

190
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:39,538
And again, I'll be honest, there are three people at the State House that are renters.

191
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,639
I would be the fourth.

192
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,769
So I think that that's also a lens that, again, the identities that I hold are sometimes visual and sometimes not.

193
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,291
And so I think that that also

194
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:53,668
is important.

195
00:19:54,068 --> 00:20:06,639
There's a lot of advocacy around housing, and again, I think that everyone should have the access to be a homeowner, or if your choice is to rent, that should be your choice to rent.

196
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:17,528
And I think that we need to create a system that is equitable, that if you are an elder who wants to age in place, we should figure out how to make that happen.

197
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:20,151
You shouldn't have to give up your home because

198
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,326
you can't afford the taxes anymore.

199
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:28,852
And I also think that young people who want to set up roots in our communities should have access to do that as well.

200
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:43,987
I think, like you said, a lot of people want to put down roots and become part of a community, a larger sense of themselves, but it is so difficult because you don't know how secure your housing will be from year to year.

201
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,290
Right.

202
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,311
And it's just, it's a roll of the dice.

203
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:52,472
I've been very fortunate, but you know, not everyone has that, that luck.

204
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,232
Yeah, totally.

205
00:20:55,013 --> 00:21:04,255
So one question that's a little more specific about the race, I think, you know, the current position has been held by the same person who's a Medford resident for a long time.

206
00:21:05,115 --> 00:21:08,136
And I think some of the, you know, he has

207
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:21,946
a good following of loyal voters in Medford and probably some in Malden as well, but some of the feedback has been, the other two candidates running for this position live in Malden, are Malden residents.

208
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:36,738
So I think there is some worry from some Medford voters that maybe the city of Medford would be less of a priority for somebody who's

209
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,160
living in Malden, so I wonder what you think about that.

210
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,187
Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest with you, I think that there's actually a lot of work to be done in Medford, and I would like to be that person that helps it.

211
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:58,675
I'm not going to say that I am an expert on Medford, I'm not going to say that I know or I see or anything like that, but again, just doing general kind of things that

212
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:03,939
and talking to people on the doors is what I've gained my knowledge from.

213
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:06,081
So just so you know.

214
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,183
And one of the biggest complaints are the roads, right?

215
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:18,590
And I mean, again, I am interested in doing all these high-level things and these intellectual things, but you've got to get the basics right, too.

216
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:19,831
And so

217
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:21,713
I did some research.

218
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:29,540
I found a website that kind of rates different roads and roadway systems and you know Malden's roads are at 82% and Medford's are at 57.

219
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:36,266
So I'd like to see that come up for Medford and I bet a lot of people would.

220
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:38,668
Now what can I do at the state house?

221
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,369
Here's what I can do at the state house.

222
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:41,490
I can't fix your pothole.

223
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:42,031
I can't.

224
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:45,194
But I can make sure that the chapter 90 money

225
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:56,182
is getting down to Medford City Hall, so that your city, your municipality can get that work done.

226
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:00,264
And again, I hear a lot of people say, well, if the hall delivers, and I'm like, well, that's great.

227
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:03,125
I don't know where then the mechanism is breaking down.

228
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:05,625
because your roads are still terrible.

229
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:20,782
And I say that with love and kindness that, again, our roads in Massachusetts are terrible to begin with, but I have been on some roads that have reminded me of some backwoods country roads.

230
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,186
And so again, it's not a big topic, but I do think that that's something that could be improved upon.

231
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:43,854
With regards to other things that I've heard, again, I know that education and the building of the high school is something that is also on the minds of lots of voters.

232
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:51,416
And I can say that I was the chair of Progressive Massachusetts, which is a statewide organization.

233
00:23:52,277 --> 00:24:09,300
And ourselves, as part of the raise up coalition, which is a large progressive coalition that moves bills ahead, we were able to run to not 10,000 doors for the fair share amendment, which was the millionaires tax.

234
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:11,948
And we helped get that passed.

235
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:24,170
Now, there was a lot of opposition, we had big money against us, but because we were able to organize, get people on doors and talk to voters, we were able to get that passed.

236
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,891
And that money is specifically earmarked for schools and for roads.

237
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,472
So I think it could help with both of those things.

238
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:38,633
And I have, again, while it's not Medford specific, I have created, helped create a statewide thing that will trickle down to Medford.

239
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:44,600
where I want to hear from more Medford voters, and I want to hear from more people in Medford.

240
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,721
As an organizer, that's one of the things that you learn.

241
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,342
You have to meet people where they're at.

242
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:54,584
You have to meet people where they're at, even when you don't agree with them.

243
00:24:54,624 --> 00:25:00,106
Because you have to figure out what the pain point is, right?

244
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,107
Like, what is causing them to feel this way?

245
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:16,345
And with my extensive organizing experience, I've learned that you might have a vision for what you think the solution is, but until you can build consensus around a solution, you can't move forward.

246
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:20,849
You can't just push things through because you think you know it's the right way.

247
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,090
You have to get by.

248
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:28,448
And buy-in takes time, and buy-in takes education, and buy-in takes building relationships.

249
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,871
And that is something that I really value in the work that I do.

250
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:49,165
It is something that really brings a lot of fulfillment in the organizing work that I do, because I've been able to build these relationships over the last, you know, eight, nine years with folks where we might not agree on this issue, but I respect that you have this issue.

251
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:59,037
And later on, we're able to kind of circle back and work together, because I have shown that person the respect, yet just held my opinion.

252
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:03,399
And with that work, I want to take that to the statehouse.

253
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:15,365
I want to take that to the statehouse, because I think that that's one of the biggest problems that's going on at the statehouse right now, is there's a lack of consensus, there's a lack of organization, and there's a lack of

254
00:26:17,235 --> 00:26:19,436
of drive to get things passed.

255
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:30,281
This past session, and again, I don't know how much you know about the state house, but this past session was the least productive of the last few cycles that I can think of.

256
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:33,422
And we have a super majority.

257
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:43,024
We have a Democratic supermajority and I can understand the excuses when it was like, well, we have a Republican governor, they're going to veto this, they're going to veto that.

258
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,207
And they did, you know, like there's lots of work that I did.

259
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:49,273
The Roe Act, for example, that codified Roe versus Wade.

260
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:57,604
My opponent, the incumbent, was like, you know, it's against my religion, I can't vote for it.

261
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:00,347
And I was like, but you don't understand, they're going to overturn this.

262
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:05,112
And he told me, you know, you're being hyperbolic, there's no way they're going to overturn Roe.

263
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:06,574
And this was in 2018, so it was still the law.

264
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:22,916
But I still pushed and I organized with Planned Parenthood and I organized with the ACLU and with Progressive Mass and the Indivisible Women to get the Roe Act passed.

265
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:34,722
The governor, Governor Baker vetoed it and we had to go back to the legislature, get the super majority, and then it passed.

266
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:37,183
But there's no excuse for that now.

267
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,244
We have a democratic governor.

268
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,820
And the housing bill was watered down.

269
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,944
There's all sorts of things that haven't passed, and we still don't know what the housing bill is going to look like, because the governor hasn't signed it yet.

270
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:57,388
But we're hoping, again, fingers crossed, that affordable housing, which is a crisis, gets addressed.

271
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:04,127
But the, you know, the two-year cycle is over as of last week.

272
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:10,911
So there's not much legislation that's going to pass between now and next January at the start of the new cycle.

273
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:13,493
And so it's disheartening.

274
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:16,435
There's a lot of climate action that could have been taken care of.

275
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,356
There's a lot of, there's so many things.

276
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:27,783
Again, the maternal health one is the one that hurts me the most is because it had consensus and then just died on the vine basically.

277
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:45,459
I think I knew that about the vote for the Roe Act and I think that what I'm hearing you say is like the importance about listening to the people that you're representing and hearing what they have to say and kind of those priorities moving them forward and that your personal religious views.

278
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:49,480
I didn't hear you say any of those so that's concerning.

279
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:51,721
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:28:51,741 --> 00:29:06,687
So I'm wondering, though, if there's any other things that you want to promote in your time, like, you know, I know there's a. Well, I mean, the biggest the biggest thing, right, is my my big three priorities is infrastructure, transportation.

281
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:14,510
I also think the MBTA, you know, while there's been a huge investment in the MBTA, we were knocking doors

282
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:23,789
up by Lawrence Memorial, and I knocked the door of an elderly woman whose bus was taken away.

283
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,312
And that was her only way of getting into Medford Center.

284
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,094
And so she's become a shut-in.

285
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,876
Now, she's 80-something years old.

286
00:29:31,057 --> 00:29:33,919
She can't walk down the hill and walk back up the hill.

287
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,522
And that bus was her only way of getting

288
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,737
to the senior center, getting to the things.

289
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:46,284
And there have been a lot of bus services that have been cut in both cities that I would like to see back.

290
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:55,693
I mean, one of the reasons that I moved to this area was because there was a lot of public transportation and I did not own a car when I first moved here.

291
00:29:57,408 --> 00:30:05,093
And I think investing in public transportation is going to get more people off the roads, which will lessen traffic and be better for the environment.

292
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:12,838
And that's the other problem that we really, I think, fundamentally as a planet, we need to address is the environmental issues that are happening.

293
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:21,524
And, you know, I would love to see, you know, fully renewable energy by 2035, but it's looking more and more like it's going to be realistically 2050.

294
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:34,966
that means that we need to start figuring out how we make our communities more resilient to climate change and the differing things that happen.

295
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:38,169
And lastly, I mean, obviously, it's housing.

296
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:47,495
I think that every part of Massachusetts has a different housing crisis, and the solutions for Medford are going to be different than the solutions for Malden.

297
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,717
And I think that one of the

298
00:30:51,343 --> 00:31:01,769
quick things that we can do is have someone at the State House who will approve local solutions through a thing called home petitions.

299
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,911
I don't know if you know what... Yeah, home petitions.

300
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:05,831
Yeah.

301
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:12,034
And so I think that that's been an obstacle that would not be an obstacle if I were elected.

302
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:14,476
Thank you.

303
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,136
Yeah.

304
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,878
No, again, I really do think that

305
00:31:20,323 --> 00:31:28,607
every city and town is different, and that the solutions that work here in Medford might not work in Boston, might not work in Malden, might not work there.

306
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:33,289
And we need to find things that fit our communities and our communities.

307
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,571
And you have some great evidence of doing that in Malden so far.

308
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:38,871
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:40,632
And again, honestly,

310
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,523
sometimes it's just as simple as creating, you know, like giving people access.

311
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:53,068
Like one of the biggest things that's helped so many people is that we have a lawyer of the day at housing court two days a week.

312
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:54,229
And so

313
00:31:55,163 --> 00:32:05,371
you don't have to pay them, the city pays for it and they're able to represent you and give you advice and mediate if it's just, you know, mediating with your landlord.

314
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:10,715
We've also helped people, you know, get out of mortgage, their mortgage problems as well.

315
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:20,082
So it's not just for renters, it's for homeowners as well, people who've fallen behind on their mortgage or need to re-negotiate how they're paying or what.

316
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:20,582
So I think

317
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,255
Again, like I said, I think there's lots of solutions.

318
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:28,903
We just have to find what's right for everyone and get consensus to build behind it.

319
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:36,598
And honestly, of all the things of, you know, again, I want to create change.

320
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:42,641
I think the biggest change that needs, the biggest help that our government right now needs is at the statehouse.

321
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:48,525
Like I said, I don't think that there's a person sitting down and saying, let's work on this together.

322
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:52,307
Even if it's two or three bills, like let's you and I get together.

323
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:57,270
There is a progressive caucus at the statehouse.

324
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:04,158
but the Progressive Caucus doesn't have a priorities list like the Black and Latino Caucus or the LGBTQ Caucus.

325
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:11,662
And I think that someone coming in and saying, hey, I'm an organizer, what do you think is important?

326
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:13,243
What do you think the priority is?

327
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:16,685
And it's just, again, asking people and finding consensus.

328
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:21,827
We can then start building an agenda that we can then all get behind and push.

329
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:27,170
And it sounds pretty basic, but it's what I really think needs to

330
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:29,575
needs to happen right now.

331
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:29,976
Yeah.

332
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:30,436
Yeah.

333
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:41,419
And I think that I think like, you know, most people, regardless of their like political leanings, would agree with that, you know, wanting to be heard by by politicians, wanting to have an impact.

334
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:46,081
And so, you know, I think it sounds like an approach that maybe we've moved away from.

335
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:52,163
And sometimes I think in in Medford, it's a little bit like you have to be

336
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:54,503
in a certain position.

337
00:33:54,544 --> 00:34:00,586
Yeah, or like, you know, you have to have, like, whatever, like, you have to have access to that person, right?

338
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:07,308
So, like, you have to have the time, you have to have, like, the connections, you have to have, like, the ability.

339
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:10,469
Yeah, and I think that, yeah, that's challenging.

340
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:19,172
Yeah, I will say this, that's something, again, one of the roles of this job is constituent services,

341
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:23,951
And that, I think, is the most important thing.

342
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:41,110
Again, to me, that's the thing that I think is my jam, is being able to talk to people, hear what their problems are, hear what their complaints are, and be able to have a conversation with them and try to figure out how to solve the puzzle of their problem.

343
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:50,409
And it's really, again, it's one of the things that I realized, this was the path to my purpose, was that I like to help people.

344
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,129
It's something that I'm naturally drawn to.

345
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:54,910
I translate for people.

346
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,731
I've translated my whole life from English to Spanish to medical jargon, and now I'm doing political jargon.

347
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,631
Like, let me explain to you what this all means.

348
00:35:03,691 --> 00:35:07,752
And in teaching and explaining, it's where I find my joy.

349
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:11,913
It's where I, you know, I could sit here and talk for hours to you about it.

350
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:19,943
And I think that a lot of people need that, especially when it comes to government, because they don't have time to learn all the nibbly bits like I do.

351
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:30,531
And if somebody can explain it to them, like I said, when I'm elected, there are going to be votes that some people don't like, and there are going to be votes that people love.

352
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:33,233
And I'm willing to have a conversation with people about it.

353
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:43,674
and I'm willing to be transparent and say, look, I voted for X because of Y and Z. I heard from these people, I heard from these people, this is the end.

354
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:47,896
And you might not agree with me, but I will have a conversation with you and I will talk to you about it.

355
00:35:48,016 --> 00:35:57,001
And I want input because one of the things that I think people don't understand is like, at the state house, there are 8,000 bills that are filed every year.

356
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:01,524
And of those 8,000 bills, maybe 100 get passed.

357
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:05,367
So no one's going to read 8,000 bills.

358
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:10,910
And so if something is important to you, I want to hear about it from you.

359
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:22,137
And because it might not be on my radar, and it might not be something that I am familiar with, but I will always listen to a constituent about why they're passionate about a thing.

360
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:31,422
and what impact it could do to either themselves, their community, or their city.

361
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,065
Well, thank you for that.

362
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:35,887
And I do wish we had hours to talk about this.

363
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,108
Yes, yes, sorry.

364
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,510
I have been like, la, la, la, la, la.

365
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,311
That's great.

366
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:44,376
But before we wrap it up, is there anything else that you want to share with us or want to let us know about?

367
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:49,136
Yeah, I mean, basically, I thank you for having me.

368
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:53,320
I appreciate the opportunity to talk to people and get get my message out.

369
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,704
I am going to be doing a meet and greet at Colleen's on the 13th.

370
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:02,509
So people want to actually talk to me and, you know, ask me a question.

371
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,453
I'll be there with my I'm not sure what kind of ice cream I'm going to get.

372
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:10,237
But that's the place I like to listen to the place I like to haunt sometimes.

373
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:10,617
Yeah.

374
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,975
in the late hours, so you might catch me there, nine or 10 o'clock at night, right before they close.

375
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:24,721
But I am running for office, not out of ego, but as a calling to serve.

376
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:39,432
And I hope that I'll be given the opportunity to do that, because I really do think that I could help both communities, Medford getting the schools taken care of,

377
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:59,763
making sure that, you know, the basics are taken care of, but also centering, you know, again, how diverse our communities are, and making sure that everybody's heard and has a seat at the table, or at least has the opportunity to speak to me and talk to me with whatever way they need.

378
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:01,184
Thank you.

379
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,805
Yeah, and there's a primary September 3rd, is that right?

380
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,486
Yes, the election is September 3rd.

381
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:07,627
It's the Tuesday after Labor Day, so

382
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:11,074
case you're going away, make sure you vote by mail.

383
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:17,180
And you can request those ballots at City Hall till August 24th.

384
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,942
And I believe that's when early voting starts as well.

385
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:21,284
Great.

386
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:22,565
Well, thank you so much.

387
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:24,426
Thank you.

388
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,487
I appreciate the conversation.

389
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:37,346
