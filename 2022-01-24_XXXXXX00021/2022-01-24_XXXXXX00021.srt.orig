[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, thank you so much for joining me today.

8
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:45,123
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and who you are.

9
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, thank you.

10
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:48,904
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kit Collins.

11
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I use she, her, and I'm a Medford City Councilor.

12
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:54,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, awesome.

13
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,366
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our newest, newly elected, right?

14
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

15
00:00:58,206 --> 00:00:59,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

16
00:00:59,686 --> 00:00:59,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

17
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:07,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the question that I try to ask everybody is a question about your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

19
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:12,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have my answer ready to go.

20
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:17,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I am lucky to live just a few blocks away from Colette bakery in South Medford and

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: As anybody who's been there knows, it's the best.

22
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:27,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and my partner love to go there sometimes on the weekends and just get a bunch of croissants.

23
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:29,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend.

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:34,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have waited in line outside of there a few times for their baked goods, it's delicious.

25
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:36,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

26
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:45,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since we didn't get to talk before the election, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of what led you to run, you know, kind of what led up to that decision.

27
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:48,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

28
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:49,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to.

29
00:01:49,116 --> 00:02:09,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of my trajectory that culminated in me running for office started in 2020 when I joined Our Revolution Medford, which if folks don't already know, is just a group of community members organizing for justice schools in Medford, fighting for, you know,

30
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,597
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, reforms and policies that will make this a more livable city for all.

31
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:39,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I just joined that as a member, I was looking for, um, a local political group to organize with, you know, in the wake of the pandemic and, you know, all of, all of the turmoil that was, you know, not at all new, but in some ways, you know, surfacing for a lot of people during 2020, I was looking for, um, you know, a way to get involved very, very locally, something that I could really kind of put my hands on.

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:47,026
[SPEAKER_01]: was happy to find Our Revolution Medford and for a lot of that year started getting involved in different campaigns.

33
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:56,753
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the Know Your Rights Coalition that Our Revolution Medford organized with the Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville group.

34
00:02:57,182 --> 00:03:04,044
[SPEAKER_01]: around all of the increased exacerbated housing instability that was happening because of the pandemic.

35
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:22,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so great and interesting and meaningful to get to focus in on these issues that we can pay attention to on a national scale and focus in on how they are manifesting right here in my community on the streets that I live on, the streets that I drive on.

36
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,416
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's so many of these.

37
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:42,990
[SPEAKER_01]: What what culminated in my decision to run was, you know, getting an increased sense of, you know, these issues aren't just urgent on a national scale, they're also urgent on a local scale and I really came to feel very committed to.

38
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,982
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do what I could to shore up the efforts already occurring that have been occurring in our community for a long time around a lot of these issues.

39
00:03:52,002 --> 00:04:06,605
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, supporting the work of groups like Our Evolution Medford and Medford People Power and the Mutual Aid Society and, you know, existing folks in office pushing for policies that will just help support everybody who lives here.

40
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we're getting towards the end of

41
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:12,881
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, beginning of 2021.

42
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:21,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought to myself, hmm, you know, I work for myself, I have a flexible schedule, I don't have kids to take care of, you know, running for office is a really big lift.

43
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:27,146
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I have, you know, a more flexible schedule than a lot of people.

44
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe this is something that I could step up and do.

45
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:37,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to tell people, you know, I called around existing elected officials to essentially looking for somebody to say, no kid, don't do it.

46
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:38,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody said that.

47
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.

48
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:46,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned that there were some issues that you were interested in.

49
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,974
[SPEAKER_00]: What specifically were you looking to have an impact on?

50
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

51
00:04:53,595 --> 00:05:03,097
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I learned that there's no renters on city council, and more to the point that traditionally there aren't, that really stuck out to me.

52
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:06,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I rent my apartment in Medford.

53
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been a renter in Medford for as long as I've lived here.

54
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,951
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of renters in Medford.

55
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:20,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that I, I would really emphasize that I think the housing crisis affects everybody, whether you rent or you own your home.

56
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:27,878
[SPEAKER_01]: But people who rent their home have to be a proportional part of that conversation.

57
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:34,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So elevating, you know, housing stability in our local conversation was really important to me.

58
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: and also being really dogged about pursuing ways to do what we can to address housing scarcity and extremely expensive housing in our own community using the tools that we have, instead of, you know, treating it as anything less than an urgent crisis.

59
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:58,327
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are a list of, you know, issues that I think we need to take bold action on would go on pretty long but you know another thing that rises to the top of my mind is

60
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:08,334
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the climate crisis and again, doing everything that we can at the local level, you know, saying we can't afford to defer any longer.

61
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:16,516
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have to be bullish and we have to, you know, evaluate the goals that we've set and say, that's great.

62
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:17,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

63
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,436
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do this?

64
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,317
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do this in a way that uplifts the people that lives here?

65
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:25,218
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't leave anybody out, but also doesn't leave out the future generations of Medford.

66
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's coming down the pike really fast as everybody is already

67
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:30,954
[SPEAKER_01]: know, materially experiencing.

68
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:56,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of conversations around, I think, around the election and before about sort of some credibility of city officials being based on, like, how long have you been here, sort of what's your permanence in the city, and it's, I can appreciate there's a large population of people in Medford that are renters that aren't, haven't been here, you know, for their whole lives, haven't been here for generations, and so it feels valuable to have you and some other members, like, on the city council that

69
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,735
[SPEAKER_00]: don't own homes here, maybe haven't been here for generations.

70
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,036
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like a valuable perspective.

71
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:05,617
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.

72
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:06,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

73
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:09,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So having- I think you make, oh, sorry, go ahead.

74
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:24,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I was just gonna say, I think you make the important point, which is, you know, there's lots of people who live in Bedford who, you know, haven't happened to be here, you know, for, haven't happened to have families who've been here for many generations, but that doesn't make them any less part of this community.

75
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:27,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, you know, I like to see that.

76
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,904
[SPEAKER_01]: hear that and see that emphasized, you know, we all we all care.

77
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:34,094
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all here, you know, and everybody wants to chip in.

78
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:35,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.

79
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:42,422
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a sense that I've gotten from meeting with city officials and just general residents and the work that they're doing.

80
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:51,046
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of interest in creating a nice place to live or maintaining this nice place to live for everybody.

81
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of what led you to run.

82
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:56,990
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the election like for you?

83
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,411
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you kind of take away from that experience?

84
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:01,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

85
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:03,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so much.

86
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:15,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, of course it was, I think everybody, I imagine that everybody has a like pretty accurate assumption about what running for office is like in that it's a lot of work.

87
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that assumption is accurate.

88
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was, you know, it was a really meaningful project.

89
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:26,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm so glad I did it.

90
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:31,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, you know, for so many reasons, you know,

91
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:45,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky to be endorsed by Our Revolution Medford and be a part of that group of candidates that chose to apply for endorsement by Our Revolution Medford, get endorsed.

92
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:54,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a wonderful way to build community by kind of running alongside candidates and so many volunteers who were all in it for the same reasons.

93
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, that was incredibly energizing.

94
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's draining as,

95
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:12,658
[SPEAKER_01]: The campaign was, you know, it's a lot of putting yourself out there, it's a lot of behind the scenes administrative work, fundraising, messaging, and it's just a ton of time, you know, walking the sidewalks, you know, knocking on strangers' doors and trying to talk to them.

96
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,661
[SPEAKER_01]: As draining as all that is, it's also extremely exciting.

97
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting to get to talk to people.

98
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:24,098
[SPEAKER_01]: about issues in their community and know that like, you know, maybe this isn't a conversation that would have happened otherwise.

99
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:35,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, apart from the outcome of the election itself, I just think that is a really healthy thing for, that's a really healthy conversation to have in any context.

100
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:41,322
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just like more opportunities for people to come together around local issues and talk about

101
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:50,414
[SPEAKER_01]: why it matters, what there is to be done, and who knows how people will take that forward into the future, even beyond the time to go to the ballot box.

102
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:56,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my theme there is running for office was a ton of work.

103
00:09:56,438 --> 00:10:04,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it was coming to a close, one thing I was really reflecting on was a few years ago, I ran a marathon in New York City.

104
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:18,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And the parallels between running an actual marathon and running for office are like, they're like almost comically, like obvious to me, just like fog about halfway through.

105
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:19,574
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm tired.

106
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:20,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stop now.

107
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's very rewarding.

108
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:29,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to change the way you ate and drank for the election to stay in the way that you might from here?

109
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbo loading.

110
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite as much, but you know, all that walking around.

111
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:36,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

112
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Like early and often.

113
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

114
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:38,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

115
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:45,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, I think there was a lot of events around the city, like leading up, you just like community events that a lot of the candidates were present for.

116
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:49,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like amazed at just how much time

117
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it seemed like some of you were like in two places at once, or I'd be like one events that you'd be there.

118
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one, you'd be at the same one.

119
00:10:56,394 --> 00:11:05,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wonder kind of like how you like balance that or how you think about like that balance of, um, kind of self care and, and, uh, yeah.

120
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:06,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

121
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm glad you brought that up.

122
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:17,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I think when I look back on it, I think that that aspect was the most challenging for me, the, um,

123
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,871
[SPEAKER_01]: the having to make an appearance at a lot of community events.

124
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:28,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean that in that I was like unhappy to be there at all, because we have some great events.

125
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:32,736
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Mystic River Festival Sticks Out especially is a really, really fun one.

126
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:38,419
[SPEAKER_01]: So many, you know, by the time I got to these events, I was always like happy to be there.

127
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,062
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think this also kind of ties into, you know,

128
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:51,540
[SPEAKER_01]: something you brought up before we started recording, which is sort of like, you know, the human experience behind the candidate experience.

129
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,065
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is maybe like a myopic point, but when it comes to sort of like, I don't know, like social interactions, I'm really a one-on-one person.

130
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:00,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I like one-on-one

131
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:03,423
[SPEAKER_01]: mingling is not my forte.

132
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:11,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So, having to, you know, say it's like a given Saturday I'm like okay I hope I can canvass for four hours today.

133
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:19,710
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also two events that I really feel like I should show up to, because I really want to support the organizers I want to be there I want to see who else is there I want to say hi to people.

134
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:41,102
[SPEAKER_01]: um that's you know the uh the drive for the walk to those events is typically when I would have my my lowest moments of oh my gosh I just don't know if I can do it um and it frequently got very emotional you know the social exhaustion I think that's um that that was a really a really real part of it um

135
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:49,209
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of like a really extended job interview where you're sort of marketing yourself over and over again.

136
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's like another thing to think about in terms of like the makeup of the city councilor, right?

137
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Is like, maybe it's important to have some folks that aren't super extroverted, right?

138
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:08,735
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's like, there's definitely a benefit to those types of personalities, those types of like thinking and learning styles that are important.

139
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

140
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.

141
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:11,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think,

142
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I was left with from going through the experience of campaigning is just, I think, you know, it really throws into very sharp focus all of the things that are very exclusive about, that's baked into the process of campaigning.

143
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't exclusive to Medford or any municipality or state at all.

144
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:41,274
[SPEAKER_01]: but are just kind of par for the course of how political campaigning is done in this country, I think.

145
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:53,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point, you have to be an extrovert or you have to be able to play one on TV, which I think is a little bit of what I've learned to do over many years, not just during the campaign.

146
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:58,004
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to summon that kind of social energy.

147
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:25,083
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then beyond the personality aspects, you know, there's, I feel like there's many hours of conversation to be had about, you know, the many systemic reasons why it's hard to be a political candidate if you are not wealth privileged, if you don't have a certain type of job, if you don't have, you know, a certain level of social support within your personal network.

148
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:31,549
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was lucky to have people who said go for it in my personal life who could help pick up slack.

149
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,595
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I needed to be out campaigning, I was running a pop-up shop for my art business during the summer.

150
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'll be honest, my parents came out and helped me staff that.

151
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's something that, that's a privilege that I had.

152
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:50,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I had family who would help me, you know, do, you know, do my job when I had to be off

153
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:55,325
[SPEAKER_01]: campaigning, I had a partner who was supportive, I had people in my family and friends network who could donate money.

154
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:01,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, that's not, you know, something that's unique to me.

155
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:12,994
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that those are all kind of accumulate into this kind of like requirement for how to things that you need to be a successful candidate, time and money and time to recharge.

156
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:17,917
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that plays into why it's really, really hard.

157
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:22,501
[SPEAKER_01]: for people from marginalized backgrounds to be candidates for political office.

158
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:31,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think, I'm trying to stay focused on that post-election because that's a huge problem that needs to be fixed systemically.

159
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:36,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you mentioned to the sort of endorsement of our revolution.

160
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:50,783
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that something that it's making me think when you're talking kind of about this like social capital and the sort of ways that the privileges that I think help support some of these campaigns, is it something that you apply for or they reach out to you?

161
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it like, what does that process look like?

162
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm so glad you asked about that.

163
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Our revolution, Medford reached out to every

164
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:04,044
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate for office in Medford and invited them to apply.

165
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:09,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then candidates had the choice to apply or not.

166
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,530
Okay.

167
00:16:12,191 --> 00:16:15,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And then does it, does it involve like, what, what happens next?

168
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:18,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is there like an investment or is there like, what's the.

169
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:20,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

170
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:29,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first step after applying for endorsement is an interview with just like a small group of core our revolution Medford members and

171
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:32,746
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by members, I just mean people who are involved in the group.

172
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it ORM for short.

173
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:38,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just people, ORM members are just people who are involved in the group.

174
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:44,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started with just a one-on-one Zoom interview with a few ORM members.

175
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,712
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, you know, standardized list of questions that these interview committees were giving to every

176
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,404
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate who applied.

177
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:56,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though I was already an OR member, I went through the exact same process as everybody else.

178
00:16:57,228 --> 00:17:11,419
[SPEAKER_01]: After going through the interview, me and all of the other candidates who applied for that round, there were two rounds of endorsement, one that, gosh, I think was like maybe in May, and then the other I think was August or September, but I kind of forget right now.

179
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:18,416
[SPEAKER_01]: After the interview, all of the round one candidates participated in a candidate's forum.

180
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:25,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all got on the same Zoom call with all of the ORN members who wanted to watch and participate.

181
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all asked the same questions.

182
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And we answered them in real time for the ORN members.

183
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:39,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And a week or two after that, a questionnaire went out to all of the ORN members just saying, OK, time to vote.

184
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote on who you want to endorse.

185
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think

186
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:52,346
[SPEAKER_01]: cause, you know, I don't think I'm talking out of school to say that all of the people who applied for endorsement received endorsement.

187
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:58,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is because the people who, so like I said, everybody, everybody who ran for office was invited to apply.

188
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:08,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's self-selecting, you know, the people who had already signed onto the Medford People's platform were like, sure, why wouldn't I, you know, apply for endorsement.

189
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:14,250
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a self-selecting group of people, you know, who would apply for endorsement.

190
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:14,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

191
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:40,702
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and we there was a there was some sort of like papers going around right before the election that sort of like I think like uh kind of split the candidates in half almost or like these are the ones that we support these are the ones that we don't and some of that I think was real and some of it wasn't but um yeah it became I think those were oh yeah go ahead oh I'm so sorry to interrupt you I was just gonna say yeah those were those were not affiliated with OR

192
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was like some really kind of bizarre local propaganda.

193
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:48,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it was, it got a little, uh, it got interesting there towards the end of it.

194
00:18:48,537 --> 00:19:04,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think afterwards, like a reflection on, um, so I think some folks choosing to vote, like sort of down ballot for people that, um, or I'm endorsed and, and then there being other like candidates that, uh, would have brought other different perspectives to the council that, um,

195
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:09,736
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think people speculated weren't elected because they hadn't joined on with ORM.

196
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:12,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if like, I don't know, it gave me something to think about.

197
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been some conversations around that.

198
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,623
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if you have any thoughts about that either.

199
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:28,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, I think, you know, I think that there's kind of a lot to consider and analyze for the, you know, like the election postmortem.

200
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:36,259
[SPEAKER_01]: for who got on and who didn't, you know, I'll say I won't like get specific, but I'll say that like the outcome in some ways was like really surprising to me.

201
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:51,344
[SPEAKER_01]: were like absolutely gonna get on, did not, you know, it didn't necessarily like go the way that I assumed it would because I'm not an elections analyst, I'm just a first time, you know, candidate, no elected official.

202
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:58,949
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there is a lot to digest about the election.

203
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the fact that ORM is,

204
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:14,616
[SPEAKER_01]: the most organized group in the city that also does elections in a highly organized strategic way.

205
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:23,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having a list of people to vote for is really powerful, but I also really want to emphasize that ORM

206
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:39,736
[SPEAKER_01]: has like a very sophisticated campaign structure for an all volunteer group and like again like a worm is not a nonprofit doesn't get any national funding like this is just really committed group of people who live here and.

207
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:50,509
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, folks who are interested, you know, next time election season rolls around, you know, you should come out to a canvas for whoever's running for office that time.

208
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:55,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, it's really a marvel, you know, we have volunteers going out every single weekend.

209
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,614
[SPEAKER_01]: who were knocking on doors in support of every single Our Revolution Medford candidate.

210
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that all summer long.

211
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:10,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it shouldn't be underestimated the power of just that level of organizing.

212
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:21,170
[SPEAKER_01]: A really professional level of organizing for a group that is not professional or is not a formal group is what I mean.

213
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not, you know,

214
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:30,318
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% of it, but I think that is really a lot of it is just the strategy and organizing behind it.

215
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and from a place of saying we want to be able to make progress, you know, we want to win so we can make progress.

216
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:42,149
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, and I think there were some like direct criticisms about race and like the racial makeup of

217
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:48,110
[SPEAKER_00]: ORM, which I don't actually know like what the facts are, but just sort of what I've heard.

218
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the racial makeup of the candidates being mostly white that signed on to ORM.

219
00:21:54,452 --> 00:22:10,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder like, and it's like, I think there was these questions about like, what does it mean when the one black candidate that's running for office that seems like aligned politically is not choosing to work with ORM?

220
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess, like, I don't know if you have any thoughts about that.

221
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:20,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm not, I know that that's been talked about a lot since the election.

222
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:24,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given it a lot of thought.

223
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:39,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna... I think what I would wanna say is that I think this is something that ORM is taking very seriously.

224
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:43,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the group is taking it very seriously, because I know there are a lot of individuals within OR.

225
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,065
[SPEAKER_01]: who have given this a ton of thought and say, it does matter to us.

226
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:55,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It says something about our organization if it is a diverse representative group of people.

227
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:00,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And continuing to evaluate, is this a space where all people feel comfortable?

228
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna speak for anybody else's decision to join or not join.

229
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:07,578
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of factors involved with that.

230
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:11,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just wanna be independent candidates, even if they politically align.

231
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:13,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't wanna,

232
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,775
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say anything would be construed as common to anybody's decision.

233
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:31,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I guess I do just want to say that, like, this is, I don't think this is a thing that, you know, either me personally or ORM is brushing under the rug at all.

234
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:38,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's a satisfying answer.

235
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:40,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a satisfying answer to me right now, but I,

236
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,848
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't something I was thinking about this morning preparing.

237
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:45,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

238
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of, I'm kind of speaking off the top of my head.

239
00:23:48,949 --> 00:24:02,072
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess, I guess just to, to bring it back to full circle, the thing I would say is, I think the way that and again, I'm not a spokesperson for OR, I'm just an individual member.

240
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:15,660
[SPEAKER_01]: But my impression from talking with the group is that this is the overall theme of how do we endorse a diverse slate of candidates?

241
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,628
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make sure that we are supporting all types of candidates and supporting candidates that are

242
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,895
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less close to the picture of a traditional candidate.

243
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:32,541
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get better at that is a conversation that's already started.

244
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:38,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that, you know, I really hope to keep talking about and you know just for me personally.

245
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:45,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, and it feels like an important parallel process for like the work that city council does, right?

246
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:58,157
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like how, you know, how are we like seeking out diverse candidates, but then also how are we like representing the diversity of Medford in the work that you all are doing as counselors as well?

247
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,498
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate the response.

248
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:04,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not an easy question to answer, but- No, no, I'm glad you asked.

249
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:09,221
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the stuff that we need to be thinking about, you know, before election season runs around.

250
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:10,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

251
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,503
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for answering that.

252
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:17,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to move on to something a little bit lighter, too.

253
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:23,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any hopes for your first term or things that you're looking forward to getting started?

254
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

255
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,391
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a list.

256
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:36,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a lot to be excited about.

257
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:37,815
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work that I'm

258
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:49,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to start and excited to explore with other with my fellow counselors with other members of the administration and the mayor.

259
00:25:53,364 --> 00:26:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to start with one with one specific example, you know I'm really excited for us to take up and consider the housing production plan that was, you know, put on the table for the Council last year.

260
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:11,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that coalesces with you know work that I'd really like to explore.

261
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:29,890
[SPEAKER_01]: with other members of the administration, with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability about, you know, ways that the city can position itself to recruit and invite and collaborate with housing developers for our city, including affordable housing developers and green affordable housing developers.

262
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:37,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, kind of at the top of our conversation, you know, dealing with the issue of housing scarcity and cost of housing is

263
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:42,117
[SPEAKER_01]: as throughout the campaign and the start of the season, been right at the top of my mind.

264
00:26:43,939 --> 00:27:05,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that something that cities similar to Medford have modeled really good results with is bridging good relationships with strong, professional, affordable housing developers to create more housing, high quality housing.

265
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:09,214
[SPEAKER_01]: in their neighborhoods that is suitable for people of all income levels.

266
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something we're lacking in Medford.

267
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:21,737
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of reports out on the city website that speak exactly to this, including the housing production plan about the gap in the housing that we have affordable and the type of housing that is appropriate for the people who live here.

268
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:30,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing that I'm really excited to dig into and to collaborate with other city staff about.

269
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:44,727
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a lot else along the lines of, you know, just city services that work better for residents and again, progressing along those climate goals for our city.

270
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:58,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned earlier, you know, one thing that actually I wanna shout out Councilor Seng, because this is, you know, an idea that he and I were talking about recently is, you know, there's been some talk of an overhaul of the city website.

271
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this has been talked about for a little bit now,

272
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:12,244
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing that in such a way that makes it more useful in really targeted ways, more useful for renters, more useful for new residents.

273
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dreams of a modernized, updated city website that has easily accessible links like, okay, what's my ward?

274
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:31,660
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one map on Reddit that I can find that tells me what ward I live in, trash recycling calendar, bill pay, actually regularly maintained construction update section.

275
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:38,143
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, a version that is actually translated into every major language spoken in different households.

276
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:47,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is something that I would, I'm really excited to begin a conversation with the city administration around for, you know, what's figuring out what's the scope here?

277
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:47,986
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do?

278
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,367
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can we get funding for a project like this?

279
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:58,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, all towards the eye of, you know, let's, let's create some, some better communication with our residents that will really be helpful.

280
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

281
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:18,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say I would hardly ever go on the city website if I didn't have to pay my water bill and it's not an easy process anytime but like if they're like folks that live in the city that don't have to go on the website for that like what else is attracting them there and that language pieces come up a lot right like how how is that it feels like a pretty.

282
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:31,384
[SPEAKER_00]: like basic way to include more people right to make all like what is there a big meeting happening how do people that maybe like English is their primary language how do they access that right like that's a yeah that's exciting.

283
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm happy to hear that.

284
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's a big project.

285
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something I try to stay conscious of is most of the great ideas that we have are big projects.

286
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:47,533
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not things that we can snap our fingers and do overnight.

287
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:53,996
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first step is figuring out who should be in on the conversation, what's the scope,

288
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:56,089
[SPEAKER_01]: do we pay for it?

289
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:56,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

290
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we start?

291
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,890
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best first step?

292
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,931
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next best step after that?

293
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:11,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, like, like so many things, this, you know, this goal of modernizing improving the city website totally falls into that category for me.

294
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:17,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of similarly along those lines, another thing that's, you know, you know, not necessarily

295
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:46,654
[SPEAKER_01]: uh not on the same priority level as a lot of other things but very on my mind as we start the term is um you know we have the stated goal of carbon net neutrality for the city by 2050 and I really want to see um you know specific metrics that we develop that we can point to that we can track for how we're progressing towards that goal really break it into discrete you know discrete trackable sections um to say you know what initiatives are we doing to try to get there

296
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,519
[SPEAKER_01]: and how's it going, you know, so that we can be armed with the data.

297
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, when we're doing great on say,

298
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,875
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding adoption of the mass saves program.

299
00:30:57,315 --> 00:31:04,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what to celebrate, who to congratulate, and for other things that we're making slower progress on to say, okay, this needs more attention.

300
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,099
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs more investment.

301
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's figure out how to do that.

302
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:15,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think we need to take a really specific granular lens to hold ourselves accountable to that carbon net zero goal.

303
00:31:16,105 --> 00:31:18,686
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing I'm just particularly jazzed about these days.

304
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:20,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

305
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:31,195
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like to receive input from residents or like how are you kind of integrating community input into sort of your, your like lens as a city counselor.

306
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so glad you asked that.

307
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:36,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to receive input.

308
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,381
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, I like to receive it, I want people to reach out to me.

309
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:56,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Existing ways to do that are my email address, which is on the city website, and I'm also happy to provide that at the end, or people can also just email kitformedford at gmail.com, just all spelled out.

310
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:00,845
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wanna hear what people are thinking about.

311
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna know what problems people are having.

312
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:03,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna know what ideas they have.

313
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, counselors are your representatives.

314
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,226
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here to represent you.

315
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:12,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in a position, it's our job.

316
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:28,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, you know, something that I was thinking a lot about during the campaign and have been trying to be intentional about maintaining focus on as I've become transitioned from candidate to elected is, you know, we did so much outreach during the campaign.

317
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:37,186
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, tons of canvassing, so, so, so much canvassing, you know, knocking on people's doors, going to them.

318
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:47,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is normative for the going to the constituents to drop off, you know, after the campaign season.

319
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:57,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be, I think, unrealistic for me to keep up that pace as an elected because there's, you know, a lot else to do now that I actually have this platform.

320
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:05,801
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in addition to starting office hours on Zoom, which is something that I have, you know, in planning mode,

321
00:33:06,312 --> 00:33:16,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm trying to schedule my first one and then I'll kind of iterate a regular schedule from that and hoping to do some, you know, in person office hours once the weather gets nicer as well.

322
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:24,869
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm hoping to start a habit of, you know, monthly neighborhood canvases just to make people make just to make sure that people know

323
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:39,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Who I am, how to contact me because I think kind of to your point about you know how, how much or how little you use the city website, people who aren't already, you know, familiar with their local representatives who aren't already kind of in fold of.

324
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:46,390
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the city and politics of the city and involved with their local government, which is a ton of people.

325
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And on very understandably, it's it takes time.

326
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:50,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.

327
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:56,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's, you know, it feels like real work to, you know, be involved with your local city.

328
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:02,598
[SPEAKER_01]: People who aren't already in the know, essentially, like don't don't know that they can be or they don't know who to talk to.

329
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:04,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it's really

330
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:13,557
[SPEAKER_01]: fair to say, well, people would get in touch with me if they wanted to be in touch with me.

331
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:19,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I got involved in local issues, I wasn't involved.

332
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:35,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to push myself to do a better job of bringing in the perspective and input of people who aren't already regularly showing up to council meetings, people who aren't already plugged in

333
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:45,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that continuing, you know, a slightly scaled down version of that direct community outreach is something that I'm hoping to continue.

334
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:51,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think people think about reaching out to city councilors in like a more of a reactive way when something's already happened.

335
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:58,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's like the Councilor Morrell and Councilor Behrs were like really helpful to me with the sanitation issue we had on our sheet.

336
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:04,446
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I feel like they're what you're speaking to is like a way of being proactive, right?

337
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are the things that are on people's minds?

338
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:13,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do we kind of get ahead of like, what, you know, what the needs are of the community rather than having to respond after something, something happens, right?

339
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:15,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

340
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:16,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

341
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:24,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think, trying to invite the proactive conversations is is a great way of putting it.

342
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:29,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a group of women I had on a couple weeks ago they were talking about.

343
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:33,180
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all Jewish residents but they were talking about this.

344
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:59,757
[SPEAKER_00]: um program that Medford used to have I think was called like Medford conversations where like it was sort of like a hot topics kind of thing and people would like uh you know just have conversations and things would come out of those conversations that would um sort of help them frame like change they wanted to see in the city which sounded really cool yeah that's awesome yeah um awesome was there anything else that you'd like to mention uh before we wrap up today um

345
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:10,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just kind of related to what we were talking about earlier regarding the campaign season.

346
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:26,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I'm trying to take every opportunity to just seed in people's minds is, you know, if you, I know it's just the beginning of the term, but if you, anybody listening is intrigued by the idea of running for local office or knows anybody who is,

347
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:35,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, no matter, you know, what age they are, uh, you know, if it's just a pipe dream or just something you're curious about, um, please reach out to me.

348
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have a conversation with you.

349
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:50,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, the process of even seeing yourself as somebody who could run for any office, um, is something that doesn't, is not made to feel real to, for most people.

350
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to do what I can to dispel that.

351
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:52,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

352
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:57,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're just kind of knocking it around in your mind, please reach out to me to have a conversation.

353
00:36:57,992 --> 00:37:03,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do what I can to demystify it and encourage you to think about it.

354
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:05,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

355
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:05,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.

356
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:10,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can put your email in the show notes so people can more easily get to that too.

357
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:11,555
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

358
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:16,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really appreciate you making the time to talk to me today and hopefully we can connect again in the future.

359
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:18,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope so.

360
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:19,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much.

361
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:21,617
