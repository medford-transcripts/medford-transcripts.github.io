Today's topic, what would happen if there was no gravity? Without gravity, we would be human birds. I believe I can fly. I believe I can touch the sky. Bro, it's over. I like gravity. It keeps me on the earth. By the way, that's Stan's last name.

Want to join? Sure. While she's thinking, I want to talk about today's sponsor, Spatula City. Spatula City is a warehouse full of name-brand spatulas for everyone.

Buy two, get one free. Act fast, because it's only this weekend at... Statula City! I'm done. Okay guys, let's see those suggestions. According to legend, Isaac Newton invented the law of gravity. Excuse me? I'm pretty sure Nikola Tesla invented it. Tesla is my favorite type of car.

00:03:37,313 --> 00:04:04,803
Elon Musk invented Tesla's. No, Frederick Douglass invented it. Frederick Douglass was a balloon. No, Frederick Douglass was an alien. No, he was a ballroom dancer. Wait, he lived on the moon. And the moon has gravity. Wow, a revolving topic. My favorite.

00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:20,007
The earth revolves around the sun. We don't need to get into another one of these. Okay, until next time. Bye!
