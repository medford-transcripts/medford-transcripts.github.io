This is the Freaking Out on Science podcast.

2
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:14,007
Who needs physics or laws of motion or gravity?

3
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,370
In this comedy show, we try the impossible.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,273
To deny all scientific facts that have been known for hundreds of years.

5
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:33,102
Join us on a terrific and hilarious journey to deny the laws of physics.

Episode 1!

12
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,860
I'm sorry, was I too loud?

13
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,901
I'm just excited.

14
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,888
Welcome to Episode 1 of Freaking Out in Science.

15
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:25,990
I'm Joe, and I'm a co-host.

16
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:29,113
I'm Adam, and I'll be answering questions.

17
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,197
I'm Dan, and I'm also going to be answering questions.

18
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,071
Today's topic, what would happen if there was no gravity?

19
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,152
Without gravity, we would be human birds.

20
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:42,673
I believe I can fly.

21
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,995
I believe I can touch the sky.

22
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,396
Bro, it's over.

23
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,297
I like gravity.

24
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,378
It keeps me on the earth.

25
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:56,180
By the way, that's Stan's last name.

26
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:02,418
We'll give the answers in a few minutes to think.

27
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:06,180
But with podcast magic, we'll be back in just a few seconds.

28
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,761
And we're back!

29
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:11,782
With freaking out science.

30
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,823
Daniel and I, do you have your suggestions?

31
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,884
Yes.

32
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:18,685
To start.

33
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:24,807
Hi, guys.

34
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:26,988
Have we started yet?

35
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,389
Hi, Catherine.

36
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,398
I'm Catherine and I am the designer.

37
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:38,124
We were just about to share our suggestions.

38
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:42,313
Want to join?

39
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:43,553
Sure.

40
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:48,077
While she's thinking, I want to talk about today's sponsor, Spatula City.

41
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:52,640
Spatula City is a warehouse full of name-brand spatulas for everyone.

42
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:58,525
Yesterday, I made an egg with a Spatula City spatula.

43
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:00,286
And I don't like to cook!

44
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:04,929
There's spatulas for birthdays, graduations, weddings, bar mitzvahs, and more.

45
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,250
Don't wait.

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,831
Get yours during the sale.

47
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,133
Buy two, get one free.

48
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:16,755
Act fast, because it's only this weekend at... Statula City!

49
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:19,316
I'm done.

50
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,457
Okay guys, let's see those suggestions.

51
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:28,179
According to legend, Isaac Newton invented the law of gravity.

52
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,299
Excuse me?

53
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,100
I'm pretty sure Nikola Tesla invented it.

54
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,482
Tesla is my favorite type of car.

55
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,854
Elon Musk invented Tesla's.

56
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:43,435
No, Frederick Douglass invented it.

57
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,417
Frederick Douglass was a balloon.

58
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,758
No, Frederick Douglass was an alien.

59
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:54,879
No, he was a ballroom dancer.

60
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,820
Wait, he lived on the moon.

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,002
And the moon has gravity.

62
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,422
Wow, a revolving topic.

63
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,463
My favorite.

64
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,554
The earth revolves around the sun.

65
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:14,501
We don't need to get into another one of these.

66
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:17,544
Okay, until next time.

67
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:17,625
Bye!
