[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

[SPEAKER_09]: Five present, two are absent, but both calls said that we get very sharp.

00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:40,868
[SPEAKER_09]: We can proceed with business.

52
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:29,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of the secretary.

53
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,700
[SPEAKER_09]: There is none.

54
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,284
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no report of committees, community participation.

55
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:42,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven report of the superintendent recommendation to approve MHS and VTHS graduation date, June 8th, 2016 approval.

56
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:48,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, this is really a double report.

57
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,614
[SPEAKER_08]: First one talks about the date on January and June 8th.

58
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:56,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason we do that, in case a snow day comes, and that's why we do it this early.

59
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:04,125
[SPEAKER_08]: In case a snow day comes, we're already set and we don't have to rearrange our calendar and people can get adequate notice for those people coming from out of town.

60
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:10,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So I recommend that you approve the date of June 8th, 2016.

61
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:15,003
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion to approve, Mr. Schiappelli.

62
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:20,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be remiss to say, Maria, that I just would, in honor of Mr. Brady.

63
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,447
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Homel?

64
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:25,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, approved.

65
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:26,489
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the second item.

66
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,210
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, let the record reflect that Mrs. Vander Kloot is here.

67
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,470
[SPEAKER_09]: She's present.

68
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,932
[SPEAKER_09]: On that recommendation, all in favor say aye, opposed, no.

69
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:37,592
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

70
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:38,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation is approved.

71
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:39,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

72
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So the second piece is the issue of Gantr.

73
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've had good success there.

74
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,555
[SPEAKER_08]: We recommend that we continue with Gantr.

75
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:48,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion of approval.

76
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,336
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of approval by Mrs. Vander Kloot, I wish you all a very good time there.

77
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,277
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all in favor say aye, opposed, no.

78
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:57,098
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

79
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,138
[SPEAKER_09]: The recommendation is approved.

80
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:02,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve Oral Hygiene Dental Health Program, Mr. Superintendent.

81
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:10,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Mayor, members of the committee, I think we all recognize that oral hygiene and dental health is important to the general health of an individual.

82
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:15,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Our supervisor of health services, Tony Vento, is here to talk about the program.

83
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:25,791
[SPEAKER_08]: We think it's important that we incorporate it into our schools and we partner with local dental associates and that we can move this forward for our young people.

84
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So Tony, come on up and why don't you explain it.

85
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:34,534
Good evening.

86
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:40,200
We have the Mother Claw Advocating Department of Children's Medicine Associates in Bedford.

87
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the hijackers and the dentists that come to do oral health education.

88
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:48,489
We have our preschoolers and we have our first graders.

89
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,232
They have a wonderful little cartoon video that's going to

90
00:03:55,376 --> 00:04:00,161
They gave out a toothbrush and a sticker.

91
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:10,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So we thought that was a worthwhile program to provide for all of our children up to grade one.

92
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:14,235
I did draft a parent's information consent letter.

93
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,617
That was all done in January.

94
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Mayor.

95
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:33,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is great.

96
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:39,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I love partnerships within the community and some kids probably need a new toothbrush and don't even realize they do.

97
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is great.

98
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:41,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for doing this.

99
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they approach you or did we approach them?

100
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:51,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year, we just put it all on one umbrella.

101
00:04:51,693 --> 00:05:02,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm scheduling it and making sure we have the same information about it at home to all parents and that all classrooms of those ages would be able to use that.

102
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:04,267
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

103
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for doing this.

104
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:06,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really a great motion to approve.

105
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:07,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

106
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,988
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all in favor say aye.

107
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:09,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed, no.

108
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:10,089
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

109
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:11,109
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion is approved.

110
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,250
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, Mr. Skerry, that the rules be suspended and I take a number of papers out of order.

111
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all in favor say aye.

112
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

113
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed, no.

114
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,411
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

115
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:25,812
[SPEAKER_09]: On a motion of Mr. Skerry, that number 10, negotiations and legal matters be moved to the end of the calendar.

116
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:27,213
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all in favor say aye.

117
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:27,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

118
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:28,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed, no.

119
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:28,693
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

120
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Under all business communications and new business, there is none.

121
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,235
[SPEAKER_09]: On a motion, Mr. Skerry?

122
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Concerning today.

123
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:46,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I'd like to ask your indulgences for a moment of silence in honor of Dave Infamy.

124
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:53,905
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the 74th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, and serving at Pearl Harbor at the time of the attacks were two outstanding Medford residents.

125
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:58,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim Barry was, for many years, a member of the National Guard.

126
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,491
[SPEAKER_10]: After he came out of the Army, he retired at the rank of Sergeant Major.

127
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: He was also the cemetery foreman at Oak Grove.

128
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:13,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Joseph Robinson, Joseph Reynolds, excuse me, from Wellington, for many years was a Medford police officer here in Medford.

129
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And he, too, served with honor and was at Pearl Harbor during that inferno.

130
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Could I ask that you please rise?

131
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a moment of silence.

132
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on the Impact Ability Program, Mr. Superintendent.

133
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:58,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair and members of the committee, the Impact Ability Program teaches personal safety and assertive communication skills to individuals with a wide range of disabilities.

134
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,383
[SPEAKER_08]: The program is a very research-based program.

135
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: It's designed to help those students with disabilities recognize abusive and unsafe conditions, as well as to protect and advocate for themselves.

136
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:18,576
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not know this, but people with disabilities are three times as likely to experience violent crime as those without disabilities.

137
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:26,503
[SPEAKER_08]: And women with disabilities in Massachusetts experience more than twice the rate of sexual assault as those without disabilities.

138
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:35,485
[SPEAKER_08]: ImpactAbility is part of the Triangle Disability Service and Advocacy Organization, founded by parents and business leaders in Medford, Malden, and Everett.

139
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:45,210
[SPEAKER_08]: For over 40 years, Triangle has worked to integrate adults and teens with disabilities into their local communities through employment and residential supports.

140
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:53,535
[SPEAKER_08]: The program started in 2011, ImpactAbility, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

141
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,310
[SPEAKER_08]: some attached information as an evaluation of the initial program.

142
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:08,717
[SPEAKER_08]: By the Institute of Community Health, a grant from the Cummings Foundation has enabled the program to collaborate with Medford's Special Education Department this school year.

143
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:14,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Jan Hollenbeck of our SPED Department is coordinating the implementation in Medford.

144
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And on Tuesday, tomorrow, December 8th, there will be a program celebration from 10 to 11.30 a.m.

145
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: at Medford High School.

146
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:28,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Triangle Board Member and State Representative Paul Donato will be the keynote speaker.

147
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:38,015
[SPEAKER_08]: As we prepare our students with disabilities to make a successful transition to adulthood, it's essential that we take a comprehensive approach.

148
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:41,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And impactability adds an important dimension to their preparedness.

149
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:48,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I expect there to be some program representatives, but I don't see any here this evening at this point in time.

150
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,317
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a terrific program.

151
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,759
[SPEAKER_08]: We had at least six graduates this year.

152
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,022
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect to expand it even more next year as we go beyond the trial phase.

153
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:11,150
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the kind of thing that we need to do to ensure that youngsters who have deep impairments have the ability to function in adult society and not with fear and not with the inability to defend themselves should something show up.

154
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:18,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for your information, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Superintendent, uh, what will the, where will the site of the graduation be?

155
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,781
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at the high school library.

156
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:25,086
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last page on the motion.

157
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just say, I suppose now the ICF recommendation is approved.

158
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mayor, I just wanted to say, I think this is a terrific thing for us to be doing.

159
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:38,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve Girls Hockey Merge-Up.

160
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval, Mr. Chairman.

161
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:41,172
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of approval.

162
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Mayor.

163
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:43,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. DiBenedetto.

164
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:48,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let the superintendent introduce it and talk about it and then I have a few questions.

165
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:48,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

166
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:57,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Essentially, girls hockey programs are not always fully occupied by any one community.

167
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:01,809
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, more and more communities are merging themselves to have

168
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,602
[SPEAKER_08]: two or three communities merge together.

169
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:09,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, in Malden, the boys hockey program is in a merger as well.

170
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:15,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Medford, our boys hockey program is strong, but our girls program comes and goes depending on interest.

171
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:27,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Secondly, for a number of years now, they've played or got special permission to get under high school age students to participate in order to have a full roster on the team.

172
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,752
[SPEAKER_08]: We think this is a way to preserve the program.

173
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:44,844
[SPEAKER_08]: and to ensure that our young people get that chance to play while at the same time making sure that we have enough players to field a competitive team and to ensure that no student is on the ice more than they should be during a regular game.

174
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:46,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Mayor.

175
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

176
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first I have a comment.

177
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that this application was dated November 25th.

178
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:03,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, it's stated here, it was created November 25th.

179
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:11,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see the application and I really, moving forward, I would love to see this come before us before an application is put forth.

180
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:12,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

181
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I only saw it at the time that I've got, I've seen it this week.

182
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's coming to you as soon as I saw it.

183
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:23,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they were exploring it as a possibility rather than remember this whole thing is still subject to your approval.

184
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:26,394
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't go forward unless you approve it.

185
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:38,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the other hand, it's just a comment that I'd like to see it happen in an appropriate fashion and appropriate timeline to come to us before they start an application unless it was something that they were going to miss out on.

186
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that's the exception, that's fine.

187
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But it can't be the rule.

188
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:43,175
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?

189
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:44,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my first thing.

190
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,918
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the cost of this program?

191
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,340
[SPEAKER_05]: How will Marlden pay for their pod?

192
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,663
[SPEAKER_05]: How will they pay for the insurance and the transportation fees?

193
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:59,128
[SPEAKER_05]: How many Meffitt High School students out of the 14 that tried out are high school students?

194
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,369
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of them are junior high?

195
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want some information about what's going on with the program.

196
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,389
[SPEAKER_08]: There are 14 Medford High School students, there are three students from Malden.

197
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Malden students will pay the user fee that Medford students typically pay at this point in time.

198
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:24,298
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as charging Malden, we haven't worked out those details at this point in time because it was something they didn't anticipate, but we will sit with them and talk with them because we do a lot of things.

199
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,700
[SPEAKER_08]: between districts that eventually work themselves out financially.

200
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Going forward, obviously, we would work out a more definitive share of the cost.

201
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:37,245
[SPEAKER_08]: But at this particular point in time, our concern is that the program go forward.

202
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:41,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, as far as underage students go, I believe there are at least three or four of them.

203
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:48,712
[SPEAKER_08]: who are not of high school age, or eighth graders who require MIA waiver approval.

204
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:51,715
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the amount of students that are usually on this team?

205
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:57,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, typically to support a team of this type, we really kind of need over 20 youngsters.

206
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,382
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point in time, with only 14, you really don't have enough if there's an injury or youngsters can't make it.

207
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have enough people on the ice.

208
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, hockey is not a sport where you skate the whole game.

209
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:15,547
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to come off, another line goes on, another defense goes on, a goalie gets hurt, you have to have someone in that role.

210
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:20,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So, 14 isn't really a good enough number to field a team for a whole season.

211
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:26,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And my question is, how much does this program cost on an annual basis?

212
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:30,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Depends on their full schedule and their thing, but it's well over $35,000 a year, possibly close to $40,000 a year.

213
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:42,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and what about our liability, having Malden students, I mean, is our insurance gonna cover them when we're transporting them?

214
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it gonna cover them when they're on the, I just wanna make sure we make informed decisions.

215
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:57,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love, I grew up as a hockey family, and so I love it, and I'm more than happy to provide this program to the girls.

216
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:02,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we need to do more outreach or something, but I just wanna make sure the school system's liability.

217
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:09,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Malden students will have their own insurance coverage, just like Mayfair students do in general.

218
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we are covered as a program.

219
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,750
[SPEAKER_08]: If we voted as a joint program, then we're covered.

220
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So liability only comes from gross negligence.

221
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:28,898
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to do something that was inappropriate, put somebody on the ice who shouldn't be on the ice, and they had a concussion and we continue to play them, there might be a situation that

222
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:33,698
[SPEAKER_08]: we could be liable for, but under normal circumstances, we're no more liable for them.

223
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are for any of our own players.

224
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to approve.

225
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if someone already did that.

226
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

227
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Falco.

228
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:43,382
[SPEAKER_07]: One quick question.

229
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:48,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have, so we approve this, do we have an option to opt out in a few years?

230
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:52,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say, all of a sudden we have 25 kids from effort that want to play.

231
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is a one year thing and we'll look at it going forward.

232
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

233
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:07,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of think it's sort of neat in a way just because it brings the two communities together as our, you know, arch rival on the football field at Thanksgiving.

234
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:13,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have the concerns of making sure and I'm glad it's going to be revisited yearly to see whether it works.

235
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:16,677
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I'm telling everybody we won the second half of the game.

236
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:20,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We did.

237
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:21,413
[SPEAKER_09]: We did.

238
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:22,474
[SPEAKER_09]: We did.

239
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's accurate information, Mr. Bell.

240
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,637
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, all in favor say aye.

241
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:27,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed, no.

242
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:27,477
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

243
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:28,478
[SPEAKER_09]: The recommendation is approved.

244
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:33,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on the status of the federal ESEA renewal.

245
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:44,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So on Wednesday, December 2nd, 2015, the Federal House of Representatives passed the Every Student Succeeds Act by an overwhelming majority of 359 in favor and 64 against.

246
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:54,439
[SPEAKER_08]: We expect the Senate to act on it if they haven't already acted on it today, sometime this week at the beginning of the week.

247
00:15:55,439 --> 00:16:01,023
[SPEAKER_08]: This new act will replace the very flawed and very unpopular No Child Left Behind legislation.

248
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:06,906
[SPEAKER_08]: This new version of the ESEA Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been years in the making.

249
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,688
[SPEAKER_08]: NCLB was passed 14 years ago.

250
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:12,850
[SPEAKER_08]: The original ESEA was crafted in the early 1980s.

251
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,732
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see how this process takes place.

252
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Essentially, the new legislation scales back the federal role and returns substantial authority to the states on the key issues of accountability, teacher evaluation, and school improvement.

253
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:35,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It maintains annual testing in reading, ELA, and mathematics in grades three to eight and once in high school.

254
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:40,877
[SPEAKER_08]: The act will still require that we disaggregate student subgroups and their performance.

255
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,602
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's greater flexibility in how we determine progress and appropriate intervention.

256
00:16:49,703 --> 00:16:53,764
[SPEAKER_08]: It encourages states to incorporate more than test data into the accountability system.

257
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:59,826
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an awful lot of detail in this act that will be needed to be worked out in the implementation phase.

258
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:04,268
[SPEAKER_08]: It remains to be seen how Massachusetts will use this new flexibility.

259
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:09,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we will all be seeking input on how Massachusetts moves forward.

260
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:17,359
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our hope that the evaluation of students, teachers, and schools will be more progressive and encompassing of the total school mission.

261
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:23,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Attached to this report is a detailed explanation of the many facets of the new act.

262
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:37,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I've asked you to read through the materials, and we'll schedule sessions going forward to talk about the various topics and also to reflect on information we received from DESE about how they intend to proceed under this new act.

263
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:44,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Overall, it's a significant improvement over NCLB, but like everything else, the devil will be in the actual implementation.

264
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be active in our voice at the state level.

265
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:53,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And therefore, we have to prepare well so we have an informed opinion when we're involved.

266
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of aspects to this.

267
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't my intent to discuss it all this evening, but to give you a chance to read it.

268
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:04,132
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to answer any specific questions you may have, should you have them this evening.

269
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:04,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chairman.

270
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:05,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scali.

271
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:11,336
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a few things that caught my eye, Roy, and I was hoping that you might shed some light on them, maybe help us out.

272
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:22,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Have we been able to receive any support, financial support for student support and academic grants, preschool, impact aid, homeless children, and

273
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:34,080
[SPEAKER_10]: construction, especially facilities management, where we have these new schools that are starting to come into their own, and they've been with us for a while, and there are certain things that have to be done.

274
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:34,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

275
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:42,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you know, the McKinley-Vento Act, and many of you will report in the near future, I'm glad it's the latest, McKinley-Vento is the Homeless Education Act.

276
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:46,050
[SPEAKER_08]: That money has come through the state, even though it's federal legislation.

277
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:50,714
[SPEAKER_08]: This act portends some larger role for the feds in providing money to the state.

278
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,472
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know that yet because it's all subject to appropriation.

279
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:00,933
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't appropriate it, it's only a possibility that they'll actually do it.

280
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:10,556
[SPEAKER_08]: When we talk about issues such as impact aid, impact aid typically comes when you have a federal facility on your local property.

281
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,516
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have much of that.

282
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So we typically don't get much of that impact aid in our facility.

283
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,178
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing an army base or

284
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:22,708
[SPEAKER_08]: some other kind of military facility on your thing you might get more impact aid.

285
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Construction aid, probably go to the poorer communities, not to us.

286
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:47,057
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll probably see some things as consolidations in Title I, consolidations in bilingual, ELL, some additional thinking about special education, how that's funded, possibly some funding in areas of innovative curriculum and technology.

287
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all subject to appropriation.

288
00:19:50,839 --> 00:20:00,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And until they really start appropriating money and start assigning it across the states, it's kind of hard to know whether we're going to see more than we're currently seeing or less than we're currently seeing.

289
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:02,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

290
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,248
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

291
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:05,608
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor say aye.

292
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

293
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:06,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

294
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,151
[SPEAKER_09]: The report is accepted and placed on file.

295
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:11,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, excuse me, is accepted.

296
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:13,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

297
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:20,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on desi board assessment decision and recommendation for spring 2016 Memphis Public Schools test selection.

298
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:30,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to make this report to discuss with you the choice that the Memphis School Committee needs to make by December 18th, by the way.

299
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got this from the state.

300
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:35,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

301
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:47,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the purpose of this report is to update you on the current status of student assessment from Massachusetts and to recommend your approval for the district's assessment system.

302
00:20:47,547 --> 00:21:05,094
[SPEAKER_06]: This coming spring, 2016, uh, as you know, for the past few years, it's been a lot of discussion about transitioning from the MCAS exam, which has been around since 1998 to a new test called park, uh, which is a test of the common core.

303
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:16,425
[SPEAKER_06]: In the spring of 2013, all students in school districts took MCAS, but also targeted districts took a park tryout, and that went on for two years.

304
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: MedFed participated in the tryout when that happened.

305
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, it was a different scenario.

306
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:27,873
[SPEAKER_06]: We were asked to choose between taking the new test park, which had not yet been voted on,

307
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,950
[SPEAKER_06]: for staying with MCAS.

308
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the committee's endorsement, we stayed with MCAS even though the state promised to hold districts harmless for their accountability levels if they took our

309
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:47,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But we figured that we didn't want to go into a new test unless we knew it was a definite thing.

310
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:50,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So we stayed with PARC, I'm sorry, stayed with MCAS.

311
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:53,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you know, the districts in the Commonwealth were split.

312
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much about half of them took PARC and half took MCAS.

313
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:05,015
[SPEAKER_06]: MCAS still remained statewide the test for grade 10 and also the test for science, okay, grades five, eight, and 10.

314
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,837
[SPEAKER_06]: For this particular year,

315
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:13,434
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being asked to decide again.

316
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Things have changed.

317
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:23,296
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, on November 17th, the Board of Education made an important decision that affects the future of state testing.

318
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:27,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And the key points of that decision are as follows.

319
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:39,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite the public negativity, and there's a lot of it about too much testing and too much high-stakes testing, the state is going to adhere to a mandated testing system for students.

320
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:43,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Massachusetts will not adopt PARC.

321
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that was part of the important vote.

322
00:22:47,478 --> 00:22:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're going to actually develop a new version of MCAS, MCAS 2.0, which is more PARC-like.

323
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to actually develop this new test.

324
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:01,043
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be developed

325
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:11,973
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the following year, operational in 2017, and the questions will be very different than what the questions are on the MCAS as it currently exists.

326
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dr. Cadelli is here tonight, as I finish up my portion of the report, to share with you some of the questions that are the old MCAS questions, the PARQ questions, and what the difference is between the two groups.

327
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,601
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so again, this year we have a choice.

328
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:34,143
[SPEAKER_06]: We can either stay with the old MCAS or go with PARCC.

329
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:51,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we feel the board's decision, it's really a compromise between basically going with PARCC, which had a lot of criticism against it, and yet developing a new test which is more resembling what students are being asked to do in the new frameworks.

330
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:57,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

331
00:23:57,206 --> 00:24:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we have a decision to make as a superintendent said, uh, by just another week or so.

332
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:10,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we need to choose between administering the old MCAS or administering the park.

333
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:14,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the MCAS tests will remain 2016.

334
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,683
[SPEAKER_06]: The traditional MCAS test will not be the new version because that is currently being developed.

335
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:25,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the past few weeks, since we heard the board's decision, we've been in discussions with our administrative staff,

336
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:31,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And based on our discussions, we feel that Medford should administer the park in the spring.

337
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:37,384
[SPEAKER_06]: to students in grades three through eight in English Language Arts and Mathematics.

338
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:50,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And our selection, our recommendation, is based on the fact that even though PARC will not be used in Massachusetts, the new questions in MCAS 2.0 will be PARC-like questions.

339
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:58,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we want to get our students used to it, because the following year, the new MCAS 2.0 test will be operational.

340
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: We feel if we administer PARCC this year, we'll help our teachers get used to the types of questions, the students to get used to the types of questions that they will eventually be asked to answer on MCASP 2.0.

341
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:25,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And please note that the regular MCASP still remains a test for grade 10, and there's no choice there, and also for the science exam, which is administered grades 5, 8, and then the different high school subject tests.

342
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:30,018
[SPEAKER_06]: December 1st, Commissioner Chester issued a memorandum.

343
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:41,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I've quoted part of what he said and he kind of re-endorsed rather what we were thinking about the rationale for going to PARCC this year, that it gets the students used to taking the test.

344
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:47,172
[SPEAKER_06]: The questions will be questions that they will be eventually asked on the new MCAS test.

345
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:55,519
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, we feel that we would use the paper pencil version of PARCC.

346
00:25:56,642 --> 00:26:03,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, we realize that a lot of the districts that took PARCC last year, they did have some glitches in their technology.

347
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,048
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure it's all worked out.

348
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:12,914
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that happened as I talked to communities that did PARCC is that the younger kids didn't really have the technological skills.

349
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:18,377
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't know that boxes would expand, and they thought that their answers had to be contained to a small box.

350
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:24,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So in talking with Mr. Trotta, we're going to revise the instructional technology curriculum at that level.

351
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:28,390
[SPEAKER_06]: to emphasize some of those skills that kids need to know.

352
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the kids didn't know how to click different boxes and things like that.

353
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:36,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of the problems that those districts had were kind of technical things with the younger kids.

354
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:43,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to work out those bugs before we go to an electronic version because we thought it was could be very frustrating to, to young children particularly.

355
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, again, uh, Dr. Riccadeli is here.

356
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,091
[SPEAKER_06]: She has some questions to share with you.

357
00:26:50,672 --> 00:27:01,440
[SPEAKER_06]: that will show you the difference in the types of questions between traditional old MCAS, the park, which will be the new MCAS 2.0.

358
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,662
[SPEAKER_06]: We really feel that park will now

359
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:14,131
[SPEAKER_06]: evolve as a consulting group to Massachusetts, that the questions they have in their test bank will be imported by Massachusetts for our MCAS 2.0.

360
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:28,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I also feel one of the other advantages of having our own 2.0 MCAS is that one of the concerns I had is if we had gone with PARC or the board had gone with PARC, only the common core portion of the frameworks would have been tested.

361
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:35,404
[SPEAKER_06]: With our new version of MCASP 2.0, as you know, the Massachusetts Frameworks contains more than the Common Core.

362
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:41,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be testing our own additional content that we put back into the frameworks.

363
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:46,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, Dr. Riccadeli will present it, and then we ask you to recommend.

364
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:58,361
[SPEAKER_06]: that you help us make that decision, endorse the decision to go with Park so we can move forward with our teachers, giving them sample questions to use with the kids over the next few months, getting them ready for the test.

365
00:27:58,722 --> 00:27:59,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So Bernadette, I'll turn it over to you.

366
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:01,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a point of information, Mr. Chairman.

367
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:02,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Scali.

368
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:16,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Nelson, do we have in place any type of prep program to work with kids that might show early on that they might be having a problem with this and how we can overcome their fears and get everybody on the same playing field?

369
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:26,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I can say is that the department directors have been sharing park-like questions with teachers over the course of the past year.

370
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:29,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So where this is, it's something new.

371
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:31,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not completely new.

372
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,961
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working on it.

373
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: working on the strategy.

374
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:56,176
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, the hope is that when students see these questions, it's not completely fresh, but we think that moving forward, having- Yeah, I was just concerned because if the state doesn't endorse it and we're going forward with something new, I want to make sure that we have all our ducks lined up and we have the proper tools that the children can get whatever help they need before taking the exam.

375
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:04,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and as you know, we do have MCAS preparation programs that will occur this winter and early spring.

376
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:14,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So the teachers will be incorporating the strategies that they need to incorporate to prepare the students for the park, if indeed that's what this body decides to move forward with.

377
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Beverly, for distributing the sample questions from park.

378
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:41,948
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information available on PARCC, and in fact, if you, I know not everyone has their sheet yet, so I won't go too far into this, but at the bottom of the sheet, there is a web address, the URL for PARCC, and if you go onto that website, you can pull up many different tests.

379
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pulled them all up.

380
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone through almost all of them for each one of the grade levels.

381
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really can get a good sense of the questions, and our teachers have been encouraged to go through these different tests and look at different test items.

382
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So for our purposes here tonight, this is just a short snapshot that you have an idea of the difference between the two tests.

383
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:13,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a sample from grade four mathematics, and then on the flip side, we have a sample from grade seven English language arts literacy.

384
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start with grade four mathematics.

385
00:30:18,728 --> 00:30:22,431
[SPEAKER_02]: In the left-hand column of that page, we have an example of an old test item.

386
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:27,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So this we can equate to a very common MCAS test item.

387
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:40,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the test item there is asking the students, after they've looked at this picture that has stars and hearts and ladybugs on it, what fraction of Justine's stickers are hearts?

388
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of the number in your fraction represents the whole set of stickers?

389
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:59,370
[SPEAKER_02]: The second question, using that visual, is draw and label a number line and mark an X on the number line to show the location of the fraction of Justine's stickers that are ladybugs.

390
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:08,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you look at this question, you can see that the focus is on the procedure, and it's counting in this case.

391
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:13,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also see that the students are not really engaging with the material, but they're answering the question.

392
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,672
[SPEAKER_02]: As we look to the right-hand column, we're going to look at a PARC test item.

393
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:24,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very usual in a PARC test item to see multiple parts.

394
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we have three parts, parts A, B, and C. You can see that there's a number line.

395
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So in part A, there is a question.

396
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:38,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the preface to the question is, Ava and Mia are comparing fractions 3 over 2 and 5 over 6.

397
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:47,461
[SPEAKER_02]: In part A, Ava created this number line to graph 3, 3 halves, 3 over 2.

398
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:53,564
[SPEAKER_02]: The student is asked to select the correct point on the number line to represent 3 over 2.

399
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:57,707
[SPEAKER_02]: This requires the students to convert it in order to put it on the number line.

400
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:02,261
[SPEAKER_02]: MIA created this number line to graph 5 over 6.

401
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:10,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, they need to be able to understand what 5 6th represents on this number line.

402
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to understand prior to doing that to convert 5 6th to 12th.

403
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: In part B, they're asking, the question is asking, is 3 halves greater or less than 5 sixths?

404
00:32:25,507 --> 00:32:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And the student is being asked to explain how they know.

405
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So reasoning is important.

406
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:37,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Part C, the student is asked to write a fraction that is in between 3 halves and 5 sixths.

407
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, they're being expected to be able to explain what they're doing.

408
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only do they need to understand procedure,

409
00:32:46,435 --> 00:33:01,923
[SPEAKER_02]: not only do they need to understand how to derive a correct answer, but rather, in addition, they're expected to understand how to reason through the problem and how to engage with it.

410
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:11,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's a sample of a typical test item in a math section of the mathematics test.

411
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:12,829
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it's grade four.

412
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it is just a sample, but I think it's representative of what we see in many of the tests.

413
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:26,508
[SPEAKER_02]: If you turn to the other side of the page, we have an example of grade 7 English language

414
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:30,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, grade seven.

415
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:39,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that the biggest difference in MCAS and PARCC is that PARCC really does focus on nonfiction.

416
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:46,825
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say that there is no nonfiction in MCAS, there is, but certainly to a much greater degree in PARCC.

417
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:53,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in the PARCC test items, students again are required to engage with the material.

418
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: They're reading, they're writing, and they're providing evidence.

419
00:33:57,512 --> 00:34:01,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the old test item, you can equate this to MCAS.

420
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:08,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So a typical writing prompt for a grade seven response could be the following.

421
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the movies is a major source of entertainment for many students.

422
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:16,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine the only discount movie theater in your area is closing.

423
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:23,950
[SPEAKER_02]: The students are being asked here to write a persuasive essay in support of keeping the discount movie theater open.

424
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:27,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not given a lot of information.

425
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: They're given this prompt.

426
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:31,590
[SPEAKER_02]: The expectation is that they've probably been to the movies.

427
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:37,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to use rationale to answer this question, but the evidence is limited.

428
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were to compare that to the PAR question, the writing prompt is the following.

429
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:49,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You have read a website entry and an article and viewed a video describing Amelia Earhart.

430
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:55,508
[SPEAKER_02]: All three include information that supports the claim that Earhart was a brave, courageous person.

431
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,191
[SPEAKER_02]: The three titles are the following.

432
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:03,256
[SPEAKER_02]: A biography of Amelia Earhart, Earhart's final resting place, believe found.

433
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:08,021
[SPEAKER_02]: and Amelia Earhart's life and disappearance, which in this case is a video.

434
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:16,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you, when it's a computer-based test, there is a possibility that some of the sources may be video sources.

435
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:18,930
[SPEAKER_02]: We're asking to go with a paper test.

436
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,151
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't have a video.

437
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:27,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Students here are being asked to consider the argument each author uses to demonstrate Earhart's bravery.

438
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being asked to write an essay that analyzes the strength of the arguments related to Erhard's bravery in at least two of the three supporting materials.

439
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember to use textual evidence to support your ideas.

440
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:46,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's not solely based on opinion, as we could see with the AMCAS question in this example.

441
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:55,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They are expected to use specific evidence from two of three of those samples, the one video and the two written samples.

442
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:03,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, just to highlight, just to give you a sample, certainly there are more resources out there.

443
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:08,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't think that going beyond this would be a great idea tonight.

444
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:13,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly would be happy to try to answer any questions that you may have.

445
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:21,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, and thank you for all the information that you brought this evening.

446
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:23,656
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things.

447
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:35,884
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, when you're saying that we're going to be doing it in paper and pencil, and if we go with PARC, how are we going to compare?

448
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:37,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there going to be any comparisons of scores?

449
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:49,997
[SPEAKER_13]: because I know that last year when we did the parks, there was park testing and there was park scores, but we really couldn't evaluate both because some people were on MCAS, some people were on park.

450
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:57,923
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we go to park, do our kids get the grades and the scaling and all that?

451
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:04,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to be exempt from whatever comes out on our stats, if that even makes sense?

452
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will answer that question.

453
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:10,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I may have to defer to Beverly on this.

454
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The individual score, well, first of all, the district will be held harmless.

455
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of our overall scores and our accountability, we are held harmless.

456
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:23,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of a district moving forward, there's a little risk.

457
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We think there's a lot more to learn.

458
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:30,323
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as individual student scores, Beverly, I'm not sure on that one.

459
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,953
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a great answer we've been given.

460
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:37,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we know that, and we saw this when they came out with the MCAS scores.

461
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have people doing two different things and you try to compare it, it's apples and oranges in my book, to be perfectly honest, they claim they can do it.

462
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They will do it.

463
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:52,159
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll give us some numbers, how much credibility you can put to those numbers.

464
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:53,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

465
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:58,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel that they really should have a period of time

466
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:10,090
[SPEAKER_06]: that everyone, the accountability, the student growth is held stable until you really get into a test, a definite test, which is MCAS 2.0.

467
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're doing all kinds of interesting things with numbers.

468
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:17,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the superintendent has been looking at it too, and he had an answer today about

469
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:27,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the districts that took PARCC and the MCAS, the districts that took MCAS were definitely rated at a disadvantage than those that took PARCC in the rating system they used.

470
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So, will they do it?

471
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:29,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

472
00:38:29,982 --> 00:38:30,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it fair?

473
00:38:30,723 --> 00:38:31,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it credible?

474
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:32,524
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

475
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:34,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in my way of thinking.

476
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,014
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I said it many years ago when we started this.

477
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:55,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I've said it at MCAS, I've said it at the Massachusetts Association, and I've actually said it holding my seat at the Department of Education.

478
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:56,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is,

479
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew this was going to happen.

480
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:09,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they said you could have MCAS, they said you could have PARCC, now they turned around, oh no, PARCC's not going to work, so we'll make up another name, but we're really taking the PARCC test.

481
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if they think we're really that foolish.

482
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,240
[SPEAKER_13]: or what they're thinking.

483
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:20,005
[SPEAKER_13]: But the fact remains is that we all are going to be taking a park test, we're just calling it a different name.

484
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,867
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically the bottom line.

485
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:35,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And they had parents going to meetings, and I am, I'm very upset with the Department of Education, because I feel at this point, they've taken like, they think they've taken everybody for fools, but they haven't.

486
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:44,960
[SPEAKER_13]: asking parents what their opinions are, asking administrators what their opinions are, myself going around the state trying to figure out who wants to take PARCC and who doesn't want to take PARCC.

487
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And now it seems like, oh, well, we listened to you.

488
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:53,227
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to do the PARCC anymore, but we won't do the MCAS.

489
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,928
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just call it something else.

490
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:59,632
[SPEAKER_13]: But now we're sitting here, and we're actually looking at examples of a PARCC test.

491
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:02,335
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not looking at examples of an MCAS test.

492
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:11,823
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, for me, is like a slap in the face from the Department of Education to everyone who's put extremely hard work into this.

493
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, you know, we have to go forward.

494
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:15,466
[SPEAKER_13]: We have no choice.

495
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:17,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And we all know that.

496
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:21,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make it very clear that I know that we're not all fools.

497
00:40:22,112 --> 00:40:36,459
[SPEAKER_13]: And my concern is taking this test, is they're going to be playing with all these numbers like they did the last time around, because all of a sudden the numbers of MCAS weren't up to par as the PARC grading was.

498
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,441
[SPEAKER_13]: And my concern now is where do we stand?

499
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:51,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't want to sit here and all of a sudden hear next year that because we took PARC and the other districts are going to be forced to do the same thing, is that all of a sudden our students now have gone

500
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:57,353
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess that's really the bottom line, is my concern of the kids aren't going to be performing worse.

501
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Department of Education that's playing with our numbers that are going to make us look worse.

502
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:17,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The only difference between I can project between last year and this year is that I think you're going to see most districts taking part.

503
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:23,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year was based on what the commission has come out with and what people see is happening down the road.

504
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:25,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right.

505
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:26,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, you know,

506
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to have more.

507
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:38,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt there'll be many districts taking MCAS this year because they'll say that we're going to the new test anyways.

508
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:40,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's our purpose.

509
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:41,929
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't like all this score stuff.

510
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:42,749
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't think it's fair.

511
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:43,950
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

512
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: You owe it to the kids to get them ready for the types of questions.

513
00:41:47,471 --> 00:42:00,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite honestly, the types of questions Park has performed, or MCAS 2.0 also, has these performance-based, we all know performance-based assessment, really gives a kid a fair shot at demonstrating what he or she truly knows.

514
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,060
[SPEAKER_06]: MCAS sometimes was a guessing game, the way the test was constructed.

515
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've worked with these tests, MCAS, since it started.

516
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:20,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we know that, so for example, as Bernadette pointed out, some of the open-ended questions, I remember there was one writing prompt one year that asked students to, what would you do on a snow day?

517
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,728
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite thing to do on a snow day?

518
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:26,910
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were students who came from other countries who had never seen snow.

519
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, they didn't perform very well on that prompt because they had no idea.

520
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:37,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think PARCC takes that element away, that subjectivity.

521
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:42,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a stronger basis for assessment, but the way they're going about it

522
00:42:43,153 --> 00:42:48,396
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, half can do this and half can do that, and we're going to measure apples and oranges is the wrong way to go about it.

523
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:57,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's, I guess the frustration part for me is that part, that part of, okay, there are going to be a lot more, and I totally agree with that.

524
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there's going to be a lot more districts taking the path.

525
00:43:00,842 --> 00:43:05,245
[SPEAKER_13]: My concern is, are they going to keep us level for at least a year?

526
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:18,255
[SPEAKER_13]: to make sure that the test has been implemented the proper way, that everyone gets the fair and right opportunity to take this, and then assess this the following year, rather than throwing out these numbers next year.

527
00:43:18,275 --> 00:43:25,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Because my concern is that if we're sitting here, and somehow they're going to try to figure out, you know, we have to compare it to something.

528
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:26,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, last year we took MCAS.

529
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:32,287
[SPEAKER_13]: If we take the PARCC this year, and they try to compare those two scores,

530
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:46,915
[SPEAKER_13]: as you said, they're going to be apples and oranges, but I don't want to sit here and feel that our kids have really come a long way and they've reached goals and in, you know, their own individual scores and their individual goals.

531
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:53,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And then all of a sudden, like Parky that comes out that we look like we haven't done anything and these kids have failed.

532
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,723
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess to the superintendent, let me just put it this way.

533
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:01,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

534
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,674
[SPEAKER_08]: You've had several reports on this.

535
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:08,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And we told you what was going to happen several months ago.

536
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:15,463
[SPEAKER_08]: We told you that the new test was going to be Park and MCAS closed.

537
00:44:15,483 --> 00:44:16,844
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to find a compromise.

538
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:18,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And they went ahead and did it.

539
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:26,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the political winds of war were such that there were people that were against MCAS.

540
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,012
[SPEAKER_08]: There were people against Park.

541
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,135
[SPEAKER_08]: The new chairman of the board, the governor,

542
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:37,662
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to go back to MCAS, but the business community wanted them to go to PARC.

543
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:46,889
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pioneer Institute wanted to go back to the old frameworks, but the business community and others wanted to go, and the college and university group wanted to go to PARC.

544
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:52,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was a way, and they also didn't want to give up their control to any other state.

545
00:44:52,894 --> 00:44:54,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what PARC has morphed in?

546
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,996
[SPEAKER_08]: PARC is now a consulting company.

547
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:58,078
[SPEAKER_08]: They're no longer just producing the test.

548
00:44:58,298 --> 00:45:01,180
[SPEAKER_08]: They're now selling test items, okay?

549
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:08,674
[SPEAKER_08]: and Massachusetts is going to adopt park items and move them into MCAS 2.0.

550
00:45:10,194 --> 00:45:19,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Our responsibility right now is to ensure that our students get every opportunity to learn what types of questions they're going to see going forward.

551
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And our teachers get as much practice as they can get.

552
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:24,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Accountability will be held harmless.

553
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:26,637
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the draw.

554
00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:29,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the

555
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:32,063
[SPEAKER_08]: the races slowed down.

556
00:45:32,803 --> 00:45:41,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue for us now is giving our people the experience with the types of questions they are going to be asked to take in the future.

557
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:49,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's a long way to go with regard to whether mandated testing or too much testing is still going to be argued across the state.

558
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:58,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know, and I can tell you this now, we know that Park scores were much lower than Epcot scores in this round.

559
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:06,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know that they were given a boost on what the department calls equity percentile, to give the Park scores an advantage.

560
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:12,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for our purposes, we need to do what prepares our students for the future.

561
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:21,154
[SPEAKER_08]: The political discussion about testing in Massachusetts, I just told you about the ESEA, which is going to leave a lot of responsibility to the states.

562
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:23,720
[SPEAKER_08]: to make up their own mind.

563
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,981
[SPEAKER_08]: All that stuff is going to be worked out.

564
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:35,468
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the short term, our students deserve and our teachers deserve an opportunity to learn as much as they can about the types of questions that are going to be asked going forward.

565
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:45,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the political discussion about too much testing, no testing, mandated testing, how tests are used, is going to be front and center in the commonwealth.

566
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I didn't really, I wasn't me getting into the political thing.

567
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:55,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I was more concerned with the fact of how they are going to grade our kids, and how the accountability is going to be there.

568
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:58,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't want to get penalized.

569
00:46:58,209 --> 00:46:58,769
[SPEAKER_08]: We're held harmless.

570
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We're held harmless.

571
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so, all right, that's all I need.

572
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:08,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that the kids do not get, and the schools, and the district does not get penalized because they've decided to change it.

573
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:11,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think that if we would stay with MCAS, we would get penalized.

574
00:47:12,175 --> 00:47:15,317
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I actually believe, because I believe the push is to get us together.

575
00:47:15,337 --> 00:47:16,838
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Debetta Detto.

576
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:17,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

577
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:26,165
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I want to express that I, too, like my colleague, agree that they did what they wanted to do, Ann Marie.

578
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:30,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And they took all of those questions, and they just put it under a new title.

579
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:36,152
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only difference is that we did get the Massachusetts framework questions also included in there.

580
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:38,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So that helps the students in Massachusetts.

581
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:40,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the only piece different.

582
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: than just doing the park that I can see.

583
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:52,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And after speaking to all my colleagues, you know, that I work in a different school district, and we all feel the same way.

584
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:56,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just their way of getting park in place in all of our schools.

585
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:05,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did win a little victory by getting our frameworks also included and not just the Common Core, which I think is a win for Massachusetts.

586
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the first thing.

587
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:12,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as accountability goes, we're not accountable this year, which is good.

588
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:16,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also the carrot dangling in front of us.

589
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you do what we want you to do, which is take back, we won't hold you accountable.

590
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've given us a free ride.

591
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:26,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't like it when they did it last year, and I spoke about it then.

592
00:48:27,123 --> 00:48:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually said, unless people stand up against them, they're going to keep doing that.

593
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:35,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't like that bribery piece, and that's how I look at it.

594
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's any other way to describe it.

595
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:38,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I just call it the way it is.

596
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any cost difference by doing this to the district?

597
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the state of Massachusetts pays, what, $37 million on testing on an annual basis?

598
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:54,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, what could we do with that money to educate the children in this commonwealth?

599
00:48:54,683 --> 00:49:01,805
[SPEAKER_05]: if we weren't spending $37 million every year just to test these students.

600
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, we would have nice books.

601
00:49:03,646 --> 00:49:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have foreign language in our middle schools full time.

602
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:16,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I could think of 100 things off the top of my head that we as a school district could do if we could get our hands on that money.

603
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,431
[SPEAKER_05]: $37 million.

604
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:19,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never forget it.

605
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my brain forever.

606
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:23,793
[SPEAKER_05]: $37 million, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

607
00:49:24,113 --> 00:49:26,875
[SPEAKER_05]: pays each year just to give a test to our students.

608
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:34,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing how we spend money and how it doesn't get to the children's education, it goes to their evaluation.

609
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And kids that miss it by two points don't get a high school diploma.

610
00:49:38,992 --> 00:49:39,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It kills me.

611
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:40,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It bothers me.

612
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:43,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the right way to judge children.

613
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just, I'm sorry, I get off on a soapbox.

614
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:55,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's no cost difference, and there's no accountability, and we're going to park anyway, I vote to give the children, and I hate saying this,

615
00:49:57,189 --> 00:50:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: the park tests and I motion to approve and would go with the superintendent's recommendation, even though I was huge, huge opponent of it last year, Mr. Superintendent on that motion.

616
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:28,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I liken this to a shell game, and I agree with my colleagues, because, you see, I think Mr. Chester must be laughing all the way, oh, we don't want, they don't want the park, okay, so we'll call it MCAS 2.0, and, you know,

617
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:38,227
[SPEAKER_00]: The big question is, what money were they getting before, was PARC getting before, and what money are they getting now?

618
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:41,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of figure that it's probably they're doing just as well.

619
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate tricky questions.

620
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:53,199
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the math question, when you look at the math question, that's a tricky question, because obviously if a student looks at it, they're going to see two different lengths and lines, so you can fall for it.

621
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to be educating our children is not to fall for a tricky question.

622
00:50:58,984 --> 00:51:01,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So which goes beyond just understanding the math.

623
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:02,306
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes beyond that.

624
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:04,587
[SPEAKER_00]: It means don't fall for a tricky question.

625
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:19,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll spend a lot of time now teaching them how to answer these questions rather than, I think, doing what our real mission in education should be, is educating a child.

626
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:24,417
[SPEAKER_00]: about and fostering a level of learning and not just simply preparing them for a test.

627
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:28,342
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not to say that, of course, these are things that students need to know.

628
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:29,463
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to know fractions.

629
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:32,247
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to know how to compare fractions, et cetera, et cetera.

630
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,149
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a way to do that with

631
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,171
[SPEAKER_00]: out, making it a tricky question.

632
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:54,387
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I think, no choice, because, by the way, if I want to make a prediction, I'm going to predict that the school districts who did park last year are going to magically do better the second time around than the school districts who are doing them for the first time.

633
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:56,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark my words, guys, that's the way it's going to be.

634
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,210
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no choice.

635
00:51:58,751 --> 00:51:59,552
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do this.

636
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:02,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chairman.

637
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Scali.

638
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a point of information through you to Ms.

639
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:06,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Riccardelli and Mrs. Nelson.

640
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:09,533
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the classroom teachers saying about this mix?

641
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Have they voiced concerns?

642
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:14,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they for or against it?

643
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:19,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have concerns that we should really look into to try to incorporate into the testing methods?

644
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:28,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, as I said at my opening, the directors have been working with the teachers on the test items, just in the event that something like this happened.

645
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,792
[SPEAKER_02]: The teachers don't know that it's happening, definitely.

646
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:34,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll know after your vote.

647
00:52:35,675 --> 00:52:37,156
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew that it was a possibility.

648
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:41,079
[SPEAKER_02]: just anecdotal feedback.

649
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them, you know, feel like you do, that, you know, we were, you know, we are pawns in a game and they feel duped.

650
00:52:49,882 --> 00:52:58,244
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have heard, but I think they understand the reality of we need to move forward, we need to do what's best for our students and what is best for the district.

651
00:52:58,285 --> 00:52:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's mixed.

652
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:08,508
[SPEAKER_10]: After this conflagration takes place, if you could get some comments, both positive and negative on how this might change, how we might

653
00:53:09,308 --> 00:53:15,452
[SPEAKER_10]: force upon our legislatures to talk to the Department of Education, try to put everybody in the same playing field.

654
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you come back after the tests and give us some type of reaction?

655
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:26,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, too, I think the main thing with teachers, as we agree, is that there's too much testing.

656
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:32,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time you take away time for testing, you're taking away time from instruction.

657
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very common feeling.

658
00:53:34,451 --> 00:53:41,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether it's Park or MCAS or whatever it is, it's the time piece that I think teaches really a concern and rightfully so.

659
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:54,104
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here in unison to work with the directors and the teachers to develop a program that's, you know, suitable to our kids and, you know, it takes a little bit of stress off them at the test times.

660
00:53:54,846 --> 00:53:58,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd appreciate any feedback in the spring that you may provide us.

661
00:53:58,508 --> 00:54:09,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Belkin, I think another factor, if you read the ESEA material that I gave you a little bit earlier, you'll find that the feds are now saying that the state should take into account other factors than tests.

662
00:54:11,035 --> 00:54:12,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's starting to trickle down from the top.

663
00:54:13,736 --> 00:54:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really what we've all been talking about.

664
00:54:16,638 --> 00:54:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that this testing, testing has its role.

665
00:54:18,979 --> 00:54:20,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, we've all taken tests in our life.

666
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the amount.

667
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:25,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the intensity that they've put on it.

668
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:30,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the way they've used test results to judge students and schools.

669
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:38,373
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at the distribution of who does well and who doesn't well, you could look at a socioeconomic map of Massachusetts and of the country.

670
00:54:39,254 --> 00:54:40,054
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that simple.

671
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:43,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not quite one-to-one, but it's very close.

672
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:49,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can use testing to give you an indicator of what a youngster is doing and how schools are doing.

673
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,353
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not the only indicator.

674
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I've used this example before with you, but I'll try it again.

675
00:54:56,177 --> 00:55:07,469
[SPEAKER_08]: John Goodlatte, who was perhaps one of the most interesting and most outstanding scholars of education in the 1980s and 90s, wrote a book called Place Called School.

676
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:23,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And when he was talking about the SAT, the over-dependence on the SAT at the time, he said, a single test score tells you as much about a student's knowledge as a temperature or a thermometer tells you about a person's health.

677
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:27,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You get an indication, but you don't get the whole picture.

678
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:29,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we've got to understand.

679
00:55:30,546 --> 00:55:37,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Different youngsters come to school with a lot less cultural enrichment, a lot less language than other youngsters.

680
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:39,898
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot less stimulation.

681
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:41,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And other youngsters come with a lot of it.

682
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is very predictive of what takes place.

683
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,180
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the only predictive factor.

684
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly instruction is important.

685
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly the quality of what we do is important.

686
00:55:51,322 --> 00:56:03,047
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a tremendous disadvantage to some communities who work with youngsters who come and don't speak English, who have a lot of cognitive disabilities, or come from homes which don't have the enrichment.

687
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:05,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's how we use it.

688
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:15,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how we work with testing that makes the difference, and whether we overuse it as a way to make judgments about whether schools or individuals are ready for the future.

689
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:16,654
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really the issue.

690
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,315
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got to prepare our kids.

691
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:23,239
[SPEAKER_08]: If this is the regimen that we're going to face, and we're teachers, then we have to work on it.

692
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We anticipated this, by the way.

693
00:56:25,821 --> 00:56:29,103
[SPEAKER_08]: We very much knew that this was going to happen, and we've done it.

694
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:33,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Heard that, I believe Diane and all the department heads.

695
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:40,381
[SPEAKER_08]: However, now we've got to actually take the action step to send the message, this is where we're going.

696
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,883
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, all those in favor say aye.

697
00:56:45,144 --> 00:56:45,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

698
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:46,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed, no.

699
00:56:46,124 --> 00:56:47,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation is approved.

700
00:56:49,186 --> 00:56:51,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Financial report, Mr. Superintendent.

701
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:56,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Members of the committee, I call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat.

702
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,142
[SPEAKER_08]: to give us our financial report.

703
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:04,990
[SPEAKER_08]: This evening, I've also passed out some additional information to enhance what you know about that.

704
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:06,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And Pat will take you through it.

705
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:32,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

706
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:38,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Attached, please find the summary financial report as of December 2nd.

707
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:43,777
[SPEAKER_03]: As of the writing of this report, the general fund budget is 32.11% expended.

708
00:57:44,537 --> 00:57:52,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten-month biweekly employees have received seven checks since September 2nd, while our 12-month employees have received 11 paychecks since July 1.

709
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:57,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, six teachers are on maternity leave, with two others pending.

710
00:57:57,944 --> 00:58:02,127
[SPEAKER_03]: We currently have a few replacement paraprofessional positions still in the process of hiring.

711
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:04,439
[SPEAKER_03]: professional development.

712
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:10,241
[SPEAKER_03]: November 3rd was a professional development day for the district for teachers, paraprofessionals, and kindergarten aides.

713
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:17,425
[SPEAKER_03]: MPS also provided a half day for professional development for the district secretaries and administrative assistants.

714
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda included a WB Mason presentation, purchase order overview by Louise Miller, city procurement,

715
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:36,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Google and Gmail overview presented by Cassandra Trotta, Microsoft Mail Merge, email protocol, changes in payroll, student activity, lost textbooks, and attendance processes.

716
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:38,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolving funds.

717
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:44,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Attached please find a report listing all NPS revolving funds and a short synopsis of what the fund is for.

718
00:58:45,516 --> 00:58:53,299
[SPEAKER_03]: In your original packet, you had the information and there is a short synopsis on the front explaining

719
00:58:54,118 --> 00:58:55,279
[SPEAKER_03]: the revolving funds to you.

720
00:58:55,859 --> 00:59:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, tonight, you've been given 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and the supporting transactions.

721
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:09,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ask that you look at those for your transactions, but look at the synopsis for the review of the funds.

722
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll take questions in a few minutes from you.

723
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:17,462
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is for accounts that are related to direct school operations.

724
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:21,866
[SPEAKER_03]: The second listing reflects community-based facilities that are managed by the school.

725
00:59:22,586 --> 00:59:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It is MPS's intent to renew the rental contract with the Japanese Language School for a three-year period at $100,000 per year, effective FY16, which is a $10,000 increase annually.

726
00:59:34,957 --> 00:59:40,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Supporting the NOPCs is a beginning and ending balance for each fund with a breakdown of deposits, revenue, and expenditures.

727
00:59:41,824 --> 00:59:47,078
[SPEAKER_03]: MPS's revolving funds are considered generated revenue and reflected in the FY16 budget plan.

728
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:55,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Security, MPS is benefiting from Aventasia's American alarm pricing and replacing eight key cameras.

729
00:59:55,645 --> 01:00:01,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We were thinking that it would only be three with a couple of cameras, but the bidding process has worked in our favor.

730
01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:07,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Resumes are under consideration for the MHS MVTH building monitor positions.

731
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:13,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Pricing has been secured for identifiable jackets, polo shirts, and hats for the building monitor positions.

732
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:20,125
[SPEAKER_03]: The Raptor Technologies Identification System purchase order has been sent to the vendor and we are awaiting a delivery date.

733
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:25,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we heard from the vendor and they are ready to begin the process of implementation.

734
01:00:26,234 --> 01:00:26,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Telephones.

735
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: The high school telephone conversion has begun.

736
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:33,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The list of current telephones has been forwarded to the DSCI Contel.

737
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:40,664
[SPEAKER_03]: The company is working with individuals at the high school, school departments, to configure and install the new telephone system.

738
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:44,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Initial expectations were to be up and running by the end of December.

739
01:00:44,846 --> 01:00:53,090
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the MHS building will probably take until the middle of January to fully complete due to the complexity and the age of the building.

740
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:58,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Transportation, current routes are posted on the NPS webpage.

741
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Routes are running on time and we are ready for winter.

742
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:07,122
[SPEAKER_03]: NPS has 230 bus stops that have been reported to the city of Medford DPW for winter plowing.

743
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Discussion is still ongoing with the DCR regarding the reinstatement of the Foulsway Crossing Guard.

744
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:15,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Last communication was December 2nd.

745
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:23,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The DCR has requested more information regarding numbers of crossing at the Foulsway and Myrtle, which is our choice for the crossing guard location.

746
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We decide on that with Eastern.

747
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Updates will be provided when new information is available.

748
01:01:30,009 --> 01:01:38,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Pricing and details are in process for the addition of a Wednesday middle school late bus run, thus providing late runs Tuesday through Thursday after the winter break.

749
01:01:39,732 --> 01:01:46,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Additional safety training has been initiated by Eastern Bus Company and will continue for all drivers over and above their mandatory monthly meetings.

750
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:52,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Unemployment, FY15 expense for July 2014 through October 31, 2014 was $40,700.

751
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:54,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the same time period, FY16, NPS expense has been $28,790 roughly.

752
01:02:04,844 --> 01:02:08,006
[SPEAKER_03]: We have spent 29% less this time of year as compared to last year.

753
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:14,429
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of our unemployment expense generally occurs in the first quarter of each year attributable to summer unemployment claims.

754
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,931
[SPEAKER_03]: The total expended in FY 15 for unemployment was $77,660.

755
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:18,792
[SPEAKER_03]: MPS has budgeted $75,000 for FY 16 expenses.

756
01:02:18,812 --> 01:02:19,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Utilities.

757
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Electricity costs for the period of July through October are $355,489.

758
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:33,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year's expenditures for July through October were $275,806, resulting in increased spending of $76,683.

759
01:02:45,259 --> 01:02:47,240
[SPEAKER_03]: or 22% increase for the same time period.

760
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:53,304
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been no change in the cost of kilowatt hours as NPS is under contract through November 2016.

761
01:02:53,864 --> 01:03:05,390
[SPEAKER_03]: The electricity cost increase can be attributed to the warmer summer and fall, which resulted in prolonged use of air conditioning and the operation of the pool that was opened July through October this year.

762
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, the pool began operations in September.

763
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:12,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Heating expenses are down due to the unseasonably warm fall.

764
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:18,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Natural gas costs for the period of July through October were $8,574.

765
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year's expenditures for July through October were $39,212, resulting in 78% decreased spending.

766
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:40,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It is too early in the heating season to qualify this heating trend, and the city and MPS does not have a natural gas contract in place, as prices are low and trends do not reflect a high rate of added users, thus keeping the rates low.

767
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Rates are monitored by the school and city departments.

768
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:52,767
[SPEAKER_03]: All buildings will be monitored closely for usage as NPS begins a process to conserve electricity and natural gas by identifying possible areas for potential savings.

769
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:59,329
[SPEAKER_03]: In closing, each year involves new financial challenges, but FY16 is progressing as planned.

770
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:01,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take questions.

771
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Belco.

772
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:05,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

773
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:06,551
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, thank you for your report.

774
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:08,472
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of quick questions.

775
01:04:09,438 --> 01:04:19,506
[SPEAKER_07]: With regard to the transportation segment, you had mentioned about the crossing guard that hopefully will be provided by the DCR.

776
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:34,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've gone back and forth on this a number of times, but the stop that we're listing here is Myrtle and the Felsway, which from our talks early on, it's St.

777
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:38,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis and the Felsway is the issue, Fulton Street, which is

778
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:41,740
[SPEAKER_07]: really not close to Myrtle.

779
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe I thought at one point there was already a crossing guard down in that location.

780
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:51,885
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, so I guess my question to this, do we have any cross crossing guards on the Fellsway?

781
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:57,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess, where are we with regard to this crossing guard at St.

782
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:59,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis and Fulton Street, the Fellsway, that area there?

783
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:03,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what happened initially is that's where the bulk of the students were crossing because St.

784
01:05:03,831 --> 01:05:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis was open.

785
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:06,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the guard was.

786
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:11,374
[SPEAKER_03]: After the school closed, the children kind of dispersed along Fells Way.

787
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:16,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been doing studies to see where the children are getting on in the most used stops.

788
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:18,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And Myrtle is a very busy stop.

789
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, is there a crossing guard down through that section?

790
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:22,740
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not.

791
01:05:25,474 --> 01:05:29,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And the DCR is very understaffed at this point because of the retirements.

792
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a long process to get any responses.

793
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:38,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have taken a survey of all the stops on the Fellsway and we've sent them back that information.

794
01:05:38,656 --> 01:05:39,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you say that last part again?

795
01:05:39,997 --> 01:05:41,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We sent them back the information from the survey.

796
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:42,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to hear from them.

797
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:49,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as the stops go then, how many kids are getting off at that stop at Myrtle and the Fells White?

798
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:50,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know?

799
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:54,704
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 14 middle schoolers and high schoolers using that stop, which is the greatest use.

800
01:05:54,744 --> 01:06:02,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But our expectation is that once a crossing guard is reinstated, we think that we will see more children go to where the crossing guard is.

801
01:06:03,048 --> 01:06:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to pick the spot that seemed to be the best and the most used right now.

802
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:26,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about, so if you go from Salem Street to the Fellows Way, Salem Street to Fulton Street, which is a pretty significant stretch, I mean, I would imagine you have an abundance of kids there that get off, that live anywhere up in the Fulton Heights area and down towards the Salem Street area.

803
01:06:27,003 --> 01:06:31,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is there any consideration that's being made for those children?

804
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:33,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, especially, I mean, I would think,

805
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:36,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it can be tough for anyone to cross.

806
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:42,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I cross there every day and I'm 45 years old and it can be an issue on some days.

807
01:06:42,763 --> 01:06:45,165
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm looking at kids that are in elementary school.

808
01:06:45,686 --> 01:06:46,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's a major concern.

809
01:06:46,947 --> 01:06:48,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've got a call from a few parents that

810
01:06:49,467 --> 01:07:01,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, really, I mean, there's some concerns there that, I mean, crossing there is a major issue and, you know, it'd be nice to have some sort of coverage between that Salem Street and Fulton Street, you know, stretch.

811
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:02,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now there's nothing.

812
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:03,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

813
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we did for the elementary kids this year is we rooted the buses such that they only get on and off the right side.

814
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:13,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how we kind of kept that onto a safe pattern.

815
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:16,095
[SPEAKER_03]: But the middle school and high schoolers are crossing the road.

816
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:21,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So the elementary schools are, when they get off the bus, they're staying on the side that they get off the bus.

817
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:22,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They strictly stay on the side.

818
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:27,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that the routes are established, I'm trying to think of the one.

819
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not real familiar.

820
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Felsway and Irving.

821
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Felsway and Irving is in Westminster.

822
01:07:32,372 --> 01:07:33,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Irving and Westminster.

823
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's placed at Irving, I'm thinking of.

824
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:36,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

825
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:40,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we did was we moved the stops a little bit further apart.

826
01:07:40,714 --> 01:07:45,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we put all the kids on the one side and the other children on the other side purposely so there was no crossing.

827
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:50,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Mr. Mayor.

828
01:07:51,046 --> 01:07:52,228
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a crosswalk.

829
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:55,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one is it?

830
01:07:56,956 --> 01:07:57,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Felsway and Fourth Street.

831
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:00,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it DCR or City?

832
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:01,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

833
01:08:01,643 --> 01:08:02,745
[SPEAKER_03]: DCR or City?

834
01:08:03,588 --> 01:08:04,488
[SPEAKER_13]: that I don't.

835
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:04,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Fourth?

836
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:06,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Fourth and Felsworth.

837
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:06,750
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

838
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:07,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look into it.

839
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:12,512
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been there for a very long time and we definitely need her there, but.

840
01:08:12,892 --> 01:08:14,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is close to Myrtle.

841
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:15,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

842
01:08:15,354 --> 01:08:17,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the one closer to Myrtle.

843
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:20,596
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's about a, it's about a block and a half.

844
01:08:20,756 --> 01:08:27,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, Myrtle's over the hill actually, but Myrtle is closer to that than it is to the St.

845
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis one that they were talking about.

846
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look into it.

847
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing I'll have to figure out is whether or not it's a city crossing guard or if it's a DCR crossing guard.

848
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:34,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will look into it.

849
01:08:38,705 --> 01:08:39,765
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Jim Benedetto.

850
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:41,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Matt.

851
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:42,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Pat.

852
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: You do great work trying to get this together.

853
01:08:45,307 --> 01:08:49,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the bureaucracy with DCR and trying to get a whole room right now.

854
01:08:49,268 --> 01:08:50,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really difficult.

855
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate all the work.

856
01:08:51,889 --> 01:08:59,211
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we can't get a Felsway, I mean a DCR crossing guide, can we put a MAPFIC crossing guide there?

857
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:00,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we do that?

858
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:02,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not their jurisdiction.

859
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:02,972
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a state road.

860
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:04,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to move over the state road.

861
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:07,293
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to walk back from the intersection to the Felsway.

862
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:09,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Schiappelli.

863
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:11,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's been difficult.

864
01:09:11,874 --> 01:09:18,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the director of the commissioner of DCR just resigned, I believe, a few weeks ago.

865
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:22,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know your job must be very difficult right now.

866
01:09:22,356 --> 01:09:30,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a liaison that they have right now working with that our legislators can maybe push that along?

867
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:32,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's daunting, believe me.

868
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:33,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dealing with it right now.

869
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of the departments have been hit hard by the retirements.

870
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So she is responsive, it just takes her a little while.

871
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:42,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Christine, I can send you her information.

872
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, if you can, then maybe that'll help.

873
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:50,874
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that we were trying to deal with the commissioner and she decided it was way too tough for her, so.

874
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:52,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in there today.

875
01:09:53,877 --> 01:09:56,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, through that early incentive retirement program.

876
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: They get killed.

877
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:01,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not allowed to put anyone back.

878
01:10:01,549 --> 01:10:07,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not only with the crossing guards, but it's in a number of different areas.

879
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:12,195
[SPEAKER_09]: It's difficult.

880
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:21,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there's rumblings talking about maybe doing another incentive because they didn't get enough the last time, which will only make the situation worse.

881
01:10:24,822 --> 01:10:25,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mayor?

882
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:28,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question about utilities.

883
01:10:31,653 --> 01:10:42,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this, my question was that it seems like there's quite an increase, and you mentioned that it's partly because of the warmer weather, but also that the pool was open two additional months.

884
01:10:43,436 --> 01:10:51,319
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of the increase does that, if it was a 76.6 thousand increase, how much does the pool

885
01:10:52,614 --> 01:10:53,275
[SPEAKER_00]: account for?

886
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,538
[SPEAKER_03]: We unfortunately did not meter the pool separately from the rest of the building.

887
01:10:58,059 --> 01:10:59,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very difficult to discern that.

888
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,182
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent asked me the same question.

889
01:11:02,623 --> 01:11:02,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

890
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:05,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just because it is, you know, 76,000 is significant.

891
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:09,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I see that it's offset a little bit by the savings so far.

892
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:13,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it definitely is a concern given that there was no price increase.

893
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:18,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Scali.

894
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:26,821
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're on the subject of utilities, would it be possible to conduct an energy review with the three middle schools, especially the cafeteriums and gyms?

895
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:29,908
[SPEAKER_10]: See if we could change the lighting to possibly save some monies there.

896
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:34,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, Alicia Hunt was just through the building and met with John McLaughlin.

897
01:11:35,412 --> 01:11:38,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have an opportunity that we're contemplating.

898
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:43,197
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't put all the information together yet to bring it to you, and we want to bring it to the superintendent first.

899
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:46,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And it regards energy conservation.

900
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:55,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it possible to seek a grant, or would we have to initially lay out the capital to get the lights changed?

901
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:57,814
[SPEAKER_10]: recover monies over the next two or three years.

902
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:02,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia Hunt is looking into that opportunity for us and we work very closely with her.

903
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:10,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we looked into this because I know we're doing it now with our parks and rink especially.

904
01:12:11,438 --> 01:12:12,838
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing so much.

905
01:12:12,858 --> 01:12:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so expensive now for what the energy is asking it.

906
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:20,542
[SPEAKER_01]: at the rinks and lighting facilities.

907
01:12:21,763 --> 01:12:31,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we looked into, I know that with the incentives with solar power, we've talked about they have solar farms, but what we're having in our department,

908
01:12:35,178 --> 01:12:40,842
[SPEAKER_01]: a group come in and discuss putting the way the parking lot is in a rink.

909
01:12:41,603 --> 01:12:51,310
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be, there'll be bays and above the bays, there'll be bars with solar powered units that would help feed the rink.

910
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone discussed?

911
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:56,053
[SPEAKER_09]: We're presently working with a company by the name of blue wave.

912
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:58,835
[SPEAKER_09]: We are coming in to do an evaluation.

913
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:04,184
[SPEAKER_09]: signed an agreement, I'm going to say two or three weeks ago.

914
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:09,045
[SPEAKER_09]: An evaluation on everything they can provide, what the cost will be.

915
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:15,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we'll have that firm until sometime after the first of the year.

916
01:13:16,066 --> 01:13:18,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they actually, they will fund it.

917
01:13:18,086 --> 01:13:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll put the capital up.

918
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:23,067
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll buy the electricity back from them at a cheaper rate.

919
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:26,448
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll make money themselves.

920
01:13:26,908 --> 01:13:27,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

921
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:28,208
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

922
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:31,337
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a few steps away.

923
01:13:31,357 --> 01:13:39,440
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have all the players together to work it to make sure that we're going.

924
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a few questions.

925
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to transportation.

926
01:13:42,621 --> 01:13:44,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we adding a bus at the middle school?

927
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:45,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

928
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:49,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we adding a bus additional day at the middle school?

929
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:51,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to add a Wednesday late run.

930
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:53,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just got the pricing for that.

931
01:13:53,602 --> 01:13:55,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in here because it came after this.

932
01:13:55,943 --> 01:13:59,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be $130, three buses times $130.

933
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:03,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be roughly $7,800 for the rest of the year.

934
01:14:03,408 --> 01:14:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm assuming we have enough need for after school homework help and time with teachers to warrant that additional bus.

935
01:14:12,474 --> 01:14:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really glad that that's taking place.

936
01:14:15,608 --> 01:14:16,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for doing that.

937
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:17,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

938
01:14:18,089 --> 01:14:18,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for doing that.

939
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first one.

940
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:27,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the increase in the cost of the rent for the Japanese school is an increase of a flat $10,000.

941
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:37,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Did someone, I'm sure, but could you make sure that we charging them enough for the increase in the utilities that they're utilizing?

942
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they, do they use the pool?

943
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:40,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

944
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:50,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and the cost of the electricity was very high, so are we increasing it enough to warrant the usage of all those rooms?

945
01:14:50,898 --> 01:14:56,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an appropriate amount of an increase, or is it just a $10,000?

946
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a very good increase for the amount that they use.

947
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:05,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And the profitability of that particular situation is very good.

948
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:06,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

949
01:15:06,174 --> 01:15:18,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure what maintenance and custodial staff and utilities that, you know, the costs that it costs us, we're still, we're still making the same profit margin.

950
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:23,661
[SPEAKER_09]: There's discussions that come up periodically about rentals.

951
01:15:23,721 --> 01:15:25,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We should rent, we shouldn't rent the schools.

952
01:15:25,962 --> 01:15:35,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the superintendent's done a great job in the agreements that he has with people, but you can't place the burden of our increases all on,

953
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:46,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you have a number of them, as we do, then if it gets to accumulate, it can offset a lot of those costs.

954
01:15:47,245 --> 01:15:50,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we negotiating rentals throughout the district?

955
01:15:50,507 --> 01:15:52,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are we renting our buildings for?

956
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:53,990
[SPEAKER_05]: What are our gymnasiums getting?

957
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the kind of information I'd really like to see some kind of breakdown about.

958
01:15:58,882 --> 01:16:03,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Our goal will be right after the first of the year to sit down and have a larger discussion on that.

959
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:09,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that topic has come up and it's very complicated because there are a lot of different situations.

960
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:14,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, we serve a lot of community activities.

961
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:17,734
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly value those activities for

962
01:16:18,683 --> 01:16:21,344
[SPEAKER_08]: the services they provide to our young people and to our families.

963
01:16:22,264 --> 01:16:28,067
[SPEAKER_08]: They may be in some instances lost leaders while others provide us revenue that offsets them.

964
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:38,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a balancing act to make sure that we don't deprive our young people of the programs and activities that they want since some of these programs and activities can't generate enough funds.

965
01:16:38,991 --> 01:16:46,094
[SPEAKER_08]: But we try and balance it against other programs that can provide the funds so that in the aggregate we make up.

966
01:16:46,713 --> 01:16:53,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that we're consistent and fair throughout the community on every area of the community.

967
01:16:54,398 --> 01:16:58,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Like one area doesn't pay more for one gym than another area might pay.

968
01:16:58,461 --> 01:17:05,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see a breakdown of who's renting it on a regular basis, what their fees are, whether it's, you know what I mean?

969
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: We have asked for that.

970
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,068
[SPEAKER_08]: We've actually begun working on that.

971
01:17:10,328 --> 01:17:13,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's much more complicated because there are so many different activities.

972
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are done by the buildings themselves.

973
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:15,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

974
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:17,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of the PTOs and other things they run.

975
01:17:17,604 --> 01:17:18,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are done by us.

976
01:17:19,486 --> 01:17:22,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to get a handle on, you know, the differences that exist.

977
01:17:23,429 --> 01:17:27,874
[SPEAKER_08]: But overall, overall, with the major renters, we make up.

978
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:36,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that, but I'd like to know what's happening in each building, how they're utilizing it, who's there at extra time, what they're being charged.

979
01:17:36,575 --> 01:17:38,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know, I want to have that picture.

980
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:44,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a lot, and I'm not asking for it for today or even close to today.

981
01:17:44,277 --> 01:17:57,720
[SPEAKER_05]: But before the end of March, I think, is a significant amount of time to gather that information from each school, get a list of what every activity is at that building, because we're liable for any of those activities happening in our buildings.

982
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:01,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as a committee member, it's important for me to know what's going on.

983
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm requesting that again.

984
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And if Paulette wants to add to that, that's great.

985
01:18:06,823 --> 01:18:08,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I go on with my next question.

986
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:19,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that I just want to remind you that it's already been requested to Erin, because earlier this fall, I very specifically went and spoke and asked for the same information.

987
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:24,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the superintendent is saying that he would get to us at the beginning of next year.

988
01:18:25,132 --> 01:18:26,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly don't want it to wait until March.

989
01:18:27,393 --> 01:18:30,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but I want to have a meeting regarding it and know everything.

990
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:31,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we asked for that.

991
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,736
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll schedule it early.

992
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:34,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

993
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:35,098
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be terrific.

994
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:35,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

995
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:39,921
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for now.

996
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:41,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Pat.

997
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:43,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I appreciate this extra data.

998
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:45,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're going to go over that next.

999
01:18:46,826 --> 01:18:48,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to let you ask questions.

1000
01:18:49,148 --> 01:18:49,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1001
01:18:50,589 --> 01:18:52,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you go over it and then I'll ask you.

1002
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:54,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did.

1003
01:18:54,652 --> 01:18:55,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1004
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:58,356
[SPEAKER_09]: You have questions?

1005
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:00,037
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a lot of information.

1006
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:00,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

1007
01:19:01,098 --> 01:19:03,260
[SPEAKER_08]: We can read it.

1008
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Let everybody read it, Pat, and we'll come back if anyone has questions.

1009
01:19:06,062 --> 01:19:08,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to accept the financial report and place it on file, Mr. Chairman.

1010
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:10,506
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, Mr. Skerry.

1011
01:19:11,298 --> 01:19:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor say aye.

1012
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:12,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed no.

1013
01:19:12,459 --> 01:19:13,220
[SPEAKER_09]: The ayes have it.

1014
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Chairman, before we go to the last item.

1015
01:19:14,762 --> 01:19:17,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we go to the last item, are we going to suspension of the rules?

1016
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:21,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, through you to the superintendent.

1017
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:26,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent, when are we going to set up a meeting on safety and protocol?

1018
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:31,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to follow up to the last meeting, we didn't want that to die in committee.

1019
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:40,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Right after the first of the year, we'll have the police chief and all of us get together in the hall, and then we'll carry that forward into a larger meeting.

1020
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:41,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a date in mind?

1021
01:19:42,086 --> 01:19:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, but we've talked to the police department, and we've gone over a whole series of things with other activities.

1022
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:50,530
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we'll be ready right after the first year to talk about it.

1023
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Before January 30th?

1024
01:19:52,231 --> 01:19:52,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1025
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:53,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great, thank you.

1026
01:19:54,532 --> 01:19:55,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1027
01:19:55,772 --> 01:20:00,253
[SPEAKER_09]: 9, report on the snow and climate weather emergency school cancellation protocol.

1028
01:20:00,293 --> 01:20:01,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1029
01:20:01,113 --> 01:20:10,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, I think we know that sometimes it snows in Massachusetts, and last year was probably a very, very bad year, one of the worst years we've had.

1030
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:12,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Although some years we've had no snow at all.

1031
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:22,477
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's important to go over this, and hopefully there's some people listening to us this evening, and if not, we're putting it out there to them, because there's a lot of variables in this.

1032
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:27,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important that people understand why we do what we do and how it works.

1033
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:37,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we head into the winter season, we have a comprehensive notification system to parents, students, and community should conditions require the closing of schools.

1034
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Experience tells us the number of school closing can vary from year to year.

1035
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:47,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, we closed schools seven times, but there have been years when no days were canceled for inclement weather.

1036
01:20:48,987 --> 01:20:53,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The decision to close schools results from a process that evaluates multiple factors.

1037
01:20:54,111 --> 01:20:57,454
[SPEAKER_08]: The paramount consideration is student faculty and staff safety.

1038
01:20:58,215 --> 01:21:04,120
[SPEAKER_08]: We must consider not only the storm conditions, but also our ability to clean school areas, streets, sidewalks.

1039
01:21:05,117 --> 01:21:09,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have to consult the weather service, our DPW, and public safety officials.

1040
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:17,987
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have to determine whether or not on that particular day we're going to have sufficient faculty who no longer all live in Medford or one community away.

1041
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:19,728
[SPEAKER_08]: These people come from distances now.

1042
01:21:20,129 --> 01:21:24,392
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the teachers aren't there and can't make it in, it's a wasted day.

1043
01:21:26,033 --> 01:21:31,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So we speak with colleagues in neighboring school districts, and we talk to our transportation providers as well.

1044
01:21:32,657 --> 01:21:36,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, we have to conduct 180 days of school to meet DESE requirements.

1045
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:40,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And waivers are not frequently given by the state.

1046
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,605
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they are very rarely given.

1047
01:21:42,326 --> 01:21:49,112
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, our calendar gives us 11 days to work with, much more than the past, as compared to normal eight days.

1048
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:56,719
[SPEAKER_08]: By contrast with the MTA, by contracts with the MTA, we must complete the school year by June 30th.

1049
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:02,536
[SPEAKER_08]: We're mindful that when school is canceled, that it can be a hardship for working parents.

1050
01:22:03,177 --> 01:22:12,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, it is very, very important, I have to stress this, I'm going to keep banging this out, that parents and guardians begin planning for coverage now in anticipation of closings.

1051
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:16,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't wait for the day that it snows to decide who's going to cover my kid.

1052
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:28,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Start thinking about how you can work with your neighbors, with other people, with grandparents, to cover those situations, or to talk to your employers about accommodations that can be made when those things happen.

1053
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:34,259
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also aware that a significant number of students that schools provide safety, warmth, and nutrition.

1054
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:42,842
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of latch kids out there, latchkey kids out there, in communities across the state whose parents have to go to work and the kid's home.

1055
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:44,434
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dangerous.

1056
01:22:44,755 --> 01:22:47,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we don't like to call a school unless we absolutely have to.

1057
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:49,758
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want kids in that situation.

1058
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:55,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We always try to provide the earliest possible notification to families and staff as possible.

1059
01:22:55,801 --> 01:23:02,125
[SPEAKER_08]: However, many times storms intensify and conditions are unpredictable and change throughout the night and early morning.

1060
01:23:02,926 --> 01:23:07,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Our preference is to let people know the night before, but in any case, no later than 6 a.m.

1061
01:23:09,091 --> 01:23:11,232
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not favor delayed openings.

1062
01:23:11,272 --> 01:23:12,713
[SPEAKER_08]: People ask me about that all the time.

1063
01:23:13,253 --> 01:23:17,115
[SPEAKER_08]: As they impact bus schedules and generally result in less productive days.

1064
01:23:17,595 --> 01:23:22,918
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only imagine when kids come in at 9, 30, 10 o'clock and everyone's talking about the weather.

1065
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,159
[SPEAKER_08]: It isn't really a day at school.

1066
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:27,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty hard to get people back and focused.

1067
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:34,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So why risk the safety factor just to get people in and mess up things and bus routes get all goofed up.

1068
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:37,945
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't think it's a great way to go.

1069
01:23:40,269 --> 01:23:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: We do make provisions for unpenalized student arrivals, late student arrivals.

1070
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:50,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So if a student does get in a little bit late, and we know that it's a situation, we work with them.

1071
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,403
[SPEAKER_08]: When school is canceled, families will be informed through multiple media.

1072
01:23:56,218 --> 01:24:02,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Notifications will be posted on both television listings and websites of channels 4, 5, 7, Fox, and NASA.

1073
01:24:03,543 --> 01:24:05,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Closings will also appear on the school website.

1074
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:10,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And robocalls will go out to homes, either from the principal or the central office.

1075
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:21,036
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be busy disseminating this information this month, hopefully so that people understand why we do what we do, where they can find out the information.

1076
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:24,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully they'll begin to make plans, should they need,

1077
01:24:26,423 --> 01:24:30,046
[SPEAKER_08]: to close school and still go to work or do something else.

1078
01:24:30,586 --> 01:24:33,749
[SPEAKER_08]: One other pitch that I want to make, it's very important.

1079
01:24:33,809 --> 01:24:38,773
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked to our bus companies, talked to the DBW about clearing areas around bus stops.

1080
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:47,481
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's very important that residents do everything they can to shovel sidewalks and to make things passable so that youngsters are not walking in the street.

1081
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:50,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tough in some roads.

1082
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:52,762
[SPEAKER_08]: If we get major accumulations, the banks get high.

1083
01:24:52,782 --> 01:24:56,244
[SPEAKER_08]: For little kids this high off the ground, it's hard to see.

1084
01:24:56,644 --> 01:25:13,589
[SPEAKER_08]: So another thing we ask people to do is buddy up, do things that, you know, have an older child walk with a younger child, or have parents accompany people to bus stops, and do the kinds of things that take the extra amount of precaution necessary to avoid an unfortunate situation.

1085
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:18,048
[SPEAKER_08]: which may be beyond anyone's control except the individuals who are involved.

1086
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:23,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's our information on snow closings or climate weather closings.

1087
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:31,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to take any questions or any suggestions anyone has of anything else we can do to make it more effective going forward.

1088
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:34,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chairman, move the paper, place on file.

1089
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:43,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the superintendent's comments and hopefully we can do a better job of educating our parents to stop all of this.

1090
01:25:43,484 --> 01:25:46,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to just give you one update because obviously

1091
01:25:47,485 --> 01:25:54,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down to less than a month, but I'm still working hard to get everything done that is an issue or has been an issue in the area.

1092
01:25:55,348 --> 01:26:05,011
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you go around the city, you'll see at the Brooks School, if they have not already gone in, they'd be flashing lights with radars.

1093
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:05,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they in?

1094
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:07,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen them yet.

1095
01:26:07,572 --> 01:26:08,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1096
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:14,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And also on Elm Street by Wright's Pawn, because where the entrance of Wright's is very dangerous as people come.

1097
01:26:15,181 --> 01:26:19,603
[SPEAKER_09]: around the corner, so we're trying to alert drivers in both of those areas that have been an issue for a while.

1098
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:29,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The second speed bump, first one went down in Central Ave, second one should be on Harvard Street sometime either this week or next week.

1099
01:26:30,589 --> 01:26:32,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Crosswalks, which are a big concern.

1100
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:33,410
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a

1101
01:26:33,886 --> 01:26:38,908
[SPEAKER_09]: A group of residents that have put together a list of, I think it is 70, 80, 90 crosswalks.

1102
01:26:39,308 --> 01:26:45,291
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got all the signage that will point to the crosswalk and advise people that there is a crosswalk coming.

1103
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:53,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the speed bumps?

1104
01:26:53,735 --> 01:26:56,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And justice today, a welcome to Memphis signs.

1105
01:26:57,496 --> 01:27:00,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I've been trying to do for about 15 years, but we finally got a grant from Tufts.

1106
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:05,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Four of them went up today near the borders of the community, and another four are going up.

1107
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:10,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I was in DCR today, trying to get permission to put signs on their property.

1108
01:27:10,952 --> 01:27:17,133
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't allow it, then we'll have to find other locations to do it, just so people know it's a very welcoming community.

1109
01:27:17,773 --> 01:27:20,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And we enjoy their business here, and we enjoy them visiting here.

1110
01:27:21,794 --> 01:27:22,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a little update.

1111
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:23,514
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

1112
01:27:24,434 --> 01:27:28,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came from money from Tufts, money from Chapter 90, money from another sources that we're able to.

1113
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I put it all together.

1114
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,761
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, Mr. Scarpelli, we go to executive session.

1115

[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll probably return after the executive session for the updates and reports, recommendations for collective bargaining units with all units updates, reports and recommendations on non-union personnel and their negotiations too.
