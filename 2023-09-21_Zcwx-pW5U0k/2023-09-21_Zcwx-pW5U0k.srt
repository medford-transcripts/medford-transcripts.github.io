7
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:36,429

8
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in the case of an emergency, we want to make sure that

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,604
[SPEAKER_01]: all residents feel welcome and supported and know where they can come to if they have any questions or concerns or need any support.
