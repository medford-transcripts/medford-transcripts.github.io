    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=90.351s">Hanley</a>  Wells, 26 Curtis Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=97.26s">So</a>  committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on the issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=107.404s">Last</a>  week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=112.586s">I</a>  have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=121.93s">No</a>  court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=126.192s">Furthermore,</a>  Mr. Bellison has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=132.136s">They</a>  enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Bellison's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=141.583s">He</a>  indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=154.585s">A</a>  temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=162.791s">This</a>  is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=163.692s">I'm</a>  here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=172.579s">This</a>  was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=178.652s">I</a>  know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=186.095s">These</a>  parents will or would have worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=194.778s">If</a>  there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=202.496s">Medford</a>  needs to be an option so that they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=205.958s">It</a>  would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room, or anyone outside this room, if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=214.263s">It</a>  is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=221.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=224.149s">Superintendent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=227.351s">So,</a>  on the 6th of September, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=231.469s">for</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=232.89s">Knowles</a>  went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=243.278s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=243.498s">The</a>  request was for a court order for school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=248.963s">There's</a>  a piece of paper, which I'll provide to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=253.066s">Enroll</a>  to the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=254.387s">It's</a>  a second thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=255.708s">And</a>  it was denied again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=259.243s">I</a>  don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=274.855s">But</a>  more importantly, I was able to get consent from <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=282.677s">to</a>  enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=289.62s">And</a>  he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover public schools as they were in the past.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=295.644s">They're</a>  enrolled in Medford as well prior to barring enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=298.425s">Well,</a>  more than attending. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=299.605s">They're</a>  attending the North Andover public schools and not out of school.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=303.828s">They</a>  are out today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=306.726s">We're</a>  not going to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=308.848s">My</a>  answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public School.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=311.731s">That</a>  needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=313.653s">Mr.</a>  Belkin has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=315.695s">The</a>  parents have to work out their arrangement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=318.558s">We</a>  are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=321.681s">They</a>  have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=326.125s">That's</a>  what the court has told them repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=328.647s">work</a>  it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=329.808s">If</a>  they work it out, and Medford is the choice, then they will be enrolled, registered, and students in the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=337.373s">But</a>  right now, the concern was, are they getting an education? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=340.855s">They're</a>  in the North Andover public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=343.077s">And</a>  Principal Landry has confirmed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=346.481s">I'm</a>  comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=349.584s">By</a>  the way, this has been going on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=352.267s">This</a>  isn't something that only came about in the last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=355.45s">This</a>  has been going on for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=359.153s">And</a>  so they've got to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=361.836s">Maybe</a>  having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=366.721s">But</a>  from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=371.465s">We've</a>  consulted with our legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=374.548s">We've</a>  gone over this matter multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=376.569s">We've</a>  spoken to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=378.311s">They're</a>  in the North Andover public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=380.292s">If</a>  the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=385.456s">That's</a>  the way to move on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=388.058s">And</a>  if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=391.541s">How</a>  can it be Medford when you said no? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=393.603s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=393.843s">Wells.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=394.764s">Doctor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=395.404s">Dr.</a>  Wells. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=396.085s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=396.405s">If</a>  you'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=400.977s">How</a>  can they work it out if you're barring enrollment? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=404.219s">You're</a>  leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents, and you favored the other party in saying, go to North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=411.184s">Didn't</a>  do anything.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=413.086s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=413.626s">You</a>  barred enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=414.647s">I</a>  have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=419.711s">From</a>  our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=429.115s">to</a>  enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=432.616s">If</a>  we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=442.797s">Now,</a>  as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=445.558s">We</a>  consulted with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=447.218s">If</a>  the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=451.879s">But</a>  the state actually asked us, and I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=458.865s">because</a>  the parents couldn't come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=461.686s">We</a>  declined to do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=463.326s">The</a>  case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=468.047s">We</a>  are not in agreement with North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=472.309s">It</a>  needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=475.89s">They</a>  would have gone to Medford today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=479.358s">So</a>  we would have had an objection from the other side as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=482.341s">Yes,</a>  but that's not yours.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=484.303s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=484.563s">So</a>  it's not our issue to argue with you one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=486.745s">Get</a>  together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=487.987s">Solve</a>  the issue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=488.787s">Just</a>  say yes, Mr. Belson.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=489.308s">And</a>  whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=491.41s">We</a>  will if you say yes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=492.951s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=493.212s">It's</a>  not me to say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=495.174s">It's</a>  for you to solve it with the court.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=497.496s">We</a>  can't if you say no.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=499.778s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=501.28s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=501.72s">Because</a>  the court wants you to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=504.029s">If</a>  I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=507.67s">The</a>  court denied it again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=509.831s">Dismissed</a>  the case, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=511.452s">If</a>  you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=522.876s">We</a>  have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=524.936s">Could</a>  you please step forward?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=536.753s">Mayor</a>  and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=545.876s">I'm</a>  in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=565.419s">uh,</a>  which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=571.544s">Uh,</a>  the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=589.077s">Uh,</a>  she had requested, uh, that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=596.194s">The</a>  court ordered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=598.695s">The</a>  court made a decision on September 6, 2017, and denied the request.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=609.379s">Denied</a>  without prejudice the determination of the merits.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=613.041s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=614.141s">So</a>  the request for temporary relief <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=619.144s">filed</a>  by the plaintiff in this matter was denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=628.226s">From</a>  my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=642.27s">The</a>  first one, I believe, was to request an order <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=648.945s">that</a>  they be enrolled in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=651.186s">So</a>  a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=658.388s">Knowles,</a>  and it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=676.247s">until</a>  either a trial on the merits or any other further rulings of the court.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=682.989s">Can</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=685.29s">At</a>  any point during the probate and future court hearings throughout the course of separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=700.074s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=700.614s">I</a>  don't believe so, but I don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=703.615s">There</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=706.013s">So</a>  this did go to trial, Mayor, and the determination of the trial that was in March was for the parents to decide and to go to mediation, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=714.518s">And</a>  as you can see by the motion for the hearing, they were unable to come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=718.601s">And</a>  again, like I said, I know these parents well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=720.482s">They</a>  will and would work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=723.144s">It</a>  was an even playing field and there was no forced <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=729.233s">forced</a>  decision to go to a district that is not an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=734.716s">But</a>  from March through September, they weren't able to reach a decision on their own, which is why they're asking the court to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=744.581s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=745.402s">And</a>  the court is not going to touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=746.562s">So</a>  I don't know why Mr. Belson feels that he is above a judge in making a decision on where they should go.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=754.646s">Mayor,</a>  I just <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=756.918s">I</a>  think Mr. Belson has stated that he would welcome the enrollment of these children once this matter is resolved in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=768.442s">Specifically,</a>  in May of 2017, the motion was, the request was to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=782.708s">That</a>  was brought in May of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=786.628s">Judge</a>  Ordonez denied that motion that specifically requested that the children be enrolled in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=795.891s">That</a>  was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=798.452s">There</a>  was an additional motion filed on and ruled on again this September, which denied the relief sought by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=810.016s">Knowles.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=811.376s">So</a>  until there is a trial on the merits, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=816.97s">or</a>  any other rulings by the court, I would recommend that these children not be enrolled in Medford until further order of the court.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=829.574s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. Greenspan, the court has made it clear they are not going to make a decision on school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=837.636s">There's</a>  not going to be a trial. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=840.917s">They're</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=843.257s">They're</a>  not ordering a district.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=847.182s">The</a>  parent in North Andover, is she willing to unenroll them in North Andover to enroll them here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=853.126s">They</a>  will work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=853.807s">If</a>  she was unwilling to drive, she was unwilling to drive to Medford to bring them to school today because of the distance and her unwillingness to move and do other, we've offered private school, we've offered in the middle, we've offered to do the transporting and meet in the middle, we've offered many accommodations to her and all she wants is to have them in her district, not have to drive, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=874.862s">and</a>  to not be accountable to anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=877.147s">So</a>  she's not really willing to compromise, but if Medford was an option, I assure you, there would be an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=886.541s">They</a>  worked the things out in their own way, and if both schools were an option, I am, she would probably not want to drive to Medford to pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=895.204s">Five</a>  days a week, because they're with us five days a week.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=898.525s">So</a>  please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=908.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=909.369s">It</a>  would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=912.15s">The</a>  superintendent wouldn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=914.21s">there</a>  would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=915.791s">So</a>  clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=922.455s">And</a>  we are not okay with North Andover, but North Andover didn't say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=925.477s">The</a>  only reason they're North Andover is because they didn't say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=927.799s">So</a>  we're not agreeing with North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=929.84s">But</a>  they were in North Andover last year, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=932.702s">No,</a>  kindergarten, she was in pre-kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=934.923s">In</a>  North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=936.745s">So</a>  pre-k she was in Wilmington, and Avery attended kindergarten at Atkinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=943.268s">Temporarily</a>  until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=950.571s">Let</a>  me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in Medford the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North Andover and <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=961.568s">The</a>  judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=968.97s">I'm</a>  not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=974.571s">They're</a>  in school.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=977.752s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=979.632s">I</a>  had a similar question to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=983.133s">So</a>  my own question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=987.46s">If</a>  someone had not petitioned for a specific district, then both parents would be on even still. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=995.663s">But</a>  because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1001.965s">If</a>  the other parent had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1008.727s">But</a>  that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1011.508s">where,</a>  like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1017.87s">It</a>  was, can we have a court order?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1019.771s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1020.251s">They</a>  said, parents decide, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1023.572s">Parents</a>  decide where to send their kids all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1027.093s">And</a>  if you don't want to be involved with all due respect, just please unbar their enrollment so that we can work this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1034.655s">I</a>  assure you, it will be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1036.316s">Whether</a>  it's North End or Medford, we will let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1038.196s">But</a>  this needs to be a yes.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.288s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1042.448s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1044.511s">First</a>  of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1049.412s">I'm</a>  reading from the documentation that you just provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1052.893s">Okay,</a>  and I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1066.176s">Yes,</a>  they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1067.136s">But</a>  on the other hand, I'm reading this and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1073.377s">in</a>  proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1077.141s">We</a>  did.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1077.661s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1078.582s">And</a>  it's currently in certain places. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1080.825s">One</a>  of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1085.129s">However,</a>  it does say that the parent who is in North Andover, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1091.39s">Refuses</a>  to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there So two days a week no, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us That's on the documentation so what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know we want to we want to <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1110.283s">Understand</a>  where you're coming from but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford Then the parents would come to an agreement <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1122.065s">But</a>  here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1131.151s">So</a>  you have to understand that they have a history of going through the courts for a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1137.455s">The</a>  court, their file is very thick. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1139.797s">And</a>  they aren't going to resolve things in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1142.258s">They</a>  resolve things in their own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1143.459s">I've</a>  been a witness to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1148.043s">It</a>  works for them eventually, but you can't decide for them that it's going to be Northendover because you've given her a lot of freedom and now she's going to go and file for having custody during the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1161.542s">And</a>  right now we have them five days.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1163.623s">But</a>  it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities and towns that the other parent is willing to move to, including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield, and Redding, which is much closer than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1176.668s">And</a>  again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not going to move out of there, or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1185.591s">So</a>  that's, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1187.792s">It's</a>  confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1198.958s">So</a>  right now, there's no reason for her to work with us because there's a note from Medford, so why should she have to give on anything?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1205.082s">But</a>  you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading or Wakefield or Reading.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1208.664s">We</a>  don't live there.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1209.665s">No,</a>  but what I'm saying is that, I'm just going by what you're saying, and that is that even if we opened up Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1215.809s">According</a>  to the documentation that you have given us from the court <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1219.813s">that</a>  you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1227.576s">I'm</a>  reading it from the documentation that you provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1230.237s">So</a>  if there's any other, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1232.978s">The</a>  court, that's the motion.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1234.498s">That's</a>  the motion, right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1235.599s">That</a>  was just, we've, demonstrating that we've made many offers to move to the same district together, private school, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1243.101s">We've</a>  made options. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1244.142s">Right,</a>  and they've refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1245.382s">Right,</a>  so now we're just Medford versus North Andover right now.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1248.602s">So</a>  let me ask this, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1252.423s">Because</a>  we're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1259.306s">Lisa</a>  Greenberg is your attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1261.626s">She's</a>  filed the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1263.367s">If</a>  she thought that we didn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1267.538s">a</a>  solid position, she'd be in our face. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1270.019s">But</a>  she's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1270.999s">You're</a>  coming here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1271.799s">She</a>  costs $300 an hour, sir.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1273.62s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1275.3s">She's</a>  the legal representative for you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1277.18s">Mia,</a>  I'm calling you because you're not taking our calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1280.141s">I'm</a>  not calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1280.601s">You're</a>  saying sue us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1281.921s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1282.422s">You're</a>  saying if she sued us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1284.042s">Well,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1284.922s">Look,</a>  if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1290.523s">But</a>  I called the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1294.104s">And</a>  I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1297.545s">They</a>  went over it and quite frankly They're sustained our position so if believe me if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled the Department of Elementary and secondary education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my Opportunity to do so believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1314.454s">They</a>  would not let me do we've been in through this many times with with desi if there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1322.458s">Even</a>  if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1328.962s">So</a>  the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1334.928s">With</a>  all due respect, there is no immigration, there's no... I know, but what I'm saying is... No, no, no.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1338.951s">You're</a>  saying DESE tends to lean on the way of the child.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1341.533s">So</a>  DESE, we closed a follow-up on them, and they said, we closed it because you informed them they were enrolled and everybody's happy with North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1347.437s">Well,</a>  I did that today because I got a note from Greg Landry, who's the principal at Atkinson, says they're enrolled.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1353.901s">But</a>  that doesn't mean we agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1355.643s">You</a>  spoke to DESE last week as well.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1357.164s">Right,</a>  I spoke to DESE today, too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1360.186s">What</a>  about us? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1361.026s">What</a>  about our disagreement with North Vandenberg? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1362.567s">What</a>  about the fact that the kids would be commuting five days a week back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1365.79s">The</a>  fact that they didn't go to school today because their parent didn't pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1368.832s">An</a>  unreliable parent didn't pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1371.054s">What</a>  is your responsibility to us?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1374.951s">I've</a>  got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1379.735s">It</a>  can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1384.039s">It's</a>  got to be a decision made by a third party. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1387.782s">And</a>  I'll be happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1388.983s">We</a>  would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go-ahead, but we don't.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.569s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1395.749s">Van</a>  der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1402.137s">The</a>  one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1409.385s">So</a>  it's a 50-50 schedule, but as you can see from the email right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1413.048s">because</a>  she asked.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1414.668s">I</a>  think she's asking for something legal from the court system that talks about custody, not an email chain. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1419.589s">That's</a>  going to be here until December.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1421.089s">That's</a>  going to be here until December. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1422.23s">She's</a>  petitioning to try to get them.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1423.95s">The</a>  one you have in place right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1425.93s">We</a>  have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1429.671s">So</a>  a 50-50 schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1430.931s">However,</a>  she does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1432.031s">She</a>  switched her work schedule, so she works weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1434.952s">The</a>  children are now with us on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1438.952s">And</a>  many more until they're picked up.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1442.433s">So</a>  on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1447.939s">So</a>  the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1455.928s">Does</a>  it matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1456.729s">It's</a>  not about how many nights there are, it's where their social activities are and where they're involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1462.94s">Cheryl</a>  coaches soccer, both teams, you know, 12 to 3, both kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1469.043s">They</a>  have friends in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1470.323s">They</a>  go to school, they go to park and the kids say, hey, what class are you in? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1474.105s">And</a>  it's quite troublesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1475.986s">All</a>  of their social activities are here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1479.047s">This</a>  is where they live. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1480.468s">These</a>  parents will work out the school issue and transportation if you just let us work, do it on our time.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1489.882s">No,</a>  the only thing I can say is that There was a specific request again in May Requesting to enroll the children in Medford that was denied the court is again denied any change in these orders and There was an original <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1515.3s">request</a>  in May, and a motion was made in May to specifically ask the court to make an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1526.604s">Specifically,</a>  the motion was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1530.406s">There</a>  was another request to modify that in September of 2017, denied again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1538.369s">So</a>  until there is some further clarification or a ruling at trial, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1545.134s">I</a>  would recommend strongly that the committee not enroll or order these children enrolled in Medford until there is further court orders to that effect or an agreement by the parties.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1562.46s">We</a>  can get you an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1563.38s">If</a>  you let us, if you say yes to Medford, we'll get you an agreement.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1566.141s">If</a>  you got an agreement, you'd get yes to Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1568.861s">That's</a>  where the quagmire we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1571.302s">They</a>  would have been in Medford today, and if they'd been in Medford Wednesday when we have them, on Thursday and Friday, and she was tired of driving back and forth from Northland to Medford, she would give in, and in Medford it would be.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1581.824s">So</a>  let me just say one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1585.445s">My</a>  own gut tells me the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1588.832s">It's</a>  not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1591.894s">The</a>  reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1598.76s">Leave</a>  them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1603.283s">The</a>  other child, okay, so they're two together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1607.344s">And</a>  what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1617.808s">So</a>  we're gonna play one off against the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1619.849s">The</a>  reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1629.268s">The</a>  court will make a decision, and you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1633.613s">We</a>  are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1636.476s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1637.197s">We're</a>  not against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1638.879s">We</a>  like children.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1640.2s">We</a>  like enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1641.201s">North</a>  Andover didn't wait for a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1642.423s">And</a>  because you said no, it has to be North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1644.705s">Do</a>  you get this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1646.047s">North</a>  Andover didn't need a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1647.789s">We</a>  live in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1649.31s">Why</a>  are you saying no?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1653.531s">We're</a>  at a council, I tell you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1655.512s">The</a>  council keeps saying the same thing over and over again, which is that no court made an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1659.014s">And</a>  he's saying he doesn't recommend it, but there's no court order saying they can't go to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1663.617s">What</a>  is it?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1664.978s">There's</a>  a court order denying, denying enrollment in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1671.802s">I</a>  have the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1673.023s">Please</a>  read it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1674.644s">I</a>  don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1675.305s">I've</a>  read it to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1676.946s">The</a>  committee has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1678.367s">The</a>  court has denied the order in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1682.948s">Denied</a>  an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1684.429s">It's</a>  been revisited again in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1687.251s">They've</a>  denied that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1689.012s">The</a>  superintendent has stated that he is willing to enroll these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1695.596s">If</a>  you have an agreement or a court order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1700.158s">Either</a>  way, if there is an agreement between the parents or a court order modifying what is in front of us now, the superintendent has stated he's willing to enroll these children in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1715.845s">And</a>  my recommendation, again, is to wait either for a order from the trial on the merits or until there's a reversal of this motion or until there is an agreement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1732.771s">Medford</a>  has not said no.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1735.775s">Medford</a>  is willing to enroll these children if this court order is modified or is there an agreement between the parties.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1745.71s">if</a>  Medford's saying no and North Danaver is the only option? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1749.195s">If</a>  the two parents agree, we will take the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1753.041s">How</a>  can they agree if she has no reason to wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1754.804s">If</a>  she's not willing to drive back and forth to get the kids to school, clearly she... In the meantime, they're out? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1760.632s">I</a>  mean, like when she doesn't want to drive down here?</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1762.293s">Point</a>  of information, ma'am?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1764.235s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1764.455s">Harry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1765.756s">Doctor,</a>  reading through the documents that you presented us, mediation was suggested by the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1771.06s">What</a>  happened in mediation?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1772.521s">That</a>  it failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1773.042s">It</a>  worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1774.943s">The</a>  parties went to mediation and could not reach an agreement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1777.505s">So</a>  Cheryl, my partner, offered to change the schedule for her request if she was willing to be in Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1784.61s">She</a>  didn't want to compromise on anything.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1788.689s">What</a>  did the original custody agreement indicate?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1790.95s">The</a>  original custody agreement is she has them Monday and Tuesday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1796.071s">Cheryl</a>  had them Monday and Tuesday?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1797.412s">No,</a>  Nicole.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1798.052s">Nicole,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1798.912s">And</a>  then we have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1802.273s">What's</a>  50-50, five and two? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1803.874s">What's</a>  50-50?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1804.694s">Could</a>  I follow up on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.914s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1805.994s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1806.835s">Thank</a>  you, Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1808.235s">When</a>  we first spoke, and up until just a little while ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1811.673s">You</a>  had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, because the children could go to school Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1818.658s">Five</a>  days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1820.139s">Okay,</a>  well, five days a week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1821.8s">Is</a>  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1824.923s">But</a>  not every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1825.523s">Okay,</a>  but they don't go to school.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1826.584s">Every</a>  week, since March. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1827.604s">But</a>  they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1829.566s">Right,</a>  but there's... So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1841.336s">And</a>  then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1844.677s">Even</a>  if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1850.559s">I</a>  mean, I'm really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1852.1s">Do</a>  we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1857.422s">I</a>  assure you if they were in Medford Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1861.973s">North</a>  Ender would not allow them to go to school Monday and Tuesdays only. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1864.856s">They</a>  would say, hey, your kids are missing too much school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1867.138s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1867.739s">Three</a>  days out of the week is more than two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1869.24s">They</a>  would be going to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1871.082s">Three</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1872.764s">Well,</a>  no, five, because she doesn't want to transport on Mondays apparently either. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1876.287s">So</a>  four days.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1877.868s">But</a>  if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1880.331s">Because</a>  she said they missed school today because she didn't want to drop them.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1886.46s">We're</a>  trying to understand it with a few pieces of paper when you have a whole file at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1890.264s">So</a>  just please bear with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1891.705s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1892.646s">And</a>  also, this isn't something that really should be discussed in front of every person in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1899.112s">It</a>  really is a private matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1900.394s">And</a>  I highly advise that if we need to continue this, that we go into executive session for the respect of your family.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1907.761s">I</a>  would be happy to do that if Mr. Belson would turn my phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1911.783s">I</a>  called the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1912.603s">I</a>  leave messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1913.204s">I</a>  don't hear back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1913.964s">So</a>  if I could get a meeting with Mr. Velson and yourself, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1917.906s">And</a>  maybe our attorneys, I would sell for that.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1921.568s">So</a>  let me just say one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1923.829s">And</a>  I don't know your status. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1925.55s">But</a>  as far as I know, you're a significant other, but not a custodial parent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1930.632s">Am</a>  I right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1931.012s">I'm</a>  not a custodial parent, no.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1932.173s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1932.333s">So</a>  as a result, I can't talk to you about the trial technically.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1935.334s">Well,</a>  with permission, you can.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1937.195s">Yeah,</a>  well, I don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1938.375s">No</a>  one gave me that permission yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1940.656s">So</a>  this is a complicated little circle here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1945.017s">I</a>  mean, it's filled with all kinds of potholes of things that we can and can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1951.179s">So</a>  if the court had said, you can put them in part time, but the court is probably saying, I don't want to split the week up for these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1962.142s">Let</a>  them be in one place and not in two places.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1963.902s">That's</a>  the problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1965.624s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1966.024s">It</a>  wouldn't work for either party.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1969.748s">So</a>  I move that the party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1980.198s">Seconded.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1981.239s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1981.519s">On</a>  the motion, roll call vote please.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1986.535s">Mrs.</a>  Cugno? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1987.656s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1988.096s">Mrs.</a>  DiBenedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1989.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1989.758s">Mrs.</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1990.899s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1991.479s">Mrs.</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1992.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1992.82s">Mr.</a>  Scurry? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1993.441s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1993.881s">Mrs.</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1994.562s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1994.822s">Mayor</a>  Burke?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1995.502s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1995.722s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1997.164s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1999.205s">Report</a>  of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2000.546s">Report</a>  on Team Medford supply drive.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2003.809s">Mayor</a>  and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our deputy superintendent to take the lead on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2009.193s">It's</a>  a very significant occasion for Team Medford, and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2017.005s">Again,</a>  we're here with our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2018.786s">I'm</a>  going to ask our team to come up with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2021.727s">It's</a>  a very special occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2024.027s">This</a>  is the 10th year we're having an anniversary tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2028.549s">We</a>  celebrate our 10th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2035.011s">I</a>  made it, yes, at Market Basket, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2036.892s">We</a>  do great work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2038.838s">But</a>  once again, we are indebted to Team Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2042.599s">Sam</a>  Terabelsi every year comes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2045.94s">Of</a>  course, I know he would because I also discovered we went to the same high school, Watertown High School, which I didn't know until this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2053.141s">So,</a>  we learned good things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2054.762s">But</a>  I'm going to ask Sam to come up and introduce his team that's with him tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2059.823s">We,</a>  every year, go over the previous year amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2062.984s">This</a>  year was $28,000 with Staples being our prime donator. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2067.705s">But</a>  again, a lot of constituents participated in this and we have as a result school supplies that arrived before the first day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2076.827s">Principals</a>  picked them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2079.268s">Students</a>  had them in their hands the first day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2081.909s">So</a>  we are indebted to Sam and I will let him speak and then we'll have cake.</p>

    <p>[OQKxfahlemU_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2088.237s">Thank</a>  you so much, Beverly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2090.118s">So</a>  yeah, 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2092.12s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2096.043s">I</a>  imagine the idea just came in as part of our sort of, as we started this committee, about 16 of us and sitting and thinking, what else can we do with the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2107.191s">How</a>  do we connect the hospital with the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2109.953s">And</a>  certainly, our thoughts were more with the school programs, which I've known Mr. Belson for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2117.557s">And</a>  then one member just said, well, what if we do this back to school drive? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2123.56s">And</a>  then it just got 16 of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2125.782s">Wow,</a>  that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2127.422s">Let's</a>  talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2129.764s">And</a>  the rest was history. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2130.964s">It</a>  was just a team of volunteers from the hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2135.67s">which</a>  we still have team effort that we do on multiple things, including what we do in Kiwanis, the chamber, Tufts Community Day, and the mayor's outing that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2147.717s">And</a>  when we really thought about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2152.24s">It's</a>  just became natural for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2155.122s">It</a>  just, you know, we look for that moment, that June email that I've already sort of put together to Beverly to say, what do you, all of the principals, what do they need? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2166.608s">Let</a>  us know, because we're gonna go and get what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2170.871s">And</a>  again, I wanna thank Staples, which is our major donor, and thanks Little Rocco, who has been the driving force trying to get <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2181.843s">donate</a>  for us the amount that they donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2184.605s">But</a>  many other organizations and all the employees at Hallmark Health Lawrence Memorial contributed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2192.192s">And</a>  before I introduce the members, I'm going to just introduce or really mention some of these groups, like the Medford Kiwanis, this year the Rotary Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2202.762s">the</a>  PTO, and then we have Armstrong, we also have Genesis, our nursing home, and then many other folks that just came in and offered their checks, their cash, and we have gone and bought certain things to really make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2219.117s">So</a>  my committee that's here is Lou Rocco, he's been from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2224.161s">We</a>  got from Armstrong, Chris Hill, representing Armstrong, which every year they make donations to our program, and they have a box in their local place that they collect. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2234.351s">This</a>  is my partner, Janet Perrault, she's always there with us trying to get this program going too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2242.119s">for</a>  us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2243.2s">Joe</a>  Raffles again has been over and over an outstanding gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2248.162s">He's</a>  in Italy as he usually is and he just again looks forward to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2253.924s">So</a>  again, thank you so much for allowing us to do this and giving us this opportunity to give back to the students and make their school year a successful year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2262.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2267.364s">On</a>  behalf of all of the children of the city of Medford, we want to thank you for all the hard work you do, how you coordinate this and get so many backpacks in the hands of needy children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2276.851s">We're</a>  astounded and we're just so thankful to have you a part of our community, so thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2290.437s">Thanks</a>  for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2292.818s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to accept this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2295.058s">Motion</a>  to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2296.259s">Motion</a>  to accept by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2297.459s">Cunha,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2299.76s">Kritz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2300.46s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2301.18s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2301.78s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2302.42s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2305.281s">Report</a>  on a Giro backpack donation program.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2308.402s">So</a>  another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2313.255s">So</a>  is it proper to say, let them eat cake? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2315.158s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2317.541s">In</a>  addition to our team Medford Patriots and whatever they do for us in Medford Public Schools, we also need to take this opportunity to thank Jero. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2329.789s">specifically</a>  Mr. Sidney Wolfe, the founder of Agero and the cross-country group, David Farrick, who is CEO and President of Agero, Sandy Savage, Vice President of Human Resources, Sandy Reyes, Human Resources Business Partner, and all the local employees of Agero for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2352.054s">So,</a>  like Beverly, when I get that phone call from Sandy Reyes at Agero saying, are you coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2359.376s">I'm</a>  just there, Michelle and I, my administrative assistant and I go over to Ajero and we get 60 backpacks and they're filled with school supplies for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2370.285s">There</a>  are pencils and pens and markers and notebooks all filled and even additional boxes that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2379.092s">So</a>  they're not just for elementary, we try to parcel it out so we can give some of the backpacks to middle schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2386.303s">So</a>  together our principals decided that the backpacks should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2392.966s">We've</a>  also saved a number of the backpacks to present to the Department of Social Services at our regular holiday donation drive, which I think most of you know we've been doing this for years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2403.772s">So</a>  we keep some of those backpacks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2408.942s">And</a>  we are just so fortunate to have generous partners such as Agero who continue to make a real difference in the lives of our children in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2416.846s">So,</a>  currently the backpacks are in my literacy office and we will be disseminating maybe six or ten per school for the elementary and the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2428.772s">And</a>  then obviously we'll give some supplies to our high school and our vocational schools, pencils and pens and whatever they need as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2436.575s">Mr.</a>  Wolfe couldn't be here tonight, but he wanted to send his best, and we just want to thank all our great business partners.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2443.739s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2443.959s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2445.219s">I</a>  would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Ajero and Mr. Wolfe to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2462.487s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2463.127s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2489.44s">Okay,</a>  from one store to the other, a market basket to Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2493.882s">On</a>  Tuesday, August 15th, Wegmans hosted an informational meeting for several non-profits, community school, and city leaders at their offices at Station Landing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2507.409s">I</a>  was able to attend, along with Diane Caldwell, Chad Fallon, Jill Sawyer, and Lisa Evangelista. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2514.073s">We</a>  all represented the school district at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2517.214s">And</a>  the purpose of the meeting is that the staff of Wegmans really wanted to learn more about what they could do for the community and for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2526.425s">They</a>  have a lot to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2529.505s">are</a>  still hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2530.466s">There</a>  was an article actually in the transcript that spoke to this meeting and what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2536.048s">They're</a>  marking their 100th anniversary, and they actually have been named one of the best places to work in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2544.233s">We</a>  were welcomed by the store manager, Kevin Russell, the store manager, the Medford service manager, Paula Colnane, and Mary Ellen Burris, who is the senior vice president of consumer affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2558.98s">All</a>  three have had longstanding roles in the company and could not speak more highly about what the company has done for their careers and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2567.246s">Wegmans</a>  offers scholarships and some of the people there actually started as clerks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2572.889s">They</a>  started in Wegmans in different parts of the country and they were given scholarships and they continued their undergraduate and graduate studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2580.875s">So</a>  they're very generous. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2582.816s">We</a>  could not be more warmly welcomed by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2585.7s">Not</a>  only did they have a lovely breakfast for us, they again wanted to know what we could do, what they could do for us moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2594.11s">And</a>  again, we're hoping that some of our students will apply for some of the part-time jobs because it can lead to scholarship opportunities for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2601.8s">They</a>  also gave us a lovely goody bag, which contained breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2607.444s">Their</a>  products are really lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2610.046s">They</a>  have all the ingredients. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2611.327s">They're</a>  very concerned about food allergies, things that we're concerned about in the schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2616.55s">So</a>  we welcomed them to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2618.031s">They</a>  couldn't speak more highly of things that they wanted to do for us, and we will coordinate</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2623.935s">Probably</a>  through Lisa and the school so that not everybody's kind of at the same time asking for things all during the school year They're officially open November 5th So, thank you for the report and I'm glad we're starting early Next time I'd like to come to that meeting make sure you're included <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2650.951s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2652.212s">My</a>  real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2657.616s">Because</a>  I don't know if they meal prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2666.542s">So</a>  the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2671.802s">Well,</a>  Chad and Jill were there at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2674.605s">We</a>  did inform them about the new restaurant that's opening at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2679.351s">So,</a>  I'm sure they will further those discussions because they were present.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2682.734s">And</a>  they will also have a restaurant on site as well within the Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2686.516s">Right,</a>  that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2691.139s">So</a>  maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2699.624s">We</a>  mentioned that to them, that we would invite them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2701.385s">Chad</a>  mentioned that, that they would be invited to that too.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2704.127s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2704.427s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2705.568s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2707.089s">On</a>  the motion of this report be placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2709.171s">Moved</a>  by Mr. Brennan, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2711.032s">VandeVleut.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2711.512s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2712.193s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2712.773s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2714.154s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2716.08s">Report</a>  on stop-and-shop donation to the metropolitan schools so report Stop-and-shop is still working out the details so tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2723.944s">We'll</a>  put it aside and wait on the table, but I can assure you that There's gonna be a lot of competition between supermarkets in the table this paper until next next meeting Seconded by mr..

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2749.46s">I'm</a>  going to call upon our director of curriculum, Bernadette Riccidelli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2757.926s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2759.744s">So</a>  I am here to report tonight on the scheduled releases of our assessment results for MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2769.03s">So</a>  the next generation MCAS in grades three through eight, and the legacy MCAS, which is the old traditional MCAS at the high school, and also the accountability ratings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2779.557s">So</a>  I've written a lot in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2782.339s">I've</a>  taken the schedule directly from the Department of Ed site, so you have all of the dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2787.442s">I've</a>  highlighted the major dates in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2791.004s">So</a>  as you can see, as early as June, we were receiving some raw data. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2796.226s">For</a>  the purpose of this report, I started in August where we started seeing some of the preliminary data in raw format. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2804.371s">both</a>  the assessment as well as the accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2808.134s">So</a>  just jumping forward because everyone is waiting for the official results to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2813.819s">So</a>  we need to wait until mid-October this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2816.322s">It</a>  seems like each year it's getting a little bit later. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2820.185s">So,</a>  October 24th is the date in which the official district and school level MCAS and the MCAS alt results are released to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2831.849s">The</a>  official accountability reports for all districts and schools will be released to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2836.53s">And</a>  also the printed MCAS parent guardian reports will be received by the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2842.274s">So</a>  October 24th is that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2844.335s">Now</a>  they do say that is an estimate, so we're planning right around that date for the results to be released. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2853.972s">So</a>  certainly we will be preparing reports for you so that as soon as possible, once they're unembargoed, we can report those to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2863.738s">As</a>  far as the accountability schedule, reporting schedule is concerned, if we go back to November of 2015, the Board of Education amended the accountability system that we had in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2876.146s">And</a>  this was done so that districts and schools administering the next generation MCAS assessment in grades three through eight this past spring would not have their accountability results negatively impacted based on those scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2890.723s">This</a>  regulation allows the Department of Education to limit the use of levels one through three this fall for any school that enrolls students in grades three through eight, as long as the school has a participation rate of at least 90% in the administration of this past spring's MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2908.435s">So</a>  participation rate is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2918.422s">that's</a>  important to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2919.383s">So</a>  again, not so much the assessment results, but participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2924.047s">The</a>  Department of Ed will publish next generation MCAS results for each school and district, including a normative measure of achievement to help districts and the Department of Ed identify schools that may require support. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2938.495s">The</a>  Department of Ed will report the participation rate separately for English language arts, mathematics, and science, and for each district and school as a whole, as well as for each subgroup. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2952.62s">So</a>  again, they're looking for a 90% participation rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2957.082s">Schools</a>  that assess at least 90% of their students in all groups and subjects will not be assigned an accountability and assistance level of 1 to 3, 1, 2, or 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2967.074s">Any</a>  school or district with participation rates below 90% for any group of students in any subject will be placed into level 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2976.345s">As</a>  far as high school level testing is concerned, so we're talking about the legacy MCAS test, the assessment and accountability results will be reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2986.573s">High</a>  schools will continue to receive an accountability and assistance level based on their PPI and the school percentile data with adjustments for those schools with persistently low graduation rates or very low assessment participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3000.484s">So</a>  again, for the high school level, we're looking at participation and low graduation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3005.668s">So,</a>  as we move forward with this, a new accountability system is in the process of being developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3013.794s">So,</a>  this fall the Board of Education will be considering those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3020.559s">And</a>  the changes do need to be consistent with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3027.922s">So</a>  that, in a nutshell, is the reporting schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3031.003s">So</a>  again, October 24th is the date that we should have the official results. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3035.624s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3037.025s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3037.225s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3038.185s">I</a>  have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3039.405s">The</a>  first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3051.689s">There</a>  were lots of discrepancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3054.71s">And</a>  I know that's a very timely thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3056.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3057.071s">Was</a>  the information that you received so far this year more accurate?</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3062.536s">It</a>  appeared so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3064.397s">There</a>  were a few things that we caught on the discrepancy report, so those have been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3072.985s">vigilant</a>  with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3074.406s">We</a>  did not want a repeat of last year, which everything turned out fine, but we believe we caught the few discrepancies.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3084.508s">But</a>  I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3088.97s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3090.731s">The</a>  second question has to do with the participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3094.054s">Are</a>  we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3098.478s">The</a>  initial look at it suggests that we are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3102.222s">I</a>  mean, we should have some idea, shouldn't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3104.504s">We</a>  should. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3105.025s">I</a>  just do need to be careful because they're embargoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3110.55s">they</a>  look to be fine, we're not concerned about that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3114.012s">But</a>  we know who took the test and who didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3115.853s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3116.553s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3117.233s">Yes,</a>  so in the preliminary results, we actually get a percentage, so we looked at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3122.917s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3124.478s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3125.198s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3126.739s">My</a>  first thing is more of a statement than a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3129.66s">It</a>  seems that the DESE is <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3134.838s">punishing</a>  school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not so I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3161.322s">to</a>  be accountable.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3163.865s">Can</a>  I just clarify, the participation rate results refers to the number of students taking the test?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3171.473s">So</a>  like when parents decided that they want to opt out, so they're holding the district's hands at pushing parents to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3183.415s">for</a>  this, because districts are going to really push for every child to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3188.116s">And</a>  I knew that we had an issue last year with the subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3196.939s">And</a>  so, I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate was appropriate when we were taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3205.722s">So,</a>  those are just some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3209.083s">We're</a>  really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test But it's very important to the district that it does and the district does get punished from desi if not or held at a higher Accountability than districts that parents don't opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3224.497s">So</a>  that's just a comment from what I've seen Secondly, I wanted to know <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3231.495s">So</a>  the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3236.776s">As</a>  a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3248.739s">It's</a>  embargoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3249.599s">It's</a>  embargoed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3250.139s">You've</a>  got to ask the question.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3251.359s">It's</a>  embargoed, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3254.749s">Part</a>  of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3261.015s">Now,</a>  you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3270.024s">Somebody</a>  leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3275.368s">It's</a>  very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things, but we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3287.712s">So</a>  that's my other comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3289.233s">So</a>  them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3298.459s">So</a>  I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3305.403s">It</a>  still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3308.865s">If</a>  I can just answer that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3311.947s">I</a>  think the thing that you've got to remember <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3313.948s">this</a>  is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3317.75s">So</a>  as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions, you know, they had to see what it was about, whether it really, you know, the questions were proper and the like, and they have to do that analysis with their own testing company. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3331.338s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3332.138s">rather</a>  than it's like a new product, it's really in a pilot phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3335.879s">So</a>  the second year, they're saying, OK, you had a year to try it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3339.459s">We've</a>  had a year to work out the bugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3341.22s">Now</a>  we'll start to look at it for real. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3343.4s">So</a>  that's really part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3344.38s">It</a>  isn't really an attempt to hide anything, because I think some people in the state would love to issue accountability ratings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3350.881s">But</a>  having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3356.242s">You'd</a>  have to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3357.163s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3357.403s">And</a>  my point is, even though that we <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3360.002s">We</a>  as a community are not accountable for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3362.965s">We</a>  are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3367.97s">And</a>  I don't want parents to think, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3378.44s">Entity</a>  that to to our students and to to but have them do very well I just wanted to put that out there I don't like it when they say it doesn't come because it counts because the kids took the time to take the exam and you guys As a school district we spent a lot of time and a lot of money Making sure that we do this well and do it right so it does it does it counts? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3403.31s">And</a>  it's the data <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3404.889s">We'll</a>  use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3410.331s">So</a>  that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3415.873s">So</a>  to my colleague who's the committee chair of <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3420.721s">the</a>  academic committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3422.262s">Last</a>  year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3428.046s">So</a>  as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3432.33s">We</a>  could schedule the meeting and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3436.192s">So</a>  we know the results are coming the 24th.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3437.874s">We</a>  always do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3439.795s">I</a>  just look at schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3440.796s">I</a>  mean, there's a lot of things you want to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3442.357s">Tonight</a>  was a good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3444.198s">But</a>  we'll get a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3445.559s">It's</a>  not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3448.582s">Traditionally</a>  it goes to the curriculum committee.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3451.346s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3451.526s">Mustone,</a>  were you going to say something, Mr. Belson?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3454.247s">I</a>  just want to say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3455.507s">I've</a>  been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way, where it goes, how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3469.591s">But</a>  you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3478.013s">And</a>  two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3490.304s">And</a>  the pushback is becoming very, very strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3493.392s">The</a>  Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3498.593s">So</a>  we'll have to see where that plays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3500.154s">But</a>  there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3511.252s">So</a>  I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3515.736s">I'll</a>  introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3518.839s">Because</a>  I think there's a lot of good material in there looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3525.244s">We</a>  talk about social and emotional learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3527.466s">We</a>  talk about career and technical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3529.688s">We</a>  talk about health. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3531.009s">All</a>  those things are important in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3533.091s">We're</a>  developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3535.893s">We're</a>  not just developing test takers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3537.995s">So</a>  a good school in a community like, you know, in Boston, where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3551.399s">So</a>  how we look at our young people, how we look at schools and what we do, needs more scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3557.001s">And</a>  I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3563.803s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3564.003s">Musto?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3564.443s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3565.765s">You</a>  had mentioned discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3566.986s">Is</a>  that part of the embargoed information, or could you elaborate? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3570.089s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3570.689s">So</a>  in October, we will know what the discrepancies were?</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3573.752s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3574.052s">So</a>  there's a discrepancy reporting window, which was in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3578.657s">So</a>  that's when the administrators, the principals, the curriculum directors take a look at, we take an initial look at the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3586.083s">We</a>  look at the students who took the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3588.265s">to</a>  see if there's anybody missing, if the numbers are correct in terms of who was supposed to be participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3595.247s">So</a>  we have, I don't know, it's about 10 days or so a week in which we then can report to the state that there was a discrepancy in what they have on paper and what we have as far as our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3606.851s">So</a>  that is not, that's not reported out in any official results.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3611.434s">Were</a>  there many discrepancies between what the state presented to you and what you had?</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3615.337s">I</a>  don't know the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3616.698s">I</a>  think that it was minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3619.82s">There</a>  were more last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3623.083s">It</a>  was not, the initial look at the data would suggest that it was pretty accurate.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3629.808s">So</a>  let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3634.571s">Fascinating</a>  kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3636.285s">A</a>  student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English language arts test because it was his first year in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3648.19s">However,</a>  because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade, he had been in the country for a short period of time, the state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3659.014s">We</a>  had to petition and clean that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3661.727s">Now,</a>  how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3667.154s">That's</a>  an example of a discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3669.337s">Medicals,</a>  people that are out on a medical who somehow don't get coded out of the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3675.485s">All</a>  of a sudden, you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3679.567s">I</a>  mean, how can you count them? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3680.607s">They</a>  couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3684.508s">So</a>  those are some of the things that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3686.849s">And</a>  you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3694.411s">All</a>  of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3697.911s">And</a>  that's not what you're going to pay attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3699.252s">And</a>  with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3703.633s">So</a>  if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3709.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3711.483s">Motion</a>  to accept and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3714.147s">And</a>  thank you, Bernadette.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3715.549s">That's</a>  a motion to accept and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3717.551s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3718.252s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3718.593s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3719.454s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3720.135s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3720.996s">Motion</a>  passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3723.219s">We</a>  put on summer programs.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3725.962s">OK,</a>  Beverly's going to do this.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3728.984s">I</a>  have Anthony with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3731.666s">As</a>  all of you know, we run a full complement of summer programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3736.37s">Some</a>  of them are voluntary for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3739.693s">Some</a>  of them are mandatory, like regular summer school for making up courses during the school year that a youngster may have failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3747.879s">Some</a>  of them have a cost to them and some are free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3751.542s">We</a>  have, again, a lot of things going on all summer long. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3755.465s">I</a>  asked people who ran programs to come tonight to present to you themselves, and Anthony volunteered to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3762.868s">So,</a>  we'll start with the summer fun program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3764.789s">And</a>  Anthony, you want to tell us a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[ACxsV5H4ehA_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3775.892s">Hi,</a>  thank you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3777.073s">I'm</a>  Anthony Pachelis. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3778.374s">I'm</a>  the director of the Mefford Summer Fund Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3780.836s">It's</a>  in its 11th year of existence and my 10th year running it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3784.34s">I'm</a>  just going to give you a short, you know, a little description about the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3787.903s">But</a>  as I said, this is our 11th year of running it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3791.066s">We</a>  run out of Mefford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3792.747s">We</a>  average about 130 to 140 kids a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3796.55s">At</a>  some weeks we were able to hit up into the 160s, one high 150s, low 160s. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3801.512s">We</a>  provide breakfast every morning for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3803.973s">Every</a>  Friday we provide them free pizza for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3806.854s">And</a>  throughout the week we have different activities that come to camp, whether it's a magician, a carnival, and so on, that we provide for the kids each week that they're registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3815.997s">We</a>  also hold the World Cup soccer tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3818.358s">We</a>  hold the dodgeball tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3820.339s">And</a>  this year we were able to partner up with, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3824.06s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3824.461s">Stone,</a>  and we were able, with the Greater Boston Food Bank, the mayor, and Hallmark helped to get food donated every Friday to camp for families, so on the way that the families were picking up their kids, we were able to have bags of food provided for families for dinner for that night or over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3844.023s">Over</a>  the four weeks we did it, we did it four Fridays, July 28th, August 4th, August 11th, and August 18th, we were able to give away over 250 bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3852.911s">And</a>  that was great, a lot of parents were very pleased and very happy that we were able to provide a service like that for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3861.799s">As</a>  I said, I just wanted to come and talk about the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3863.741s">I</a>  think it's one of those great programs that we have in the city that a lot of people are starting to hear about and know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3869.606s">And</a>  every single year we've grown in size. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3871.888s">We</a>  have over 30 employees, 33 employees, part-time and full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3877.113s">And</a>  all of them are, you know, city of Mefford kids that, you know, went through the elementary schools and middle schools and high schools, and some are currently in high school or graduated from Mefford High or in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3887.328s">So,</a>  you know, we provide a great service for the youth of the community from elementary all the way up to high school and beyond.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3895.805s">That</a>  next year, Wegmans will help you with food stuff.</p>

    <p>[ACxsV5H4ehA_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3899.807s">Yeah,</a>  when I heard that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3901.407s">Definitely,</a>  absolutely, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3902.968s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3903.388s">If</a>  I could just jump in on the food portion of it, and really, we have to thank Mia in a large way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3908.471s">Not</a>  mean Mia, Mia. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3911.212s">She</a>  really, we've had several meetings on food insecurity at City Hall, and Mia has been a part of all of those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3917.714s">And</a>  she was, with her van, we went in and picked up the whole truckload of stuff in her van one Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3923.877s">And</a>  it continued for four weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3925.159s">So</a>  we want to really thank you, Mia, for all of your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3928.403s">And</a>  thanks to Sarah and Anthony for coordinating it once everything came back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3933.029s">Because</a>  that was, I know, a lot of effort on your part as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3935.672s">So</a>  thank you all for doing what you can for our kids.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3940.637s">I</a>  think that's such a great addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3942.499s">I</a>  also, though, just need to take a moment to thank my colleague, Anne Marie Cuno, who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3952.365s">It's</a>  been a long time of great successes.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3955.588s">It</a>  was one of my things on my to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3959.67s">And</a>  as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3963.574s">And</a>  like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3968.738s">So</a>  it has proved itself many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3972.862s">So</a>  I'm very proud of that program.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3974.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3975.324s">And</a>  you do a great job, Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3976.765s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.165s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3977.426s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3978.006s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[OQKxfahlemU_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3979.047s">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3979.768s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3981.603s">It's</a>  amazing so many programs are going on simultaneously at the high school and they kind of all share the pool and the facilities and it seems to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3989.11s">I</a>  really don't have a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3991.653s">People</a>  take care of their own business and Anthony's been wonderful with that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3995.556s">Other</a>  programs, we always have our special education program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3999.8s">Lisa</a>  Ionelli was overseeing it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4003.384s">Again,</a>  this program is basically for students who <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4006.967s">have</a>  in their IEPs, extended year services, and again, they were approximately 145 students that participated in those programs this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4018.097s">We</a>  have our English learner program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4020.76s">Paul</a>  Texera, our new director, supervised that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4025.644s">Approximately</a>  75 English learner students through grades one through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4031.214s">attended,</a>  they were at the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4035.755s">We</a>  try to contain our programs in as few schools as possible so we get all the cleaning done and we tell John McLaughlin the schedule so we can work around it so it all seems to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4048.118s">High</a>  School 101, this is a program that we started years ago when we had the academic support grant to support students who have difficulty passing MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4060.181s">Dr.</a>  Keizer and David Blow were overseeing this, organizing the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4065.723s">It's</a>  basically a program for students who are coming into grade nine and it kind of gives them a jump start. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4072.565s">All</a>  eighth grade students have math work to do over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4076.206s">and</a>  they have reading to do over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4078.407s">So,</a>  we bring the students in about three or four days in August, and the teachers are there to help them to finish the assignments, because oftentimes these are the students that will go into the classes and the regular teacher in grade nine will say, where's your summer reading, or where's your summer math, and they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4094.195s">So,</a>  this makes sure that they have those assignments completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4097.916s">And</a>  we also interface it with just getting used to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4102.879s">So,</a>  during the time they're here, they get to meet the <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4105.98s">the</a>  principal, the assistant principal of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4109.022s">And</a>  their last day actually is the regular freshman orientation day, so they're on board for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4115.367s">That</a>  program was very popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4117.528s">Once</a>  the grant no longer existed, we thanked the committee for supporting it in regular budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4122.772s">Parents</a>  love it and it really does help those youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4125.614s">They</a>  benefit a great deal coming into school in the fall.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4129.66s">Mr.</a>  Tringali, our student representative, would like to comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4133.333s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Sebastian Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4138.46s">I</a>  just have a very fond memory of facilitating student orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4144.663s">And</a>  there was a group of people, a group of freshmen, who really knew their way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4153.287s">And</a>  then there was a group of people who were asking, what's C building? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4157.389s">What's</a>  B building? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4159.45s">And</a>  the people who really knew their stuff were the high school 101 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4165.353s">Yeah,</a>  I think if I did that as a freshman, I would have been a lot less lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4173.401s">So</a>  I think it's great, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4174.923s">Great,</a>  thank you for that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4177.886s">Other</a>  programs, we had regular summer school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4183.01s">David</a>  Blau and Jill Sawyer were running that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4186.511s">And</a>  again, this program is for students who really have to make up a subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4190.793s">Now,</a>  one of the big pluses this year is we did not have a lot of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4196.135s">Many</a>  times seniors who fail a subject, they can't graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4200.736s">We</a>  actually, this spring, through credit recovery, got those seniors over the hump so that they did not miss out on graduation, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4209.439s">that</a>  they actually get into our graduation rate, which is a plus thing with our data. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4213.782s">And</a>  also, we didn't have to have them pay for summer school, as in the past, we've had a lot of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4221.126s">We</a>  also used our Plato, our online courses a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4226.749s">What</a>  we do is we have the curriculum directors look at the Plato. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4229.931s">We</a>  don't throw students into online courses, because some of them are better than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4234.774s">We</a>  make sure that the curriculum people <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4237.275s">are</a>  comfortable with the content of the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4239.435s">And</a>  there were some courses, math courses, that perhaps really had to be delivered with the real teachers standing up in front of the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4247.397s">But</a>  most of the science classes, I believe all the science classes were done online. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4251.478s">This</a>  is the second year we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4253.478s">And</a>  again, it also, the other benefit of online courses is that when summer school officially ended on whatever day that was in August, some students who still needed a little bit more time were allowed to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4265.321s">because</a>  they could just continue online. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4267.583s">And</a>  that was a real plus, and also students could take more than two courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4271.987s">Because</a>  traditional summer school, you basically have an eight to 10, and a 10 to 12, so you can only take two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4278.953s">With</a>  the online, a student on his or her own could take a third course. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4283.337s">So</a>  we see a lot of potential, we hope to grow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4286.32s">What</a>  we need to do is to take the packaged programs <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4290.463s">and</a>  make sure that we expand them with our own materials so that the curriculum directors feel that they're rigorous enough that they match the curriculum that would be, you know, a live course. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4301.471s">So</a>  again, we had a great success with students doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4304.653s">We</a>  also, we learn, you know, after we do our summer programs, we sit down, we just don't close the books and say, okay, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4311.478s">started</a>  again in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4313.159s">We</a>  basically brainstormed what we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4316.061s">And</a>  last year we realized that the middle school students in summer school really were having a difficult time with the attention span. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4322.746s">They</a>  needed a different type of structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4324.907s">So,</a>  what we did this year through the efforts of Jill and David is we kind of mixed it up for the middle school youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4331.311s">Yes,</a>  they did their math course or they did their English course, but they also had a 45-minute block in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4336.915s">Bernadette</a>  Riccardelli was part of the planning team on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4340.297s">where</a>  every week they did something different, whether it was an outdoor activity or learning some social emotional activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4348.344s">Again,</a>  it seemed to make them more liable to go back into the classroom and be much more focused. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4354.469s">So,</a>  we liked that addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4356.091s">I</a>  think it worked well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4357.572s">And</a>  again, we'll probably continue with that model. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4359.614s">It</a>  was just for 6th and 7th graders because those were the youngsters that were having difficulty. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4363.837s">The</a>  8th graders seemed to be okay with the traditional model. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4369.636s">Two</a>  other camps from basically middle school youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4373.519s">Jill</a>  Sawyer ran the CTE Explore Camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4376.941s">These</a>  are for middle school students who want to come into the vocational school, explore some of the offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4384.786s">Actually</a>  they had a great chance to see some of the different shops, auto tech, biotechnical, carpentry, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4394.071s">The</a>  students actually had, I believe, a swim, an hour swim in the pool, and that was well attended as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4400.339s">Very</a>  short program, but again, worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4403.243s">And</a>  then finally, we have with Molly Leighton, our director of instructional technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4408.691s">She</a>  has her mobile app making summer camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4412.138s">that</a>  she held again at the McGlynn from July 17th to the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4417.546s">And</a>  again, this is tied to a funded program through the National Science Foundation project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4423.914s">So</a>  any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4425.416s">I</a>  think everything went very well, and it's positive feedback.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4430.734s">Just</a>  to comment on this science camp, I know the kids absolutely love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4434.575s">It's</a>  a real hit, and kids get a lot out of it, and a big jump for the next year.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4461.974s">Waitmans.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4463.278s">Stop</a>  and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4463.899s">Stop</a>  and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4466.532s">This</a>  report was included in your packet last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4470.335s">I</a>  hope you've had a chance to look it over, but we'd like to discuss it publicly tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4478.062s">I'll</a>  start by just introducing the topic with regard to both schools that opened in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4485.468s">Both</a>  schools follow the same academic curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4489.171s">They</a>  have the full complement of exploratory subjects, such as art, music, and health. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4495.173s">They</a>  are the same number of guidance Councilors, school psychologists in both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4501.795s">The</a>  teaching staff are highly qualified teachers, all licensed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4506.556s">And</a>  while the nature of the activities may vary, they both offer, both schools offer after school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4515.165s">One</a>  of the differences is the schools house different specialized populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4520.207s">The</a>  Andrews, for example, houses the therapeutic learning program, while the McGlynn houses all of our EL middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4529.73s">All</a>  content area classes are scheduled the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4532.891s">Everyone</a>  has the same amount of time in English, math, social studies, and science. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4538.093s">The</a>  exploratories are scheduled slightly differently because of the different populations in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4544.147s">And</a>  the fact that many of the EL kids don't take foreign language, they need to have the exploratories in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4550.932s">But</a>  if you add up the time on a yearly basis, all students are getting the same amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4556.155s">It's</a>  just that in one school they're getting it throughout the school year on a lesser basis, and in the other school they get it more concentrated during one segment of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4565.734s">but</a>  time-wise it's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4568.295s">Inclusion</a>  is practiced in both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4573.957s">Again,</a>  since the opening of the new buildings in 2001, the district has offered parents of grade five students the opportunity to select a preferred middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4585.521s">The</a>  system has worked well until the past two years, when a disproportionate number of parents of students entering grade six selected the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4595.859s">Currently</a>  the Andrews has 45, I'm sorry, 47 more students entering grade six than does the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4603.344s">And</a>  we can accommodate them through extra staffing, but again, it's not an ideal situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4609.545s">We</a>  also have a significant discrepancy in the socioeconomic status of the student populations at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4617.232s">This</a>  is something that we do need to address more long-term, not tonight, but at other meetings that we need to have during the fall and during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4629.122s">In</a>  order to correct for this imbalance, administrators at all levels, we came together once we saw this happening this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4636.325s">And</a>  it was central administration, it was the departmental people, and the building, the principals obviously were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4643.069s">And</a>  we worked throughout the spring and summer to make some changes that we wanted to put in place at the beginning of the school year that we thought would address some of these issues with the discrepancies or the idea that people were selecting the Anders over the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4658.976s">We</a>  put some things in place and we are currently working on additional changes that can be put in place during the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4667.625s">So,</a>  just to kind of review what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4670.207s">At</a>  budget time the committee allowed the addition of one health teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4676.511s">and</a>  one Spanish teacher for additional staff to be shared by the two middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4682.576s">We</a>  also added another EL teacher because that population at the McGlynn was growing leaps and bounds and we wanted to make sure the students were supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4692.284s">And</a>  the previous year we had already added a full-time librarian and a .5 adjustment Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4698.289s">So</a>  we've been adding staff over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4702.852s">During</a>  the summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4704.855s">There</a>  were several more measures that were put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4708.117s">And</a>  I'll review them with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4710.298s">We</a>  have new staff members that were hired to either fill vacancies or new positions that were created. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4717.302s">And</a>  you have the list of all of those positions without the individual names of the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4723.365s">We</a>  have a new assistant principal in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4725.346s">We</a>  have two special education teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4728.528s">We</a>  have a new reading teacher, an ELA teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4732.263s">a</a>  guidance Councilor, she's actually filling a leave of absence, the additional EL teacher, and then we have .5 health and .5 Spanish, that's the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4744.394s">The</a>  full-time was shared, the two full-time positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4748.24s">The</a>  second thing we did is we took a look at the background of staff and we reassigned a few staff members to better serve the needs of students and to support some of the newer staff and to foster some of the new state required curriculum realignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4766.57s">Realignments</a>  happened in science, English, and mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4770.812s">So,</a>  these are the changes without, again, names. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4776.518s">statement</a>  also attached with this that speaks to the science changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4780.881s">Again,</a>  that statement does contain names, so that's why we have it marked confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4786.145s">But</a>  the changes dealt with changing a grade 7 teacher to grade 8 in science and a grade 8 teacher to grade 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4794.45s">And</a>  this was based on the recommendations of Director Rocco Sieri. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4799.186s">who</a>  knowing the background of both teachers, knowing the new frameworks, and the new frameworks realigned standards where they were taught in different grade levels, felt that that placement was warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4810.29s">So,</a>  that was one of the changes that we made. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4814.652s">There</a>  was another change with the grade seven and eight <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4817.657s">English</a>  language arts teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4819.899s">We</a>  hired a new English language arts teacher for the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4823.963s">This</a>  teacher was brand new, but her student teaching and her background in, you know, again, student teaching mainly was at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4831.89s">We</a>  felt that putting her at grade eight was the proper placement since, again, she was more high school oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4838.776s">That</a>  was one part of the decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4843.08s">current</a>  eighth grade teacher, who's an excellent veteran teacher, we needed her expertise to go back into grade seven to help the new reading teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4853.164s">In</a>  grade seven now, we're starting a new reading program, RTI, where we're going to identify students who really need the reading support. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4860.447s">Grade</a>  six, all students get reading, but now grade seven and eight, it's going to be students who really need it through our testing, our study island we purchased to be able to identify those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4871.312s">We</a>  felt that having a veteran seventh grade English teacher would assist that brand new reading teacher in making those assessments and placements of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4879.553s">So,</a>  that was the rationale for that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4882.474s">Again,</a>  there was a grade eight team lateral change for two social studies teachers, again, teaching the same subject, teaching the same grade, just on different teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4893.236s">And</a>  that was a measure to balance the two teams with veteran teachers and also to have a little better gender balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4901.39s">The</a>  change I mentioned before is the modification of how reading will be delivered. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4906.223s">It's</a>  going to be, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4909.278s">The</a>  RTI model that currently exists at the Andrews with a great deal of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4914.2s">Again,</a>  all students in grade six will receive basic reading instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4919.182s">Seven</a>  and eighth grade students will be given reading support based on needs as identified on the newly purchased assessment tool, Study Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4927.386s">So</a>  we purchased, Study Island has been at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4931.047s">Again,</a>  we were able to purchase it for the McGlynn through a new grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4934.789s">that</a>  Bernadette Riccadeli is overseeing, title 4A. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4938.391s">And</a>  again, grade 7, ELA teachers, both grade 7 teachers on both teams are very veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4945.035s">They're</a>  excellent teachers and we know they will provide a great amount of support for this new reading teacher as she gets started in her career. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4953.697s">What</a>  we're going to be working on during the school year, we want to make sure that students have opportunities to have more clubs at the McGlynn and opportunities for students to be able to go to different clubs, even if they're housed at another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4970.295s">I</a>  know I had one parent, his daughter is really into theater and drama and she's <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4974.844s">At</a>  the McGlynn he's asked that she could be in the production that's done at the Andrews and we're working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4981.406s">So,</a>  we're trying to make sure that students are given the opportunity to join clubs at both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4987.829s">We</a>  are having more administrative support in the building so that we have an idea if people have concerns that they know there's always a place they can go in addition to the <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4998.813s">principal</a>  and to the new assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5002.316s">Dr.</a>  Riccadeli is going to have and has had already more of a presence in the school, walking around the halls, talking to the teachers, seeing again, expressing her interest in what they're doing and if they have any concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5016.506s">And</a>  also Mr. Texera, again our new EL director, he is going to have a presence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5023.492s">Both</a>  people are going to have an office, we're working on that, where they can actually sit and if a person wants to go to them, they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5030.597s">It</a>  was only natural to have Mr. Texera be there more because all of the EL middle school students and teachers are housed at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5039.804s">We've</a>  already decided that we're going to have the open house for grade five parents together, both principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5046.109s">presenting</a>  and then again having the tours of the buildings for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5052.431s">I</a>  think we need to together during the school year work on some systemic changes to the protocols for the school selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5060.793s">Because</a>  what's happened is it's resulted in this imbalance in both numbers, but not just numbers, but socioeconomic status. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5071.395s">20%</a>  free and reduced lunch at the Andrews and 40% at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5076.076s">It's</a>  just like a huge discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5078.317s">So,</a>  we have to together come up with a way for parents to have a voice in school selection, but get around this issue that's occurred this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5086.879s">And</a>  again, we'll have to sit down together and put all of our minds to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5093.402s">We're</a>  planning for more programs at the McGlynn to perhaps attract some students back to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5101.967s">I</a>  know that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5102.748s">Lew</a>  and I have spoken already about an Odyssey of the Mind program, perhaps to go into the McGlynn, perhaps something around STEM. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5111.174s">which</a>  would be something beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5113.676s">And</a>  then we will look to move some EL classes back to the Andrews, similar to what occurred at the Roberts and the Brooks this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5123.802s">The</a>  thinking was, we used to have EL students in both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5127.184s">And</a>  then about, I want to say five years ago, we decided that we could actually use staff more efficiently if we had all of the students and all of the EL staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5136.57s">in</a>  one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5137.87s">But</a>  now the numbers have grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5139.591s">So,</a>  it's warranted that we could, again, have students move back and we would still not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5145.373s">What</a>  we're having before with so few EL students is that you'd have the EL teachers running between buildings and losing time having to travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5153.175s">But</a>  now we have so many more students, we feel we could have dedicated staff at each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5158.157s">So,</a>  we'll be looking to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5162.139s">And</a>  as we move forward, we will keep the committee informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5165.263s">We'll</a>  look to you for some guidance on some of these large issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5168.688s">And</a>  again, we welcome your input as we move forward and do our best to make this a better situation.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.068s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5177.248s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5178.649s">Beverly,</a>  one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5187.694s">And</a>  you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5193.457s">But</a>  it was more than that, because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5203.402s">I'm</a>  hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5223.42s">This</a>  was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5230.995s">In</a>  terms of the number of parents that wanted, we had a wait list.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5235.837s">We</a>  knew that... No, not in terms of that.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5237.798s">What's</a>  being done now to make sure those students are... We have, again, what happened during the summer is that some parents that would call my office, they again had information that their student was the only student who wasn't from that particular elementary school who wasn't going to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5253.585s">we</a>  said that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5254.926s">Again,</a>  lists were made available of other students that were from the same school that were gonna go to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5261.83s">The</a>  principals are aware, Mr. Edwards is aware of the students that really wanted to go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5268.834s">He's</a>  working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5269.874s">For</a>  example, that young girl who wants to be in the production at the Andrews, we're working with her family to make sure she's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5277.779s">And</a>  again, we're reassuring <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5279.921s">parents,</a>  and I know a lot of that I did this summer, is that the students adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5285.644s">And,</a>  you know, it's really beneficial sometimes to meet new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5289.546s">You're</a>  all going to be together in the high school in a few short years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5292.428s">But</a>  we will make that transition for those students and those families that didn't get their first choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5298.351s">We'll</a>  make sure that they <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5300.332s">you</a>  know, it's duly noted and that they, again, dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5303.475s">But</a>  I haven't gotten any phone calls since school began, quite honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5309.261s">So,</a>  everybody seems to have, I don't know if you have any, but I haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5312.885s">It</a>  seems like people are settling in and kids are settling in.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5316.469s">Like,</a>  I see that it says that we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5324.853s">And</a>  the thing is, I think we need to do that right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5327.794s">I</a>  want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5341.1s">No,</a>  we've already spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5342.181s">Paul</a>  and Jake both have sat down with me <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5345.089s">We're</a>  trying to see which clubs are the ones that, you know, more easily the kids can get to either school where they're going to be housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5352.337s">So,</a>  we're making a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5353.499s">And</a>  as I said, you know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5355.14s">Lew</a>  is very proactive and she wants to get something going right away with, you know, at least that one club. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5361.207s">And</a>  again, we're in the process of asking them what clubs they think that they want to add in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5366.794s">and</a>  then making sure we have the funding for the stipends for the teachers to, you know, jump to basically oversee to be facilitators of these clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5376.901s">And</a>  we're hoping that the teachers are gonna jump at the opportunity to run something new as well.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5382.165s">I</a>  think we usually plan for stipends to take place.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5385.247s">There</a>  is some, but we know we need additional, we need some additional ones and we're gonna prepare, we're prepared to entertain those requests.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5394.814s">Beth</a>  Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5395.294s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5397.08s">You</a>  had mentioned, I mean, Odyssey of the Mind with Miss Lowe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5400.964s">So,</a>  is that a gifted and talented program?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5403.406s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5403.886s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5404.267s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5404.827s">The</a>  thing is with the gifted and talented programs now, teachers that run them are supposed to have not a license, it's called an endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5413.355s">So,</a>  we're looking to see who might have that endorsement or <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5416.736s">If</a>  the person needs to get the endorsement, what they have to do to get it, and then we'll help them to get that endorsement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5422.56s">So</a>  there's a few little regulatory things that we have to look into.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5425.922s">And</a>  the same with that in the EL classes, are we looking for September of 2018 to <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5431.885s">move</a>  half the EL to the Andrews?</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5434.327s">Not</a>  maybe half, but maybe some of the programs, we'll take a look at what's going on and see what makes more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5441.292s">Again,</a>  we don't want to overcrowd the Andrews because we already have too many kids already, so we want to move kids in unless we can make sure that things are going to be a little bit more balanced all around.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5451.42s">And</a>  then, I don't know, because it's been 20 months, so it might have happened before I was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5457.125s">I</a>  was assigned to the Roberts for my children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5459.367s">And</a>  then I did not choose the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5461.369s">I</a>  love the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5462.15s">I</a>  can't say enough about Mr. Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5464.071s">But</a>  then I get to pick middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5465.833s">Why</a>  don't we just assign <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5468.522s">families</a>  to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a wait list.</p>

    <p>[Beverly Nelson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5472.845s">With</a>  your support we could entertain that as one of the options.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5475.686s">Before</a>  you go down that road, our schools were built on a racial balance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5484.191s">Schools</a>  were built with choice as one of the options. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5487.673s">And</a>  if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5492.82s">But</a>  I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the memo?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5495.743s">No,</a>  you could choose elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5497.205s">See,</a>  one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5501.065s">The</a>  essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5505.848s">So</a>  people, you know, it was a, let's say a progressive movement of youngsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5511.553s">But</a>  you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5516.336s">So</a>  there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5520.519s">It's</a>  happened all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5522.1s">But</a>  now people are getting settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5523.501s">They're</a>  getting comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5524.882s">And</a>  to some degree, things have sort of settled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5527.544s">People</a>  sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5534.068s">One</a>  of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5543.034s">And</a>  if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5548.578s">Just</a>  got to look at those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5549.619s">I</a>  mean, it's all part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5551.78s">Choice</a>  was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5556.264s">Right,</a>  but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5563.409s">Everyone</a>  thinks you go to the school closest to your house.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5565.811s">Well,</a>  you know, we get plenty of requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5568.694s">Maybe</a>  we don't see it.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5569.534s">You</a>  grant them.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5570.753s">We</a>  grant a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5572.294s">But</a>  you don't see them because you didn't make that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5574.796s">But</a>  we grant a lot of requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5576.298s">We</a>  take a look at class size first. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5578.579s">We</a>  take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5582.923s">We</a>  look at the balance between different populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5586.846s">But</a>  we have granted quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5588.627s">Diane,</a>  what would you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5590.389s">Because</a>  Diane handles the elementaries.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5593.816s">We</a>  do get a lot of requests for different areas in schools and for different reasons, but sometimes parents will send in a request because it's easier for them to get to work, to jump onto 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5606.584s">Sometimes</a>  we have requests from parents who have childcare issues and the childcare person is in another school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5614.709s">So,</a>  you know, I can't give you a specific number, but we do get requests.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5619.692s">I</a>  know, but we're not, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5621.413s">Selling</a>  ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5622.334s">I</a>  don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5627.417s">I</a>  don't there's really not a choice system So let's know unless you make the request you're going to write your school or you register your child.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5634.822s">I'm</a>  racist So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5645.97s">Right,</a>  who are in the know to write a letter or an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5649.192s">But</a>  when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5653.954s">They</a>  say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5656.976s">And</a>  unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5664.079s">Well,</a>  I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5676.822s">Right,</a>  but if we are, if for middle school you get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school, I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5689.798s">Well,</a>  then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5695.5s">Not</a>  if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5699.801s">Well,</a>  then no one gets a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5702.681s">This</a>  trade-off, so all of these systems, for the most part, it's worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5706.302s">This</a>  is a year where we have one real aberration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5709.103s">If</a>  you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlynn, it's within a few students of each other.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5714.905s">No,</a>  because you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5717.117s">The</a>  McGlynn used to be the choice school, and they had over-enrollment.</p>
