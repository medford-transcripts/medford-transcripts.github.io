[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven present, none absent.

19
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,552
[SPEAKER_14]: All please rise and salute our flag.

20
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I pledge allegiance to the flag

21
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:35,945
[SPEAKER_04]: to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:37,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke.

23
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:38,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

24
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:38,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

25
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:47,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to also acknowledge that we have a non-voting member, but our student representative, Sebastian Tringali, with us today.

26
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, Sebastian.

27
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for being here with us this evening.

28
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:55,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Let the records officially reflect Sebastian's presence, please.

29
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,437
[SPEAKER_14]: The first item, approval of minutes of September 11, 2017.

30
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,459

[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

34
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:09,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

35
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:10,645
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

36
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:11,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

37
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,628

38
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:15,028
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

39
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:15,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval.

40
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,989
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

41
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Approval of payrolls?

42
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,490
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

43
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:19,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of secretary?

44
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:20,613
[SPEAKER_14]: There is none.

45
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:21,193
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

46
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:22,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of committees?

47
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:23,295
[SPEAKER_14]: None.

48
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Community participation?

49
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:29,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Your name and address, please.

50
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Hanley Wells, 26 Curtis Street.

51
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on the issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school.

52
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:51,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th.

53
00:01:52,586 --> 00:02:01,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order.

54
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,052
[SPEAKER_07]: No court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of.

55
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:11,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Furthermore, Mr. Bellison has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover.

56
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:20,322
[SPEAKER_07]: They enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Bellison's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment.

57
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:33,471
[SPEAKER_07]: He indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court.

58
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:41,250
[SPEAKER_07]: A temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out.

59
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,532
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not working.

60
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:51,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover.

61
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:57,482
[SPEAKER_07]: This was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today.

62
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:05,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things.

63
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:13,717
[SPEAKER_07]: These parents will or would have worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field.

64
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,940
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out.

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford needs to be an option so that they can do this.

66
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room, or anyone outside this room, if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools.

67
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:38,626
[SPEAKER_07]: It is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment.

68
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:42,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

69
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:47,291
[SPEAKER_24]: Superintendent.

70
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,952
[SPEAKER_24]: So, on the 6th of September, I believe,

71
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,870
[SPEAKER_24]: for Ms.

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:02,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Knowles went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?

73
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:03,438
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

74
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:06,901
[SPEAKER_07]: The request was for a court order for school.

75
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,505
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a piece of paper, which I'll provide to the committee.

76
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,227
[SPEAKER_24]: Enroll to the public schools.

77
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,668
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a second thing.

78
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,649
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was denied again.

79
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:32,874
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.

80
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:40,920
[SPEAKER_24]: But more importantly, I was able to get consent from

81
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:48,940
[SPEAKER_24]: to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,143
[SPEAKER_24]: And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover public schools as they were in the past.

83
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:58,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They're enrolled in Medford as well prior to barring enrollment.

84
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,165
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, more than attending.

85
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:02,927
[SPEAKER_24]: They're attending the North Andover public schools and not out of school.

86
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:04,468
[SPEAKER_07]: They are out today.

87
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,548
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not going to go back and forth.

88
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:11,711
[SPEAKER_24]: My answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public School.

89
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:13,633
[SPEAKER_07]: That needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.

90
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Belkin has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.

91
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,037
[SPEAKER_24]: The parents have to work out their arrangement.

92
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:21,621
[SPEAKER_24]: We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.

93
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:26,105
[SPEAKER_24]: They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.

94
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,887
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what the court has told them repeatedly.

95
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:29,147
[SPEAKER_24]: work it out.

96
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:36,833
[SPEAKER_24]: If they work it out, and Medford is the choice, then they will be enrolled, registered, and students in the Medford public schools.

97
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:40,435
[SPEAKER_24]: But right now, the concern was, are they getting an education?

98
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:42,537
[SPEAKER_24]: They're in the North Andover public schools.

99
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,038
[SPEAKER_24]: And Principal Landry has confirmed that.

100
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,564
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out.

101
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:52,227
[SPEAKER_24]: By the way, this has been going on for a long time.

102
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:55,069
[SPEAKER_24]: This isn't something that only came about in the last month.

103
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,393
[SPEAKER_24]: This has been going on for an extended period of time.

104
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,275
[SPEAKER_24]: And so they've got to work it out.

105
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:06,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.

106
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:10,804
[SPEAKER_24]: But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.

107
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:13,847
[SPEAKER_24]: We've consulted with our legal counsel.

108
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,549
[SPEAKER_24]: We've gone over this matter multiple times.

109
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:17,910
[SPEAKER_24]: We've spoken to North Andover.

110
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,972
[SPEAKER_24]: They're in the North Andover public schools.

111
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:25,076
[SPEAKER_24]: If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.

112
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,738
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the way to move on the issue.

113
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:31,061
[SPEAKER_24]: And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms.

114
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,463
[SPEAKER_14]: How can it be Medford when you said no?

115
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:33,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

116
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:34,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Wells.

117
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:35,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Doctor.

118
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:35,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Wells.

119
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:36,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

120
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:39,908
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like to speak.

121
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:43,959
[SPEAKER_07]: How can they work it out if you're barring enrollment?

122
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:51,164
[SPEAKER_07]: You're leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents, and you favored the other party in saying, go to North Andover.

123
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,946
[SPEAKER_24]: Didn't do anything.

124
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:53,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You did.

125
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You barred enrollment.

126
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.

127
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:08,037
[SPEAKER_24]: From our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right

128
00:07:09,115 --> 00:07:11,915
[SPEAKER_24]: to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.

129
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:22,257
[SPEAKER_24]: If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford.

130
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:25,118
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.

131
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:26,798
[SPEAKER_24]: We consulted with the state.

132
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:31,159
[SPEAKER_24]: If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.

133
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,080
[SPEAKER_24]: But the state actually asked us, and I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.

134
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,266
[SPEAKER_24]: because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.

135
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,746
[SPEAKER_24]: We declined to do that.

136
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:47,647
[SPEAKER_07]: The case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover.

137
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,188
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not in agreement with North Andover.

138
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to take it.

139
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,010
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have gone to Medford today.

140
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,861
[SPEAKER_24]: So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.

141
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but that's not yours.

142
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:04,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

143
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,685
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.

144
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:07,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Get together.

145
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Solve the issue.

146
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:09,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say yes, Mr. Belson.

147
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,390
[SPEAKER_24]: And whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.

148
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,471
[SPEAKER_07]: We will if you say yes.

149
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,192
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no.

150
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:14,533
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not me to say yes.

151
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:17,236
[SPEAKER_24]: It's for you to solve it with the court.

152
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,897
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't if you say no.

153
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:20,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, you can.

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,700
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, you can.

155
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the court wants you to work it out.

156
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,650
[SPEAKER_24]: If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.

157
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,971
[SPEAKER_24]: The court denied it again.

158
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:31,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Dismissed the case, sir.

159
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: If you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.

160
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,816
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan.

161
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:45,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you please step forward?

162
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:04,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did.

163
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:24,303
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment.

164
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,363
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court.

165
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:47,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work.

166
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:54,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, she had requested, uh, that, uh,

167
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,274
[SPEAKER_22]: The court ordered that.

168
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:07,819
[SPEAKER_22]: The court made a decision on September 6, 2017, and denied the request.

169
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Denied without prejudice the determination of the merits.

170
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:13,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

171
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:18,123
[SPEAKER_22]: So the request for temporary relief

172
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:26,066
[SPEAKER_22]: filed by the plaintiff in this matter was denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court.

173
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:41,190
[SPEAKER_22]: From my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff.

174
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:48,112
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one, I believe, was to request an order

175
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,425
[SPEAKER_22]: that they be enrolled in Medford.

176
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:58,348
[SPEAKER_22]: So a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms.

177
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:14,752
[SPEAKER_22]: Knowles, and it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court.

178
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:21,869
[SPEAKER_22]: until either a trial on the merits or any other further rulings of the court.

179
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask one question?

180
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:38,053
[SPEAKER_14]: At any point during the probate and future court hearings throughout the course of separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?

181
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:40,594
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

182
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,414
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't believe so, but I don't know.

183
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:44,115
[SPEAKER_07]: There is not.

184
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:54,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So this did go to trial, Mayor, and the determination of the trial that was in March was for the parents to decide and to go to mediation, which I did.

185
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:58,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see by the motion for the hearing, they were unable to come to an agreement.

186
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, like I said, I know these parents well.

187
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,463
[SPEAKER_07]: They will and would work it out.

188
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:06,806
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an even playing field and there was no forced

189
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,976
[SPEAKER_07]: forced decision to go to a district that is not an option.

190
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:24,541
[SPEAKER_07]: But from March through September, they weren't able to reach a decision on their own, which is why they're asking the court to intervene.

191
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

192
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And the court is not going to touch it.

193
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:32,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know why Mr. Belson feels that he is above a judge in making a decision on where they should go.

194
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:35,247
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor, I just

195
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:47,662
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Mr. Belson has stated that he would welcome the enrollment of these children once this matter is resolved in the Essex County Probate Court.

196
00:12:48,442 --> 00:13:02,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Specifically, in May of 2017, the motion was, the request was to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools specifically.

197
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,068
[SPEAKER_22]: That was brought in May of 2017.

198
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:15,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Judge Ordonez denied that motion that specifically requested that the children be enrolled in Medford.

199
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,071
[SPEAKER_22]: That was denied.

200
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:29,615
[SPEAKER_22]: There was an additional motion filed on and ruled on again this September, which denied the relief sought by Ms.

201
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:30,436
[SPEAKER_22]: Knowles.

202
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,277
[SPEAKER_22]: So until there is a trial on the merits,

203
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:48,813
[SPEAKER_22]: or any other rulings by the court, I would recommend that these children not be enrolled in Medford until further order of the court.

204
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:57,296
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, Mr. Greenspan, the court has made it clear they are not going to make a decision on school district.

205
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,756
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not going to be a trial.

206
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:01,657
[SPEAKER_07]: They're done.

207
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,758
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not ordering a district.

208
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:12,006
[SPEAKER_13]: The parent in North Andover, is she willing to unenroll them in North Andover to enroll them here?

209
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:13,747
[SPEAKER_07]: They will work it out.

210
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:34,342
[SPEAKER_07]: If she was unwilling to drive, she was unwilling to drive to Medford to bring them to school today because of the distance and her unwillingness to move and do other, we've offered private school, we've offered in the middle, we've offered to do the transporting and meet in the middle, we've offered many accommodations to her and all she wants is to have them in her district, not have to drive,

211
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:37,087
[SPEAKER_07]: and to not be accountable to anything.

212
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's not really willing to compromise, but if Medford was an option, I assure you, there would be an agreement.

213
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:55,184
[SPEAKER_07]: They worked the things out in their own way, and if both schools were an option, I am, she would probably not want to drive to Medford to pick them up.

214
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Five days a week, because they're with us five days a week.

215
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.

216
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

217
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:10,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be not an issue.

218
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,070
[SPEAKER_05]: The superintendent wouldn't,

219
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,231
[SPEAKER_05]: there would be not an issue.

220
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:22,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.

221
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are not okay with North Andover, but North Andover didn't say no.

222
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason they're North Andover is because they didn't say no.

223
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not agreeing with North Andover.

224
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were in North Andover last year, correct?

225
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,603
[SPEAKER_07]: No, kindergarten, she was in pre-kindergarten.

226
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:35,644
[SPEAKER_07]: In North Andover.

227
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:42,008
[SPEAKER_07]: So pre-k she was in Wilmington, and Avery attended kindergarten at Atkinson.

228
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:50,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Temporarily until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.

229
00:15:50,571 --> 00:16:00,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in Medford the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North Andover and

230
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:08,330
[SPEAKER_24]: The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.

231
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,151
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.

232
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:15,191
[SPEAKER_24]: They're in school.

233
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto?

234
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a similar question to my colleague.

235
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So my own question is,

236
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:35,623
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone had not petitioned for a specific district, then both parents would be on even still.

237
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:41,785
[SPEAKER_10]: But because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference.

238
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:48,667
[SPEAKER_10]: If the other parent had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover.

239
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:49,768
[SPEAKER_10]: But that didn't happen.

240
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:57,810
[SPEAKER_10]: where, like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.

241
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, can we have a court order?

242
00:16:59,771 --> 00:16:59,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

243
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,312
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, parents decide, right?

244
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Parents decide where to send their kids all the time.

245
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:13,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't want to be involved with all due respect, just please unbar their enrollment so that we can work this out.

246
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I assure you, it will be fine.

247
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:18,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's North End or Medford, we will let you know.

248
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:19,757
[SPEAKER_07]: But this needs to be a yes.

249
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:22,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

250
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:22,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Cunha.

251
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,977
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.

252
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:32,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us.

253
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:46,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.

254
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:46,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they will.

255
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:52,477
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the other hand, I'm reading this and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable

256
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,781
[SPEAKER_11]: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work.

257
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:57,561
[SPEAKER_07]: We did.

258
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

259
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's currently in certain places.

260
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,969
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.

261
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,874
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,

262
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:29,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there So two days a week no, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us That's on the documentation so what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know we want to we want to

263
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:41,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Understand where you're coming from but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford Then the parents would come to an agreement

264
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:50,311
[SPEAKER_11]: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.

265
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:57,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to understand that they have a history of going through the courts for a lot of things.

266
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:58,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The court, their file is very thick.

267
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:02,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And they aren't going to resolve things in court.

268
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,439
[SPEAKER_07]: They resolve things in their own way.

269
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been a witness to this.

270
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:21,100
[SPEAKER_07]: It works for them eventually, but you can't decide for them that it's going to be Northendover because you've given her a lot of freedom and now she's going to go and file for having custody during the week.

271
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now we have them five days.

272
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:36,208
[SPEAKER_11]: But it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities and towns that the other parent is willing to move to, including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield, and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.

273
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:45,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not going to move out of there, or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.

274
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:46,952
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, I mean,

275
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:56,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.

276
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:05,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, there's no reason for her to work with us because there's a note from Medford, so why should she have to give on anything?

277
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:08,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading or Wakefield or Reading.

278
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:09,264
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't live there.

279
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:15,248
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but what I'm saying is that, I'm just going by what you're saying, and that is that even if we opened up Medford,

280
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:18,542
[SPEAKER_11]: According to the documentation that you have given us from the court

281
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:27,136
[SPEAKER_11]: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.

282
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.

283
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's any other, you know.

284
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: The court, that's the motion.

285
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:35,559
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the motion, right.

286
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:43,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just, we've, demonstrating that we've made many offers to move to the same district together, private school, et cetera, et cetera.

287
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:43,842
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made options.

288
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and they've refused.

289
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so now we're just Medford versus North Andover right now.

290
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:52,163
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me ask this, OK?

291
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:56,905
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, OK?

292
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,626
[SPEAKER_24]: Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.

293
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,707
[SPEAKER_24]: She's filed the motion.

294
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,988
[SPEAKER_24]: If she thought that we didn't have

295
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:09,138
[SPEAKER_24]: a solid position, she'd be in our face.

296
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:10,579
[SPEAKER_24]: But she's not.

297
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:11,779
[SPEAKER_24]: You're coming here.

298
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,559
[SPEAKER_07]: She costs $300 an hour, sir.

299
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,060
[SPEAKER_24]: But you know what?

300
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,160
[SPEAKER_24]: She's the legal representative for you.

301
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Mia, I'm calling you because you're not taking our calls.

302
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:20,561
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not calling.

303
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:21,581
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying sue us.

304
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:22,362
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry?

305
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:23,982
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying if she sued us.

306
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:24,442
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, no.

307
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:30,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.

308
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,124
[SPEAKER_24]: But I called the Department of Education.

309
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:36,585
[SPEAKER_24]: And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.

310
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:54,414
[SPEAKER_24]: They went over it and quite frankly They're sustained our position so if believe me if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled the Department of Elementary and secondary education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my Opportunity to do so believe me.

311
00:21:54,454 --> 00:22:01,738
[SPEAKER_24]: They would not let me do we've been in through this many times with with desi if there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled

312
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:08,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.

313
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:12,745
[SPEAKER_24]: So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.

314
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:18,911
[SPEAKER_07]: With all due respect, there is no immigration, there's no... I know, but what I'm saying is... No, no, no.

315
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,513
[SPEAKER_14]: You're saying DESE tends to lean on the way of the child.

316
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So DESE, we closed a follow-up on them, and they said, we closed it because you informed them they were enrolled and everybody's happy with North Andover.

317
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:33,801
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I did that today because I got a note from Greg Landry, who's the principal at Atkinson, says they're enrolled.

318
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't mean we agree with that.

319
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,124
[SPEAKER_07]: You spoke to DESE last week as well.

320
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, I spoke to DESE today, too.

321
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:40,926
[SPEAKER_07]: What about us?

322
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,547
[SPEAKER_07]: What about our disagreement with North Vandenberg?

323
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,770
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the fact that the kids would be commuting five days a week back and forth?

324
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,812
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that they didn't go to school today because their parent didn't pick them up.

325
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,133
[SPEAKER_07]: An unreliable parent didn't pick them up.

326
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,715
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your responsibility to us?

327
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:59,695
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there.

328
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:03,638
[SPEAKER_24]: It can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.

329
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,682
[SPEAKER_24]: It's got to be a decision made by a third party.

330
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:08,943
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'll be happy to do it.

331
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:14,467
[SPEAKER_24]: We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go-ahead, but we don't.

332
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

333
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:22,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?

334
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:29,145
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.

335
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:32,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a 50-50 schedule, but as you can see from the email right now,

336
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: because she asked.

337
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:39,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I think she's asking for something legal from the court system that talks about custody, not an email chain.

338
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:40,869
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be here until December.

339
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,190
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be here until December.

340
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,910
[SPEAKER_07]: She's petitioning to try to get them.

341
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,630
[SPEAKER_14]: The one you have in place right now.

342
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,371
[SPEAKER_07]: We have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

343
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:50,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So a 50-50 schedule.

344
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:51,811
[SPEAKER_07]: However, she does not.

345
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,512
[SPEAKER_07]: She switched her work schedule, so she works weekends.

346
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The children are now with us on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

347
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:01,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And many more until they're picked up.

348
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:07,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover.

349
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:15,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.

350
00:24:15,928 --> 00:24:16,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it matter?

351
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:21,834
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not about how many nights there are, it's where their social activities are and where they're involved.

352
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheryl coaches soccer, both teams, you know, 12 to 3, both kids.

353
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:30,303
[SPEAKER_07]: They have friends in the community.

354
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:33,965
[SPEAKER_07]: They go to school, they go to park and the kids say, hey, what class are you in?

355
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's quite troublesome.

356
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:39,007
[SPEAKER_07]: All of their social activities are here in Medford.

357
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:39,888
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where they live.

358
00:24:40,468 --> 00:24:45,010
[SPEAKER_07]: These parents will work out the school issue and transportation if you just let us work, do it on our time.

359
00:24:49,882 --> 00:25:11,670
[SPEAKER_22]: No, the only thing I can say is that There was a specific request again in May Requesting to enroll the children in Medford that was denied the court is again denied any change in these orders and There was an original

360
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:25,584
[SPEAKER_22]: request in May, and a motion was made in May to specifically ask the court to make an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools.

361
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,906
[SPEAKER_22]: Specifically, the motion was denied.

362
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:37,409
[SPEAKER_22]: There was another request to modify that in September of 2017, denied again.

363
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:43,171
[SPEAKER_22]: So until there is some further clarification or a ruling at trial,

364
00:25:45,134 --> 00:26:01,710
[SPEAKER_22]: I would recommend strongly that the committee not enroll or order these children enrolled in Medford until there is further court orders to that effect or an agreement by the parties.

365
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get you an agreement.

366
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,841
[SPEAKER_07]: If you let us, if you say yes to Medford, we'll get you an agreement.

367
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,841
[SPEAKER_14]: If you got an agreement, you'd get yes to Medford.

368
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,262
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the quagmire we're in right now.

369
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:21,464
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have been in Medford today, and if they'd been in Medford Wednesday when we have them, on Thursday and Friday, and she was tired of driving back and forth from Northland to Medford, she would give in, and in Medford it would be.

370
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,965
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me just say one more thing.

371
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,726
[SPEAKER_24]: My own gut tells me the following.

372
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:31,254
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.

373
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:38,119
[SPEAKER_24]: The reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year.

374
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Leave them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there.

375
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:46,784
[SPEAKER_24]: The other child, okay, so they're two together.

376
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:57,188
[SPEAKER_24]: And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.

377
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,369
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're gonna play one off against the other.

378
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:08,352
[SPEAKER_24]: The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,

379
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:13,232
[SPEAKER_24]: The court will make a decision, and you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.

380
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:16,436
[SPEAKER_24]: We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.

381
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:16,917
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all.

382
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,318
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not against it.

383
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,180
[SPEAKER_24]: We like children.

384
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We like enrollment.

385
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:22,403
[SPEAKER_07]: North Andover didn't wait for a go-ahead.

386
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And because you said no, it has to be North Andover.

387
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:25,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get this?

388
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,488
[SPEAKER_07]: North Andover didn't need a go-ahead.

389
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:28,930
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in this district.

390
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you saying no?

391
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,452
[SPEAKER_24]: We're at a council, I tell you.

392
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:38,994
[SPEAKER_07]: The council keeps saying the same thing over and over again, which is that no court made an order.

393
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:42,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's saying he doesn't recommend it, but there's no court order saying they can't go to Medford.

394
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:44,018
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

395
00:27:44,978 --> 00:27:51,402
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a court order denying, denying enrollment in the Medford Public Schools.

396
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:53,003
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the order.

397
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:54,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Please read it to us.

398
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:55,205
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have to.

399
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:56,485
[SPEAKER_22]: I've read it to myself.

400
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:58,006
[SPEAKER_22]: The committee has it.

401
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,689
[SPEAKER_22]: The court has denied the order in May.

402
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Denied an order.

403
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,710
[SPEAKER_22]: It's been revisited again in September.

404
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,732
[SPEAKER_22]: They've denied that again.

405
00:28:09,012 --> 00:28:14,955
[SPEAKER_22]: The superintendent has stated that he is willing to enroll these children.

406
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:19,298
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have an agreement or a court order.

407
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:35,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Either way, if there is an agreement between the parents or a court order modifying what is in front of us now, the superintendent has stated he's willing to enroll these children in the Medford Public Schools.

408
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:49,612
[SPEAKER_22]: And my recommendation, again, is to wait either for a order from the trial on the merits or until there's a reversal of this motion or until there is an agreement.

409
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:55,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford has not said no.

410
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:04,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford is willing to enroll these children if this court order is modified or is there an agreement between the parties.

411
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,294
[SPEAKER_07]: if Medford's saying no and North Danaver is the only option?

412
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,100
[SPEAKER_07]: If the two parents agree, we will take the children.

413
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,764
[SPEAKER_07]: How can they agree if she has no reason to wait?

414
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:19,691
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's not willing to drive back and forth to get the kids to school, clearly she... In the meantime, they're out?

415
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:22,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like when she doesn't want to drive down here?

416
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, ma'am?

417
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:24,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

418
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:24,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry.

419
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:30,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctor, reading through the documents that you presented us, mediation was suggested by the courts.

420
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,181
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened in mediation?

421
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,021
[SPEAKER_14]: That it failed.

422
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,022
[SPEAKER_14]: It worked.

423
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:37,325
[SPEAKER_14]: The parties went to mediation and could not reach an agreement.

424
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:43,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So Cheryl, my partner, offered to change the schedule for her request if she was willing to be in Medford schools.

425
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't want to compromise on anything.

426
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:50,710
[SPEAKER_04]: What did the original custody agreement indicate?

427
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,771
[SPEAKER_07]: The original custody agreement is she has them Monday and Tuesday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

428
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:57,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheryl had them Monday and Tuesday?

429
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,032
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Nicole.

430
00:29:58,052 --> 00:29:58,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicole, okay.

431
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

432
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,854
[SPEAKER_07]: What's 50-50, five and two?

433
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:04,334
[SPEAKER_07]: What's 50-50?

434
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Could I follow up on that?

435
00:30:05,914 --> 00:30:05,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

436
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:06,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Cunha.

437
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:07,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Doctor.

438
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,816
[SPEAKER_11]: When we first spoke, and up until just a little while ago,

439
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:18,618
[SPEAKER_11]: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, because the children could go to school Monday through Friday.

440
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:19,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Five days a week.

441
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:21,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, five days a week.

442
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five days a week.

443
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:25,503
[SPEAKER_07]: But not every week.

444
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but they don't go to school.

445
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:27,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week, since March.

446
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,346
[SPEAKER_11]: But they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday.

447
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:40,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but there's... So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,

448
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.

449
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:50,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?

450
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm really confused.

451
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?

452
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I assure you if they were in Medford Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

453
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,696
[SPEAKER_07]: North Ender would not allow them to go to school Monday and Tuesdays only.

454
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:06,698
[SPEAKER_07]: They would say, hey, your kids are missing too much school.

455
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

456
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Three days out of the week is more than two.

457
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,661
[SPEAKER_07]: They would be going to Medford.

458
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:11,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Three days.

459
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:16,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, five, because she doesn't want to transport on Mondays apparently either.

460
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:17,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So four days.

461
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:20,291
[SPEAKER_11]: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get?

462
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:23,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she said they missed school today because she didn't want to drop them.

463
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,204
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to understand it with a few pieces of paper when you have a whole file at home.

464
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,685
[SPEAKER_14]: So just please bear with us.

465
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:32,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

466
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:39,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, this isn't something that really should be discussed in front of every person in the city of Medford.

467
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,354
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is a private matter.

468
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:47,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And I highly advise that if we need to continue this, that we go into executive session for the respect of your family.

469
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:49,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to do that if Mr. Belson would turn my phone calls.

470
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:52,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I called the office.

471
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:53,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I leave messages.

472
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:53,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hear back.

473
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:57,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could get a meeting with Mr. Velson and yourself, that would be great.

474
00:31:57,906 --> 00:32:01,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe our attorneys, I would sell for that.

475
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:03,369
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me just say one more thing.

476
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,209
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know your status.

477
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:10,072
[SPEAKER_24]: But as far as I know, you're a significant other, but not a custodial parent.

478
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:10,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I right?

479
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a custodial parent, no.

480
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:12,273
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

481
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,954
[SPEAKER_24]: So as a result, I can't talk to you about the trial technically.

482
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with permission, you can.

483
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:18,315
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, I don't have that.

484
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,396
[SPEAKER_24]: No one gave me that permission yet.

485
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:24,617
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is a complicated little circle here.

486
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:30,278
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's filled with all kinds of potholes of things that we can and can't do.

487
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:41,801
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the court had said, you can put them in part time, but the court is probably saying, I don't want to split the week up for these kids.

488
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:43,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Let them be in one place and not in two places.

489
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem with it.

490
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:45,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

491
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't work for either party.

492
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:59,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So I move that the party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent.

493
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:00,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded.

494
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:01,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded.

495
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,981
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion, roll call vote please.

496
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:07,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Cugno?

497
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:07,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

498
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

499
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:09,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

500
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:10,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Kreatz?

501
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:11,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

502
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Mustone?

503
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

504
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Scurry?

505
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:13,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

506
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:14,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Van der Kloot?

507
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:14,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

508
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:15,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke?

509
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:15,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

510
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:17,124
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

511
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:17,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

512
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Report of superintendent.

513
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on Team Medford supply drive.

514
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,753
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our deputy superintendent to take the lead on this.

515
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:35,478
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford, and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.

516
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:38,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're here with our team.

517
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:41,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask our team to come up with me.

518
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very special occasion.

519
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:47,448
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 10th year we're having an anniversary tonight.

520
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:53,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We celebrate our 10th anniversary.

521
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it, yes, at Market Basket, yes.

522
00:33:56,892 --> 00:33:58,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We do great work together.

523
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:01,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But once again, we are indebted to Team Medford.

524
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam Terabelsi every year comes through.

525
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:12,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I know he would because I also discovered we went to the same high school, Watertown High School, which I didn't know until this year.

526
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:14,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we learned good things there.

527
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to ask Sam to come up and introduce his team that's with him tonight.

528
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:22,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We, every year, go over the previous year amount.

529
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: This year was $28,000 with Staples being our prime donator.

530
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:36,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, a lot of constituents participated in this and we have as a result school supplies that arrived before the first day of school.

531
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Principals picked them up.

532
00:34:39,268 --> 00:34:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Students had them in their hands the first day of school.

533
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are indebted to Sam and I will let him speak and then we'll have cake.

534
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:49,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, Beverly.

535
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:51,680
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, 10 years.

536
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

537
00:34:56,043 --> 00:35:06,070
[SPEAKER_20]: I imagine the idea just came in as part of our sort of, as we started this committee, about 16 of us and sitting and thinking, what else can we do with the city?

538
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,833
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we connect the hospital with the city?

539
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:16,596
[SPEAKER_20]: And certainly, our thoughts were more with the school programs, which I've known Mr. Belson for many years.

540
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:23,000
[SPEAKER_20]: And then one member just said, well, what if we do this back to school drive?

541
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,381
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it just got 16 of us.

542
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, that's a good thing.

543
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:28,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's talk about it.

544
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:30,744
[SPEAKER_20]: And the rest was history.

545
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:34,767
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just a team of volunteers from the hospital,

546
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:46,817
[SPEAKER_20]: which we still have team effort that we do on multiple things, including what we do in Kiwanis, the chamber, Tufts Community Day, and the mayor's outing that we do.

547
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:50,799
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we really thought about it,

548
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,701
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just became natural for us.

549
00:35:55,122 --> 00:36:06,428
[SPEAKER_20]: It just, you know, we look for that moment, that June email that I've already sort of put together to Beverly to say, what do you, all of the principals, what do they need?

550
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:10,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Let us know, because we're gonna go and get what their needs are.

551
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:19,616
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I wanna thank Staples, which is our major donor, and thanks Little Rocco, who has been the driving force trying to get

552
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:24,565
[SPEAKER_20]: donate for us the amount that they donate.

553
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:31,431
[SPEAKER_20]: But many other organizations and all the employees at Hallmark Health Lawrence Memorial contributed to this.

554
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:41,840
[SPEAKER_20]: And before I introduce the members, I'm going to just introduce or really mention some of these groups, like the Medford Kiwanis, this year the Rotary Club.

555
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:58,736
[SPEAKER_20]: the PTO, and then we have Armstrong, we also have Genesis, our nursing home, and then many other folks that just came in and offered their checks, their cash, and we have gone and bought certain things to really make it happen.

556
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:03,501
[SPEAKER_20]: So my committee that's here is Lou Rocco, he's been from day one.

557
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:13,911
[SPEAKER_20]: We got from Armstrong, Chris Hill, representing Armstrong, which every year they make donations to our program, and they have a box in their local place that they collect.

558
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:21,438
[SPEAKER_20]: This is my partner, Janet Perrault, she's always there with us trying to get this program going too.

559
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:22,479
[SPEAKER_20]: for us.

560
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Joe Raffles again has been over and over an outstanding gentleman.

561
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:33,884
[SPEAKER_20]: He's in Italy as he usually is and he just again looks forward to this.

562
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:42,267
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, thank you so much for allowing us to do this and giving us this opportunity to give back to the students and make their school year a successful year.

563
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:42,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

564
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:56,211
[SPEAKER_14]: On behalf of all of the children of the city of Medford, we want to thank you for all the hard work you do, how you coordinate this and get so many backpacks in the hands of needy children.

565
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:00,774
[SPEAKER_14]: We're astounded and we're just so thankful to have you a part of our community, so thank you all.

566
00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:12,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for coming tonight.

567
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

568
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:16,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept.

569
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:17,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to accept by Ms.

570
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Cunha, seconded by Ms.

571
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Kritz.

572
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,160
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

573
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

574
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,360
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

575
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

576
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on a Giro backpack donation program.

577
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:31,923
[SPEAKER_24]: So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.

578
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:35,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it proper to say, let them eat cake?

579
00:38:35,158 --> 00:38:36,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

580
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:48,256
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to our team Medford Patriots and whatever they do for us in Medford Public Schools, we also need to take this opportunity to thank Jero.

581
00:38:49,789 --> 00:39:11,234
[SPEAKER_08]: specifically Mr. Sidney Wolfe, the founder of Agero and the cross-country group, David Farrick, who is CEO and President of Agero, Sandy Savage, Vice President of Human Resources, Sandy Reyes, Human Resources Business Partner, and all the local employees of Agero for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies.

582
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:17,875
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like Beverly, when I get that phone call from Sandy Reyes at Agero saying, are you coming?

583
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:30,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just there, Michelle and I, my administrative assistant and I go over to Ajero and we get 60 backpacks and they're filled with school supplies for the kids.

584
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:38,211
[SPEAKER_08]: There are pencils and pens and markers and notebooks all filled and even additional boxes that we have.

585
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not just for elementary, we try to parcel it out so we can give some of the backpacks to middle schools as well.

586
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:52,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So together our principals decided that the backpacks should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students.

587
00:39:52,966 --> 00:40:03,672
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also saved a number of the backpacks to present to the Department of Social Services at our regular holiday donation drive, which I think most of you know we've been doing this for years now.

588
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:06,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So we keep some of those backpacks back.

589
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:16,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are just so fortunate to have generous partners such as Agero who continue to make a real difference in the lives of our children in school.

590
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:27,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So, currently the backpacks are in my literacy office and we will be disseminating maybe six or ten per school for the elementary and the middle schools.

591
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:35,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And then obviously we'll give some supplies to our high school and our vocational schools, pencils and pens and whatever they need as well.

592
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:43,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Wolfe couldn't be here tonight, but he wanted to send his best, and we just want to thank all our great business partners.

593
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:43,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

594
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:44,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

595
00:40:45,219 --> 00:41:01,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Ajero and Mr. Wolfe to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations.

596
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.

597
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:03,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

598
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:04,828
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion.

[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

604
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,350
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Superintendent, we'll get a letter out tomorrow.

607
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:13,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

608
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:14,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

609
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:14,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell.

610
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:17,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

611
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:18,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved.

612
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:18,915
[SPEAKER_14]: So moved.

613
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:19,995
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

614
00:41:20,015 --> 00:41:20,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

615
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:21,356
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

616
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:22,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

617
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on meeting with Wegmans.

618
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:25,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

619
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:26,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelson.

620
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, from one store to the other, a market basket to Wegmans.

621
00:41:33,882 --> 00:41:46,709
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesday, August 15th, Wegmans hosted an informational meeting for several non-profits, community school, and city leaders at their offices at Station Landing in Medford.

622
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:53,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to attend, along with Diane Caldwell, Chad Fallon, Jill Sawyer, and Lisa Evangelista.

623
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:56,234
[SPEAKER_02]: We all represented the school district at the meeting.

624
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:05,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purpose of the meeting is that the staff of Wegmans really wanted to learn more about what they could do for the community and for the schools.

625
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,607
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot to offer.

626
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:10,426
[SPEAKER_02]: are still hiring.

627
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:15,068
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an article actually in the transcript that spoke to this meeting and what they're doing.

628
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:23,212
[SPEAKER_02]: They're marking their 100th anniversary, and they actually have been named one of the best places to work in the United States.

629
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:38,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We were welcomed by the store manager, Kevin Russell, the store manager, the Medford service manager, Paula Colnane, and Mary Ellen Burris, who is the senior vice president of consumer affairs.

630
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:46,705
[SPEAKER_02]: All three have had longstanding roles in the company and could not speak more highly about what the company has done for their careers and communities.

631
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:52,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Wegmans offers scholarships and some of the people there actually started as clerks.

632
00:42:52,889 --> 00:43:00,815
[SPEAKER_02]: They started in Wegmans in different parts of the country and they were given scholarships and they continued their undergraduate and graduate studies.

633
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very generous.

634
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: We could not be more warmly welcomed by them.

635
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:13,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only did they have a lovely breakfast for us, they again wanted to know what we could do, what they could do for us moving forward.

636
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:21,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're hoping that some of our students will apply for some of the part-time jobs because it can lead to scholarship opportunities for them.

637
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: They also gave us a lovely goody bag, which contained breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next couple of days.

638
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:29,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Their products are really lovely.

639
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all the ingredients.

640
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very concerned about food allergies, things that we're concerned about in the schools as well.

641
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So we welcomed them to Medford.

642
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:43,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't speak more highly of things that they wanted to do for us, and we will coordinate

643
00:43:43,935 --> 00:44:09,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably through Lisa and the school so that not everybody's kind of at the same time asking for things all during the school year They're officially open November 5th So, thank you for the report and I'm glad we're starting early Next time I'd like to come to that meeting make sure you're included

644
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,072
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

645
00:44:12,212 --> 00:44:17,536
[SPEAKER_10]: My real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans?

646
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:25,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't know if they meal prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge.

647
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:31,266
[SPEAKER_10]: So the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.

648
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Chad and Jill were there at the meeting.

649
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,370
[SPEAKER_02]: We did inform them about the new restaurant that's opening at the school.

650
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:42,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sure they will further those discussions because they were present.

651
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:46,136
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will also have a restaurant on site as well within the Wegmans.

652
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:50,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op.

653
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:59,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.

654
00:44:59,624 --> 00:45:01,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned that to them, that we would invite them.

655
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:03,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Chad mentioned that, that they would be invited to that too.

656
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

657
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:05,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

658
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:05,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

659
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:09,091
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of this report be placed on file.

660
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:11,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Moved by Mr. Brennan, seconded by Ms.

00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:11,472
[SPEAKER_14]: VandeVleut.

00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:12,173
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

663
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:12,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:13,974
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

00:45:14,154 --> 00:45:14,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Report on stop-and-shop donation to the metropolitan schools so report Stop-and-shop is still working out the details so tonight.

667
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:42,173

668
00:45:44,256 --> 00:45:49,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Update report on public release of MCAS 2.0 information and accountability ratings.

669
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,225
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to call upon our director of curriculum, Bernadette Riccidelli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.

670
00:45:57,926 --> 00:45:58,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

671
00:45:59,744 --> 00:46:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am here to report tonight on the scheduled releases of our assessment results for MCAS.

672
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:18,957
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next generation MCAS in grades three through eight, and the legacy MCAS, which is the old traditional MCAS at the high school, and also the accountability ratings.

673
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:22,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've written a lot in the report.

674
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I've taken the schedule directly from the Department of Ed site, so you have all of the dates.

675
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:30,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I've highlighted the major dates in the report.

676
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:35,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you can see, as early as June, we were receiving some raw data.

677
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:43,190
[SPEAKER_09]: For the purpose of this report, I started in August where we started seeing some of the preliminary data in raw format.

678
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:47,253
[SPEAKER_09]: both the assessment as well as the accountability.

679
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:53,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So just jumping forward because everyone is waiting for the official results to come out.

680
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to wait until mid-October this year.

681
00:46:56,322 --> 00:46:59,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like each year it's getting a little bit later.

682
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:11,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So, October 24th is the date in which the official district and school level MCAS and the MCAS alt results are released to the public.

683
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,670
[SPEAKER_09]: The official accountability reports for all districts and schools will be released to the public.

684
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:22,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the printed MCAS parent guardian reports will be received by the superintendent's office.

685
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:23,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So October 24th is that date.

686
00:47:24,335 --> 00:47:32,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they do say that is an estimate, so we're planning right around that date for the results to be released.

687
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:42,938
[SPEAKER_09]: So certainly we will be preparing reports for you so that as soon as possible, once they're unembargoed, we can report those to you.

688
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:55,045
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the accountability schedule, reporting schedule is concerned, if we go back to November of 2015, the Board of Education amended the accountability system that we had in place.

689
00:47:56,146 --> 00:48:09,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was done so that districts and schools administering the next generation MCAS assessment in grades three through eight this past spring would not have their accountability results negatively impacted based on those scores.

690
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:27,934
[SPEAKER_09]: This regulation allows the Department of Education to limit the use of levels one through three this fall for any school that enrolls students in grades three through eight, as long as the school has a participation rate of at least 90% in the administration of this past spring's MCAS.

691
00:48:28,435 --> 00:48:30,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So participation rate is key.

692
00:48:38,422 --> 00:48:39,343
[SPEAKER_09]: that's important to know.

693
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, not so much the assessment results, but participation.

694
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:56,880
[SPEAKER_09]: The Department of Ed will publish next generation MCAS results for each school and district, including a normative measure of achievement to help districts and the Department of Ed identify schools that may require support.

695
00:48:58,495 --> 00:49:12,420
[SPEAKER_09]: The Department of Ed will report the participation rate separately for English language arts, mathematics, and science, and for each district and school as a whole, as well as for each subgroup.

696
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, they're looking for a 90% participation rate.

697
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:26,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Schools that assess at least 90% of their students in all groups and subjects will not be assigned an accountability and assistance level of 1 to 3, 1, 2, or 3.

698
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:34,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Any school or district with participation rates below 90% for any group of students in any subject will be placed into level 3.

699
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:45,733
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as high school level testing is concerned, so we're talking about the legacy MCAS test, the assessment and accountability results will be reported.

700
00:49:46,573 --> 00:50:00,124
[SPEAKER_09]: High schools will continue to receive an accountability and assistance level based on their PPI and the school percentile data with adjustments for those schools with persistently low graduation rates or very low assessment participation.

701
00:50:00,484 --> 00:50:04,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, for the high school level, we're looking at participation and low graduation rates.

702
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:12,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as we move forward with this, a new accountability system is in the process of being developed.

703
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:19,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this fall the Board of Education will be considering those changes.

704
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And the changes do need to be consistent with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.

705
00:50:27,922 --> 00:50:30,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So that, in a nutshell, is the reporting schedule.

706
00:50:31,003 --> 00:50:35,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, October 24th is the date that we should have the official results.

707
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:36,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to take any questions.

708
00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:37,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

709
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:37,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

710
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two questions.

711
00:50:39,405 --> 00:50:51,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The first question is, I remember that last year there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.

712
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:53,349
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lots of discrepancies.

713
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's a very timely thing.

714
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

715
00:50:57,071 --> 00:51:01,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the information that you received so far this year more accurate?

716
00:51:02,536 --> 00:51:03,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It appeared so.

717
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:10,123
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a few things that we caught on the discrepancy report, so those have been addressed.

718
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:13,805
[SPEAKER_09]: vigilant with that.

719
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:24,468
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not want a repeat of last year, which everything turned out fine, but we believe we caught the few discrepancies.

720
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.

721
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

722
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:33,594
[SPEAKER_05]: The second question has to do with the participation rates.

723
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:37,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?

724
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:42,202
[SPEAKER_09]: The initial look at it suggests that we are there.

725
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we should have some idea, shouldn't we?

726
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:45,005
[SPEAKER_09]: We should.

727
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:48,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I just do need to be careful because they're embargoed.

728
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,992
[SPEAKER_09]: they look to be fine, we're not concerned about that.

729
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:55,813
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know who took the test and who didn't.

730
00:51:55,853 --> 00:51:56,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

731
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:56,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

732
00:51:57,233 --> 00:52:02,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so in the preliminary results, we actually get a percentage, so we looked at that.

733
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:04,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

734
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:05,158
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

735
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:05,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

736
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:09,640
[SPEAKER_10]: My first thing is more of a statement than a question.

737
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems that the DESE is

738
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:39,943
[SPEAKER_10]: punishing school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not so I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to

739
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:43,464
[SPEAKER_10]: to be accountable.

740
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:51,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just clarify, the participation rate results refers to the number of students taking the test?

741
00:52:51,473 --> 00:53:02,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So like when parents decided that they want to opt out, so they're holding the district's hands at pushing parents to opt in.

742
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:07,816
[SPEAKER_10]: for this, because districts are going to really push for every child to take it.

743
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:16,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew that we had an issue last year with the subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues.

744
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:25,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate was appropriate when we were taking the test.

745
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:27,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So, those are just some comments.

746
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:43,676
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test But it's very important to the district that it does and the district does get punished from desi if not or held at a higher Accountability than districts that parents don't opt out.

747
00:53:44,497 --> 00:53:49,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just a comment from what I've seen Secondly, I wanted to know

748
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:56,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets.

749
00:53:56,776 --> 00:54:07,919
[SPEAKER_10]: As a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated?

750
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:09,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It's embargoed.

751
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It's embargoed?

752
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:11,279
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to ask the question.

753
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,120
[SPEAKER_24]: It's embargoed, Dave.

754
00:54:14,749 --> 00:54:20,434
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.

755
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:29,403
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.

756
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:34,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.

757
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:46,035
[SPEAKER_24]: It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things, but we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.

758
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:48,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my other comment.

759
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:58,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future.

760
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:05,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry.

761
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:08,205
[SPEAKER_10]: It still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.

762
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:11,707
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can just answer that a little bit.

763
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:13,388
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the thing that you've got to remember

764
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:17,310
[SPEAKER_24]: this is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.

765
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:31,278
[SPEAKER_24]: So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions, you know, they had to see what it was about, whether it really, you know, the questions were proper and the like, and they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.

766
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:31,458
[SPEAKER_24]: So

767
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:35,339
[SPEAKER_24]: rather than it's like a new product, it's really in a pilot phase.

768
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:39,139
[SPEAKER_24]: So the second year, they're saying, OK, you had a year to try it out.

769
00:55:39,459 --> 00:55:40,800
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had a year to work out the bugs.

770
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we'll start to look at it for real.

771
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,360
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's really part of it.

772
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:50,461
[SPEAKER_24]: It isn't really an attempt to hide anything, because I think some people in the state would love to issue accountability ratings.

773
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:56,202
[SPEAKER_24]: But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.

774
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:57,003
[SPEAKER_24]: You'd have to look at it.

775
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:57,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

776
00:55:57,403 --> 00:55:59,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And my point is, even though that we

777
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:02,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We as a community are not accountable for that.

778
00:56:02,965 --> 00:56:07,710
[SPEAKER_10]: We are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it.

779
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:17,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want parents to think, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational.

780
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:42,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Entity that to to our students and to to but have them do very well I just wanted to put that out there I don't like it when they say it doesn't come because it counts because the kids took the time to take the exam and you guys As a school district we spent a lot of time and a lot of money Making sure that we do this well and do it right so it does it does it counts?

781
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,450
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the data

782
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:49,851
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways.

783
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:54,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here.

784
00:56:55,873 --> 00:57:00,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So to my colleague who's the committee chair of

785
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:01,902
[SPEAKER_10]: the academic committee.

786
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:06,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.

787
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:12,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.

788
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:16,172
[SPEAKER_10]: We could schedule the meeting and then.

789
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:17,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know the results are coming the 24th.

790
00:57:17,874 --> 00:57:18,354
[SPEAKER_24]: We always do.

791
00:57:19,795 --> 00:57:20,756
[SPEAKER_24]: I just look at schedules.

792
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,337
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, there's a lot of things you want to talk about.

793
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:23,998
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight was a good example.

794
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:25,479
[SPEAKER_24]: But we'll get a meeting.

795
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,921
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.

796
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:30,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Traditionally it goes to the curriculum committee.

797
00:57:31,346 --> 00:57:31,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

798
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:34,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Mustone, were you going to say something, Mr. Belson?

799
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:35,347
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say one thing.

800
00:57:35,507 --> 00:57:49,051
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way, where it goes, how it goes.

801
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:57,073
[SPEAKER_24]: But you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.

802
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:09,923
[SPEAKER_24]: And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.

803
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:12,466
[SPEAKER_24]: And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.

804
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:18,013
[SPEAKER_24]: The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.

805
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,094
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll have to see where that plays out.

806
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:30,557
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.

807
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:35,215
[SPEAKER_24]: So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.

808
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:38,819
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it.

809
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:44,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I think there's a lot of good material in there looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.

810
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:47,146
[SPEAKER_24]: We talk about social and emotional learning.

811
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:49,428
[SPEAKER_24]: We talk about career and technical education.

812
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:50,569
[SPEAKER_24]: We talk about health.

813
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:52,550
[SPEAKER_24]: All those things are important in a school.

814
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:55,573
[SPEAKER_24]: We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.

815
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:57,395
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not just developing test takers.

816
00:58:57,995 --> 00:59:10,779
[SPEAKER_24]: So a good school in a community like, you know, in Boston, where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.

817
00:59:11,399 --> 00:59:16,961
[SPEAKER_24]: So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools and what we do, needs more scrutiny.

818
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:22,902
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.

819
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:23,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

820
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:24,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Musto?

821
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:24,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

822
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:26,926
[SPEAKER_13]: You had mentioned discrepancy.

823
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:30,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that part of the embargoed information, or could you elaborate?

824
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:30,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.

825
00:59:30,689 --> 00:59:33,352
[SPEAKER_13]: So in October, we will know what the discrepancies were?

826
00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:33,952
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

827
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:38,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a discrepancy reporting window, which was in August.

828
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:45,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's when the administrators, the principals, the curriculum directors take a look at, we take an initial look at the data.

829
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,464
[SPEAKER_09]: We look at the students who took the test.

830
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:54,667
[SPEAKER_09]: to see if there's anybody missing, if the numbers are correct in terms of who was supposed to be participating.

831
00:59:55,247 --> 01:00:06,131
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have, I don't know, it's about 10 days or so a week in which we then can report to the state that there was a discrepancy in what they have on paper and what we have as far as our students.

832
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:11,414
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is not, that's not reported out in any official results.

833
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:15,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Were there many discrepancies between what the state presented to you and what you had?

834
01:00:15,337 --> 01:00:16,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the exact number.

835
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:18,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it was minimal.

836
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,061
[SPEAKER_09]: There were more last year.

837
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:29,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not, the initial look at the data would suggest that it was pretty accurate.

838
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:33,810
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.

839
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:35,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Fascinating kind of thing.

840
01:00:36,285 --> 01:00:47,570
[SPEAKER_24]: A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English language arts test because it was his first year in the country.

841
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:58,314
[SPEAKER_24]: However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade, he had been in the country for a short period of time, the state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.

842
01:00:59,014 --> 01:01:00,835
[SPEAKER_24]: We had to petition and clean that out.

843
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:06,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?

844
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:08,776
[SPEAKER_24]: That's an example of a discrepancy.

845
01:01:09,337 --> 01:01:15,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Medicals, people that are out on a medical who somehow don't get coded out of the thing.

846
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:18,709
[SPEAKER_24]: All of a sudden, you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.

847
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:20,587
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, how can you count them?

848
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:23,768
[SPEAKER_24]: They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.

849
01:01:24,508 --> 01:01:26,269
[SPEAKER_24]: So those are some of the things that happen.

850
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:34,351
[SPEAKER_24]: And you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.

851
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:36,871
[SPEAKER_24]: All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.

852
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:39,232
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's not what you're going to pay attention to.

853
01:01:39,252 --> 01:01:43,013
[SPEAKER_24]: And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.

854
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:48,034
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.

855
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:49,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

856
01:01:51,483 --> 01:01:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to accept and place on file.

857
01:01:54,147 --> 01:01:55,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Bernadette.

858
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,471
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a motion to accept and place on file.

859
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:58,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Ms.

860
01:01:58,252 --> 01:01:58,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Cunha.

861
01:01:58,593 --> 01:01:59,434
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

862
01:01:59,454 --> 01:01:59,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

863
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:00,976
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

864
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:02,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passed.

865
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,041
[SPEAKER_14]: We put on summer programs.

866
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:07,104
[SPEAKER_24]: OK, Beverly's going to do this.

867
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Anthony with me tonight.

868
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:15,669
[SPEAKER_02]: As all of you know, we run a full complement of summer programs.

869
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are voluntary for students.

870
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are mandatory, like regular summer school for making up courses during the school year that a youngster may have failed.

871
01:02:27,879 --> 01:02:30,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have a cost to them and some are free of charge.

872
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:34,545
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, again, a lot of things going on all summer long.

873
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:42,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked people who ran programs to come tonight to present to you themselves, and Anthony volunteered to come.

874
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:44,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll start with the summer fun program.

875
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:46,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And Anthony, you want to tell us a little bit about that?

876
01:02:55,892 --> 01:02:56,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, thank you for having me.

877
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:57,994
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Anthony Pachelis.

878
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the director of the Mefford Summer Fund Program.

879
01:03:00,836 --> 01:03:03,899
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in its 11th year of existence and my 10th year running it.

880
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,883
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to give you a short, you know, a little description about the camp.

881
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:10,185
[SPEAKER_19]: But as I said, this is our 11th year of running it.

882
01:03:11,066 --> 01:03:12,307
[SPEAKER_19]: We run out of Mefford High School.

883
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:13,968
[SPEAKER_19]: We average about 130 to 140 kids a week.

884
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:20,772
[SPEAKER_19]: At some weeks we were able to hit up into the 160s, one high 150s, low 160s.

885
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,393
[SPEAKER_19]: We provide breakfast every morning for the children.

886
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:26,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Every Friday we provide them free pizza for lunch.

887
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:35,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And throughout the week we have different activities that come to camp, whether it's a magician, a carnival, and so on, that we provide for the kids each week that they're registered.

888
01:03:35,997 --> 01:03:37,998
[SPEAKER_19]: We also hold the World Cup soccer tournament.

889
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:39,719
[SPEAKER_19]: We hold the dodgeball tournament.

890
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:42,560
[SPEAKER_19]: And this year we were able to partner up with,

891
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:44,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

892
01:03:44,461 --> 01:04:03,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Stone, and we were able, with the Greater Boston Food Bank, the mayor, and Hallmark helped to get food donated every Friday to camp for families, so on the way that the families were picking up their kids, we were able to have bags of food provided for families for dinner for that night or over the weekend.

893
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:12,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the four weeks we did it, we did it four Fridays, July 28th, August 4th, August 11th, and August 18th, we were able to give away over 250 bags.

894
01:04:12,911 --> 01:04:20,538
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was great, a lot of parents were very pleased and very happy that we were able to provide a service like that for them.

895
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:23,721
[SPEAKER_19]: As I said, I just wanted to come and talk about the camp.

896
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:29,566
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's one of those great programs that we have in the city that a lot of people are starting to hear about and know about.

897
01:04:29,606 --> 01:04:31,348
[SPEAKER_19]: And every single year we've grown in size.

898
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:36,713
[SPEAKER_19]: We have over 30 employees, 33 employees, part-time and full-time.

899
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:46,867
[SPEAKER_19]: And all of them are, you know, city of Mefford kids that, you know, went through the elementary schools and middle schools and high schools, and some are currently in high school or graduated from Mefford High or in college.

900
01:04:47,328 --> 01:04:53,796
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we provide a great service for the youth of the community from elementary all the way up to high school and beyond.

901
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:59,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That next year, Wegmans will help you with food stuff.

902
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:01,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, when I heard that, yeah.

903
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:02,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely, absolutely, yeah.

904
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:03,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burke.

905
01:05:03,388 --> 01:05:08,410
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could just jump in on the food portion of it, and really, we have to thank Mia in a large way.

906
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Not mean Mia, Mia.

907
01:05:11,212 --> 01:05:17,074
[SPEAKER_14]: She really, we've had several meetings on food insecurity at City Hall, and Mia has been a part of all of those conversations.

908
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:23,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was, with her van, we went in and picked up the whole truckload of stuff in her van one Friday.

909
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:25,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And it continued for four weeks.

910
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:28,283
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to really thank you, Mia, for all of your hard work.

911
01:05:28,403 --> 01:05:33,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And thanks to Sarah and Anthony for coordinating it once everything came back to you.

912
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that was, I know, a lot of effort on your part as well.

913
01:05:35,672 --> 01:05:38,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you all for doing what you can for our kids.

914
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's such a great addition.

915
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:50,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I also, though, just need to take a moment to thank my colleague, Anne Marie Cuno, who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago.

916
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long time of great successes.

917
01:05:55,588 --> 01:05:57,329
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of my things on my to-do list.

918
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.

919
01:06:03,574 --> 01:06:08,178
[SPEAKER_11]: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.

920
01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:12,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has proved itself many times.

921
01:06:12,862 --> 01:06:14,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very proud of that program.

922
01:06:14,944 --> 01:06:15,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

923
01:06:15,324 --> 01:06:16,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do a great job, Anthony.

924
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:17,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

925
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:17,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

926
01:06:17,426 --> 01:06:17,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

927
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:18,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

928
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:19,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, guys.

929
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:20,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

930
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:29,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing so many programs are going on simultaneously at the high school and they kind of all share the pool and the facilities and it seems to come together.

931
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't have a lot of problems.

932
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: People take care of their own business and Anthony's been wonderful with that program.

933
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:39,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Other programs, we always have our special education program.

934
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa Ionelli was overseeing it this year.

935
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:46,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this program is basically for students who

936
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:57,217
[SPEAKER_02]: have in their IEPs, extended year services, and again, they were approximately 145 students that participated in those programs this summer.

937
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our English learner program.

938
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Texera, our new director, supervised that program.

939
01:07:05,644 --> 01:07:10,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Approximately 75 English learner students through grades one through 12.

940
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:15,315
[SPEAKER_02]: attended, they were at the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School.

941
01:07:15,755 --> 01:07:27,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to contain our programs in as few schools as possible so we get all the cleaning done and we tell John McLaughlin the schedule so we can work around it so it all seems to come together.

942
01:07:28,118 --> 01:07:38,341
[SPEAKER_02]: High School 101, this is a program that we started years ago when we had the academic support grant to support students who have difficulty passing MCAS.

943
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:45,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Keizer and David Blow were overseeing this, organizing the program.

944
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a program for students who are coming into grade nine and it kind of gives them a jump start.

945
01:07:52,565 --> 01:07:55,726
[SPEAKER_02]: All eighth grade students have math work to do over the summer.

946
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,847
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have reading to do over the summer.

947
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we bring the students in about three or four days in August, and the teachers are there to help them to finish the assignments, because oftentimes these are the students that will go into the classes and the regular teacher in grade nine will say, where's your summer reading, or where's your summer math, and they don't have it.

948
01:08:14,195 --> 01:08:17,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this makes sure that they have those assignments completed.

949
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also interface it with just getting used to the high school.

950
01:08:22,879 --> 01:08:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So, during the time they're here, they get to meet the

951
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,402
[SPEAKER_02]: the principal, the assistant principal of the high school.

952
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:34,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And their last day actually is the regular freshman orientation day, so they're on board for that as well.

953
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: That program was very popular.

954
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:42,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the grant no longer existed, we thanked the committee for supporting it in regular budget.

955
01:08:42,772 --> 01:08:45,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents love it and it really does help those youngsters.

956
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:48,957
[SPEAKER_02]: They benefit a great deal coming into school in the fall.

957
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Tringali, our student representative, would like to comment on that.

958
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:53,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

959
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:04,143
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have a very fond memory of facilitating student orientation.

960
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:12,527
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was a group of people, a group of freshmen, who really knew their way around.

961
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:17,369
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there was a group of people who were asking, what's C building?

962
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:18,050
[SPEAKER_12]: What's B building?

963
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:23,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And the people who really knew their stuff were the high school 101 kids.

964
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:30,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think if I did that as a freshman, I would have been a lot less lost.

965
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:34,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's great, thank you.

966
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:36,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you for that comment.

967
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Other programs, we had regular summer school.

968
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,611
[SPEAKER_02]: David Blau and Jill Sawyer were running that.

969
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:50,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this program is for students who really have to make up a subject.

970
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:55,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the big pluses this year is we did not have a lot of seniors.

971
01:09:56,135 --> 01:10:00,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Many times seniors who fail a subject, they can't graduate.

972
01:10:00,736 --> 01:10:08,779
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, this spring, through credit recovery, got those seniors over the hump so that they did not miss out on graduation,

973
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,101
[SPEAKER_02]: that they actually get into our graduation rate, which is a plus thing with our data.

974
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:20,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, we didn't have to have them pay for summer school, as in the past, we've had a lot of seniors.

975
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:25,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We also used our Plato, our online courses a great deal.

976
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:29,911
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is we have the curriculum directors look at the Plato.

977
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:34,333
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't throw students into online courses, because some of them are better than others.

978
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:36,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We make sure that the curriculum people

979
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,415
[SPEAKER_02]: are comfortable with the content of the course.

980
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some courses, math courses, that perhaps really had to be delivered with the real teachers standing up in front of the class.

981
01:10:47,397 --> 01:10:51,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the science classes, I believe all the science classes were done online.

982
01:10:51,478 --> 01:10:52,958
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second year we did that.

983
01:10:53,478 --> 01:11:04,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it also, the other benefit of online courses is that when summer school officially ended on whatever day that was in August, some students who still needed a little bit more time were allowed to have it.

984
01:11:05,321 --> 01:11:07,083
[SPEAKER_02]: because they could just continue online.

985
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:11,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a real plus, and also students could take more than two courses.

986
01:11:11,987 --> 01:11:18,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Because traditional summer school, you basically have an eight to 10, and a 10 to 12, so you can only take two things.

987
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: With the online, a student on his or her own could take a third course.

988
01:11:23,337 --> 01:11:25,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see a lot of potential, we hope to grow it.

989
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need to do is to take the packaged programs

990
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:40,911
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure that we expand them with our own materials so that the curriculum directors feel that they're rigorous enough that they match the curriculum that would be, you know, a live course.

991
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:44,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we had a great success with students doing well.

992
01:11:44,653 --> 01:11:50,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, we learn, you know, after we do our summer programs, we sit down, we just don't close the books and say, okay, that's it.

993
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:52,699
[SPEAKER_02]: started again in June.

994
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically brainstormed what we can do better.

995
01:11:56,061 --> 01:12:02,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year we realized that the middle school students in summer school really were having a difficult time with the attention span.

996
01:12:02,746 --> 01:12:04,467
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed a different type of structure.

997
01:12:04,907 --> 01:12:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what we did this year through the efforts of Jill and David is we kind of mixed it up for the middle school youngsters.

998
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did their math course or they did their English course, but they also had a 45-minute block in between.

999
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Bernadette Riccardelli was part of the planning team on this.

1000
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:27,543
[SPEAKER_02]: where every week they did something different, whether it was an outdoor activity or learning some social emotional activities.

1001
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it seemed to make them more liable to go back into the classroom and be much more focused.

1002
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:36,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we liked that addition.

1003
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:37,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it worked well.

1004
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:39,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we'll probably continue with that model.

1005
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:43,817
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just for 6th and 7th graders because those were the youngsters that were having difficulty.

1006
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: The 8th graders seemed to be okay with the traditional model.

1007
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:52,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Two other camps from basically middle school youngsters.

1008
01:12:53,519 --> 01:12:56,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Jill Sawyer ran the CTE Explore Camp.

1009
01:12:56,941 --> 01:13:03,786
[SPEAKER_02]: These are for middle school students who want to come into the vocational school, explore some of the offerings.

1010
01:13:04,786 --> 01:13:11,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually they had a great chance to see some of the different shops, auto tech, biotechnical, carpentry, and so on.

1011
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:20,299
[SPEAKER_02]: The students actually had, I believe, a swim, an hour swim in the pool, and that was well attended as well.

1012
01:13:20,339 --> 01:13:22,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Very short program, but again, worthwhile.

1013
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:27,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, we have with Molly Leighton, our director of instructional technology.

1014
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:31,635
[SPEAKER_02]: She has her mobile app making summer camp.

1015
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:37,125
[SPEAKER_02]: that she held again at the McGlynn from July 17th to the 21st.

1016
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:43,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is tied to a funded program through the National Science Foundation project.

1017
01:13:43,914 --> 01:13:45,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So any questions?

1018
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:49,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything went very well, and it's positive feedback.

1019
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:54,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to comment on this science camp, I know the kids absolutely love it.

1020
01:13:54,575 --> 01:13:58,477
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a real hit, and kids get a lot out of it, and a big jump for the next year.

1021
01:13:58,637 --> 01:13:58,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1022
01:13:59,497 --> 01:14:00,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for all the summer programming.

1023
01:14:01,118 --> 01:14:02,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any questions?

1024
01:14:02,778 --> 01:14:02,958
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

1025
01:14:03,178 --> 01:14:05,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion that this report be placed on file, authored by Ms.

1026
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:06,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Cunha, seconded by Ms.

1027
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:06,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Vander Kloof.

1028
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1029
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,160
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1030
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:08,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1031
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:08,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1032
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:09,761
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1033
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:11,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Papers?

1034
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:12,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Passes.

1035
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on McGlynn Middle School Action Plan.

1036
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:21,874
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have a return visit from Emily, straight from Market Basket.

1037
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:22,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Waitmans.

1038
01:14:23,278 --> 01:14:23,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop and shop.

1039
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:24,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop and shop.

1040
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:30,315
[SPEAKER_02]: This report was included in your packet last week.

1041
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:36,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you've had a chance to look it over, but we'd like to discuss it publicly tonight.

1042
01:14:38,062 --> 01:14:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start by just introducing the topic with regard to both schools that opened in 2001.

1043
01:14:45,468 --> 01:14:48,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Both schools follow the same academic curriculum.

1044
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the full complement of exploratory subjects, such as art, music, and health.

1045
01:14:55,173 --> 01:15:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the same number of guidance Councilors, school psychologists in both schools.

1046
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: The teaching staff are highly qualified teachers, all licensed.

1047
01:15:06,556 --> 01:15:13,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And while the nature of the activities may vary, they both offer, both schools offer after school activities.

1048
01:15:15,165 --> 01:15:19,407
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the differences is the schools house different specialized populations.

1049
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews, for example, houses the therapeutic learning program, while the McGlynn houses all of our EL middle school students.

1050
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:32,831
[SPEAKER_02]: All content area classes are scheduled the same way.

1051
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has the same amount of time in English, math, social studies, and science.

1052
01:15:38,093 --> 01:15:43,435
[SPEAKER_02]: The exploratories are scheduled slightly differently because of the different populations in the school.

1053
01:15:44,147 --> 01:15:50,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that many of the EL kids don't take foreign language, they need to have the exploratories in a different way.

1054
01:15:50,932 --> 01:15:55,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you add up the time on a yearly basis, all students are getting the same amount of time.

1055
01:15:56,155 --> 01:16:05,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that in one school they're getting it throughout the school year on a lesser basis, and in the other school they get it more concentrated during one segment of the school year.

1056
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:07,095
[SPEAKER_02]: but time-wise it's the same.

1057
01:16:08,295 --> 01:16:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Inclusion is practiced in both schools.

1058
01:16:13,957 --> 01:16:24,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, since the opening of the new buildings in 2001, the district has offered parents of grade five students the opportunity to select a preferred middle school.

1059
01:16:25,521 --> 01:16:34,945
[SPEAKER_02]: The system has worked well until the past two years, when a disproportionate number of parents of students entering grade six selected the Andrews.

1060
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently the Andrews has 45, I'm sorry, 47 more students entering grade six than does the McGlynn.

1061
01:16:43,344 --> 01:16:48,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can accommodate them through extra staffing, but again, it's not an ideal situation.

1062
01:16:49,545 --> 01:16:57,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a significant discrepancy in the socioeconomic status of the student populations at each school.

1063
01:16:57,232 --> 01:17:07,661
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we do need to address more long-term, not tonight, but at other meetings that we need to have during the fall and during the winter.

1064
01:17:09,122 --> 01:17:15,765
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to correct for this imbalance, administrators at all levels, we came together once we saw this happening this spring.

1065
01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:22,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was central administration, it was the departmental people, and the building, the principals obviously were involved.

1066
01:17:23,069 --> 01:17:37,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked throughout the spring and summer to make some changes that we wanted to put in place at the beginning of the school year that we thought would address some of these issues with the discrepancies or the idea that people were selecting the Anders over the McGlynn.

1067
01:17:38,976 --> 01:17:46,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We put some things in place and we are currently working on additional changes that can be put in place during the school year.

1068
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just to kind of review what's happened.

1069
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:55,933
[SPEAKER_02]: At budget time the committee allowed the addition of one health teacher.

1070
01:17:56,511 --> 01:18:01,755
[SPEAKER_02]: and one Spanish teacher for additional staff to be shared by the two middle schools.

1071
01:18:02,576 --> 01:18:10,843
[SPEAKER_02]: We also added another EL teacher because that population at the McGlynn was growing leaps and bounds and we wanted to make sure the students were supported.

1072
01:18:12,284 --> 01:18:18,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And the previous year we had already added a full-time librarian and a .5 adjustment Councilor.

1073
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:21,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been adding staff over the last couple of years.

1074
01:18:22,852 --> 01:18:23,593
[SPEAKER_02]: During the summer,

1075
01:18:24,855 --> 01:18:27,176
[SPEAKER_02]: There were several more measures that were put in place.

1076
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll review them with you.

1077
01:18:30,298 --> 01:18:37,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We have new staff members that were hired to either fill vacancies or new positions that were created.

1078
01:18:37,302 --> 01:18:42,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have the list of all of those positions without the individual names of the teachers.

1079
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:45,306
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new assistant principal in place.

1080
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,508
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two special education teachers.

1081
01:18:48,528 --> 01:18:51,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new reading teacher, an ELA teacher.

1082
01:18:52,263 --> 01:19:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: a guidance Councilor, she's actually filling a leave of absence, the additional EL teacher, and then we have .5 health and .5 Spanish, that's the McGlynn.

1083
01:19:04,394 --> 01:19:06,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The full-time was shared, the two full-time positions.

1084
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing we did is we took a look at the background of staff and we reassigned a few staff members to better serve the needs of students and to support some of the newer staff and to foster some of the new state required curriculum realignment.

1085
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Realignments happened in science, English, and mathematics.

1086
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:34,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are the changes without, again, names.

1087
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:40,261
[SPEAKER_02]: statement also attached with this that speaks to the science changes.

1088
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that statement does contain names, so that's why we have it marked confidential.

1089
01:19:46,145 --> 01:19:53,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But the changes dealt with changing a grade 7 teacher to grade 8 in science and a grade 8 teacher to grade 7.

1090
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:58,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was based on the recommendations of Director Rocco Sieri.

1091
01:19:59,186 --> 01:20:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: who knowing the background of both teachers, knowing the new frameworks, and the new frameworks realigned standards where they were taught in different grade levels, felt that that placement was warranted.

1092
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:12,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that was one of the changes that we made.

1093
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:17,213
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another change with the grade seven and eight

1094
01:20:17,657 --> 01:20:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: English language arts teacher.

1095
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:23,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We hired a new English language arts teacher for the McGlynn.

1096
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:31,289
[SPEAKER_02]: This teacher was brand new, but her student teaching and her background in, you know, again, student teaching mainly was at the high school level.

1097
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:37,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt that putting her at grade eight was the proper placement since, again, she was more high school oriented.

1098
01:20:38,776 --> 01:20:41,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one part of the decision making.

1099
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:53,084
[SPEAKER_02]: current eighth grade teacher, who's an excellent veteran teacher, we needed her expertise to go back into grade seven to help the new reading teacher.

1100
01:20:53,164 --> 01:21:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: In grade seven now, we're starting a new reading program, RTI, where we're going to identify students who really need the reading support.

1101
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Grade six, all students get reading, but now grade seven and eight, it's going to be students who really need it through our testing, our study island we purchased to be able to identify those students.

1102
01:21:11,312 --> 01:21:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt that having a veteran seventh grade English teacher would assist that brand new reading teacher in making those assessments and placements of students.

1103
01:21:19,553 --> 01:21:21,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that was the rationale for that change.

1104
01:21:22,474 --> 01:21:33,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there was a grade eight team lateral change for two social studies teachers, again, teaching the same subject, teaching the same grade, just on different teams.

1105
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:39,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a measure to balance the two teams with veteran teachers and also to have a little better gender balance.

1106
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:46,203
[SPEAKER_02]: The change I mentioned before is the modification of how reading will be delivered.

1107
01:21:46,223 --> 01:21:48,147
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, again,

1108
01:21:49,278 --> 01:21:53,180
[SPEAKER_02]: The RTI model that currently exists at the Andrews with a great deal of success.

1109
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, all students in grade six will receive basic reading instruction.

1110
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:07,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven and eighth grade students will be given reading support based on needs as identified on the newly purchased assessment tool, Study Island.

1111
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:10,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So we purchased, Study Island has been at the Andrews.

1112
01:22:11,047 --> 01:22:14,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we were able to purchase it for the McGlynn through a new grant.

1113
01:22:14,789 --> 01:22:17,511
[SPEAKER_02]: that Bernadette Riccadeli is overseeing, title 4A.

1114
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:24,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, grade 7, ELA teachers, both grade 7 teachers on both teams are very veteran.

1115
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:32,560
[SPEAKER_02]: They're excellent teachers and we know they will provide a great amount of support for this new reading teacher as she gets started in her career.

1116
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:49,775
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to be working on during the school year, we want to make sure that students have opportunities to have more clubs at the McGlynn and opportunities for students to be able to go to different clubs, even if they're housed at another school.

1117
01:22:50,295 --> 01:22:54,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I had one parent, his daughter is really into theater and drama and she's

1118
01:22:54,844 --> 01:23:01,066
[SPEAKER_02]: At the McGlynn he's asked that she could be in the production that's done at the Andrews and we're working on that.

1119
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:06,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're trying to make sure that students are given the opportunity to join clubs at both schools.

1120
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:18,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We are having more administrative support in the building so that we have an idea if people have concerns that they know there's always a place they can go in addition to the

1121
01:23:18,813 --> 01:23:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: principal and to the new assistant principal.

1122
01:23:22,316 --> 01:23:35,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Riccadeli is going to have and has had already more of a presence in the school, walking around the halls, talking to the teachers, seeing again, expressing her interest in what they're doing and if they have any concerns.

1123
01:23:36,506 --> 01:23:42,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Mr. Texera, again our new EL director, he is going to have a presence there.

1124
01:23:43,492 --> 01:23:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Both people are going to have an office, we're working on that, where they can actually sit and if a person wants to go to them, they can.

1125
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:58,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only natural to have Mr. Texera be there more because all of the EL middle school students and teachers are housed at the McGlynn.

1126
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:05,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already decided that we're going to have the open house for grade five parents together, both principals.

1127
01:24:06,109 --> 01:24:11,210
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting and then again having the tours of the buildings for the parents.

1128
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to together during the school year work on some systemic changes to the protocols for the school selection.

1129
01:24:20,793 --> 01:24:28,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what's happened is it's resulted in this imbalance in both numbers, but not just numbers, but socioeconomic status.

1130
01:24:31,395 --> 01:24:36,016
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% free and reduced lunch at the Andrews and 40% at the McGlynn.

1131
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:37,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a huge discrepancy.

1132
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:46,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have to together come up with a way for parents to have a voice in school selection, but get around this issue that's occurred this year.

1133
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:50,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we'll have to sit down together and put all of our minds to that.

1134
01:24:53,402 --> 01:25:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: We're planning for more programs at the McGlynn to perhaps attract some students back to the McGlynn.

1135
01:25:01,967 --> 01:25:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Ms.

1136
01:25:02,748 --> 01:25:10,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Lew and I have spoken already about an Odyssey of the Mind program, perhaps to go into the McGlynn, perhaps something around STEM.

1137
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:12,735
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be something beneficial.

1138
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will look to move some EL classes back to the Andrews, similar to what occurred at the Roberts and the Brooks this year.

1139
01:25:23,802 --> 01:25:26,984
[SPEAKER_02]: The thinking was, we used to have EL students in both schools.

1140
01:25:27,184 --> 01:25:36,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about, I want to say five years ago, we decided that we could actually use staff more efficiently if we had all of the students and all of the EL staff.

1141
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:37,370
[SPEAKER_02]: in one building.

1142
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But now the numbers have grown.

1143
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:45,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's warranted that we could, again, have students move back and we would still not have.

1144
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:52,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're having before with so few EL students is that you'd have the EL teachers running between buildings and losing time having to travel.

1145
01:25:53,175 --> 01:25:57,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we have so many more students, we feel we could have dedicated staff at each building.

1146
01:25:58,157 --> 01:26:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll be looking to do that as well.

1147
01:26:02,139 --> 01:26:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we move forward, we will keep the committee informed.

1148
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:08,128
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look to you for some guidance on some of these large issues.

1149
01:26:08,688 --> 01:26:15,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we welcome your input as we move forward and do our best to make this a better situation.

1150
01:26:17,068 --> 01:26:17,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1151
01:26:17,248 --> 01:26:18,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Vander Kloof.

1152
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:26,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.

1153
01:26:27,694 --> 01:26:33,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy.

1154
01:26:33,457 --> 01:26:41,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was more than that, because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.

1155
01:26:43,402 --> 01:27:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.

1156
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:09,245
[SPEAKER_05]: This was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.

1157
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:14,797
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the number of parents that wanted, we had a wait list.

1158
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:17,498
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew that... No, not in terms of that.

1159
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:32,724
[SPEAKER_02]: What's being done now to make sure those students are... We have, again, what happened during the summer is that some parents that would call my office, they again had information that their student was the only student who wasn't from that particular elementary school who wasn't going to the Andrews.

1160
01:27:33,585 --> 01:27:34,866
[SPEAKER_02]: we said that's not the case.

1161
01:27:34,926 --> 01:27:40,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, lists were made available of other students that were from the same school that were gonna go to the McGlynn.

1162
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The principals are aware, Mr. Edwards is aware of the students that really wanted to go to the Andrews.

1163
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:49,814
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working with them.

1164
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:57,059
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, that young girl who wants to be in the production at the Andrews, we're working with her family to make sure she's doing that.

1165
01:27:57,779 --> 01:27:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're reassuring

1166
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:04,844
[SPEAKER_02]: parents, and I know a lot of that I did this summer, is that the students adjust.

1167
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:09,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's really beneficial sometimes to meet new students.

1168
01:28:09,546 --> 01:28:12,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You're all going to be together in the high school in a few short years.

1169
01:28:12,428 --> 01:28:17,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will make that transition for those students and those families that didn't get their first choice.

1170
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make sure that they

1171
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:23,415
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's duly noted and that they, again, dealt with.

1172
01:28:23,475 --> 01:28:28,361
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't gotten any phone calls since school began, quite honestly.

1173
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, everybody seems to have, I don't know if you have any, but I haven't.

1174
01:28:32,885 --> 01:28:36,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like people are settling in and kids are settling in.

1175
01:28:36,469 --> 01:28:44,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I see that it says that we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.

1176
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.

1177
01:28:47,794 --> 01:29:00,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.

1178
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,101
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've already spoken.

1179
01:29:02,181 --> 01:29:04,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul and Jake both have sat down with me

1180
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to see which clubs are the ones that, you know, more easily the kids can get to either school where they're going to be housed.

1181
01:29:12,337 --> 01:29:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're making a list.

1182
01:29:13,499 --> 01:29:15,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, you know, Ms.

1183
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:21,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Lew is very proactive and she wants to get something going right away with, you know, at least that one club.

1184
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:26,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're in the process of asking them what clubs they think that they want to add in.

1185
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:36,361
[SPEAKER_02]: and then making sure we have the funding for the stipends for the teachers to, you know, jump to basically oversee to be facilitators of these clubs.

1186
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:41,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hoping that the teachers are gonna jump at the opportunity to run something new as well.

1187
01:29:42,165 --> 01:29:45,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.

1188
01:29:45,247 --> 01:29:52,272
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some, but we know we need additional, we need some additional ones and we're gonna prepare, we're prepared to entertain those requests.

1189
01:29:54,814 --> 01:29:55,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Beth Stone.

1190
01:29:55,294 --> 01:29:55,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

1191
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:00,764
[SPEAKER_13]: You had mentioned, I mean, Odyssey of the Mind with Miss Lowe.

1192
01:30:00,964 --> 01:30:03,266
[SPEAKER_13]: So, is that a gifted and talented program?

1193
01:30:03,406 --> 01:30:03,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1194
01:30:03,886 --> 01:30:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1195
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:04,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1196
01:30:04,827 --> 01:30:12,874
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is with the gifted and talented programs now, teachers that run them are supposed to have not a license, it's called an endorsement.

1197
01:30:13,355 --> 01:30:16,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're looking to see who might have that endorsement or

1198
01:30:16,736 --> 01:30:22,540
[SPEAKER_02]: If the person needs to get the endorsement, what they have to do to get it, and then we'll help them to get that endorsement.

1199
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few little regulatory things that we have to look into.

1200
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:30,444
[SPEAKER_13]: And the same with that in the EL classes, are we looking for September of 2018 to

1201
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,947
[SPEAKER_13]: move half the EL to the Andrews?

1202
01:30:34,327 --> 01:30:41,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Not maybe half, but maybe some of the programs, we'll take a look at what's going on and see what makes more sense.

1203
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:50,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we don't want to overcrowd the Andrews because we already have too many kids already, so we want to move kids in unless we can make sure that things are going to be a little bit more balanced all around.

1204
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:56,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, I don't know, because it's been 20 months, so it might have happened before I was on.

1205
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,967
[SPEAKER_13]: I was assigned to the Roberts for my children.

1206
01:30:59,367 --> 01:31:01,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I did not choose the Roberts.

1207
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:02,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I love the Roberts.

1208
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say enough about Mr. Johnson.

1209
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:05,513
[SPEAKER_13]: But then I get to pick middle school.

1210
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we just assign

1211
01:31:08,522 --> 01:31:12,825
[SPEAKER_13]: families to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a wait list.

1212
01:31:12,845 --> 01:31:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: With your support we could entertain that as one of the options.

1213
01:31:15,686 --> 01:31:23,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Before you go down that road, our schools were built on a racial balance plan.

1214
01:31:24,191 --> 01:31:26,793
[SPEAKER_24]: Schools were built with choice as one of the options.

1215
01:31:27,673 --> 01:31:32,800
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.

1216
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the memo?

1217
01:31:35,743 --> 01:31:37,165
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you could choose elementary.

1218
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:40,148
[SPEAKER_24]: See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,

1219
01:31:41,065 --> 01:31:45,228
[SPEAKER_24]: The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.

1220
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:50,912
[SPEAKER_24]: So people, you know, it was a, let's say a progressive movement of youngsters.

1221
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:55,756
[SPEAKER_24]: But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.

1222
01:31:56,336 --> 01:32:00,499
[SPEAKER_24]: So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.

1223
01:32:00,519 --> 01:32:01,480
[SPEAKER_24]: It's happened all the time.

1224
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,481
[SPEAKER_24]: But now people are getting settled.

1225
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:04,482
[SPEAKER_24]: They're getting comfortable.

1226
01:32:04,882 --> 01:32:07,524
[SPEAKER_24]: And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.

1227
01:32:07,544 --> 01:32:13,248
[SPEAKER_24]: People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.

1228
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:22,074
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.

1229
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:26,457
[SPEAKER_24]: And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.

1230
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:29,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Just got to look at those things.

1231
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:30,619
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's all part of it.

1232
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:35,583
[SPEAKER_24]: Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.

1233
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:43,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system.

1234
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:45,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone thinks you go to the school closest to your house.

1235
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:48,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.

1236
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:49,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we don't see it.

1237
01:32:49,534 --> 01:32:49,895
[SPEAKER_13]: You grant them.

1238
01:32:50,753 --> 01:32:52,174
[SPEAKER_24]: We grant a lot of them.

1239
01:32:52,294 --> 01:32:54,776
[SPEAKER_24]: But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.

1240
01:32:54,796 --> 01:32:56,278
[SPEAKER_24]: But we grant a lot of requests.

1241
01:32:56,298 --> 01:32:58,079
[SPEAKER_24]: We take a look at class size first.

1242
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:02,442
[SPEAKER_24]: We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.

1243
01:33:02,923 --> 01:33:06,045
[SPEAKER_24]: We look at the balance between different populations.

1244
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:08,587
[SPEAKER_24]: But we have granted quite a bit.

1245
01:33:08,627 --> 01:33:09,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Diane, what would you say?

1246
01:33:10,389 --> 01:33:11,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Because Diane handles the elementaries.

1247
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:26,084
[SPEAKER_08]: We do get a lot of requests for different areas in schools and for different reasons, but sometimes parents will send in a request because it's easier for them to get to work, to jump onto 93.

1248
01:33:26,584 --> 01:33:34,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we have requests from parents who have childcare issues and the childcare person is in another school.

1249
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:39,672
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I can't give you a specific number, but we do get requests.

1250
01:33:39,692 --> 01:33:40,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but we're not,

1251
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:42,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Selling ourselves.

1252
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:47,337
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two.

1253
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:54,762
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't there's really not a choice system So let's know unless you make the request you're going to write your school or you register your child.

1254
01:33:54,822 --> 01:34:05,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm racist So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and

1255
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:09,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, who are in the know to write a letter or an email.

1256
01:34:09,192 --> 01:34:13,894
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to.

1257
01:34:13,954 --> 01:34:16,655
[SPEAKER_13]: They say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts.

1258
01:34:16,976 --> 01:34:23,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.

1259
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:36,622
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.

1260
01:34:36,822 --> 01:34:48,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, but if we are, if for middle school you get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school, I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?

1261
01:34:49,798 --> 01:34:55,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.

1262
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Not if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.

1263
01:34:59,801 --> 01:35:02,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, then no one gets a choice.

1264
01:35:02,681 --> 01:35:06,242
[SPEAKER_24]: This trade-off, so all of these systems, for the most part, it's worked.

1265
01:35:06,302 --> 01:35:09,083
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a year where we have one real aberration.

1266
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:14,364
[SPEAKER_24]: If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlynn, it's within a few students of each other.

1267
01:35:14,905 --> 01:35:16,005
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because you said,

1268
01:35:17,117 --> 01:35:20,058
[SPEAKER_13]: The McGlynn used to be the choice school, and they had over-enrollment.

1269
01:35:20,558 --> 01:35:21,598
[SPEAKER_05]: But not to this level.

1270
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:23,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Not at this level.

1271
01:35:23,838 --> 01:35:25,719
[SPEAKER_24]: This is an aberration this particular year.

1272
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:27,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

1273
01:35:27,419 --> 01:35:42,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.

1274
01:35:43,062 --> 01:35:45,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And because we also did it in a phase way,

1275
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:58,249
[SPEAKER_11]: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.

1276
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:05,315
[SPEAKER_11]: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here, what's happened is we've kind of,

1277
01:36:06,175 --> 01:36:34,043
[SPEAKER_11]: it's always an option, maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that, we've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses, we have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school really to the max,

1278
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:57,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And and you kind of do want to leave I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood But parents have actually opted to stay within the system or within their district I should say this is within their neighborhood Let's say in a larger in a larger way when it came to the middle school it was always more of a choice and I think that's how that's the reason we've gone that way and

1279
01:36:57,385 --> 01:36:59,006
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's on a campus together.

1280
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:11,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advised parents, you know Where are you living?

1281
01:37:11,675 --> 01:37:19,540
[SPEAKER_11]: How you know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that, whereas you're

1282
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:46,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean we've had situations because our children some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn middle school Their children stayed in the McGlynn elementary school because that's it was a better thing for them But I mean I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized That there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved too But with that being said if parents have called they have been given that choice

1283
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:50,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. O'Jarrett.

1284
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:51,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my name is Michael O'Jarrett.

1285
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:52,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1286
01:37:53,775 --> 01:37:59,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to address this question in particular because I had a number of parents say that they weren't able to get into the school of their choice.

1287
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: This happened to me twice now.

1288
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1289
01:38:01,721 --> 01:38:05,745
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a school that was closer to them and one parent was so outraged

1290
01:38:06,305 --> 01:38:10,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That they were like, oh, if Medford is going to treat me this way, I'm going to take my kids to a private school.

1291
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:11,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it elementary or middle?

1292
01:38:11,793 --> 01:38:12,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Elementary.

1293
01:38:12,274 --> 01:38:13,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Elementary school.

1294
01:38:14,177 --> 01:38:16,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to know, what percent does this happen?

1295
01:38:17,662 --> 01:38:19,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, you know, I've only heard one side of the story.

1296
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:26,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.

1297
01:38:27,455 --> 01:38:32,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And so there was some desire that maybe we should move people to one school or the other.

1298
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:36,204
[SPEAKER_24]: In some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.

1299
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:37,345
[SPEAKER_24]: But Diane, you may want to.

1300
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:39,528
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's usually.

1301
01:38:40,341 --> 01:38:42,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We usually look at class size issues.

1302
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:49,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we have kindergartens or different grade levels that begin to fill up, we certainly don't want to put additional students in that school.

1303
01:38:49,909 --> 01:38:58,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So if, for instance, there was a child and one of the classes was only 17 or 19 students, we would accommodate.

1304
01:38:58,436 --> 01:39:00,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the past, we have accommodated them.

1305
01:39:00,883 --> 01:39:08,865
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think your question is someone that lives in that school district, neighborhood, whatever we want to refer to it as, didn't get to go to that school.

1306
01:39:08,925 --> 01:39:09,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true.

1307
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard of that at all.

1308
01:39:10,426 --> 01:39:11,326
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not someone in the neighborhood.

1309
01:39:11,386 --> 01:39:11,566
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1310
01:39:11,606 --> 01:39:19,809
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're designated, for instance, if it's a Brooks School student, and in their designated neighborhood, they all went to that school.

1311
01:39:19,929 --> 01:39:20,429
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I hear.

1312
01:39:20,469 --> 01:39:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably.

1313
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:22,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they have fresh choice.

1314
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:28,191
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the way the district lines worked out, that they were closer to one, but they weren't requested.

1315
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:29,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to get a sense of what percentage.

1316
01:39:30,612 --> 01:39:31,353
[SPEAKER_03]: that happens?

1317
01:39:31,513 --> 01:39:33,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Very small, very small.

1318
01:39:33,474 --> 01:39:35,195
[SPEAKER_13]: When was the last time you redistricted?

1319
01:39:35,275 --> 01:39:36,116
[SPEAKER_13]: One at a time please.

1320
01:39:37,377 --> 01:39:39,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Long time ago, long time ago.

1321
01:39:39,518 --> 01:39:41,259
[SPEAKER_14]: When we opened the schools probably.

1322
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:47,263
[SPEAKER_24]: There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.

1323
01:39:47,623 --> 01:39:48,244
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a while.

1324
01:39:49,865 --> 01:39:50,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto?

1325
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I live in that neighborhood.

1326
01:39:55,444 --> 01:40:02,911
[SPEAKER_10]: that it used to be like North Street, and it used to be Winthrop Street over, you go to the Brooks, and then they redistricted it.

1327
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:13,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't realize at the time it had been redistricted, so when people were talking to me, this was prior to me being on this committee, I was like, yeah, you just go down the street to the Brooks.

1328
01:40:14,243 --> 01:40:18,687
[SPEAKER_10]: But they had redistricted it, so it went to North Street, down, went to the Brooks.

1329
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:19,328
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Columbus.

1330
01:40:20,284 --> 01:40:34,576
[SPEAKER_10]: from North Street over was redistricted to the Columbus School, which wasn't as close, and where some people, like on my street, would have been able to walk their children to school, now live much further.

1331
01:40:35,096 --> 01:40:38,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's more what the concern was.

1332
01:40:38,339 --> 01:40:48,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have heard people in the Hillside area make comments like, I could walk my child every day, but I can't, it's too far.

1333
01:40:49,191 --> 01:40:56,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I have to bus them or bring them and it's because of that last redistricting.

1334
01:40:56,637 --> 01:40:58,899
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible that there was a miscommunication.

1335
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:02,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to the parent and see if we can forward that information to you guys.

1336
01:41:02,822 --> 01:41:10,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was that exact issue that she could walk it, but now she can't walk and she was very frustrated at the response she received from the school district.

1337
01:41:11,129 --> 01:41:12,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1338
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:14,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.

1339
01:41:14,572 --> 01:41:15,472
[SPEAKER_24]: When the schools were built,

1340
01:41:16,767 --> 01:41:25,081
[SPEAKER_24]: The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Irving and Gleason.

1341
01:41:25,502 --> 01:41:26,123
[SPEAKER_24]: Those were the three.

1342
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:28,667
[SPEAKER_24]: But there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.

1343
01:41:29,617 --> 01:41:35,263
[SPEAKER_24]: that we needed to take to the Columbus, because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.

1344
01:41:36,043 --> 01:41:47,515
[SPEAKER_24]: So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus, or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.

1345
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,897
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was the sort of divide there.

1346
01:41:49,957 --> 01:41:51,859
[SPEAKER_24]: And of course, with busing transportation,

1347
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,720
[SPEAKER_24]: we felt it was very doable.

1348
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,701
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the thinking at the time.

1349
01:41:55,941 --> 01:42:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not that, I don't think there was any malfeasance or practice on anyone's part, it was just a question of miscommunication.

1350
01:42:02,363 --> 01:42:10,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to get a sense of how often that happens for parents, because as well, many parents don't think that they do have a choice, at least in my experience when talking to them.

1351
01:42:10,665 --> 01:42:14,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to follow up, as a committee member, I do hear that as well.

1352
01:42:15,326 --> 01:42:15,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1353
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:15,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Vander Kloof.

1354
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:17,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I just comment on the district.

1355
01:42:18,347 --> 01:42:21,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we did it, it was very unpopular.

1356
01:42:22,509 --> 01:42:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.

1357
01:42:26,492 --> 01:42:46,083
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.

1358
01:42:46,723 --> 01:42:51,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just haven't heard that level.

1359
01:42:52,329 --> 01:42:57,053
[SPEAKER_05]: The ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.

1360
01:42:57,734 --> 01:42:59,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really positive.

1361
01:42:59,395 --> 01:43:03,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mia, you nearly took my breath away when you said, why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that?

1362
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:07,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that might be something we're going to talk about, but we're going to make

1363
01:43:07,943 --> 01:43:14,291
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice and schools.

1364
01:43:14,412 --> 01:43:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very difficult thing as a school committee member, because we are naturally people who want to please.

1365
01:43:20,717 --> 01:43:27,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're going to not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.

1366
01:43:27,623 --> 01:43:36,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?

1367
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are we making sure?

1368
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:42,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see

1369
01:43:42,697 --> 01:44:01,140
[SPEAKER_05]: that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a... because we were so concerned at the time of building them that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.

1370
01:44:02,041 --> 01:44:09,123
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.

1371
01:44:09,503 --> 01:44:15,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.

1372
01:44:16,144 --> 01:44:19,225
[SPEAKER_05]: But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.

1373
01:44:19,605 --> 01:44:23,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go.

1374
01:44:24,526 --> 01:44:29,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the parents I spoke with, I have to talk with them obviously, but I'll forward you the information if they agree.

1375
01:44:29,568 --> 01:44:30,448
[SPEAKER_03]: They felt they were sort of,

1376
01:44:31,468 --> 01:44:46,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Pushed into the Columbus, and I think that that was just that whether it was the reality of the perception I just maybe it's a question of just clearing it up We don't want to have one school, which has 300 kids in one course And that's the challenge of course very good.

1377
01:44:46,202 --> 01:44:46,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Mike.

1378
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:50,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you They're a motion to receive this paper in place.

1379
01:44:50,506 --> 01:44:53,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a question if you don't mind

1380
01:44:54,650 --> 01:45:01,633
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about Study Island, how much that costs, and why has Andrews had it for a while and McGlenn not?

1381
01:45:03,634 --> 01:45:19,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Study Island, Mr. DeLava had put that in his regular budget for several years because he wanted to have that reading instruction to be delivered in terms of the RTI.

1382
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:25,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the way the scheduling was done that wasn't done the same way as the McGlynn, there was not the need for it.

1383
01:45:26,044 --> 01:45:28,586
[SPEAKER_02]: We said we have to do it differently, okay?

1384
01:45:28,606 --> 01:45:35,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that the two schools are doing RTI and that they have the materials that they need.

1385
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Study Island for both math, it's a very good diagnostic tool.

1386
01:45:41,175 --> 01:45:45,078
[SPEAKER_02]: For both of them we were able to, I think we're under like $4,000 at the McGlynn.

1387
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:59,663
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did at budget time we did include it at the McGlynn budget But then we were able to get this new grant this summer that paid for it So we could put the money back in and probably use it for stipends for clubs.

1388
01:46:00,224 --> 01:46:15,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So Okay at budget time we we heard from people that RTI was extremely important and a few committee members were really focused on this as being a budget item and now it wasn't and

1389
01:46:17,072 --> 01:46:26,635
[SPEAKER_10]: At budget time and now we're purchasing stuff like we talked about staff maybe for RTI and there was talk about using people in the

1390
01:46:28,302 --> 01:46:29,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's elementary.

1391
01:46:29,322 --> 01:46:37,745
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle school, Dr. Chiesa had put the study island in her English budget for the McGlynn because she knew it was used at the Andrews very effectively.

1392
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:46,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we can throw that money back into something else because we have this brand new Title IV-A grant that we can support that.

1393
01:46:46,389 --> 01:46:49,770
[SPEAKER_02]: The plan was to have it at the McGlynn this year, okay?

1394
01:46:50,248 --> 01:46:53,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, so my other comment is about the clubs.

1395
01:46:55,018 --> 01:47:00,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Mr. DeLaver has been here for years asking more and more money for the clubs because they're so popular.

1396
01:47:01,618 --> 01:47:07,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And because it makes the children feel a part of that community and the social piece is so important.

1397
01:47:07,841 --> 01:47:11,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that is a big draw for the middle schoolers.

1398
01:47:11,622 --> 01:47:20,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember either myself or someone else asking why can't we open it up to the McGlen kids and have them go back and forth.

1399
01:47:20,766 --> 01:47:26,929
[SPEAKER_10]: He said they've tried it on a few occasions, if I remember correctly, I wish he was here, and that it really doesn't always work.

1400
01:47:28,163 --> 01:47:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure that we figure out a way that it does work.

1401
01:47:32,408 --> 01:47:40,197
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want not only the McGlynn kids to go over to Andrew's to take part, I want some really cool things at the McGlynn that draws those kids over.

1402
01:47:41,098 --> 01:47:46,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I really want, you know, the McGlynn has a little bit more space with them.

1403
01:47:47,508 --> 01:48:13,176
[SPEAKER_02]: In talking to the principals, one of the issues with having the kids, let's say, from the McGlynn go to a club at the Andrews is just we have to make sure the safety issue, that the kids are, because they're not as well known in the school, so we have to make sure we have systems in place that those kids, they're supposed to be coming over from the McGlynn, they're truly there, okay, and that was the concern that they identified this past week.

1404
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:23,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So the drama club that is excellent and it's well-reviewed at the Andrews School, could it be housed at the McGlynn?

1405
01:48:23,927 --> 01:48:24,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Or not?

1406
01:48:24,688 --> 01:48:29,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the McGlynn has the auditorium.

1407
01:48:30,173 --> 01:48:31,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The teacher is at the Andrews.

1408
01:48:31,814 --> 01:48:33,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's how that happened, the teacher that runs it.

1409
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:35,137
[SPEAKER_02]: But the McGlynn has-

1410
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:59,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's after school and the McGlynn has the talent show though, so I mean they both have you know structures in place for the arts It's just different Okay, but we but we can like I said that one that one student again the father wrote me an email the students at the McGlynn But she'd like to participate in the drama because that's her her real passion, and we're working to get her over there, so I

1411
01:49:00,562 --> 01:49:04,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure there's other children as well, and I would like it open to them as well.

1412
01:49:05,425 --> 01:49:05,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Burke.

1413
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:06,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1414
01:49:06,445 --> 01:49:06,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Vandiver.

1415
01:49:06,946 --> 01:49:10,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.

1416
01:49:12,409 --> 01:49:13,609
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacher is extraordinary.

1417
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:18,112
[SPEAKER_05]: She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.

1418
01:49:18,832 --> 01:49:24,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by- She had a hundred last year.

1419
01:49:24,733 --> 01:49:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1420
01:49:25,213 --> 01:49:38,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she told us to do it at the other school as well, or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular.

1421
01:49:39,076 --> 01:49:45,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Because to just say, okay, every student, if I understand the student that you're talking about,

1422
01:49:46,358 --> 01:49:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: But frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're going to have 25 calls of kids who hear this.

1423
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:56,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be in tomorrow, Mr. Superintendent.

1424
01:49:57,754 --> 01:50:00,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program.

1425
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:08,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some new music teachers, I know that, that we hired, and I'll talk to Mrs. Igney about maybe doing that.

1426
01:50:08,564 --> 01:50:12,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the teacher is extraordinary, she's amazing.

1427
01:50:12,907 --> 01:50:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the farmer's market in North Andover on a Sunday last week and it's Mrs. Nelson, Mrs. Nelson, there she was volunteering up there, so she's extraordinary.

1428
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:25,035
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1429
01:50:26,135 --> 01:50:29,898
[SPEAKER_24]: This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school,

1430
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:32,091
[SPEAKER_24]: The other school has to want to compete.

1431
01:50:32,552 --> 01:50:45,096
[SPEAKER_24]: The other school has to want to pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.

1432
01:50:45,476 --> 01:50:47,037
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's a certain amount of that.

1433
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,837
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.

1434
01:50:49,237 --> 01:50:53,099
[SPEAKER_24]: The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.

1435
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:54,779
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've got to change that.

1436
01:50:54,819 --> 01:50:58,080
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.

1437
01:50:58,741 --> 01:50:59,581
[SPEAKER_24]: Sending a message.

1438
01:51:00,261 --> 01:51:01,342
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the way you do it.

1439
01:51:01,402 --> 01:51:02,162
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to do it.

1440
01:51:02,642 --> 01:51:10,467
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.

1441
01:51:10,487 --> 01:51:12,588
[SPEAKER_24]: And we sent a message and we changed some things.

1442
01:51:12,628 --> 01:51:18,091
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be

1443
01:51:19,512 --> 01:51:23,333
[SPEAKER_24]: the school of choice, you want to bring people to you, then you've got to step it up a little bit.

1444
01:51:23,734 --> 01:51:28,035
[SPEAKER_24]: And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.

1445
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:33,257
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.

1446
01:51:33,973 --> 01:51:38,257
[SPEAKER_13]: With the federal funding, you said they had to be schools with a similar student population.

1447
01:51:38,277 --> 01:51:38,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Not federal.

1448
01:51:39,358 --> 01:51:40,219
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you say about that?

1449
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:40,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, state.

1450
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:42,181
[SPEAKER_13]: State, sorry, not federal.

1451
01:51:42,601 --> 01:51:46,104
[SPEAKER_13]: But how does the Andrews have 20% low and reduced?

1452
01:51:46,124 --> 01:51:49,087
[SPEAKER_24]: It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.

1453
01:51:49,567 --> 01:51:52,591
[SPEAKER_13]: But 20% to 44% for that subgroup is pretty big.

1454
01:51:52,711 --> 01:51:53,452
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a change.

1455
01:51:53,592 --> 01:51:57,317
[SPEAKER_24]: And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.

1456
01:51:57,337 --> 01:52:00,742
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, that was not as significant years ago.

1457
01:52:01,202 --> 01:52:02,123
[SPEAKER_24]: It's now significant.

1458
01:52:02,163 --> 01:52:04,266
[SPEAKER_24]: It's now emerged, and it will continue to emerge.

1459
01:52:04,587 --> 01:52:06,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was part of a racial balance plan back then as well.

1460
01:52:06,048 --> 01:52:07,110
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a new challenge for us.

1461
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:08,231
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a new challenge for us.

1462
01:52:08,572 --> 01:52:10,974
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, we work at these things.

1463
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:13,397
[SPEAKER_24]: And every year there's going to be challenges.

1464
01:52:13,417 --> 01:52:14,038
[SPEAKER_24]: This is one of them.

1465
01:52:14,578 --> 01:52:15,359
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll make it work.

1466
01:52:15,399 --> 01:52:15,920
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll get on it.

1467
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:17,081
[SPEAKER_24]: We've got a lot of things moving.

1468
01:52:17,342 --> 01:52:18,303
[SPEAKER_24]: We've talked about a lot.

1469
01:52:18,343 --> 01:52:20,786
[SPEAKER_24]: We're certainly not being satisfied about it.

1470
01:52:21,406 --> 01:52:22,588
[SPEAKER_24]: We're saying, let's go make it happen.

1471
01:52:22,608 --> 01:52:24,069
[SPEAKER_24]: But we need everybody on board.

1472
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:27,953
[SPEAKER_24]: It can't be, woe is me, they did something to me.

1473
01:52:27,993 --> 01:52:29,354
[SPEAKER_24]: They've got to step up too.

1474
01:52:29,374 --> 01:52:29,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1475
01:52:29,714 --> 01:52:30,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

1476
01:52:30,475 --> 01:52:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had one more question, a little bit back to earlier in your report.

1477
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:36,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned to us the teacher changes.

1478
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:43,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if that's because are the teachers willing to do that?

1479
01:52:44,606 --> 01:52:48,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to see grievances at some point?

1480
01:52:48,129 --> 01:52:48,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wondered.

1481
01:52:50,247 --> 01:52:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not change any one subject they taught.

1482
01:52:53,171 --> 01:52:54,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We changed grade levels.

1483
01:52:55,535 --> 01:52:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: No one likes change, quite honestly.

1484
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we exhibited some resistance.

1485
01:53:01,663 --> 01:53:06,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we didn't put an English teacher in a math class.

1486
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And contractually, we have the ability to write.

1487
01:53:11,123 --> 01:53:14,965
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle school, you know, I taught middle school for 23 years, okay?

1488
01:53:15,086 --> 01:53:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I was at the Roberts for 13 years.

1489
01:53:19,108 --> 01:53:22,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, what was the superintendent said, you have to go to the Lincoln.

1490
01:53:22,651 --> 01:53:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I happy?

1491
01:53:23,852 --> 01:53:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was not happy.

1492
01:53:25,453 --> 01:53:26,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I fine when I got there?

1493
01:53:26,934 --> 01:53:28,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I a better teacher?

1494
01:53:28,736 --> 01:53:29,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1495
01:53:29,877 --> 01:53:37,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the middle school is the only level of teaching where a person could conceivably stay in the same job year after year.

1496
01:53:37,824 --> 01:53:40,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Elementary teachers go from grade to grade.

1497
01:53:40,887 --> 01:53:43,169
[SPEAKER_02]: High school teachers teach different subjects.

1498
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:46,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year you might be a world history teacher, then you might be a U.S.

1499
01:53:46,432 --> 01:53:46,992
[SPEAKER_02]: history teacher.

1500
01:53:47,853 --> 01:53:52,515
[SPEAKER_02]: In rethinking all of this, quite honestly, what perhaps we should have learned.

1501
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:54,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we went from the three middle schools to the two.

1502
01:53:54,776 --> 01:54:00,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent that summer drying tears how this person couldn't possibly teach without their teammate.

1503
01:54:01,358 --> 01:54:08,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said to people, if you feel this strongly after a year, come back and see me and we'll think about moving you back.

1504
01:54:08,581 --> 01:54:09,722
[SPEAKER_02]: No one came back to see me.

1505
01:54:10,502 --> 01:54:11,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I think change is healthy.

1506
01:54:11,984 --> 01:54:21,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very healthy for a teacher who's an 8th grade teacher to be a 7th grade teacher because that 8th grade teacher knows what a 7th grade student has to do to get to 8th grade.

1507
01:54:22,519 --> 01:54:25,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very healthy and we're not asking them to teach

1508
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:28,245
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of their license, their content area.

1509
01:54:28,886 --> 01:54:30,327
[SPEAKER_02]: There were needs in that school.

1510
01:54:30,407 --> 01:54:32,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a brand new reading teacher.

1511
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:35,953
[SPEAKER_02]: She needed veteran English teachers to support her.

1512
01:54:35,993 --> 01:54:41,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That new English teacher that was hired would not have been able to help her in the way the veteran teacher was.

1513
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:47,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand, I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.

1514
01:54:47,299 --> 01:54:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.

1515
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we want you to know what we did, because you might get phone calls, I'm sure.

1516
01:54:54,361 --> 01:54:54,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1517
01:54:54,681 --> 01:55:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Cieri came tonight because he wanted to speak if there was a question about the science.

1518
01:55:01,143 --> 01:55:04,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we did this with his blessing and recommendation.

1519
01:55:05,143 --> 01:55:11,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Science frameworks are new, and he knows his people best, and that change was, again, for the best, are people happy?

1520
01:55:12,466 --> 01:55:14,267
[SPEAKER_02]: No one likes change, but you know what?

1521
01:55:14,468 --> 01:55:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It's healthy, it's good.

1522
01:55:15,469 --> 01:55:16,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through it.

1523
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:17,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a better teacher.

1524
01:55:18,372 --> 01:55:20,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, how could I possibly leave my classroom in the Roberts?

1525
01:55:21,295 --> 01:55:23,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I could teach from my car by the time I got through.

1526
01:55:23,477 --> 01:55:27,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you just become more flexible and you meet new people and you get new ideas.

1527
01:55:27,581 --> 01:55:31,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's healthy, it's just not pleasant to go through initially.

1528
01:55:31,725 --> 01:55:32,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

1529
01:55:33,046 --> 01:55:33,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1530
01:55:36,141 --> 01:55:37,082
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question here.

1531
01:55:38,403 --> 01:55:46,671
[SPEAKER_03]: If a parent has trouble reading perhaps the form for admissions, what's the default school that they get sent to if they don't return the form to you?

1532
01:55:47,051 --> 01:55:49,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that they get defaulted to McGlynn?

1533
01:55:49,373 --> 01:55:55,118
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, they were defaulted to McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under enrolled in the sixth grade.

1534
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1535
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1536
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:02,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

1537
01:56:02,842 --> 01:56:04,622
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1538
01:56:04,642 --> 01:56:04,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1539
01:56:05,222 --> 01:56:06,083
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1540
01:56:06,183 --> 01:56:07,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1541
01:56:08,243 --> 01:56:12,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Report on enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1542
01:56:14,012 --> 01:56:23,417
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a report you asked for, and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda to ask me these questions, okay?

1543
01:56:24,057 --> 01:56:31,000
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here, so I'm going to go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.

1544
01:56:31,821 --> 01:56:36,023
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1545
01:56:36,902 --> 01:56:42,447
[SPEAKER_24]: This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.

1546
01:56:43,028 --> 01:56:45,751
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.

1547
01:56:46,491 --> 01:56:55,100
[SPEAKER_24]: The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.

1548
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:03,622
[SPEAKER_24]: The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.

1549
01:57:04,103 --> 01:57:08,824
[SPEAKER_24]: This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.

1550
01:57:10,665 --> 01:57:13,566
[SPEAKER_24]: The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.

1551
01:57:15,086 --> 01:57:16,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Two of the students are in outside placements.

1552
01:57:17,687 --> 01:57:23,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.

1553
01:57:24,138 --> 01:57:30,663
[SPEAKER_24]: Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.

1554
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:37,308
[SPEAKER_24]: The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.

1555
01:57:38,028 --> 01:57:49,657
[SPEAKER_24]: I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.

1556
01:57:50,561 --> 01:57:56,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.

1557
01:57:57,365 --> 01:58:05,809
[SPEAKER_24]: We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.

1558
01:58:06,709 --> 01:58:09,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.

1559
01:58:10,131 --> 01:58:10,812
[SPEAKER_24]: We currently have 937.

1560
01:58:12,632 --> 01:58:16,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.

1561
01:58:17,774 --> 01:58:21,720
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.

1562
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:23,463
[SPEAKER_24]: People are saying there's no capacity anymore.

1563
01:58:23,703 --> 01:58:26,367
[SPEAKER_24]: The new developments are going to swamp the schools.

1564
01:58:26,768 --> 01:58:27,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Not true.

1565
01:58:28,408 --> 01:58:30,649
[SPEAKER_24]: The high school vocational program has room to grow.

1566
01:58:31,289 --> 01:58:34,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.

1567
01:58:35,351 --> 01:58:39,954
[SPEAKER_24]: For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.

1568
01:58:40,674 --> 01:58:44,736
[SPEAKER_24]: If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.

1569
01:58:45,256 --> 01:58:53,020
[SPEAKER_24]: The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.

1570
01:58:53,740 --> 01:59:01,924
[SPEAKER_24]: In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.

1571
01:59:01,944 --> 01:59:03,965
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to take you to the first chart.

1572
01:59:07,026 --> 01:59:10,708
[SPEAKER_24]: You're looking at the eight big complexes.

1573
01:59:12,469 --> 01:59:16,851
[SPEAKER_24]: If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column,

1574
01:59:17,478 --> 01:59:21,919
[SPEAKER_24]: So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.

1575
01:59:22,299 --> 01:59:26,379
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Edge Drive, you only have 11 families.

1576
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:28,700
[SPEAKER_24]: Some families have more than one child.

1577
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:31,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And so on and so forth.

1578
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,381
[SPEAKER_24]: And some of these complexes have existed for some time.

1579
01:59:34,401 --> 01:59:35,141
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not brand new.

1580
01:59:35,741 --> 01:59:36,621
[SPEAKER_24]: They've been here for a while.

1581
01:59:37,801 --> 01:59:47,003
[SPEAKER_24]: So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are in outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.

1582
01:59:48,089 --> 01:59:49,450
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me go to the next chart for a minute.

1583
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:51,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just say, is Lumiere less than 150 units?

1584
01:59:52,653 --> 01:59:52,833
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1585
01:59:53,153 --> 01:59:54,655
[SPEAKER_13]: So is Lumiere one of those addresses?

1586
01:59:54,675 --> 01:59:54,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1587
01:59:54,835 --> 01:59:56,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know what the address is.

1588
01:59:56,156 --> 01:59:59,158
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the third one, the 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1589
01:59:59,499 --> 01:59:59,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Lumiere?

1590
01:59:59,879 --> 02:00:01,681
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's nine students from Lumiere.

1591
02:00:01,901 --> 02:00:02,882
[SPEAKER_24]: OK, Lumiere.

1592
02:00:04,063 --> 02:00:07,846
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.

1593
02:00:08,687 --> 02:00:12,470
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.

1594
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:12,850
[SPEAKER_24]: And grade one, 18.8.

1595
02:00:16,833 --> 02:00:17,394
[SPEAKER_24]: In grade 2, 18.

1596
02:00:17,514 --> 02:00:18,895
[SPEAKER_24]: In grade 3, 17.7.

1597
02:00:19,616 --> 02:00:21,998
[SPEAKER_24]: In grade 4, 19.3.

1598
02:00:22,318 --> 02:00:23,019
[SPEAKER_24]: In grade 5, 17.7.

1599
02:00:25,101 --> 02:00:28,043
[SPEAKER_24]: Those class sizes are private school class sizes.

1600
02:00:29,244 --> 02:00:33,408
[SPEAKER_24]: There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.

1601
02:00:34,769 --> 02:00:36,491
[SPEAKER_24]: You've done an excellent job supporting that.

1602
02:00:37,332 --> 02:00:40,715
[SPEAKER_24]: But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,

1603
02:00:42,034 --> 02:00:43,455
[SPEAKER_24]: is misleading everyone.

1604
02:00:43,755 --> 02:00:44,116
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not.

1605
02:00:44,656 --> 02:00:47,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we just go back to the buildings, just because I don't know the addresses.

1606
02:00:47,978 --> 02:00:50,220
[SPEAKER_13]: So 100 Rivers Edge Drive, where's that?

1607
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:52,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Rivers Edge is along the Malden River.

1608
02:00:52,262 --> 02:00:54,703
[SPEAKER_14]: It runs from Wellington Station to Malden Station.

1609
02:00:54,863 --> 02:00:55,964
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a new development.

1610
02:00:56,044 --> 02:00:58,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It's commercial and residential.

1611
02:00:58,766 --> 02:00:59,006
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1612
02:00:59,027 --> 02:01:00,087
[SPEAKER_13]: 3,600 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1613
02:01:00,127 --> 02:01:01,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that behind the old Malden Mall?

1614
02:01:02,829 --> 02:01:03,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1615
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:03,530
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1616
02:01:05,757 --> 02:01:08,019
[SPEAKER_13]: And that 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway?

1617
02:01:08,039 --> 02:01:13,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the condos that are, those are directly behind, if you're on 16 looking at them all to the right.

1618
02:01:14,405 --> 02:01:14,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty sure.

1619
02:01:15,265 --> 02:01:16,006
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the condos.

1620
02:01:16,466 --> 02:01:16,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1621
02:01:17,507 --> 02:01:18,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabot Road?

1622
02:01:18,808 --> 02:01:20,269
[SPEAKER_14]: That's down Wellington Circle as well.

1623
02:01:20,309 --> 02:01:26,855
[SPEAKER_14]: That's brand new, so this is just, it's just beginning, it has its occupancy starting up.

1624
02:01:27,135 --> 02:01:27,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1625
02:01:28,496 --> 02:01:30,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the boat that's station landing, and then Riverside Ave.

1626
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,660
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the towers at Riverside Ave.

1627
02:01:33,652 --> 02:01:34,753
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that near?

1628
02:01:34,793 --> 02:01:35,654
[SPEAKER_24]: They've been there forever.

1629
02:01:35,834 --> 02:01:37,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Near La Conte Rink, is that?

1630
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:38,757
[SPEAKER_14]: They are, yes.

1631
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:40,758
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1979, they've been there since.

1632
02:01:40,879 --> 02:01:54,391
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.

1633
02:01:55,144 --> 02:01:56,925
[SPEAKER_24]: But when their families grow, they move out.

1634
02:01:57,445 --> 02:01:58,786
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't stay in these developments.

1635
02:01:58,806 --> 02:02:00,687
[SPEAKER_24]: They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.

1636
02:02:00,707 --> 02:02:09,572
[SPEAKER_24]: But we're going to have to see what that does because basically, you know, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not going to be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.

1637
02:02:10,352 --> 02:02:11,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Burke, excuse me.

1638
02:02:11,813 --> 02:02:12,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

1639
02:02:12,533 --> 02:02:18,817
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as buildings, what are the buildings, you know, when you go down 9th Street at the end, there's a new... 9th Street.

1640
02:02:19,517 --> 02:02:26,725
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one that, the five cabin is the brand new one that's having like a ribbon cutting in a week or so, but they have started their occupancy.

1641
02:02:27,306 --> 02:02:30,810
[SPEAKER_14]: The one before the train tracks, they're under 150 units.

1642
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:33,112
[SPEAKER_14]: He looked at 150 as a threshold.

1643
02:02:33,313 --> 02:02:36,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so all the condo buildings on 8th, 9th and 11th.

1644
02:02:38,961 --> 02:02:42,102
[SPEAKER_10]: all those buildings are not included in any of these lists.

1645
02:02:42,303 --> 02:02:43,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are existing, those are existing.

1646
02:02:44,003 --> 02:02:45,004
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been there for a while.

1647
02:02:45,244 --> 02:02:47,445
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that apartment complex at the very end.

1648
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:52,227
[SPEAKER_24]: And the other thing you need to know, the other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.

1649
02:02:53,468 --> 02:02:57,790
[SPEAKER_24]: Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.

1650
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:02,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.

1651
02:03:03,181 --> 02:03:03,961
[SPEAKER_14]: So could I continue?

1652
02:03:04,181 --> 02:03:07,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, for a true comparison, you should be looking at the Rivers Edge Drive.

1653
02:03:08,163 --> 02:03:09,043
[SPEAKER_14]: That's brand new.

1654
02:03:09,123 --> 02:03:14,085
[SPEAKER_14]: It's apartments that are built, you know, they haven't been existing for a very long time.

1655
02:03:14,145 --> 02:03:16,046
[SPEAKER_14]: And the station landing would be next up.

1656
02:03:16,386 --> 02:03:18,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were put in in 2004.

1657
02:03:18,867 --> 02:03:21,768
[SPEAKER_14]: But they were part of like transit development, smaller units.

1658
02:03:22,388 --> 02:03:27,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are probably the ones I would be looking at, but comparable about going forward.

1659
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:36,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did request this report and it's because of future building and if we have the baseline now that we know where we're at, I have no problem with this.

1660
02:03:36,737 --> 02:03:48,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The only data that's not on here that I would like from the census piece is how many of these people are, how many younger children, pre-school age children.

1661
02:03:48,497 --> 02:03:50,880
[SPEAKER_10]: do they have that will be coming into our school district?

1662
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:56,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're newer apartments, they might, right, and that is something you would get from the census, and I understand that.

1663
02:03:56,847 --> 02:04:00,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And my only other concern is on the, I believe, third graph.

1664
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:07,601
[SPEAKER_10]: and where it says school development enrollment percentage, I just want to keep an eye on things.

1665
02:04:07,841 --> 02:04:17,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the McGlynn, these new students, well these new buildings affect 10%, almost 10%, 9.6% of their enrollment.

1666
02:04:17,424 --> 02:04:18,484
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to see.

1667
02:04:18,524 --> 02:04:19,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of geography.

1668
02:04:19,724 --> 02:04:20,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1669
02:04:20,624 --> 02:04:21,865
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my whole point here.

1670
02:04:22,305 --> 02:04:23,785
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're adding more

1671
02:04:25,142 --> 02:04:28,046
[SPEAKER_10]: apartments or condos in our community.

1672
02:04:28,306 --> 02:04:34,193
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to see where in the community is and which schools it's going to impact and how we want to deal with that.

1673
02:04:34,794 --> 02:04:36,676
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be proactive, not reactive.

1674
02:04:37,137 --> 02:04:39,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just want to be careful with that.

1675
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:54,591
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe we redistrict any new building in this side, from this side over goes to this school, and this side over goes to this school for future districting, not redistricting existing people.

1676
02:04:54,631 --> 02:04:57,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you get less people mad at you already that live here.

1677
02:04:57,874 --> 02:04:59,215
[SPEAKER_10]: All right?

1678
02:04:59,515 --> 02:05:05,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I asked for this report, is I want to be proactive, not reactive in how we place students.

1679
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:11,283
[SPEAKER_10]: and to make sure that no one school is more crowded than others.

1680
02:05:12,344 --> 02:05:21,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is good information, so I make a motion at this point to re-look at these numbers again at the end of the school year, so in June.

1681
02:05:21,369 --> 02:05:23,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to do January.

1682
02:05:24,631 --> 02:05:25,752
[SPEAKER_10]: See if there's any changes.

1683
02:05:26,212 --> 02:05:27,873
[SPEAKER_14]: This capital will be coming online.

1684
02:05:28,093 --> 02:05:29,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so even, yeah.

1685
02:05:30,035 --> 02:05:30,435
[SPEAKER_16]: So moved.

1686
02:05:31,548 --> 02:05:35,833
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion, this report be updated for the first meeting in January.

1687
02:05:35,853 --> 02:05:37,835
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1688
02:05:38,095 --> 02:05:38,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1689
02:05:38,696 --> 02:05:39,356
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1690
02:05:39,416 --> 02:05:40,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1691
02:05:40,898 --> 02:05:41,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1692
02:05:41,238 --> 02:05:42,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And that the report be placed on file.

1693
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,681
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1694
02:05:43,701 --> 02:05:43,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1695
02:05:44,141 --> 02:05:45,463
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1696
02:05:45,503 --> 02:05:46,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1697
02:05:47,085 --> 02:05:49,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Financial report close out of fiscal year 17.

1698
02:05:49,287 --> 02:05:49,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1699
02:05:49,347 --> 02:05:49,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Patterson.

1700
02:05:57,084 --> 02:06:08,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So just as a preview, as a first-year finance director, it was important to become familiar with Medford's chart of accounts, the budget categories, structurally, and payroll placements.

1701
02:06:08,736 --> 02:06:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So this end-of-year report is a

1702
02:06:11,319 --> 02:06:29,758
[SPEAKER_06]: High-level look by department and category for end of year fiscal 17 as the report indicates the appropriation budget Offered by the city side is the fifty four million three hundred and thirty three thousand an additional 2.1

1703
02:06:31,579 --> 02:06:37,704
[SPEAKER_06]: was identified from outside revenue sources as the overall budget totaling $56,443,392 for fiscal year 2017.

1704
02:06:37,764 --> 02:06:41,407
[SPEAKER_06]: The year end finished with expenditures and remaining encumbrances totaling $55,686,555.

1705
02:06:52,135 --> 02:06:54,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So the difference in this closeout was $1,458,616.

1706
02:06:56,598 --> 02:07:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a $651,776 less than projected to cover from additional revenue sources within the school departments.

1707
02:07:09,386 --> 02:07:17,392
[SPEAKER_06]: The remaining revenue offset has already been earmarked and planned for balancing for the FY18 budget revenue sources as well.

1708
02:07:18,287 --> 02:07:19,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't spend enough money?

1709
02:07:20,527 --> 02:07:20,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

1710
02:07:22,188 --> 02:07:24,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, that's not what we're saying.

1711
02:07:25,048 --> 02:07:34,210
[SPEAKER_06]: We were looking at, you know, as we build the budget, it's a multi-year planning and analysis process.

1712
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:47,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's done late in the fiscal year so that we can attempt to project where we are at in the current fiscal year and identify issues or concerns moving forward that we need to

1713
02:07:48,613 --> 02:07:56,196
[SPEAKER_06]: provide additional sources for, which we knew we were going to have some lower circuit breaker reimbursements in FY18.

1714
02:07:56,717 --> 02:08:02,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to have reduced grant funding, and we have reduced homeless transportation reimbursement.

1715
02:08:02,359 --> 02:08:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of these indicators made it necessary and prudent for us to be as conservative as possible.

1716
02:08:11,323 --> 02:08:13,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So that $651,000 has been earmarked and planned for

1717
02:08:17,905 --> 02:08:19,826
[SPEAKER_06]: in the FY18 budget process.

1718
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:21,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news.

1719
02:08:21,987 --> 02:08:35,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So, moving forward, again, as high-level overviews, and again, these are programmatic savings in various line items.

1720
02:08:35,753 --> 02:08:39,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, district-wide salaries, we budget for

1721
02:08:40,695 --> 02:08:43,857
[SPEAKER_06]: a lump sum that is to be distributed and reallocated.

1722
02:08:43,977 --> 02:08:49,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, being new within the district, it looks like there's funds remaining there.

1723
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they have already been dispersed among the appropriate accounts for step lane changes, things of that sort.

1724
02:08:58,786 --> 02:09:08,296
[SPEAKER_06]: The district-wide substitute account, we did realize some savings related to more automatic and accurate substitute call-out.

1725
02:09:08,796 --> 02:09:19,628
[SPEAKER_06]: The ASAP system was implemented and completed year one in fiscal year 2017, and it did realize some savings in that area.

1726
02:09:20,589 --> 02:09:41,303
[SPEAKER_06]: The ELL department salaries, these were paid within school program codes, so although they had been budgeted in one department, they were, again, the matching up in terms of salaries was for the end of year reporting purposes and did not necessarily align with the budget line placement.

1727
02:09:41,783 --> 02:09:48,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, just moving forward from my perspective, year one finance director,

1728
02:09:48,748 --> 02:09:55,453
[SPEAKER_06]: it was necessary for me to identify and see where these were before making significant changes.

1729
02:09:55,533 --> 02:09:58,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be in that process moving forward for FY18.

1730
02:10:00,257 --> 02:10:09,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, the similar situation in the guidance, the directors were paid within the district-wide program versus the guidance department.

1731
02:10:10,064 --> 02:10:16,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is reporting distinctions for end-of-year report that did not align with the budget placement.

1732
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:22,874
[SPEAKER_06]: the English language arts salaries, again, paid within the school program codes.

1733
02:10:23,535 --> 02:10:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is just for the understanding of the end of year report.

1734
02:10:28,098 --> 02:10:31,621
[SPEAKER_06]: The Department of Ed requires us to report by school.

1735
02:10:32,322 --> 02:10:36,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a need to track this and be able to see

1736
02:10:36,585 --> 02:10:42,508
[SPEAKER_06]: the expenses for salaries in certain categories at a school-wide level.

1737
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:52,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something, you know, to keep in mind as we do budget a program, those expenses still will have to be reported out at the end of year.

1738
02:10:52,494 --> 02:11:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's still some alignment within our structure that just has to be translated to the end of year report.

1739
02:11:00,698 --> 02:11:03,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So where it seems to be variances,

1740
02:11:04,321 --> 02:11:09,713
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the rationale in terms of the actual placement of the expense.

1741
02:11:10,901 --> 02:11:14,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, similar situation within the library department salaries.

1742
02:11:14,903 --> 02:11:22,087
[SPEAKER_06]: The director had been paid through district-wide program area versus the library departmental area.

1743
02:11:22,908 --> 02:11:36,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The buildings and grounds, the utility usage for heating, which was natural gas, and our phone services did have some favorable contract rates, and we did have lower utilization.

1744
02:11:37,576 --> 02:11:41,001
[SPEAKER_06]: with the weather and things of that sort, so that was favorable.

1745
02:11:41,562 --> 02:11:45,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, again, unpredictable year-to-year.

1746
02:11:45,627 --> 02:11:52,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So the budget reflects a need and anticipated heating year.

1747
02:11:54,799 --> 02:12:01,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Due to certain situations in terms of building temperatures, things of that sort, it can fluctuate.

1748
02:12:02,805 --> 02:12:10,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we don't see a spike this year, but I don't know what the Farmer's Almanac will reveal.

1749
02:12:13,674 --> 02:12:22,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, each year during our budget process, our revenue sources are identified as the supplement to the appropriated budget.

1750
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a means to achieve the district goals.

1751
02:12:26,501 --> 02:12:33,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So the amounts that we had utilized and identified from each source was dependent on program needs and the available balances.

1752
02:12:34,286 --> 02:12:37,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we close out and continue to reconcile the year end,

1753
02:12:38,008 --> 02:12:43,929
[SPEAKER_06]: We will draw from the following accounts that we had identified during the FY17 budget development process.

1754
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:53,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, with foresight going into the FY18 process, those similar program areas were earmarked for revenue offsets.

1755
02:12:54,592 --> 02:13:02,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And those areas include the before and after school programs, the MEEP, the SURE, and special ed tuitions that come in.

1756
02:13:03,474 --> 02:13:08,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The circuit breaker, again, we've been notified that that reimbursement level has decreased.

1757
02:13:08,976 --> 02:13:10,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We're down to about 65%.

1758
02:13:11,436 --> 02:13:20,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a cost that cannot be managed or tracked year to year, dependent on student need.

1759
02:13:20,379 --> 02:13:30,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So transportation reimbursement, again, that continues to drop, and as we have fewer students

1760
02:13:31,602 --> 02:13:36,765
[SPEAKER_06]: placed out of our district, those funds begin to dwindle.

1761
02:13:37,426 --> 02:13:51,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have vocational tuitions, and we had E-rate reimbursement, as well as our building facility rentals, which included all of the community schools, our rink, our pool, the fields, which we have reviewed extensively.

1762
02:13:52,274 --> 02:14:06,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, continuous communication, working with the city hall, our auditor side, and treasury, we will be determining final amounts from each of the sources and plan the application of those moving forward to FY18.

1763
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:16,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we go forward, moving along in this fiscal year, reports will be provided as we continue to do the finalization of closeouts.

1764
02:14:17,824 --> 02:14:19,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good, thank you so much, Christine.

1765
02:14:19,844 --> 02:14:20,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Burkus.

1766
02:14:20,425 --> 02:14:20,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1767
02:14:20,585 --> 02:14:20,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Stone.

1768
02:14:21,812 --> 02:14:30,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Kristina, just on the first page, the third paragraph, the last one, the undistributed unemployment, is that one employee, or is that a number of employees?

1769
02:14:30,634 --> 02:14:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: No, multiple employees throughout the year.

1770
02:14:32,854 --> 02:14:38,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and is that, so it's 72,000, is that accurate?

1771
02:14:38,496 --> 02:14:40,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a typical year for unemployment?

1772
02:14:41,236 --> 02:14:44,077
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be the average looking back, yes.

1773
02:14:44,857 --> 02:14:45,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, wow.

1774
02:14:45,957 --> 02:14:47,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the school department size.

1775
02:14:47,958 --> 02:14:48,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

1776
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:50,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1777
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:50,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot.

1778
02:14:50,930 --> 02:14:56,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine, I just want to thank you for your diligence in sorting out all of these accounts, and this is good news.

1779
02:14:56,232 --> 02:14:56,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1780
02:14:56,952 --> 02:14:57,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1781
02:14:57,592 --> 02:14:58,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, Christine.

1782
02:14:58,952 --> 02:14:59,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1783
02:15:00,413 --> 02:15:03,854
[SPEAKER_14]: So at this point, if we could just entertain a quick little diversion.

1784
02:15:03,874 --> 02:15:12,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how many of you realize, but over the course of the last week, we've been collecting sporting goods equipment to send down to the Houston area.

1785
02:15:13,436 --> 02:15:21,282
[SPEAKER_14]: We realized how they were devastated, and a lot of people were giving blood, donating money, and doing all sorts of things to help them out.

1786
02:15:21,983 --> 02:15:26,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor, came up with an idea, and he said, why don't we do a drive?

1787
02:15:26,686 --> 02:15:27,967
[SPEAKER_14]: These kids want to get back.

1788
02:15:29,008 --> 02:15:30,028
[SPEAKER_14]: They have no equipment.

1789
02:15:30,129 --> 02:15:31,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything's been just ruined.

1790
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:33,951
[SPEAKER_14]: So he wanted to start a drive for it.

1791
02:15:35,072 --> 02:15:41,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack Dempsey has put together this awesome video that is on a truck right now rolling into Texas.

1792
02:15:41,917 --> 02:15:45,539
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just really spectacular how the community came together.

1793
02:15:45,559 --> 02:15:56,447
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the sporting teams and the sporting equipment stores that supply our players with their equipment came through and put so many things on this truck.

1794
02:15:56,847 --> 02:15:57,988
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just simply amazing.

1795
02:15:58,088 --> 02:16:04,352
[SPEAKER_14]: So without further ado, I hope you all enjoy this video that Jack and the team put together with all the kids at the high school.
