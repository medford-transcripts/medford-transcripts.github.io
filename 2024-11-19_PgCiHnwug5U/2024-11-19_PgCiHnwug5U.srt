105
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:25,080
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm very disappointed that we weren't able to do that this year and I wasn't able to be there as a city councilor.

106
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:36,547
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do know that in addition to the flags, there were door decorations and memoriam, just so much from people all across the city, really making this as best as possible.

107
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:40,174
[SPEAKER_18]: a memorial day to remember, even though we can't be together.

00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:12,220
[SPEAKER_17]: And Michael Beachy highlighted the fact that we had a lot of community participation, a lot of community flags at Oak Grove.

116
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:26,829

00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:58,966

186
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:20,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

187
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:21,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Mr. President.

188
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,995
[SPEAKER_17]: It's National DPW, National Public Works Week.

189
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:31,617
[SPEAKER_17]: The public works have been essential employees since the government shutdown that have been providing great services to the community.

190
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,377
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to,

191
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:38,767
[SPEAKER_17]: move to recognize their work and their commitment to our city and ask my council colleagues for their support as I move for approval.

192
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:40,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

193
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:42,830
[SPEAKER_11]: On motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by?

194
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

195
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:44,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

196
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello?

197
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:47,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

198
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,135
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this forward.

199
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:57,220
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, talk about a group of people who are probably one of the hottest working group in the city of Medford.

200
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,183
[SPEAKER_20]: is our DPW, greatly understaffed, but they're out there.

201
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of them work seven days a week for the city of Medford.

202
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:18,870
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, this small thing is so insignificant into the amount of work that these people put in day after day in our community.

203
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,891
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I want to thank them for all the hard work they do.

204
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:26,479
[SPEAKER_20]: say for every day of the week, not just Monday to Friday.

205
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of these men and women are seven day a week people here.

206
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:34,163
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's it, you get the water department guys out there, those cold nights in the winter.

207
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:38,985
[SPEAKER_20]: There's not enough that can be said about our DPW crew.

208
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,906
[SPEAKER_20]: So I wanna thank them for all their hard work.

209
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

210
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:44,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

211
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

212
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:51,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I wanna thank Councilor Knight for putting this forth and echo my council colleagues.

213
00:13:52,602 --> 00:14:17,607
[SPEAKER_16]: As a new Councilor, you get pretty familiar with the DPW very quickly, and I was fortunate enough to take a tour throughout the whole yard with Brian and Steve, and they took me around, and I got to meet everyone and see the people that are super responsive, who are out there responding to residents, either going through us or going directly, and they are an instrumental part of this city, and so much of what the city is could not be possible without them.

214
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,848
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really wanna echo the thanks for their service.

215
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

216
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:23,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

217
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

218
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

219
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:38,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's almost like the Wizard of Oz that, you know, the department is severely understaffed and there are very few people behind the curtain.

220
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:41,070
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me tell you, they get the job done on a daily basis.

221
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And from the leader, Brian Cairns on down, they do a tremendous work on behalf of the residents of this community.

222
00:14:49,213 --> 00:15:01,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very attentive in addressing issues and as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, you know, they're out there in the cold nights and the hot days doing what it takes to keep our city moving forward.

223
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to thank them all personally.

224
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:05,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

225
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:05,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

226
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

227
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,901
[SPEAKER_18]: I echo everything that my colleagues have said.

228
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And Brian has been fantastic as well.

229
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:17,504
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to give a special thanks to

230
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:22,090
[SPEAKER_18]: the folks at DPW who are also down at the cemetery right now.

231
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:32,673
[SPEAKER_18]: As we all know, there's been a significant growth in people dying, and I think that's really difficult work, and they've been making it happen.

232
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:38,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So in addition to the whole DPW, I just want to recognize them in a very difficult time doing very difficult work.

233
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

234
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:42,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

235
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Powell.

236
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:45,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Again,

237
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I support and reiterate what my fellow colleagues have said.

238
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,654
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, again, we're talking about during the best times that we've seen economically.

239
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Our DPW has functioned on the most deplorable number of staff, one being the civil service and renegotiating and reworking that system.

240
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:12,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But the community should know, no matter what

241
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:19,084
[SPEAKER_06]: the city has given them, they've come out and done the best that they could do for what we have in Medford.

242
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:27,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really appreciate all their hard work and understand that times are gonna get tougher soon.

243
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,950
[SPEAKER_06]: And we appreciate everything they've done for us.

244
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:33,092
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been yeoman's work for sure, so thank you.

245
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

246
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:37,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello, did you have another comment?

247
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,007
[SPEAKER_11]: No comment, Mr. President.

248
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:40,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

249
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:49,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I ask the clerk to call the roll, if I may add, or echo the sentiments of my colleagues as well, our ITVW is always out there.

250
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,236
[SPEAKER_11]: They're working hard.

251
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:54,960
[SPEAKER_11]: They are civilly understaffed, but they always get the job done.

252
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,862
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate all their hard work.

253
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Councilor Bears had a very good point.

254
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Up at the cemetery now,

255
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:07,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that experiencing up to six burials a day, that is a really high number.

256
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:15,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know they're always working, they're always working hard, and we appreciate all their hard work and all their efforts.

257
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:23,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clark-Curtabese, would you please call the roll?

258
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

259
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:34,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

260
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello?

261
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:36,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

262
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:37,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

263
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:38,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

264
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

265
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

266
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:42,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

267
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:43,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

268
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:44,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

269
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:45,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

270
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:46,539
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

271
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:50,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes.

272
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:05,289
[SPEAKER_11]: 2-0-373, offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Meckon City Council extend its congratulations to Mae Mockerbeck on the celebration of her 90th birthday, Vice President Caraviello.

273
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,670
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

274
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:14,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, if I were to start talking about Mae Mockerbeck and her contributions throughout the community, we'd be here until midnight.

275
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,268
[SPEAKER_20]: May's commitment to the city of Medford has been unwavering.

276
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:37,082
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether she was a Mustang Hall of Fame, great athlete in her day, worked with the Chevalier, worked with the Cachet, you name it, May Markenbrink has been a part of anything that goes on in this community.

277
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,887
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said, she's turned 90 and she acts like she's 50.

278
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,748
[SPEAKER_20]: She's out there, I mean, listen, she's out there walking.

279
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:47,869
[SPEAKER_20]: She's probably in better shape than me, Mr. President.

280
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,693
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, I want to say, like I said, there's not enough words that you can say for Mae Markenbrink for her years with the dedication to this community.

281
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:59,954
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to say happy birthday to Mae.

282
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:05,616
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a shame that we can't really have a true celebration for you.

283
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:09,058
[SPEAKER_20]: So Mae, happy birthday and see you on your 100th.

284
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

285
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

286
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

287
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:27,834
[SPEAKER_06]: To my Hall of Fame sister, Mae Magelbeck, I appreciate everything she's done for our community, and it's great for our new councils.

288
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:31,216
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever meet Mae, she's going to tell you exactly what

289
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,358
[SPEAKER_06]: what is what's best for our community.

290
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:40,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's totally out of total respect and honor and love of our community.

291
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:47,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think she's one of the true gems of our community and a pillar of our community.

292
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:48,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish her a happy birthday.

293
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that when we do bring May up, she brings a glow

294
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,794
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's one of the awards she's received in the past, the council.

295
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of sad that we're not with May, because we would have invited her up, I'm sure.

296
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:17,485
[SPEAKER_06]: But she really makes you feel great and understands why you want to work so hard for the city of Medford, because people like May wake up every day that have nothing, has nothing in the game, and making sure that she's volunteering and doing what is the best for our city.

297
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It's remarkable.

298
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy birthday, my friend, and many more.

299
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

300
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.

301
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:27,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

302
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:30,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Vice President Caraviello for putting this on.

303
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,223
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 years young, May Makibrek, what an accomplishment.

304
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:42,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I had the unique opportunity to serve on the Methodist Council, incorporated with May on the board.

305
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:55,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about someone that's a plugger, a go-getter, never took no for an answer, and truly was unselfish when it came to never wanting the recognition, just wanting to get things done in the community.

306
00:20:56,001 --> 00:21:00,282
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't for May, you could safely say the Boys and Girls Club would not exist.

307
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:11,525
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't for May, the Friends of Chevalier wouldn't be supporting the Chevalier Auditorium for the many, many years and all the improvements that were done to Chevalier.

308
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:17,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, May has been instrumental in this community and continues to be instrumental in this community.

309
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:19,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to personally

310
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:27,806
[SPEAKER_04]: congratulator and wish her another hundred years of community involvement in this community, Mr. President.

311
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:29,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

312
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:35,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may also thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

313
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,320
[SPEAKER_11]: May has been an unbelievable member of our community, always volunteering.

314
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone once used the term volunteer extraordinaire, and that's who she is.

315
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:49,562
[SPEAKER_11]: She is someone who's always volunteering, always giving back.

316
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's someone who's always tells you what's on her mind, which is nice.

317
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:57,559
[SPEAKER_11]: but I just want to wish her a very, very happy birthday.

318
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy 90th birthday to Maymar Quebec, and best wishes to her.

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:10,842
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Sara Coley, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

320
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:15,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

321
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:16,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

322
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello?

323
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:18,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

324
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:19,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

325
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:20,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

326
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

327
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:23,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

328
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell.

329
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:25,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

330
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:27,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

331
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:28,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

332
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:29,628
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco.

333
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:31,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

334
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,389
[SPEAKER_11]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

335
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:33,309
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

336
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:37,091
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-374 offered by Councilor Marks.

337
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:45,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the concerns on South Street in the intersection of South Street and Main Street be discussed.

338
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:45,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

339
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:48,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

340
00:22:49,236 --> 00:23:03,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I rise once again with my fellow colleagues to bring up the concern of public safety, in particular at the corner of Main Street and South Street and along the entirety of South Street.

341
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:28,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Last we spoke, Mr. President, I think it was a couple of months ago, we brought up this issue regarding some of the traffic calming initiatives that were pushed forward during a public meeting that hundreds of residents in the area attended, and of which many of the initiatives that were sent to the Traffic Commission have yet to be done, Mr. President, which is a little alarming.

342
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:43,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Mr. President, within the last couple of months, and I have talked to Chief Buckley just recently, and I'm in the process of getting the traffic accidents in that particular area from the chief, an update.

343
00:23:44,204 --> 00:23:51,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been several major traffic accidents on that particular corner in the last couple of months.

344
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an issue that's not going away.

345
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's existed for, I'd have to say since I've been on the council,

346
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So 20 years, Mr. President, we've been asking for some relief.

347
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, that section of the corner of Main and South is a state road, and they have jurisdiction over that particular piece of road that we are discussing.

348
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:27,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did, Mr. President, I went through some of the studies that were initiated by this community since 2005.

349
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:43,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found it pretty interesting that each study that I looked at all spoke about the need for traffic calming and traffic improvements, safety improvements in the Method Square area.

350
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:59,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has been since 2005, over four reports that I could get my hands on, and I'm sure there were more, Mr. President, all spoke about initiatives that should be done in our community to improve traffic flow, pedestrian,

351
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:06,194
[SPEAKER_04]: bicycles, and in my opinion, very little has been acted upon.

352
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:15,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So the most recent report we have was December 2018, which was the Method Square Priority Roadway Improvement Study.

353
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:20,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was done by the Boston Regional Metropolitan Planning Organization.

354
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:23,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was commissioned in December, 2018.

355
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:41,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they came out with, uh, I don't know if it was a 40, 50 page report, uh, that talked about, uh, the method square surrounding area and ways to make improvements of which, um, I'd like to go through Mr. President, their recommendations.

356
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:53,347
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Medford Square area, and I'd like to isolate not on all their recommendations, but the intersection of South Street and Main Street, Mr. President.

357
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will get into that.

358
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:00,872
[SPEAKER_04]: The second report that was commissioned by the city was December 2017.

359
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:07,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a year before the Medford Square Priority Roadway Improvement Plan.

360
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the Medford Square Master Plan.

361
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:13,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was done by the Metro Area Planning Council.

362
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:16,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And that had an associated cost of $90,000.

363
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That also got into the improvements and traffic calming improvements that were needed in the Medford Square area.

364
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:32,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not going to get into that, Mr. President, because I think much of that is covered in the Medford Square priority roadway improvement.

365
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,329
[SPEAKER_04]: The report prior to that was in the fall of 2006.

366
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:43,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Medford Square and Mystic River Reconnection, Revitalization, and Redevelopment Study.

367
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:45,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was done by MIT.

368
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:47,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And that talked about parking.

369
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:50,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It talked about improvements to the downtown area.

370
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It talked about revitalizing business.

371
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That encompassed a lot more than just roadways.

372
00:26:56,756 --> 00:27:00,998
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the roadway in question, Salt Street and Main,

373
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,860
[SPEAKER_04]: was mentioned, Mr. President, and ways to improve that.

374
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back in 2006.

375
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:17,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last report I could find was the original Medford Square Master Plan, which was done by Sasaki in June of 2005.

376
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:23,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And that had an associated cost of a little over $100,000.

377
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:27,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't have the cost of the other studies.

378
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:40,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So the two that I have, Mr. President, were close to $200,000 in studies with very little in the way of improvements to our roadways, which

379
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:55,927
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, Mr. President, is alarming when we have to talk about it year after year and know that as time goes by, accidents increase, pedestrian safety is at an all time dangerous rate in that particular area.

380
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should concern all of us.

381
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:05,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So December 2018, the Metropolitan Planning Organization conducted this study.

382
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:15,698
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, the study is part of the MPO series of ongoing studies that addresses safety, mobility, and access of the Boston region's priority roadways.

383
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:34,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This report identifies specific issues and concerns in Medford Square study area, presents an in-depth analysis of multiple transportation-related factors, and recommends potential short, long-term solutions to problems, including improvement alternatives.

384
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:44,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So the study goes on to talk about 2.4 total miles of needed improvements on our roadways at many different sections.

385
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:52,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to focus, Mr. President, on the Main Street, Route 38 from Salem Street to Mystic Ave.

386
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:59,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And that calls into question, as we all know, the South Street and Main Street connection.

387
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. President, in 2000, 2013, and 2015, mass DOT data shows that the crash clusters

388
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:17,413
[SPEAKER_04]: that are present throughout the entire study area, which I just alluded to this five different major study areas.

389
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:28,478
[SPEAKER_04]: They were ranked in the top 5% of crash locations in the Boston region MPO area.

390
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:36,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have five locations in Medford that are in the top 5% of crash clusters.

391
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:44,323
[SPEAKER_04]: That speaks volumes, Mr. President, and that was indicated within this December 2018 report.

392
00:29:45,884 --> 00:30:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes on to say, Mr. President, that the Main Street corridor from Craddock Bridge to Mystic Ave, whose two most concerning intersections are Main Street at Route 16 ramps and Main Street at Mystic Ave, which is the area that we're focusing on, Mr. President.

393
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,228
[SPEAKER_04]: The issues of concern

394
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're all, some of us, this is old hat.

395
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we've got to keep on revisiting this, Mr. President.

396
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:30,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a talk today with Christine Barber, our state representative, who assured me that there's transportation bond bill money that is for the purpose of putting signalization throughout the square, which was a major recommendation.

397
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:36,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was an estimated cost, which I brought up several months back at, I want to say, $4 to $5 million,

398
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: which sounds like overkill in my opinion, but that's what they came out with.

399
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:51,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But according to Representative Barber, that there is money in the transportation bond bill.

400
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:52,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It just has to be freed up.

401
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:58,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So, issues of concern, there is considerable traffic on Main Street during the a.m.

402
00:30:58,697 --> 00:30:59,217
[SPEAKER_04]: and p.m.

403
00:30:59,277 --> 00:30:59,958
[SPEAKER_04]: peak periods.

404
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone crossing those streets realize, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, it's a game of chicken or frog.

405
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:16,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogger trying to cross those streets and even just trying to get out onto Main Street is you're taking your life in your hands.

406
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The intersection at Main Street Route 16 ramps is currently un-signalized with stop controls at Route 16 westbound off-ramp and South Street joined by Route 16 eastbound off-ramp.

407
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:34,749
[SPEAKER_04]: During peak traffic periods, the stop control approaches are extremely congested.

408
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:46,777
[SPEAKER_04]: The intersection of Main Street and Mystic Ave currently operates with flashing yellow on Main Street southbound and Mystic Ave flashing red on Main Street northbound during peak periods.

409
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:58,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Vehicles on Main Street northbound endure extensive delays and frequently force themselves into the intersection, what causes potential conflicts with prevailing traffic and sometimes gridlock.

410
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:00,335
[SPEAKER_04]: the intersection.

411
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:10,340
[SPEAKER_04]: These two intersections have a crash rate much higher than the district floor average of un-signalized sections.

412
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:20,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's ranked in the top 5% and it has a much higher average of crashes than other un-signalized intersections.

413
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:31,663
[SPEAKER_04]: With no traffic signals, with pedestrian phases, and under heavy traffic, pedestrians usually have a difficult time crossing the two intersections.

414
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Pedestrian crosswalk markings on Main Street are faded.

415
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: That was 2018.

416
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,948
[SPEAKER_04]: They have since painted the crosswalks.

417
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:50,673
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no sufficient shoulders or clearly marked shared road bicycle accommodations on Main Street and Mystic Ave.

418
00:32:52,178 --> 00:33:01,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So the report went on, Mr. President, and the reason why I bring this up is we don't have to recreate the wheel when it comes to what needs to be done.

419
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:15,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We have four commission reports by organizations that came in, did a thorough investigation, had community input, public hearings, and made recommendations.

420
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:22,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are 15 years later, and we're no closer to addressing our concerns.

421
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet, accidents continue to happen.

422
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Very serious accidents, Mr. President.

423
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So the proposed short-term improvements, and I'll go over them briefly, regularly maintain the crosswalks.

424
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:44,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think that would be a no-brainer, but in our community, it's something that has to be revisited every year.

425
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:50,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I asked for thermal plastic crosswalks, which don't need repainting every year.

426
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They last five years, they're slip resistant, they're highly reflective, and we still don't incorporate that as a common practice in our community.

427
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: which it's a little more expensive, but the state uses them and every other large agency and city uses thermoplastic in the use of their pavement markings.

428
00:34:13,249 --> 00:34:19,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Install stripe yield lines in both directions at the crosswalk on Main Street near the police station.

429
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:25,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Consider removing on-street parking in front of the police station and providing at least five foot shoulders on both sides

430
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:26,958
[SPEAKER_04]: of Main Street.

431
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:34,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Install striped sharrows at appropriate locations of both streets south of the intersection of Main Street and Mystic Ave.

432
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:49,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Support development on South Method Connector, a multi-use path on South Bank of the Mystic River that would connect the Mystic Greenway currently understudied by the City of Method and the Mystic River Watershed Association.

433
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,276
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term improvements.

434
00:34:52,917 --> 00:35:01,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Both the intersection of Main Street at Route 16 ramps and Main Street at Mystic Ave should be signalized and reconstructed.

435
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:10,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Main Street at Route 16, in summary, this study proposes alternative 1A and 1B for the interchange, long-term improvements.

436
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: 1A, signalize the two ramp intersections under one controller with three phase traffic operations and concurrent pedestrian phases.

437
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Mr. President, I need to add that this does not talk about signalization all the way from Salem Street, which we were originally told by the state would run us anywhere from $3 to $5 million.

438
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:49,008
[SPEAKER_04]: This is far more of a centralized approach to alleviate the concerns we have on the Main Street, South Street area to Mystic Ave.

439
00:35:49,708 --> 00:36:00,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Alternative B, signalize the two ramp intersections under one controller with four-phase traffic operations and concurrent pedestrian phases.

440
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Mr. President, I won't get into all the other improvements, but I do have them and I am going to list them, Mr. President.

441
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask that as part of this report, the funding that MassDOT says is clearly available for this project.

442
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:30,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would ask any of my colleagues to go on to the FY, the 2018 Medford Square Priority Roadway Improvement Study.

443
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could see that for themselves that the state is saying funding is available for this particular project.

444
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:51,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know why we're in a quandary now, how we're going to pay for this and why we haven't moved forward on this project for at least the last two years since we received this report, Mr. President.

445
00:36:51,632 --> 00:37:00,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that through our traffic engineer and through our engineer that we find out about the funding.

446
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:18,989
[SPEAKER_04]: that DOT admits is available to the city of Medford for the Route 16, Mystic Ave portion of improvements that were mentioned within the Priority Roadway Improvement Study of 2018.

447
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:27,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also ask, Mr. President, once again, I think we did this six months ago, and I don't recall a response.

448
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:29,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe my colleagues can correct me.

449
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:50,849
[SPEAKER_04]: but the council recommended during a public meeting with hundreds of residents from the South Street area, some simple low-lying fruit of stop signs, widening sidewalks, raised crosswalks, maybe even a pedestrian crossing light on South Street in general.

450
00:37:51,885 --> 00:38:01,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And there may have been one or two improvements, but largely, Mr. President, many of the recommendations that were forwarded to the traffic commission have not been acted upon yet.

451
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's a reason why I, as one member of the council, would like to know, if it's a financial reason, then we should have that discussion with the mayor and try to find out.

452
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be discussing budget shortly, what needs to be done to move these along.

453
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:30,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we asked for a meeting with our state delegation, uh, regarding, um, improvements to the state roadway, which is at the corner of Maine and, uh, and South street.

454
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:33,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I know we met with DOT sometime back.

455
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:45,625
[SPEAKER_04]: They really took a hotline stance on, uh, you know, more or less saying that they didn't have the funding to do the full signalization from Salem street on down to Mystic Ave.

456
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:50,707
[SPEAKER_04]: and put that outrageous cost estimate on getting that done.

457
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:56,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask once again, Mr. President, maybe we need a roundtable summit.

458
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need to bring in someone higher up

459
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:07,303
[SPEAKER_04]: than the representatives we're seeing from DOT.

460
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need the commissioner present, Mr. President.

461
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:14,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need the lieutenant governor present.

462
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:26,112
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, to me, an all-time risk right now we face for our residents, for people driving, for people on bicycles, for pedestrians.

463
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:28,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can no longer sit around, Mr. President.

464
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've all issued our concerns.

465
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We can no longer sit around and say, you know what, we're waiting for the state to act.

466
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:51,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said it before, many of the state roads in our community, and I feel this strongly, if the state doesn't want to act, we should step forward and act and worry about the ramifications after.

467
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:54,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these are roads in our community.

468
00:39:54,669 --> 00:40:08,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the state doesn't want to act upon these or feels that it's too expensive, putting a cost on public safety and lives in our community, then we need to step forward, Mr. President, as a community.

469
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to shake the tree.

470
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,363
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to yell from the highest mountain, whatever it's going to take, Mr. President, to get this done.

471
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:24,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also are locating a public safety building across the street.

472
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: What message does that send to residents that may want to go to the public safety building, that may want to walk there?

473
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:38,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It sends a lousy message, Mr. President, that you're not welcome unless you drive there.

474
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:41,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It sends an awful message in our community.

475
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:53,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So as soon as I get the results, Mr. President, from the number of accidents at that location that Chief Buckley said they're working on, I will also present that to the council.

476
00:40:53,901 --> 00:41:12,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask in the form of a motion that the traffic engineer and our city engineer look at the 2018 report and find out why we have not solicited the funding according to what MassDOT said we're eligible, and also that

477
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: They look into the traffic calming initiatives that were pushed forward by a unanimous vote of this council back many months ago, and where we stand with that, Mr. President.

478
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:30,188
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would respectfully ask you, Mr. President, that we set up a roundtable.

479
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:39,908
[SPEAKER_04]: with our state delegation, with higher ups from DOT, whoever we can get at the meeting, Mr. President, this is vital on behalf of our community.

480
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank my colleagues for indulging me with that presentation.

481
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:46,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I second that as a motion, Mr. President.

482
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:49,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

483
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:53,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Hurtubise, do you have the wording in the motion?

484
00:41:56,738 --> 00:42:04,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I have the main motion is the discussion, is 20-374.

485
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:06,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got three amendments to it.

486
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:10,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather than go through them in excruciating detail, there's three amendments.

487
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is to consult with the city engineer and traffic, ask the city engineer and the traffic engineer to report back on why funds were not solicited in the 2018 report.

488
00:42:22,348 --> 00:42:24,210
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one is to play.

489
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That was mentioned in the 2018 report as being available.

490
00:42:27,952 --> 00:42:30,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I will clean this up a little bit more when I watch the video tomorrow.

491
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:32,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

492
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the second part is for the city engineer and the traffic engineer to

493
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,601
[SPEAKER_09]: looking to the traffic improvements that were recommended by the council several months ago at that intersection.

494
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:53,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the third amendment was for the council to have a roundtable meeting with DOT, with the state delegation on the council, to discuss these issues.

495
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:56,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a clarification on the second one.

496
00:42:57,046 --> 00:42:57,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at the end.

497
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:02,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It was South Street and the intersection of South and Main.

498
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

499
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:06,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a number of improvements requested on South Street itself.

500
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,350
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

501
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

502
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:11,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

503
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:12,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

504
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:13,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

505
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:19,270
[SPEAKER_11]: To that motion was made by Councilor Marks, who is seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

506
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,492
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a number of Councilors that want to speak on this.

507
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,736
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this point, I recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Knight.

508
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:27,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

509
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:31,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward again.

511
00:43:32,682 --> 00:43:37,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know we'll ask probably Mr. Rodriguez to speak in a minute.

512
00:43:37,546 --> 00:43:45,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we had a recent conversation of the South Street concerns, and I've talked to the state delegations as well.

513
00:43:46,272 --> 00:43:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: They're waiting for the final number to come back to see how much it

514
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,230
[SPEAKER_06]: taking to pay for this.

515
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,311
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was told, to implement the lights.

516
00:44:02,011 --> 00:44:06,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll be the culmination of correcting that issue.

517
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: But where we are today is something we've asked for.

518
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:22,676
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm gonna do, I would like to make an amendment, if Councilor Marks allows me to, for putting an amendment to this resolution, that we look at the low-hanging fruit

519
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: and implement these few initiatives, as well as hold a Committee of the Whole meeting with our traffic engineer, our chief of staff, and our police chief to talk about these simple concerns.

520
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:45,796
[SPEAKER_06]: One, the raised sidewalks to be implemented on South and Main.

521
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:46,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

522
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:51,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott.

523
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you slow down just a little bit so I can copy these all down?

524
00:44:54,268 --> 00:44:54,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

525
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,510
[SPEAKER_06]: One is to implement the raised sidewalks.

526
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Crosswalks.

527
00:44:59,210 --> 00:44:59,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

528
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:03,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

529
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:11,076
[SPEAKER_06]: The raised sidewalks we asked for and were questioned because of the plowing situation.

530
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:16,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only concern back when we made this ad months ago.

531
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:19,933
[SPEAKER_06]: raised sidewalk on Main Street and South Street.

532
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,154
[SPEAKER_06]: On that intersection- Sidewalk or crosswalk?

533
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:23,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, crosswalk.

534
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:36,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Street and South Street, the intersection, and on Main Street and South Street going toward South Medford.

535
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:41,018
[SPEAKER_06]: on the opposite side of Main Street.

536
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:53,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the narrowing to one lane and adding the traffic posts that go along the side where they would eliminate the parking in front of the police station.

537
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:55,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be eliminated to one lane.

538
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So it slows the traffic down to that area.

539
00:46:00,982 --> 00:46:03,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And then paint along that lane.

540
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:27,377
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that it is visible, that that is closed, it's not an active lane anymore, and that we look into what is in the study with the police department because the discussion was a crosswalk in front of the police station, which they would implement what's called a rhino light, which is a crosswalking light to be added

541
00:46:31,027 --> 00:46:39,292
[SPEAKER_06]: during the construction, and then it's a simple one-touch when you need to cross to stop that traffic so they can cross in a safe manner.

542
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:42,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So these initiatives are difficult.

543
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Council Marks, but I want to commit you the whole if we can to go over these very simple, very cost-effective,

544
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:58,718
[SPEAKER_06]: initiatives that we've been screaming for, for years.

545
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:14,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize that, you know, I know Mr. Rodriguez is new, but this is, it's so frustrating when, you know, as the chairperson of the transportation subcommittee, we've had meetings after meetings after meetings with everybody involved.

546
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:20,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the council, as the council elected by the city of Medford,

547
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We are asking for, this is simple, right now, in a week, to implement raised crosswalks to those two locations to slow traffic.

548
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:42,690
[SPEAKER_06]: to narrow the opposite lane to one lane with markings and their three-foot posts that are reflectors.

549
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:46,711
[SPEAKER_06]: These are simple initiatives that are going to calm that area down.

550
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:53,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to hear closing that and making that a right turn only.

551
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not going to work.

552
00:47:55,453 --> 00:48:05,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the state delegates are working on the funding and the process to put traffic lights, signal lights there.

553
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard that.

554
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,300
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still waiting.

555
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're trying hard.

556
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's money involved.

557
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:17,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But Council Marks put a very thorough timeline of history of this issue.

558
00:48:18,364 --> 00:48:21,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm imploring to our administration is simple.

559
00:48:22,439 --> 00:48:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: These initiatives that I made as an amendment are very simple.

560
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:38,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And truly, the chief will say no, the traffic engineer might say no, whatever might come down.

561
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:45,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We as a council need to really push these simple initiatives because this is what was told to us.

562
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:55,757
[SPEAKER_06]: months ago with the state delegates and representatives from DOT that said this is low-hanging fruit that can be done.

563
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:56,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

564
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:05,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm actually disgusted right now that we're talking about it again.

565
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:11,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look myself in the mirror and question why I haven't demanded this like I am right now.

566
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:26,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm asking for is a Committee of the Whole meeting, if we can, as soon as possible, with the traffic engineers, city administration, DPW director, and our chief of police and traffic.

567
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:33,052
[SPEAKER_06]: to implement these simple, simple fixes for south of Maine to slow this down.

568
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:36,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I can, I hope I'm rambling.

569
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:41,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little, I'm a little motivated, but I hope a clerk her to bees has that.

570
00:49:42,574 --> 00:49:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And I moved to make that as an amendment.

571
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:48,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

572
00:49:49,436 --> 00:49:49,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

573
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

574
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:51,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

575
00:49:52,677 --> 00:49:56,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I'd certainly second the amendment offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

576
00:49:56,958 --> 00:50:07,265
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's safe to say that all members of the council have a concern about Southern Maine all members of the council are aware there have been long standing issues.

577
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:12,408
[SPEAKER_17]: And all members of the council have ideas about what approach to take to address it.

578
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:16,311
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Councilor Marks made some very great suggestions.

579
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,492
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Councilor Scarpelli's made great suggestions.

580
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:21,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So what I'm hearing is that we want to have a roundtable.

581
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:27,651
[SPEAKER_17]: with the players from the state administration for district four, as well as our state delegation.

582
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:35,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And also we want to have a committee of the whole meeting with the city administration and the decision makers at the city level.

583
00:50:36,478 --> 00:50:38,499
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they have great ideas, Mr. President.

584
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:41,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd ask that we move to consolidate all amendments to one amendment.

585
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:44,944
[SPEAKER_17]: So they require one roll call vote and we move forward on the issue.

586
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

587
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:50,428
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay with me.

588
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:53,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

589
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:54,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

590
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:59,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears, if I may really quick, the clerk has his hand up.

591
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we have... I've got everything, councilors.

592
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,292
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're all amending the main paper, you don't have to take separate votes as long as you're considering all the amendments.

593
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:11,093
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not a B paper, then it doesn't require a separate vote.

594
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:15,554
[SPEAKER_09]: So if all your amendments are to the main paper and they're not B papers, you don't have to take separate votes on any of this.

595
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:16,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

596
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:17,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

597
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:21,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'll throw an amendment onto the pile.

598
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:28,277
[SPEAKER_18]: I would just like to also, and I don't even know exactly how possible this is.

599
00:51:28,838 --> 00:51:43,352
[SPEAKER_18]: So just something to keep in mind for the city administration, hopefully, since we're inviting the state delegation, that at any meeting, at such a meeting that the state delegation and the city administration provide an update on

600
00:51:44,048 --> 00:51:46,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Any timelines for the release of bond bill funds?

601
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:53,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I think one thing we know is the legislature passes things, but they have to be authorized by the governor's office.

602
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And very often that never happens.

603
00:51:56,494 --> 00:52:01,117
[SPEAKER_18]: So at least that's my experience with bond bills for public higher education.

604
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:03,058
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just one of the issues with bonding.

605
00:52:03,438 --> 00:52:08,820
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd just like to see how those discussions, if there are any updates or if any of those discussions have been had.

606
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:11,962
[SPEAKER_18]: I spoke longer than the motion, is it clear?

607
00:52:14,104 --> 00:52:14,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got it, Councilor.

608
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:15,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

609
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:17,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

610
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:19,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Any questions from the Council?

611
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:27,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli, I believe you mentioned the Chief of Staff before.

612
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:32,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez, do you know if there are any updates from the administration with regard to this issue?

613
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:34,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a well-known issue.

614
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:35,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any updates with regard to this?

615
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll unmute you, hang on.

616
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

617
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

618
00:52:43,602 --> 00:53:01,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have any updates for you tonight, but I have been going back and forth with Tim McGivern over text during the conversation just so we can update, so we can prepare ourselves, update the council on things that we've done to date, recommendations that have come to us, and why we've acted on them or have not acted on them, and the reasons therefore.

619
00:53:02,322 --> 00:53:08,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to participate in any committees of the whole or any roundtables to talk through the issues and try to find solutions that will work.

620
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:21,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all aware that it is a problem and we're all aware that that solutions are there somewhere, but we need to find them and be able to find them as so they're equitable across the board, both financially as well as logistically.

621
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:24,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're happy to participate in that discussion moving forward.

622
00:53:25,021 --> 00:53:25,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

623
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:38,234
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that at the present time, for the majority of the day, South Street remains closed as they do the Eversource underground construction project.

624
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:48,842
[SPEAKER_17]: And they've implemented some traffic calming measures while construction is going on before the road closure that would be very effective and very cost neutral, to say the least.

625
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:50,924
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think this is something that we can get done.

626
00:53:52,295 --> 00:54:02,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So initially, and that's a I'll just I'll just piggyback on customer nice point that prior to the ever source project and prior to the being pulled away on other issues.

627
00:54:03,498 --> 00:54:08,940
[SPEAKER_05]: As of late, we did take some immediate steps and we kind of put them in short term medium term long term buckets.

628
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,601
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk about.

629
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:18,084
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of the short-term issues that we were looking at, especially pertaining to South Street, was to narrow the street as much as we could by allowing parking on both sides.

630
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:22,946
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the problems that we were seeing is that the road was too wide, so folks were speeding down there.

631
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:26,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all seen the news reports of folks speeding because the roads are more empty.

632
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:30,710
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this perception that the more space people have, the faster they'll go.

633
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking to narrow those roads as much as we can by using natural barriers of parking.

634
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:42,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Using signage to direct more traffic away from South Street towards High Street, so folks can get to the square and get onto Route 16.

635
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:50,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Sending letters to MassDOT to allow trucking to proceed on that portion of Route 16, where trucking is now not allowed.

636
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:53,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying to divert as much traffic as we can.

637
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:56,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good source point for us to be able to focus on.

638
00:54:57,118 --> 00:55:00,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily managing the cars that are there, but getting less cars on that street.

639
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,444
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of the Main Street and South Street intersections.

640
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a lot of conversations about what to do.

641
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:16,363
[SPEAKER_05]: We engaged with MassDOT and the state police about what their thoughts were and actions that they could take immediately, as well as engaging with the state delegation to talk about the signalization issues.

642
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:19,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears is dead right when it comes to the bond bill.

643
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

644
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome to have that stuff in there.

645
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:25,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We're blessed to have good advocacy at the state level to get as many projects in there.

646
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But given the current financial state of the state, I'd be very surprised to see the authorized money released by the administration, especially in the terms of the amount of dollars that we're talking about in terms of the long-term fix.

647
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:43,140
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the option of putting the money in the tip.

648
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,382
[SPEAKER_05]: which is run through the NPO.

649
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:48,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great program, but it requires a lot of legwork on the city side.

650
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:54,192
[SPEAKER_05]: We started that legwork on the city side when the current public health crisis hit.

651
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:57,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of that is doing road counts.

652
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:02,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, some of the road counts are being deflated because there's just not enough people on the road.

653
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:03,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make sure we get accurate counts.

654
00:56:04,144 --> 00:56:15,868
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can re-engage with the traffic engineer on this point, so we can give the best advice to the city and the council as to how best to proceed in light of the current crisis and how to get the best resources from the TIP and the NPO.

655
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:20,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chief of Staff David Rodriguez.

656
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:22,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the council?

657
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:29,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Any community participation or emails, Clerk Hurtubise?

658
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:34,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

659
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:40,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Navarre, name and address for the record, please.

660
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:44,079
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

661
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:54,326
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that I think what this really comes down to is whether or not, sort of to paraphrase the late Mayor Menino,

662
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,348
[SPEAKER_00]: is the car king in the city of Medford.

663
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:06,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't say that it's not when it's not safe to walk so close to Medford Square.

664
00:57:06,396 --> 00:57:07,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a map right now.

665
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:11,323
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of parking that's in Medford Square

666
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:14,378
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely astonishing.

667
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:20,065
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's our 100% point in our city, it's absolutely astonishing how much.

668
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:25,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not because it doesn't fall out of the sky.

669
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:28,574
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's not a safe place to walk a lot of people feel, I think.

670
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:31,558
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that we have to have more parking.

671
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:33,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means there can't be as much development.

672
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:36,726
[SPEAKER_00]: It means we can't have as much affordable housing if we have to have all this parking.

673
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: You look along Mystic Avenue right near there.

674
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,773
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all automobile uses.

675
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:44,016
[SPEAKER_00]: There are car dealerships there in a city.

676
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:49,863
[SPEAKER_00]: a city where it's one of the few communities in this country you can live a full life without a car.

677
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,663
[SPEAKER_00]: We have car dealerships there.

678
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?

679
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:58,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's because you can't quite live a full life without a car because we got little issues like this.

680
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:09,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really happy to see this addressed because I think only by making people feel safe using what we call alternative transportation, whereas

681
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a great word, because Pete came first.

682
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,811
[SPEAKER_00]: But we call it alternative transportation.

683
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:18,435
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't feel comfortable using alternative transportation at intersections like this.

684
00:58:18,735 --> 00:58:20,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say, we want more parking.

685
00:58:20,056 --> 00:58:21,077
[SPEAKER_00]: We want more parking.

686
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:25,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, parking doesn't pay much taxes.

687
00:58:26,122 --> 00:58:27,223
[SPEAKER_00]: That affects the budget.

688
00:58:27,243 --> 00:58:28,344
[SPEAKER_00]: That affects everything.

689
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:29,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all connected.

690
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:33,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that anything we can do to make people less reliant on their cars

691
00:58:33,642 --> 00:58:38,506
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make Medford a happier, healthier, more financially sustainable place.

692
00:58:38,606 --> 00:58:41,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very pleased to see you taking this up with urgency.

693
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:41,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

694
00:58:42,669 --> 00:58:43,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Navarre.

695
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:54,498
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

696
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:57,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Also amended by Councilor Marks.

697
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,502
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize, amended by Councilor Marks.

698
00:59:01,923 --> 00:59:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilor Bears.

699
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we got Councilor Bears, we got Councilor Scarpelli.

700
00:59:05,669 --> 00:59:09,052
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here comes the roll call on this motion as amended.

701
00:59:09,552 --> 00:59:10,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

702
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:11,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

703
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:13,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello?

704
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:14,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

705
00:59:14,536 --> 00:59:15,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

706
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:16,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

707
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

708
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:18,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

709
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

710
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:20,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

711
00:59:20,862 --> 00:59:21,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

712
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:22,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

713
00:59:22,683 --> 00:59:23,404
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco?

714
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:27,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

715
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:47,287
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-375 offered by Council of Bears be resolved by the Medford City Council that the Community Preservation Committee and City Administration provide an update on the Rental Assistance Program and Free Legal Services Program for people facing housing insecurity due to the coronavirus emergency and economic crisis.

716
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:49,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Council of Bears.

717
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

718
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:56,955
[SPEAKER_18]: As we know, it's been several weeks now since we got this program up and running.

719
00:59:57,115 --> 01:00:11,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been lucky enough to be working with Roberta and Danielle and several other folks from the CPC and the city just to check in and see how it's going, connect people to the program.

720
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:18,830
[SPEAKER_18]: With the level of unemployment and the significant economic issues that we're facing, I think it's really good that we set this program up.

721
01:00:19,091 --> 01:00:20,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I will say that, you know,

722
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:27,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I expect sooner rather than later that the first installment of funds that we use will likely be used.

723
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,831
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to speak to that directly.

724
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:35,914
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we have actually Roberta and Danielle here from the CPC who have more direct information.

725
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:37,135
[SPEAKER_18]: But the need is great.

726
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:42,738
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of communities, especially surrounding communities, have put in even larger amounts of funds.

727
01:00:42,818 --> 01:00:43,699
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that we're limited.

728
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:47,641
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'll just say it again, the need is great.

729
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:50,283
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why I put this on the agenda, hoping to get an update.

730
01:00:50,905 --> 01:00:54,706
[SPEAKER_18]: and also just for anyone watching to hear about this program.

731
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:57,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we have a couple of Councilors that want to speak.

732
01:00:57,827 --> 01:00:59,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

733
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:04,648
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I'll yield to Roberta Cameron and then I'll ask my question after I hear what she has to say.

734
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:07,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta, could you please have your name and address for the record?

735
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:14,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

736
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:25,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here, and as well, I see Danielle Evans is here, who can also speak to this.

737
01:01:26,097 --> 01:01:40,523
[SPEAKER_01]: We did receive a preliminary update from the organizations who are administering the emergency rental assistance programs that the Community Preservation Committee funded last month.

738
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:42,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It is premature.

739
01:01:42,804 --> 01:01:58,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd actually like to let Danielle speak to our process of being able to actually have the funds running to the people who need it.

740
01:02:00,524 --> 01:02:16,296
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did get an update from the organizations about the inquiries that they've received and the applications that they're currently in the pipeline to receive assistance from ABCD, we have.

741
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:33,303
[SPEAKER_01]: They've received so far 38 inquiries since this program was launched about three weeks ago, of which 27, they are currently working on processing applications.

742
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:41,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And nine applicants have completed the intake and are waiting on supporting documentation.

743
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of those nine applicants, eight are families.

744
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:50,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And the total amount that's been requested of these nine applicants is $45,829.

745
01:02:56,509 --> 01:03:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I also asked them to let us know if they're seeing any barriers to participation in the program, just so that we could understand if there's a way that we could tweak this program or look at how we might be able to make future funding available.

746
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:20,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And the barriers that they've identified so far are landlords who don't wish to participate in the program.

747
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:32,871
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have had rental arrears prior to COVID-19, which make them ineligible, and also just specific circumstances around the housing units that make them ineligible.

748
01:03:34,654 --> 01:03:38,957
[SPEAKER_01]: So Housing Families Inc so far has seven applications in the pipeline.

749
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:44,101
[SPEAKER_01]: All of their applicants are below 30% area median income.

750
01:03:45,402 --> 01:03:51,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of these include households with children and one of those also has senior household members.

751
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:55,958
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is in a public housing unit.

752
01:03:56,518 --> 01:04:09,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Four are in small multifamily housing, which means very likely that they have independent landlords whose mortgages are being protected by helping the renter households.

753
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:14,464
[SPEAKER_01]: One small apartment building and one larger apartment complex.

754
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:17,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And a total of

755
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:23,244
[SPEAKER_01]: 7350 has been requested of their funding to date with requested amounts ranging from 650,000 to $2,000.

756
01:04:31,472 --> 01:04:48,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also wanted to update that I'm working with Housing Medford, an advocacy group that has been trying to help share information with outreach to ensure that people know that these programs exist.

757
01:04:48,836 --> 01:04:58,918
[SPEAKER_01]: We held a meeting last Thursday evening to provide information to the public about the emergency rental assistance programs and other housing resources that are available to Medford residents.

758
01:05:00,273 --> 01:05:05,538
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Office of Community Development, Medford Housing Authority in attendance.

759
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:19,353
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to ABCD and the Metro Boston Housing Partnership, which is the entity that administers raft for Medford residents, that's another emergency rental assistance program.

760
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: This information session can still be viewed on Medford Community Media.

761
01:05:26,454 --> 01:05:27,434
[SPEAKER_01]: It was televised.

762
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:31,296
[SPEAKER_01]: It took place on Thursday, May 21st.

763
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:48,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And Housing Medford has also helped to facilitate outreach to Medford Senior Center, Medford Family Network, the Food Security Network, the Chamber of Commerce, Medford Public Schools, West Medford Community Center, in addition to other organizations in the community.

764
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:57,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that OCD is also working to ensure that information about our housing resources is available in other languages.

765
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:04,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd love to ask Danielle to provide an update, any further details that I've left out.

766
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she needs to be unmuted.

767
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:13,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, she looked like she's about to unmute herself.

768
01:06:13,712 --> 01:06:15,772
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the, okay, there you go.

769
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:18,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

770
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:35,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Roberta, did you also mention that in addition to the calls that went straight to ABCD and HFI, that there were also about 22 calls directly to OCD for rental assistance.

771
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:40,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, I've got someone knocking on my door.

772
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:43,218
[SPEAKER_12]: What was I saying?

773
01:06:44,828 --> 01:06:50,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if all 22 of them have completed intakes with ABCD.

774
01:06:51,354 --> 01:06:57,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Lorena from OCD is going to be following up with them to see how far along they are.

775
01:06:57,879 --> 01:07:12,110
[SPEAKER_12]: But also for being able to get the money out the door, the grant agreement has been approved by the city solicitor and we just need the account set up by the finance department to be able to

776
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:15,000
[SPEAKER_12]: to get these signed off by the mayor.

777
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:21,025
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there is a bit of a process with council papers making it through the various steps.

778
01:07:21,526 --> 01:07:25,890
[SPEAKER_12]: But as of today, the accounts are not set up.

779
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:28,372
[SPEAKER_12]: I am hoping that can be rectified soon.

780
01:07:28,973 --> 01:07:32,216
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can sign the agreement and get the funds out the door.

781
01:07:38,272 --> 01:07:39,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Caraviello, did you?

782
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

783
01:07:40,994 --> 01:07:44,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Roberto, thank you for answering some of the questions that I was going to ask.

784
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:54,442
[SPEAKER_20]: But it seems like the process needs to be streamlined a little more to make it easier for these people to get through this.

785
01:07:54,943 --> 01:07:59,306
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, from what I'm hearing from you and Danielle is everybody's wrapped up in paperwork.

786
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:07,771
[SPEAKER_20]: So is there anything being done to maybe streamline this so those who need it the most would be able to get it?

787
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:26,467
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the issues that some of the feedback that we've received from ABCD is that the applicants are not, or the people who are inquiring are not always clear on what the eligibility criteria are.

788
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:29,690
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they had people inquiring from Medford, Oregon.

789
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,293
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, understanding which Medford this is providing.

790
01:08:33,793 --> 01:08:35,254
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency assistance for.

791
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:45,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that level, they've been receiving a lot more inquiries than they can actually process applications for.

792
01:08:50,342 --> 01:08:58,606
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could ask whether there's anything that we can do on our end to make the application process be able to go more smoothly.

793
01:08:58,626 --> 01:09:01,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

794
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:02,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

795
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:04,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Kavyao.

796
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:05,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morales.

797
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:07,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

798
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:15,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Roberta, you mentioned that one of the reasons that people might not be getting through is that their landlord doesn't want to participate in the program.

799
01:09:15,392 --> 01:09:16,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you just explain what that means?

800
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:25,420
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be that the landlord, because the program will require that the landlord, I believe,

801
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:39,166
[SPEAKER_01]: receive a tax statement stating that they received funding through this program and the landlord may not want to provide their social security number or their tax ID in order to be able to make that possible.

802
01:09:39,186 --> 01:09:43,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that that's sometimes a barrier for landlords.

803
01:09:44,808 --> 01:09:45,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

804
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:47,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

805
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:49,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Councilor Marks, did you have your hand up?

806
01:09:52,132 --> 01:09:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have missed it, but Roberta, did you mention the range of requests for the nine applicants?

807
01:09:59,374 --> 01:10:00,775
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not provide a range.

808
01:10:00,815 --> 01:10:01,975
[SPEAKER_01]: They only gave the total.

809
01:10:04,315 --> 01:10:09,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't know, you said 45,000 between nine applicants.

810
01:10:10,217 --> 01:10:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the most that someone can receive?

811
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:13,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know that?

812
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:26,975
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000.

813
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:26,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the average is above what they've requested and they may be looking for other sources of funds to be able to help some of these households.

814
01:10:27,455 --> 01:10:29,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any details at the moment.

815
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:36,077
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually a very last minute request to make of the organization.

816
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:43,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have time to give us as much detailed information as they would have if we had

817
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:45,779
[SPEAKER_01]: given them a week to reply.

818
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:54,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may be able to go back and follow up with a more detailed report in, you know, the next time that we talk with you.

819
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

820
01:10:57,409 --> 01:10:57,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

821
01:10:58,029 --> 01:10:59,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

822
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:02,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

823
01:11:02,493 --> 01:11:06,936
[SPEAKER_17]: I just ask that any type of update like this be given, be given to us in writing.

824
01:11:07,317 --> 01:11:08,658
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the presentation.

825
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:25,100
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I think it's important for us to have something like this in writing, especially where we've appropriated about 25% of the community preservation funds that we've allotted to the affordable housing bucket to this cause.

826
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,243
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think that the presentation from ABCD might be

827
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:33,196
[SPEAKER_17]: called for rather than members of the CPC.

828
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:45,083
[SPEAKER_17]: And looking at this, I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the level of involvement that the CPC has on the administration of the grant and the actual application that the grant recipient is having.

829
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:48,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we can administer it and monitor it, but I think it's getting very hands-on.

830
01:11:49,466 --> 01:11:54,609
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know how comfortable I feel with that from the feedback that I'm getting and the way that I'm hearing that these are working out.

831
01:11:55,376 --> 01:12:04,723
[SPEAKER_17]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the mission and the work that we're doing to address some of these community concerns.

832
01:12:05,283 --> 01:12:13,309
[SPEAKER_17]: I just ask that any response to the resolution also be offered to the council in writing so that we can have a snapshot in time for when we ask for a future update later on.

833
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, do you want this updated in writing?

834
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:18,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that?

835
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:21,055
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be my intention, Mr. President.

836
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:22,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, and I'd offer that in the form of a motion.

837
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:24,889
[SPEAKER_02]: second the motion, Mr. President.

838
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:25,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

839
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:27,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the council?

840
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:31,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Council appears.

841
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:46,471
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to again thank Roberta, Danielle, and also a lot of other folks, anyone who's been communicating about this, putting information out, letting friends and neighbors know that there are options from the city to help.

842
01:12:48,303 --> 01:12:50,305
[SPEAKER_18]: The last thing we need right now is anyone losing their housing.

843
01:12:50,345 --> 01:13:00,597
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's been really, um, I've been grateful to see how many people in Medford have stepped up and volunteered to help make things like this and also assistance to, you know, guidance for other help, um, available.

844
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

845
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Council of bears, uh, do you have the wording on the motion?

846
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:14,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, and again, I can clarify this a little bit when I go back and watch the video.

847
01:13:15,309 --> 01:13:24,258
[SPEAKER_09]: But Councilor Knight wants written updates on this program in the response to the council on this resolution.

848
01:13:28,748 --> 01:13:33,531
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I may, Mr. President, this is a motion that I'll make on any paper that requests an update.

849
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:44,757
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's a council paper, the paper will be approved, the update should be received in writing as well as by way of the presentation or we should just get the update in writing, but it should definitely be in writing.

850
01:13:46,078 --> 01:13:50,900
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not something that's just particular and exclusive to this matter that's before us.

851
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll continue to ask for these updates in writing for other matters as well.

852
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:57,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

853
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:00,543

[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, perfect.

855

[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, any other questions from the council?

856
01:14:04,644 --> 01:14:08,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Any emails coming, Clerk Cardavese, or any comments from the general public?

857

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

907
01:15:51,315 --> 01:15:54,798
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, it seems like we're on fire with the Community Preservation Commission.

908
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:59,242
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe on our agenda this evening, we have a request for appropriation.

909
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:06,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd ask that that paper be taken up out of order, whereas we have our representatives from the CPC before us on the previous matter.

910
01:16:06,508 --> 01:16:07,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good.

911
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Communications from the mayor, 20-379, May 20th, 2020.

912
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:21,427
[SPEAKER_11]: to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts here on 2155 regarding the Community Preservation Committee.

913
01:16:21,947 --> 01:16:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the following following a recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

914
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:44,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, requesting the appropriation of $30,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Unitarian Universalist Church for the David Osgood House Historic Window Restoration Project.

915
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:50,305
[SPEAKER_11]: This project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category General Reserve.

916
01:16:52,926 --> 01:16:55,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

917
01:16:56,587 --> 01:16:57,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

918
01:16:58,608 --> 01:16:59,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Roberta, did you wanna speak on this?

919
01:17:05,366 --> 01:17:15,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I would like to defer to Doug Carr, another Community Preservation Committee member who has expertise on the subject of historic preservation.

920
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:19,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Doug Carr, name and address for the record, please.

921
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:23,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in Medford.

922
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:24,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

923
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:32,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wearing two hats this evening, obviously from the Community Preservation Committee, but also the Medford Historic Commission.

924
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:39,098
[SPEAKER_07]: The CPC supported the original grant, which we thought was really important to move forward this historic building.

925
01:17:39,778 --> 01:17:46,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put a condition on it to provide ADA access to the building so the public benefit would be clear.

926
01:17:47,885 --> 01:17:57,153
[SPEAKER_07]: At the time it was voted on, the scope of the ADA work was really a conceptual diagram.

927
01:17:57,193 --> 01:18:01,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happened during the course of figuring out the project in great detail was

928
01:18:03,152 --> 01:18:05,973
[SPEAKER_07]: The cost for the ADA stuff ballooned dramatically.

929
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:08,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's why we're coming back.

930
01:18:08,754 --> 01:18:11,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We still feel that the accessibility is important.

931
01:18:13,236 --> 01:18:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that the number is a little high, but we feel it's really important for this project to move forward and that the accessibility part not be severed from the building restoration as a whole, which was the genesis of this grant application.

932
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:35,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to support this increased dollar amount on behalf of the applicant.

933
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:40,810
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have any questions in regards to the historic preservation side of things, please let me know.

934
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:43,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

935
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:47,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion approved, Mr. President.

936
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:51,635
[SPEAKER_11]: A motion of Vice President Caraviello to approve, seconded by?

937
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:52,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

938
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:55,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears, was that?

939
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:57,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears?

940
01:18:58,554 --> 01:18:59,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

941
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:00,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight has a question.

942
01:19:02,136 --> 01:19:05,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight and Councilor Morell.

943
01:19:06,759 --> 01:19:11,022
[SPEAKER_17]: My question, Mr. President, was just that the second Councilor Caraviello's motion to move for approval.

944
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,643
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what these funds are for.

945
01:19:13,163 --> 01:19:18,866
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a very worthy cause and it's something that we've supported in the past and it's something that I will continue to support in the future.

946
01:19:19,507 --> 01:19:20,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

947
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:21,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

948
01:19:21,768 --> 01:19:22,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

949
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:23,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Doug, just a question.

950
01:19:23,709 --> 01:19:24,450
[SPEAKER_16]: So is this the

951
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:30,360
[SPEAKER_16]: this amount is finalized, this is what you know that this will cost, or is there a chance you may have to come back for more?

952
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:37,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the applicant got an estimate and they built in some contingency to this number, so this number should be it.

953
01:19:38,485 --> 01:19:41,067
[SPEAKER_07]: They've told us explicitly they will not be coming back for more.

954
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:42,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

955
01:19:42,368 --> 01:19:42,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

956
01:19:43,308 --> 01:19:43,648
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

957
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:49,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Councilor Caraviello, Vice President Caraviello, then Councilor Marks, Vice President Caraviello.

958
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

959
01:19:51,461 --> 01:19:54,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Doug, before we vote on this, I just had a quick question for you.

960
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,943
[SPEAKER_20]: The wall on Grove Street, the company did a great job on that.

961
01:20:02,124 --> 01:20:09,326
[SPEAKER_20]: But I noticed that a section has fallen down and that end cap hasn't been finished yet.

962
01:20:10,226 --> 01:20:12,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Will they be coming back there to get that finished?

963
01:20:13,067 --> 01:20:13,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they will.

964
01:20:13,927 --> 01:20:15,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw that as well, Councilor.

965
01:20:17,141 --> 01:20:22,085
[SPEAKER_07]: The wall is, it's under warranty per contract, so they're not done yet.

966
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:26,088
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a groutless wall, meaning they're just stuck together as stones.

967
01:20:26,108 --> 01:20:27,129
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no grout in that wall.

968
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:28,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way those walls were built.

969
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:34,074
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're gonna make sure that that piece that you're talking about, the little piece did break off.

970
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:37,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a very high quality wall.

971
01:20:37,437 --> 01:20:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen the improvement along Grove Street.

972
01:20:39,438 --> 01:20:40,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, this is unrelated to this.

973
01:20:41,059 --> 01:20:42,921
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Brooks Estate, not to the,

974
01:20:43,861 --> 01:20:45,662
[SPEAKER_07]: applicant before the council.

975
01:20:45,803 --> 01:20:49,725
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, I just wanted to bring this up before, I know you're involved with that project.

976
01:20:49,785 --> 01:20:51,586
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, the wall came out great.

977
01:20:52,507 --> 01:20:58,051
[SPEAKER_20]: And as I say, I got nothing but compliments from many members of the community in regards to that.

978
01:20:58,211 --> 01:21:00,372
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to thank you.

979
01:21:00,933 --> 01:21:01,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

980
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

981
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:06,516
[SPEAKER_20]: One more thing, Doug?

982
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:07,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, sir.

983
01:21:08,398 --> 01:21:13,221
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could wish your dad, former councillor Bill Carr, happy birthday.

984
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:14,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, thank you, Councilor.

985
01:21:14,962 --> 01:21:15,862
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm greatly appreciated.

986
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:16,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

987
01:21:17,283 --> 01:21:17,844
[SPEAKER_20]: He's a good man.

988
01:21:17,884 --> 01:21:20,225
[SPEAKER_20]: I had him as a school teacher and a good friend too.

989
01:21:21,386 --> 01:21:22,587
[SPEAKER_20]: You and many others in Medford.

990
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:23,067
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

991
01:21:24,188 --> 01:21:25,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Birthday, Mr. Carr.

992
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:26,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, let's see.

993
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:27,370
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Councilor Marks.

994
01:21:28,991 --> 01:21:29,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

995
01:21:30,713 --> 01:21:38,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug, can you point to anything in particular why the costs, uh, were so exorbitant compared to what was originally thought?

996
01:21:39,508 --> 01:21:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what happened was that the applicant didn't actually have a survey of the back of the property, a detailed survey showing the grades.

997
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: When it came time to get from the door to the street and the sidewalk as required by ADA, it was a lot more complicated.

998
01:21:57,695 --> 01:21:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot longer path.

999
01:21:59,036 --> 01:22:02,137
[SPEAKER_07]: They had to do a lot more design.

1000
01:22:02,337 --> 01:22:08,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought it was just going to be a simple path, but it turned out to be much more complicated because it was a steeper change in grade.

1001
01:22:09,648 --> 01:22:12,571
[SPEAKER_07]: than what they had guessed, because they didn't have accurate information.

1002
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:20,357
[SPEAKER_07]: That's quite common with historic properties that don't really have a great existing facilities.

1003
01:22:20,877 --> 01:22:23,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the same problem when we started with the Brooks Estate many years ago.

1004
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:28,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So has this passed through the historic commission in the city?

1005
01:22:31,286 --> 01:22:35,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the commission has signed off on the project.

1006
01:22:35,309 --> 01:22:38,492
[SPEAKER_07]: The design that they've come up with has been

1007
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,581
[SPEAKER_07]: viewed by the commission, so they've approved it.

1008
01:22:41,601 --> 01:22:42,462
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no issues there.

1009
01:22:44,063 --> 01:22:45,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have approved it?

1010
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:48,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so, yes, they have.

1011
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:51,987
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could just get a notice on that, Mr. President, that this was approved.

1012
01:22:53,227 --> 01:22:55,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that typical of CPC funds?

1013
01:22:56,169 --> 01:22:59,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a requirement before funds are doled out?

1014
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:00,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how does it typically work?

1015
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:10,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think Roberta can speak to this as well, but I think any property that's on the National Register and historic property in Medford would come before the commission with any changes.

1016
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:13,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So we typically do that.

1017
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:16,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And this property clearly qualified.

1018
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been on the National Register for many decades.

1019
01:23:20,943 --> 01:23:25,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but I'm talking about in particular before the CPC grants money.

1020
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make sure if there's any type of sign off or approval that that's done prior to allocating money?

1021
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:36,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, can you help me here on this one?

1022
01:23:36,132 --> 01:23:39,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember because the original grant was a while ago.

1023
01:23:40,494 --> 01:23:43,756
[SPEAKER_07]: What the sequence was, I know it came before the commission.

1024
01:23:43,776 --> 01:23:45,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember where in the process it was.

1025
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, could you unmute Mr. Daniela?

1026
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:57,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to, it sometimes takes a few clicks, so.

1027
01:23:57,151 --> 01:23:57,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1028
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:58,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1029
01:23:58,371 --> 01:23:59,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead, Daniela.

1030
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:07,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And also I should mention that the applicant, Susan Girard, is on the Zoom right now too, if anyone has questions for her directly.

1031
01:24:08,318 --> 01:24:17,505
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the conditions of the grant was that it meet the National Secretary of the Interior Standards.

1032
01:24:18,245 --> 01:24:19,306
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1033
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:30,564
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the, before they start the work, and we don't even have a grant agreement executed with them yet.

1034
01:24:30,664 --> 01:24:35,167
[SPEAKER_12]: So this hasn't, nothing has started yet really.

1035
01:24:36,889 --> 01:24:42,873
[SPEAKER_12]: We just need sign off from the historical commission that it indeed does meet those standards.

1036
01:24:45,154 --> 01:24:47,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And we saw the original drawings of the house

1037
01:24:48,646 --> 01:24:53,190
[SPEAKER_07]: which shows the four elevations of the property with the windows and the new paint.

1038
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:58,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the revised design was presented before it was given to the commission.

1039
01:24:59,656 --> 01:25:01,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was at least a month ago.

1040
01:25:01,777 --> 01:25:06,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll provide you with the paperwork, Councilor Marks, anything you need to show the support of the commission.

1041
01:25:07,762 --> 01:25:08,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1042
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:11,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1043
01:25:11,886 --> 01:25:13,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the council?

1044
01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:16,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion for approval again, Mr. President.

1045
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:20,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Clerk Hurtubise, any emails, any comments from the general public?

1046
01:25:22,472 --> 01:25:25,033
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no emails and no comments from the general public, Mr. President.

1047
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:29,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1048
01:25:31,556 --> 01:25:32,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1049
01:25:33,437 --> 01:25:33,997

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:39,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1060
01:25:46,817 --> 01:25:47,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:25:47,598 --> 01:25:48,378
[SPEAKER_09]: President Falco.

1062
01:25:48,978 --> 01:25:50,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1063
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,640
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

1064
01:25:53,401 --> 01:25:54,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

1065
01:25:55,603 --> 01:25:59,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to the regular order of business.

1066

1067
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:04,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

1068
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:05,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1069
01:26:06,089 --> 01:26:06,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Caraviello.

1070
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:07,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1071
01:26:08,851 --> 01:26:09,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1072
01:26:12,873 --> 01:26:13,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

1073
01:26:14,094 --> 01:26:15,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, thought I was unmuted.

1074
01:26:16,848 --> 01:26:17,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1075
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:18,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1076
01:26:19,235 --> 01:26:19,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

1077
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:20,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1078
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:21,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1079
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:22,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1080
01:26:23,025 --> 01:26:23,707

1081
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:26,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1082
01:26:26,823 --> 01:26:29,705
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes, and we will now revert to the regular order of business.

1083
01:26:29,725 --> 01:26:49,315
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-376 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council, I'm sorry, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update on any plans to protect public employee safety, including social distancing measures as Massachusetts implements the base reopening plan issued by Governor Baker.

1084
01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:50,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

1085
01:26:51,977 --> 01:26:52,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1086
01:26:53,217 --> 01:26:54,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just put this on

1087
01:26:55,031 --> 01:27:06,823
[SPEAKER_18]: The agenda, I know that the last thing we need is any of our public employees, public safety, city hall, whatever it may be, being infected with coronavirus.

1088
01:27:06,903 --> 01:27:16,432
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just was wondering if the administration had an update on the efforts that we're making to make sure that all of our public employees can social distance and have protective equipment if they need it.

1089
01:27:16,853 --> 01:27:18,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1090
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:19,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1091
01:27:19,374 --> 01:27:21,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1092
01:27:21,755 --> 01:27:38,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, but I believe the administration set out guidelines in an email, I believe tonight, if Clerk Hurtubise can correct me if I'm wrong, on a reopening plan and what steps they're taking for the safety of our city employees.

1093
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:42,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can read it or it is an email.

1094
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:44,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for putting that forward, Councilor Bears.

1095
01:27:46,123 --> 01:27:50,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Councilor Scarpelli needs me to answer this question, but yes, we did receive an update from Mr. Rodriguez earlier this evening.

1096
01:27:54,330 --> 01:28:00,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did forward it to all your city emails and also to those of you who use personal emails.

1097
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:01,455
[SPEAKER_09]: So you should all have it by now.

1098
01:28:02,136 --> 01:28:05,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

1099
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:08,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Would the chief of staff mind just going through the highlights?

1100
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:15,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez, do you want to go through the highlights?

1101
01:28:15,766 --> 01:28:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure thing.

1102
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:17,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:28:17,107 --> 01:28:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Beres.

1104
01:28:19,288 --> 01:28:27,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So earlier this evening, I did send along the operating procedure that institutes phase one of a reopening plan for City Hall.

1105
01:28:27,732 --> 01:28:29,813
[SPEAKER_05]: This fall is kind of in the same vein.

1106
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:32,375
[SPEAKER_05]: as the guidance that was issued by the governor last week.

1107
01:28:32,995 --> 01:28:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: We do want to try to work in concert with the guidance that's coming from the state administration as well as the Department of Public Health in this.

1108
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:52,068
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally, the way that we developed the standard operating procedure was to develop guidelines that apply to all phases and all departments, make this be all inclusive, includes a self-certification for employees before they come to work.

1109
01:28:53,028 --> 01:28:58,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Simply saying that if they're sick or they don't feel well, they have to certify to their supervisor that they're not feeling

1110
01:28:58,952 --> 01:29:06,555
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're not feeling well, if they have any symptoms, that they are to stay home, that they haven't been in contact with anybody who's been positive, or they don't have anybody at home that has symptoms.

1111
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:08,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It has cleaning guidelines.

1112
01:29:09,676 --> 01:29:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to be as thoughtful and all-encompassing and comprehensive as we could with this.

1113
01:29:14,898 --> 01:29:18,660
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of the general guidelines that will apply to all phases going forward.

1114
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase one will have, so as everyone is aware, we have been on a reduced staffing levels at City Hall for the last few months.

1115
01:29:28,465 --> 01:29:34,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have some positive cases inside the building and we wanted to be extra cautious, so we have been encouraging remote work to the greatest extent possible.

1116
01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:44,497
[SPEAKER_05]: As we do start a reopening plan, we do want to have this be a rolling effort and not just tell all employees and all folks, oh, guess what?

1117
01:29:44,517 --> 01:29:45,918
[SPEAKER_05]: On Monday, everybody has to come to work now.

1118
01:29:46,358 --> 01:29:48,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to taper the staff up as much as we can.

1119
01:29:49,641 --> 01:29:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So phase one, all the guidelines will apply, and all the departments will abide by the most recent guidance issued by the state.

1120
01:29:58,108 --> 01:30:01,351
[SPEAKER_05]: City Hall and municipal buildings will remain closed to the general public.

1121
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:10,026
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the Medford Public Library will reopen for remote fulfillment and pickup, but remain closed to the general public effective May 26th.

1122
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: In effect of next Monday, we'll taper up our staffing levels at City Hall and other municipal buildings to 25% of staff in each department, at least one person in every department.

1123
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:29,855
[SPEAKER_05]: The department has been responsible for staffing those levels, as well as taking into account childcare needs, underlying health conditions,

1124
01:30:30,741 --> 01:30:33,122
[SPEAKER_05]: and other general guidelines that apply to all phases.

1125
01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:41,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not apply to the Department of Public Works, the Metro Police Department, and the Metro Fire Department, and the Metro Board of Health, who are all at full staffing levels throughout the crisis.

1126
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:50,448
[SPEAKER_05]: We have also undertaken significant improvements at City Hall in the anticipation of rolling into a phase two.

1127
01:30:50,988 --> 01:31:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: including screening in each office to have, so we did a tour, myself, Marianne O'Connor from the Board of Health, Brian Cairns from DPW, and Paul Moki from the Building Department, walked through each office and in effect hardened each office to make the employees feel more comfortable, first of all, but also keep them safe for when we do slide into what we're anticipating to be a phase two program.

1128
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: which we believe will include reopening the building to the general public by appointment only and allowing one member of the public in each office at all times and everyone else social distancing in the hallways.

1129
01:31:28,444 --> 01:31:37,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We're moving all the chairs in the hallways so that people can't congregate, but allow folks to be able to spread out as much as we can using crowd control stanchions, cough shields,

1130
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and also we're requiring all employees to wear a face mask if they can't social distance or they don't have their own office um to use Electronic media like zoom to have meetings.

1131
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:53,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it is a little off-putting to have a meeting when everybody's in city hall But everybody's on zoom.

1132
01:31:53,998 --> 01:31:54,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little weird.

1133
01:31:55,239 --> 01:32:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but it's something that we've we've started doing um all for all time, um for the for the time being

1134
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:14,249
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also, as part of this, we've limited on-site inspections and installations that are done by each individual departments, the building department, the DPW, the Board of Health.

1135
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:20,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We limit that to life safety matters or inspections or installations that you can use social distancing.

1136
01:32:21,172 --> 01:32:27,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and where interpersonal contact is limited, and that all the folks doing that are required to wear PPE as they do it.

1137
01:32:27,654 --> 01:32:37,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did this, this SOP was developed in consultation with Marianne O'Connor, as well as some other folks, and we just tried to be as thoughtful and thorough as we could.

1138
01:32:38,615 --> 01:32:47,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this initial phase one, and as we move to phase two, like they say at the state level, and we've adopted this policy as well, we're driven by data, not dates.

1139
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:55,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to use the guidance that we're receiving to try to reopen the building slowly and make sure that employees remain safe.

1140
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as part of the reopening plan,

1141
01:32:59,143 --> 01:33:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: We did offer to city employees the ability to be tested through our partnership with Physicians One.

1142
01:33:07,187 --> 01:33:09,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're pleased to almost 200 employees were tested.

1143
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Employees were given further guidance as well as what to do if they did test positive for the virus as well as antibodies.

1144
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:27,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Some select individuals based upon medical criteria were tested for antibodies, what to do if you're positive for antibodies and what to do and how to notify everyone involved to keep everyone safe.

1145
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:32,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the update.

1146
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1147
01:33:35,461 --> 01:33:38,222
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just curious, Mr. President, as to what the policy is.

1148
01:33:38,422 --> 01:33:45,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Say Janice in the clerk's office comes into the clerk's office and she has a fever.

1149
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,865
[SPEAKER_17]: And now because she has a fever, I'm assuming that she'd be required to do a 14 day quarantine before she'd be allowed to return back to work.

1150
01:33:53,946 --> 01:34:08,096
[SPEAKER_17]: How is the administration going to approach situations like that where an individual is mandated to report these health concerns so that they don't spread the virus throughout the department, but they're not necessarily ill or sick?

1151
01:34:09,097 --> 01:34:20,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the administration going to do salary continuation, wage continuation, or are they going to require these employees to utilize earned time or sick time during these 14-day quarantine periods if in fact something does arise?

1152
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:32,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It's generally been the policy since the beginning of the COVID crisis that if folks are sent home or they're abiding by orders to remain home, that they do maintain salary continuation.

1153
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:36,142
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're choosing to remain home of their own volition, then they use time.

1154
01:34:36,863 --> 01:34:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a case by case basis.

1155
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:44,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has been worked out as a policy along with public safety as well as DPW.

1156
01:34:45,529 --> 01:34:48,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So that wage continuation, and if we're putting folks out, we'll own the time.

1157
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they'd like to stay home out of their own feelings, then they should use their own time in that regard.

1158
01:34:56,975 --> 01:35:06,497
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the policy that's been applied for our essential workers, and it will be the policy that is applied and even handedly to the non-essential workers when they do the rollout to phase them back into work?

1159
01:35:07,057 --> 01:35:07,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1160
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:09,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1161
01:35:09,178 --> 01:35:09,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it.

1162
01:35:10,818 --> 01:35:11,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1163
01:35:13,459 --> 01:35:14,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears?

1164
01:35:15,931 --> 01:35:21,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to thank the Chief of Staff, both for the document and for the detailed explanation.

1165
01:35:21,653 --> 01:35:24,614
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm encouraged by it and I hope anyone watching is as well.

1166
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:27,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1167
01:35:28,375 --> 01:35:37,018
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1168
01:35:42,259 --> 01:35:42,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1169
01:35:42,419 --> 01:35:42,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1170
01:35:42,519 --> 01:35:42,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1171
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:43,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1172
01:35:44,642 --> 01:35:44,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1173
01:35:55,287 --> 01:35:56,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Senator Falco.

1174
01:35:57,388 --> 01:36:02,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative, the motion passes.

1175
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:19,695
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-377 offered by Council of Mayors, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update on any guidance or other assistance available to local businesses and organizations if they have questions or concerns regarding the face reopening plan issued by Governor Baker.

1176
01:36:22,036 --> 01:36:22,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Council of Mayors.

1177
01:36:24,213 --> 01:36:25,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1178
01:36:25,214 --> 01:36:30,457
[SPEAKER_18]: I think along the same lines here, just, you know, we have this plan for city hall.

1179
01:36:30,497 --> 01:36:34,260
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there's guidance that's going out to our local businesses and orders as well.

1180
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:40,284
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that the mayor spoke about it at the Westminster Community Center over the weekend, the digital legislative forum.

1181
01:36:40,344 --> 01:36:44,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the chief of staff would be so gracious to give us an update on that.

1182
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief of staff Dave Rodriguez.

1183
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on mute.

1184
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:55,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1185
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't assume that I'm going to keep talking, so I usually mute myself after each hour.

1186
01:36:59,161 --> 01:36:59,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1187
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:04,822
[SPEAKER_11]: When I click on mute, it seems to take like 20 seconds before it actually... Thank you, Mr. President.

1188
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:10,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were in... I know the mayor spoke about this at the West Medford legislative gathering over the weekend.

1189
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:24,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We were also able to host a business info session last week, of which we tried to... We made every attempt to invite businesses to engage with the mayor, engage with the Board of Health, engage with the available resources with OCD.

1190
01:37:25,027 --> 01:37:27,129
[SPEAKER_05]: For us to answering any questions in real time.

1191
01:37:27,629 --> 01:37:28,410
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it via zoom.

1192
01:37:28,570 --> 01:37:29,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very well attended.

1193
01:37:29,671 --> 01:37:38,438
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some great questions And gave some great resources to the business community in terms of reopening It's not the governor's plans are not all inclusive.

1194
01:37:38,498 --> 01:37:47,345
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not there's a lot of wiggle room in these things and there's a lot of questions It's why you've seen these faqs Pop up on the on mass.gov through the covid updates.

1195
01:37:47,725 --> 01:37:49,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We're constantly updating ourselves

1196
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:53,288
[SPEAKER_05]: in order to make sure that we're up to date and that we can give the best advice.

1197
01:37:53,708 --> 01:38:03,912
[SPEAKER_05]: We field calls and emails constantly from business owners trying to give advice and get their input so that we can, in turn, advocate for them at the state level.

1198
01:38:03,952 --> 01:38:10,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the mayor has been in constant contact with state-level officials expressing the need to do certain things.

1199
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:33,772
[SPEAKER_05]: and advocating on behalf of industries and restaurants and fitness clubs and personal care services and you name it, she's been pushing to try to open these things responsibly and effectively in a way that achieves a certain balance of having the economic need that's behind it, but also the public health need driving it as well.

1200
01:38:34,623 --> 01:38:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do both, and we're gonna make every effort to do that.

1201
01:38:38,124 --> 01:38:39,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're always available as a resource.

1202
01:38:40,085 --> 01:38:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: That info session was designed as a first of many, so we can keep doing these as phases keep rolling out and information becomes more available.

1203
01:38:48,348 --> 01:38:51,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to do that, and we're happy to serve as a resource at all times.

1204
01:38:52,169 --> 01:38:55,610
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a ton of information on the Medford website about this.

1205
01:38:56,110 --> 01:39:03,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We've taken some steps to revamp the COVID page, just to have it be, there's a lot of information on there.

1206
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,134
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've added in the last two months.

1207
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:12,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great resource for it, but email and phone calls, we're always happy to address those through OCD, through the mayor's office and through wherever.

1208
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:15,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're happy to provide those resources.

1209
01:39:17,222 --> 01:39:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the update.

1210
01:39:18,103 --> 01:39:20,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bears.

1211
01:39:20,385 --> 01:39:22,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Just one quick follow-up, Dave.

1212
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:25,968
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor mentioned that businesses are going to be posting a checklist on the door.

1213
01:39:26,088 --> 01:39:27,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you just explain what that is?

1214
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:36,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So as part of so contrast that to when construction of resident essential construction was allowed, they had to submit a work safety plan that was approved by the city.

1215
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:48,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Contrasting to that, because that would be untenable from an enforcement standpoint, what businesses have to do is they have to go through the checklist posted in a test that they're following that checklist.

1216
01:39:49,277 --> 01:39:56,181
[SPEAKER_05]: there and file on the attestation with us to make sure that they're saying, yep, we're abiding by the state guidelines when it comes to reopening.

1217
01:39:56,221 --> 01:39:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So hair salons have to do certain things.

1218
01:39:59,563 --> 01:40:00,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Pet groomers have to do other things.

1219
01:40:01,324 --> 01:40:07,888
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to check those boxes off, post that in their business, and attest to that to us.

1220
01:40:07,928 --> 01:40:11,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So Marianne O'Connor went through that in pretty good detail.

1221
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout, and her team has been working to try to intake those attestations and find out who hasn't filed them so that we can make sure we can follow up.

1222
01:40:19,178 --> 01:40:22,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Enforcement is always going to be the biggest challenge with all of this.

1223
01:40:22,962 --> 01:40:32,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The state has passed all these guidelines, all these rules, all these things, and kind of kicked it to the locals to say, all right, you guys, you figure it out on how to make it work, and then make sure everybody's playing by the rules.

1224
01:40:33,133 --> 01:40:43,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've kind of, we've had to scramble a little bit in order to make sure we feel like we have a good handle on it in terms of enforcement and we're really focusing on education.

1225
01:40:43,925 --> 01:40:52,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So every, almost every piece that you see coming out of the comms office is just constantly reminding about this stuff all the time, because education is going to be our best tool.

1226
01:40:54,933 --> 01:40:59,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, thank you, Chief of Staff Rodriguez, Vice President Caraviello.

1227
01:40:59,915 --> 01:41:00,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1228
01:41:00,796 --> 01:41:07,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I was able to be on the meeting last week with the mayor and many, many other businesses.

1229
01:41:07,719 --> 01:41:10,360
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, a lot of good questions were asked.

1230
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,301
[SPEAKER_20]: And again,

1231
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:13,783
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an ever-changing situation.

1232
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:24,112
[SPEAKER_20]: And as Chief of Staff Rodriguez mentioned, it's a little difficult for us because the state threw the ball in our court now.

1233
01:41:24,672 --> 01:41:33,500
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, we're kind of limited with how we enforce this and with our limited powers that we have.

1234
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:36,483
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think everyone is doing the best they can.

1235
01:41:38,846 --> 01:41:42,370
[SPEAKER_20]: trying to get this, get as many businesses open as possible.

1236
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:48,197
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, the mayor's following the governor's lead on this, so there's only so much he can do.

1237
01:41:48,918 --> 01:41:52,302
[SPEAKER_20]: But I said there was a lot of good questions were asked, a lot of dialogue was

1238
01:41:53,143 --> 01:42:02,453
[SPEAKER_20]: was done last week and along with questions about the business fund that I served on the committee with to get out there.

1239
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:08,419
[SPEAKER_20]: So things are moving in the right direction and maybe they're not moving as fast as we'd like them to be but

1240
01:42:10,278 --> 01:42:18,665
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, the administration is doing the best they can to follow the guidelines and guidance that's been given out to them.

1241
01:42:20,006 --> 01:42:23,209
[SPEAKER_20]: And I say, as things change, we'll change too.

1242
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:25,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1243
01:42:25,611 --> 01:42:26,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1244
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:27,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Perez.

1245
01:42:28,793 --> 01:42:30,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, thank you, Dave.

1246
01:42:30,575 --> 01:42:32,116
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1247
01:42:32,977 --> 01:42:36,119
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say, I think, you know, enforcement, this is on us, right?

1248
01:42:36,139 --> 01:42:39,182
[SPEAKER_18]: This whole crisis is on us taking action together.

1249
01:42:39,615 --> 01:42:44,819
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think luckily we're in Medford where we know that people are gonna step up and follow the rules and keep everybody safe.

1250
01:42:44,919 --> 01:42:53,806
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just really glad you put this together and thanks for getting it out there and doing the outreach to make sure businesses are not only have the information, but know there's someone they can call if they have a question.

1293
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:54,238
[SPEAKER_11]: 20-380 to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council.

1294
01:44:55,549 --> 01:45:01,754
[SPEAKER_11]: City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding local acceptance, small business property tax exemption.

1295
01:45:02,314 --> 01:45:12,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear Mr. President and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body take the following action relative to small business personal property taxes.

1296
01:45:13,001 --> 01:45:21,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I request that the city of Medford by vote of the Medford city council, accept the provisions of mass general laws, chapter 59, section five,

1297
01:45:23,519 --> 01:45:36,443
[SPEAKER_11]: 54 and exempt $10,000 of fair cash value on personal property accounts to be taxed beginning in fiscal year 2021, beginning on July 1st, 2020.

1298
01:45:36,924 --> 01:45:39,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1299
01:45:39,164 --> 01:45:43,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Ongo, current mayor.

1300
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:46,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello.

1301
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1302
01:45:47,361 --> 01:45:57,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, is this motion relative to the COVID problem or it's just something that in general?

1303
01:45:59,037 --> 01:46:01,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez, would you like to speak on this matter?

1304
01:46:04,533 --> 01:46:09,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I am joined by Ellen Burdell, the chief assessor for the city.

1305
01:46:09,897 --> 01:46:13,620
[SPEAKER_05]: She can certainly go into details of the local acceptance of this act.

1306
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:17,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not directly related, it's related, but it's not because of.

1307
01:46:18,704 --> 01:46:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is certainly something that we can do for small businesses in the city in order for just a little bit of relief.

1308
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:41,114
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we redirected all staff to do, Ellen specifically, is to say, let's look for little things that we can do in order to help small businesses the best we can that won't have a huge, that won't have a detrimental impact upon the city or from the management side from the city.

1309
01:46:41,154 --> 01:46:47,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the things that Ellen brought to our attention right away and something that the mayor wanted to get before the council as soon as possible.

1310
01:46:48,056 --> 01:46:49,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll defer to Ellen on any questions.

1311
01:46:50,117 --> 01:46:56,392
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding the details of the local acceptance and how that would mean, what it would mean for city finances and also these businesses.

1312
01:46:56,412 --> 01:46:59,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, at this point I'd recognize Ella Burdell.

1313
01:47:01,349 --> 01:47:01,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly.

1314
01:47:02,349 --> 01:47:03,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, Councilors.

1315
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:17,674
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as chief of staff mentioned, the mayor challenged us to come up with solutions, not only that would assist our small businesses but also for cost saving measures for the, for the city.

1316
01:47:18,214 --> 01:47:22,375
[SPEAKER_14]: So the small commercial exemption, or small personal property exemption.

1317
01:47:23,415 --> 01:47:28,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Although my department still has to gather and value, every account in the city.

1318
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:34,124
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a, it is a cost savings to the treasurer collector's office, where they are not issuing bills.

1319
01:47:35,145 --> 01:47:45,914
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have bills as low as $1 20 for the year that they have to send out four times, it's just not cost effective for the postage the mailing, and the time and energy spent on these little tiny bills.

1320
01:47:47,475 --> 01:47:49,918
[SPEAKER_14]: So that really was what brought it to the forefront.

1321
01:47:51,019 --> 01:47:53,962
[SPEAKER_14]: The small commercial or small personal property accounts.

1322
01:47:54,683 --> 01:48:02,191
[SPEAKER_14]: In Medford we have 1000 accounts of estimated for personal property, 60% of those are under $10,000 in value.

1323
01:48:04,029 --> 01:48:09,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet it was only 1.1% of the total value of personal property for the whole city.

1324
01:48:09,934 --> 01:48:15,979
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a big number of accounts, little tiny number of value.

1325
01:48:15,999 --> 01:48:19,081
[SPEAKER_14]: And it just makes sense to do it at this time.

1326
01:48:19,101 --> 01:48:26,647
[SPEAKER_14]: My board spending time doing $10 abatements because somebody moved out of town is not a good use of time.

1327
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:30,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Caraviello, did you have any further questions?

1328
01:48:31,054 --> 01:48:33,616
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope, that was a very good answer, thank you.

1329
01:48:33,636 --> 01:48:35,837
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, we have Councilor Bears and Councilor Knight.

1330
01:48:35,857 --> 01:48:38,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Bears.

1331
01:48:39,619 --> 01:48:39,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

1332
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:41,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Please continue.

1333
01:48:42,801 --> 01:48:43,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1334
01:48:45,123 --> 01:48:48,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Ellen, that was a super helpful explanation.

1335
01:48:48,385 --> 01:48:53,768
[SPEAKER_18]: So is the number in here, there's just a typo in the notice, it's 10,000, the period's just in the wrong place, is that?

1336
01:48:54,876 --> 01:48:55,496
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1337
01:48:55,657 --> 01:48:59,098
[SPEAKER_14]: The maximum that a city could exempt from personal property is 10,000.

1338
01:48:59,158 --> 01:48:59,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1339
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:07,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And so and you said that, that, that the accounts under 10,000 are only 1% of the value of personal property.

1340
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,002
[SPEAKER_18]: So 99% is in the accounts above 10,000.

1341
01:49:11,755 --> 01:49:12,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 1.1%.

1342
01:49:12,575 --> 01:49:15,116
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, 99 sounds good.

1343
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:15,916
[SPEAKER_14]: We're around numbers.

1344
01:49:18,137 --> 01:49:18,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1345
01:49:18,697 --> 01:49:26,779
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and that equates it's 600 of the 1000 accounts again, estimated wise that are in that under 10,000 range.

1346
01:49:27,139 --> 01:49:28,299
[SPEAKER_14]: These are your small businesses.

1347
01:49:28,339 --> 01:49:32,600
[SPEAKER_14]: These are your, your nail salons, your little restaurants.

1348
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:37,901
[SPEAKER_14]: These are not your big grocery stores or other big accounts or hotels.

1349
01:49:38,081 --> 01:49:41,002
[SPEAKER_14]: These are small people that, you know, are little independent

1350
01:49:41,762 --> 01:49:43,643
[SPEAKER_14]: businesses.

1351
01:49:43,803 --> 01:49:44,664
[SPEAKER_18]: So two questions.

1352
01:49:44,864 --> 01:49:54,190
[SPEAKER_18]: One, I think it wouldn't be good if I didn't ask this, what exactly are we taxing in terms of personal property for a hair salon, for example, what would that actually mean?

1353
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:57,772
[SPEAKER_14]: In a hair salon, that means the chairs, the counters,

1354
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:05,332
[SPEAKER_14]: those, yeah, all those things that go into a hairdressing salon.

1355
01:50:05,853 --> 01:50:15,339
[SPEAKER_14]: So you go in and you literally count how many chairs they have, how many stations, you know, the little counters in front of the stations, all of that is considered personal property.

1356
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:19,482
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not anything that's not affixed to the commercial property itself.

1357
01:50:20,563 --> 01:50:22,805
[SPEAKER_14]: So anything that's a tenant fit up.

1358
01:50:23,605 --> 01:50:24,146
[SPEAKER_14]: basically.

1359
01:50:24,646 --> 01:50:29,050
[SPEAKER_14]: In a little restaurant, you're counting silverware, number of chairs, number of tables.

1360
01:50:30,492 --> 01:50:31,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the things.

1361
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:38,099
[SPEAKER_14]: It's little items that depreciate quickly, but they are taxed in the state of Massachusetts.

1362
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:39,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it.

1363
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:42,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess that's to my second question, which is,

1364
01:50:43,306 --> 01:50:47,889
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds to me like there's a lot of time that goes into this relative to the return on your end.

1365
01:50:48,329 --> 01:50:53,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have an estimate of how much tax revenue we would lose by doing this?

1366
01:50:54,053 --> 01:50:56,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's my first part of the question.

1367
01:50:56,335 --> 01:51:02,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so for tax revenue, we don't lose any because it's, again, we're exempting those.

1368
01:51:03,479 --> 01:51:05,541
[SPEAKER_14]: We still have to collect the same amount.

1369
01:51:05,581 --> 01:51:08,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Last year, if you looked at those accounts,

1370
01:51:10,304 --> 01:51:14,847
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about $43,000, but we still have to collect those taxes.

1371
01:51:14,928 --> 01:51:18,030
[SPEAKER_14]: It just gets redistributed through all the commercial accounts.

1372
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:20,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it's 43,000.

1373
01:51:20,512 --> 01:51:30,119
[SPEAKER_14]: If I added up those 600 accounts, what their total value was times last year's tax rate.

1374
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, what you're saying is that that's a lot of work.

1375
01:51:32,871 --> 01:51:44,157
[SPEAKER_14]: You think we're probably spending more than 43,000 and time hours or, I would like to correct you on that Councilor bears is that I don't save any time or energy and work I still have to value those properties by law.

1376
01:51:44,437 --> 01:51:44,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1377
01:51:45,037 --> 01:51:55,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, where we save funds is the sending out of a tax bill the man hours the postage, the paper, and then the time and energy spent explaining

1378
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:59,385
[SPEAKER_14]: to someone why they have a $38 tax bill.

1379
01:52:00,886 --> 01:52:02,387
[SPEAKER_14]: That part gets eliminated.

1380
01:52:03,127 --> 01:52:09,891
[SPEAKER_14]: But by law, I still have to go out there and make sure I gather all that information and still value them.

1381
01:52:11,632 --> 01:52:13,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not saving my department work.

1382
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:15,314
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the long run, it is saving.

1383
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:21,398
[SPEAKER_14]: If you took 600 accounts times $0.55 in postage times, so little money.

1384
01:52:21,978 --> 01:52:24,219
[SPEAKER_14]: But the impact on a small commercial account

1385
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:28,443
[SPEAKER_14]: could be pretty significant to them, you know, in the long run.

1386
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So, got it.

1387
01:52:30,245 --> 01:52:37,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, no, it sounds like a win win to me so thank you for the explanation and thanks for answering my questions.

1388
01:52:39,094 --> 01:52:43,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Would properties who are in arrears of payments be eligible to participate.

1389
01:52:45,616 --> 01:52:49,618
[SPEAKER_14]: property so this is a new program beginning fiscal 21.

1390
01:52:50,218 --> 01:53:04,286
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would not be issuing bills to anyone in fiscal 21 but if they're in arrears or have not paid their tax bills prior, those bills are still due and can be collected on through the other mechanisms at the collector uses.

1391
01:53:05,146 --> 01:53:14,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me rephrase the question I guess the question is, would an applicant be eligible to receive the exemption, if they have already hold the city if they already hold the city

1392
01:53:15,532 --> 01:53:19,355
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is no application process for this exemption.

1393
01:53:19,955 --> 01:53:26,200
[SPEAKER_14]: You just take any account that's in assessed value 10,000 or less, they just don't get a tax bill.

1394
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:34,406
[SPEAKER_17]: So that they could have a lot of bill they could always sue a bill, but they'll still get the prop personal property tax exemption through this.

1395
01:53:34,967 --> 01:53:35,587
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1396
01:53:36,488 --> 01:53:37,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1397
01:53:37,689 --> 01:53:42,012
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's safe to say that this is something that will have an effect on the FY 21 bottom line.

1398
01:53:45,155 --> 01:53:52,723
[SPEAKER_14]: the impact on the F 120 fiscal 21 bottom line is only a shift within the commercial class on taxes.

1399
01:53:53,504 --> 01:53:55,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a minimal amount of shipping.

1400
01:53:55,365 --> 01:54:01,592
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's similar to the same shift that we discussed when we were talking about the residential property tax exemption.

1401
01:54:01,952 --> 01:54:02,913
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be similar to that.

1402
01:54:03,513 --> 01:54:05,275
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have to collect the same amount of money.

1403
01:54:05,335 --> 01:54:06,877
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a matter of who's going to pay for it.

1404
01:54:07,357 --> 01:54:07,938
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1405
01:54:10,338 --> 01:54:26,104
[SPEAKER_17]: And do you feel as though this might make sense for us to table this discussion where it is a financial issue that will have an impact on the FY 21 budget and wait until we actually have a copy of the FY 21 budget and start those debates before we start moving towards implementing exemptions?

1406
01:54:27,124 --> 01:54:28,545
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I'm looking at today's like 528.

1407
01:54:28,665 --> 01:54:29,845
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I mean?

1408
01:54:29,865 --> 01:54:31,526
[SPEAKER_17]: June 1 is a few days away.

1409
01:54:32,346 --> 01:54:35,387
[SPEAKER_17]: We're way, way, way, way behind in the budget process.

1410
01:54:35,907 --> 01:54:39,250
[SPEAKER_17]: And last I heard, you know, we didn't know what our recap sheet was going to say.

1411
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:46,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess is it wise for us to move forward on an exemption at this time when we don't know what the total fiscal picture is for FY 21.

1412
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:51,599
[SPEAKER_17]: We have our paid consultant that has given us a great forecast of worst case scenario.

1413
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:56,823
[SPEAKER_17]: But it seems though the administration has not committed to producing a budget for us for this next fiscal year.

1414
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:00,566
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, if we're adopting

1415
01:55:01,233 --> 01:55:11,211
[SPEAKER_17]: abatements for FY 21 when we don't even know what course we're going to take in terms of a budget, whether it's a one-twelfth budget, a quarterly budget, or a 12-month budget, I think is concerning.

1416
01:55:11,712 --> 01:55:12,995
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you please talk a little bit about that?

1417
01:55:13,805 --> 01:55:17,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I certainly can talk quickly but I'd also probably disperse a chief of staff.

1418
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:20,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Rodriguez.

1419
01:55:20,849 --> 01:55:27,313
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, if this does not cost this, this actually saves the city money in the terms of the postage and other items.

1420
01:55:28,034 --> 01:55:30,636
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no cost, nor is there any offset.

1421
01:55:31,476 --> 01:55:44,003
[SPEAKER_14]: to the city and revenue collected, all we're doing is exempting a small amount of personal property tax that is shifted to the other accounts.

1422
01:55:44,023 --> 01:55:47,465
[SPEAKER_14]: $43,000, it's not gonna move the tax rate.

1423
01:55:48,185 --> 01:55:52,928
[SPEAKER_14]: If all things were equal and we weren't in this position today, it wouldn't even move the tax rate a penny.

1424
01:55:55,169 --> 01:56:01,313
[SPEAKER_14]: it for those commercial accounts we're still going to collect the same amount of money so it doesn't have an impact on budget that I can see.

1425
01:56:01,813 --> 01:56:04,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly I'll defer to Chief of Staff.

1426
01:56:06,796 --> 01:56:12,999
[SPEAKER_17]: And then okay so it doesn't have an impact on budget per se and I understand that does it, what's the anticipated cost savings for your department if implemented.

1427
01:56:14,352 --> 01:56:26,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it would not be a cost savings to my department, it's going to be through a minimal $1,300 if you just calculating that the part of the postage that you would save.

1428
01:56:27,858 --> 01:56:35,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, you know, I don't know if I could put $1 amount on on the, the man hours that we spend answering the questions.

1429
01:56:37,401 --> 01:56:37,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1430
01:56:37,902 --> 01:56:40,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And in terms of your postage account, how is that looking right now at this point?

1431
01:56:41,427 --> 01:56:45,849
[SPEAKER_17]: juncture in the fiscal year, you maxed out in your postage do you have any money left in that account.

1432
01:56:46,669 --> 01:56:51,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are those are managed again through the collector's office and he uses a mailing company.

1433
01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:57,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Now he's just going to reduce the amount of mailing that go, I couldn't really comment on that Councilor.

1434
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:04,196
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, ultimately, we want to take your money and put it towards our zoning consultant, if in fact, there's going to be a balance there.

1435
01:57:04,216 --> 01:57:05,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is going to save them money on postage.

1436
01:57:06,097 --> 01:57:08,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was my, my thought surrounding it.

1437
01:57:08,559 --> 01:57:11,221
[SPEAKER_14]: But I appreciate help.

1438
01:57:11,721 --> 01:57:13,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we only need 2800 more.

1439
01:57:13,202 --> 01:57:13,782
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're close.

1440
01:57:13,823 --> 01:57:16,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We're very close to self funding.

1441
01:57:16,705 --> 01:57:18,906
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, I do appreciate it.

1442
01:57:18,946 --> 01:57:21,268
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems to me like this is something that's relatively de minimis.

1443
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:24,630
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, benign in terms of application.

1444
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:28,213
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I'd like to hear my other council colleagues have to say, but I'm indefinite on it.

1445
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:31,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

1446
01:57:32,591 --> 01:57:33,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1447
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:41,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Ellen, if you could just reiterate, I think you mentioned it, but the $10,000, uh, amount is imposed by the state.

1448
01:57:41,995 --> 01:57:43,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that, is that what that was?

1449
01:57:44,196 --> 01:57:44,696
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1450
01:57:44,716 --> 01:57:48,238
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the maximum we could exempt from personal property.

1451
01:57:48,278 --> 01:57:54,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, um, when discussing it with the mayor and the chief of staff, we looked at a 5,000 and a 10,000.

1452
01:57:55,441 --> 01:57:57,962
[SPEAKER_14]: The difference between is so negligible.

1453
01:57:58,142 --> 01:58:01,043
[SPEAKER_14]: It's might as well go to the max at this point so that it's not something.

1454
01:58:01,683 --> 01:58:03,284
[SPEAKER_14]: It just makes it cleaner and easier.

1455
01:58:03,304 --> 01:58:05,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I agree.

1456
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:08,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And you said there's roughly 1000 businesses that this would apply to?

1457
01:58:09,886 --> 01:58:17,508
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I have 1000 personal property accounts in the city today, 600 of them would qualify to not receive a tax bill.

1458
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:19,390
[SPEAKER_04]: 600 would qualify.

1459
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:30,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any indication of how many, uh, of, uh, small businesses would be in the range from, uh, $10,001 to $20,000?

1460
01:58:31,613 --> 01:58:35,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I, I didn't even honestly research that because I, I stopped it at the 10.

1461
01:58:36,614 --> 01:58:36,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

1462
01:58:38,974 --> 01:58:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have an idea of, uh, you know, not, not at the tip.

1463
01:58:42,555 --> 01:58:42,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1464
01:58:43,515 --> 01:58:43,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1465
01:58:44,187 --> 01:58:48,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the amount of money, it's really negligible for the amount of money.

1466
01:58:49,629 --> 01:58:54,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, you know, it's really, in my opinion, not a savings to the business owners.

1467
01:58:55,111 --> 01:58:57,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're talking very minimal.

1468
01:58:57,712 --> 01:59:07,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, my, my only concern is it's minimal on the other end too, but someone that may have property value that's assessed at $10,050 is going to see an increase.

1469
01:59:11,717 --> 01:59:17,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how many of those are out there, but it's minimal anyways.

1470
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:23,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this something that we anticipate gonna happen every year, or is this a one-time thing we're looking at?

1471
01:59:24,063 --> 01:59:25,983
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a one-time adoption by the city.

1472
01:59:26,344 --> 01:59:35,548
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't visit it every year unless the state law changes and you could increase it, or if the city chooses to

1473
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:41,123
[SPEAKER_14]: reduce it, but you don't visit this every year it's a one time upset acceptance.

1474
01:59:41,884 --> 01:59:49,011
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm saying is, will the city administration come back next year and say we'd like to enact this small business exemption.

1475
01:59:50,433 --> 01:59:52,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that that's a possibility correct.

1476
01:59:53,094 --> 02:00:01,957
[SPEAKER_14]: No, once you adopt it today, if the city council chose to adopt it, it's done in perpetuity until you rescind it or change it.

1477
02:00:01,977 --> 02:00:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1478
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:06,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is every year now go moving forward.

1479
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:07,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1480
02:00:08,580 --> 02:00:09,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And I okay.

1481
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:19,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so minimal that I don't have a problem with it.

1482
02:00:21,312 --> 02:00:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you could get us the numbers, I'd be curious to see the other 400 businesses where they fall on personal property tax amounts.

1483
02:00:31,315 --> 02:00:36,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the total personal property for the whole community.

1484
02:00:36,196 --> 02:00:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the total.

1485
02:00:38,453 --> 02:00:41,575
[SPEAKER_04]: the dollar amount broken down by percentage.

1486
02:00:42,756 --> 02:00:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you able to tell us what range, how many businesses fall in between 10 to 20,000 or 10 to 50,000?

1487
02:00:52,141 --> 02:00:56,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be curious to see what that results are from that.

1488
02:00:58,925 --> 02:00:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something you can get?

1489
02:01:00,646 --> 02:01:02,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, yes.

1490
02:01:02,467 --> 02:01:04,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1491
02:01:04,829 --> 02:01:05,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1492
02:01:06,029 --> 02:01:06,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1493
02:01:09,174 --> 02:01:13,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you know the answer to this, Madam Assessor, if this is something more appropriate for the solicitor.

1494
02:01:14,718 --> 02:01:28,489
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we passed a vote on this this evening, but it had a sunset clause that said that, you know, this vote will remain in effect only for the fiscal the current the future fiscal year and would have to be brought up again at a later date next year for further adoption.

1495
02:01:28,509 --> 02:01:29,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that something that we could do?

1496
02:01:31,697 --> 02:01:33,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I would defer that to the city solicitor.

1497
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:45,527
[SPEAKER_14]: The way I read the law or my understanding is that you adopt it, you accept the provisions, and then if the city council chose to rescind that, you would have to bring it back to city council.

1498
02:01:45,787 --> 02:01:50,671
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, that would be a solicitor question to put that language in there.

1499
02:01:54,214 --> 02:01:55,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, any further questions?

1500
02:01:56,435 --> 02:01:57,276
[SPEAKER_17]: That does it for me, sir.

1501
02:01:57,296 --> 02:01:58,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1502
02:01:58,857 --> 02:02:00,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the council?

1503
02:02:01,303 --> 02:02:02,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1504
02:02:04,205 --> 02:02:07,267
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Council Mark, seconded by- Second, Mr. President.

1505
02:02:07,327 --> 02:02:08,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, can I be heard?

1506
02:02:08,988 --> 02:02:10,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Hurtubise, any emails?

1507
02:02:13,492 --> 02:02:15,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, there are no emails on this topic.

1508
02:02:15,473 --> 02:02:17,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Any participation from the public?

1509
02:02:19,156 --> 02:02:21,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing and seeing none, on that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1510
02:02:22,758 --> 02:02:23,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

1511
02:02:24,556 --> 02:02:24,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1512
02:02:25,597 --> 02:02:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1513
02:02:25,697 --> 02:02:25,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1514
02:02:25,797 --> 02:02:25,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1515
02:02:25,938 --> 02:02:26,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1516
02:02:26,038 --> 02:02:26,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1517
02:02:26,178 --> 02:02:26,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1518
02:02:26,258 --> 02:02:26,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1519
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:52,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, 20-381, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding ordinance amendment zoning change.

1520
02:02:52,670 --> 02:03:06,042

1521
02:03:06,582 --> 02:03:14,966

1522
02:03:15,806 --> 02:03:21,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 194-148 of the revised ordinances City of Method, Massachusetts is hereby amended as follows.

1523
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:26,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, table of use regulations in off-street parking and loading.

1524
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:34,032
[SPEAKER_11]: table of use regulations for use 18 multiple dwellings not over three stories in height.

1525
02:03:34,572 --> 02:03:40,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Amend yes to SPC with footnote number three immediately following the word height to read as follows.

1526
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:59,353
[SPEAKER_11]: A special permit shall require that 25% of the total gross floor area of the development contain non-residential uses permitted by right of which are authorized pursuant to a special permit in the underlying zoning district or where relevant overlying zoning district.

1527
02:04:01,467 --> 02:04:12,896
[SPEAKER_11]: For use 19, multiple dwelling, not over 75 feet or six stories in height, amended yes to SPC with footnote number three, immediately following the word height to read as follows.

1528
02:04:13,797 --> 02:04:30,530
[SPEAKER_11]: A special permit shall require that at least 25% of the gross floor area of the development contain a non-residential uses permit by right or which are authorized pursuant to a special permit in the underlying zoning district or where relevant

1529
02:04:31,298 --> 02:04:32,840
[SPEAKER_11]: overlying zoning district.

1530
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:35,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1531
02:04:35,822 --> 02:04:38,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Respectfully submitted Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

1532
02:04:40,046 --> 02:04:44,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there someone from the, actually Dave, oh, you got Councilor Knight.

1533
02:04:46,653 --> 02:04:49,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I do believe at 6 p.m.

1534
02:04:49,455 --> 02:04:56,262
[SPEAKER_17]: this evening, we had a meeting concerning the city council's vote on what direction we were gonna go in relative to zoning reform.

1535
02:04:56,963 --> 02:05:02,668
[SPEAKER_17]: And the council has had a very public open and deliberate process relative to what direction we want to go in.

1536
02:05:03,109 --> 02:05:06,792
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now, I believe we're moving forward with the codification process.

1537
02:05:07,513 --> 02:05:13,138
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, I think this council has spoken as to what the next steps are in terms of zoning reform.

1538
02:05:13,578 --> 02:05:20,824
[SPEAKER_17]: And I might ask that the administration withdraw the amendment that's before us this evening so that the council can move forward with the zoning consultant and the codification process.

1539
02:05:22,306 --> 02:05:23,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Second that motion, Mr. President.

1540
02:05:24,323 --> 02:05:31,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, we have the Chief of Staff, if we can get a brief overview of what they're trying to put forth.

1541
02:05:31,892 --> 02:05:32,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1542
02:05:32,933 --> 02:05:36,677
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a motion on the floor from Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

1543
02:05:37,518 --> 02:05:42,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of Staff Dave Rodriguez, if you could please explain this paper or just give us an overview.

1544
02:05:42,805 --> 02:05:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure thing, Mr. President.

1545
02:05:44,166 --> 02:05:54,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of the low hanging fruit items that we've identified as we came into office and we started looking at the zoning ordinance as it is put into application.

1546
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:58,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, being mindful of the process that the council is undergoing.

1547
02:05:59,551 --> 02:06:08,635
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a tool that gives enormous flexibility and control back to the council when it comes to permitting

1548
02:06:09,515 --> 02:06:11,757
[SPEAKER_05]: of large-scale residential developments within the city.

1549
02:06:12,497 --> 02:06:22,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something that would require these large-scale or large volume residential developments to have at least 25% non-residential use.

1550
02:06:23,004 --> 02:06:35,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be retail, it could be office space, it could be lab space, it could be something else that allows us to help diversify the stock of development that's coming in and also gives local control back to the city council.

1551
02:06:39,863 --> 02:06:53,634
[SPEAKER_17]: If you look at the tables of use and you look at the language in the proposal, Mr. President, it says that there'll be a 20% commercial for gross floor space, but the allowable 25% is only subject to what's outlined in the table of use charts.

1552
02:06:54,215 --> 02:06:58,098
[SPEAKER_17]: And that would be items that don't include biotech.

1553
02:06:58,138 --> 02:06:59,619
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't include retail sales.

1554
02:07:01,285 --> 02:07:04,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Chief of Staff says that it includes research or biotech, it doesn't.

1555
02:07:04,288 --> 02:07:08,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are actually excluded in the zoning use chat for an apartment one district.

1556
02:07:08,772 --> 02:07:11,435
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to point that out that that's not accurate.

1557
02:07:12,255 --> 02:07:15,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if it's allowed in the underlying use district, then it would be allowed.

1558
02:07:15,758 --> 02:07:17,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I misspoke, I apologize.

1559
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:22,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's allowed in the underlying use district, then it would be allowed within the 25% special permit threshold.

1560
02:07:23,205 --> 02:07:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: These items, these developments are allowed as right right now.

1561
02:07:27,036 --> 02:07:43,607
[SPEAKER_05]: but it would place them back into a special permit granted by the city council, giving the flexibility to the council to permit these individual developments and give us, as a city as a whole, the administration working in collaboration with the council.

1562
02:07:46,829 --> 02:07:47,129
[SPEAKER_05]: the city.

1563
02:07:48,110 --> 02:07:55,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It is generally designed to give us more flexibility and not have individual developments foisted upon the city outside of our control.

1564
02:07:55,895 --> 02:07:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the low-hanging fruit items we identified early.

1565
02:07:59,157 --> 02:08:05,661
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor feels strongly about moving forward with this in order to give the city the biggest and loudest voice at the table as

1566
02:08:20,477 --> 02:08:25,499
[SPEAKER_17]: I certainly have some concern, Mr. President.

1567
02:08:26,039 --> 02:08:36,642
[SPEAKER_17]: This paper says that any dwelling, any multiple unit dwelling over three stories, it's located in an apartment one, an apartment two, or an apartment three district.

1568
02:08:37,322 --> 02:08:46,245
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we look at the zoning map, Mr. President, here in the community, and we look at our apartment one and apartment two districts, because we don't have any apartment three districts, we'll see high street

1569
02:08:46,718 --> 02:08:57,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Riverside Ave, Washington Street, Salem Street, Winthrop Street, Boston Ave, Mystic Ave, the Wellington Mixed-Use District gets put into effect, Middlesex Ave, Fulton Street.

1570
02:08:58,024 --> 02:09:06,409
[SPEAKER_17]: This proposal says if you wanna build a multi-dwelling that's less than three stories, that you now have to have 25% commercial.

1571
02:09:06,969 --> 02:09:14,733
[SPEAKER_17]: So as I drive down Main Street and I look at a three-story, two-family home, somebody wants to knock that home down and build a new one,

1572
02:09:15,163 --> 02:09:16,524
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not going to be able to do that now.

1573
02:09:16,744 --> 02:09:19,466
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be required to have 25% commercial.

1574
02:09:19,886 --> 02:09:27,932
[SPEAKER_17]: And the council isn't going to be bound on the requirements of the special permit to say that they can't issue the special permit unless that 25% commercial is there.

1575
02:09:29,313 --> 02:09:32,195
[SPEAKER_17]: This proposal, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

1576
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:38,500
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, looking at it, it seems to me as though it's a unilateral implementation of a use variance.

1577
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:42,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking at apartment one and apartment two districts, Mr. President.

1578
02:09:42,323 --> 02:09:44,224
[SPEAKER_17]: These are residentially zoned districts.

1579
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:50,392
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we're doing is saying, in these residentially zoned districts, you are now required to have commercial use.

1580
02:09:51,072 --> 02:09:58,495
[SPEAKER_17]: So although it's an attempt and it's a noble attempt to increase the commercial tax base, it's not completing the task, Mr. President.

1581
02:09:58,515 --> 02:09:59,595
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't how we do that.

1582
02:09:59,675 --> 02:10:05,657
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't how we increase the commercial tax base by requiring residential property owners to become commercial landlords.

1583
02:10:05,897 --> 02:10:07,798
[SPEAKER_17]: That just doesn't make sense.

1584
02:10:07,918 --> 02:10:14,460
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, when we're looking at development and growth and increasing a commercial base, maybe we start looking at Locust Street.

1585
02:10:15,405 --> 02:10:39,186
[SPEAKER_17]: and Riverside Ave, and Route 16, and we look at the Malden River, and we look at all the open space that we have there along Route 16, and we look at the community path that we have on Route 16, and we look at the fact that we have housing already on Locust Street, we have housing already on Mystic Avenue, and we have a number of underutilized large parcels in between Locust Street and the Felsway.

1586
02:10:39,586 --> 02:10:43,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe that's what we should be focusing our effort if we want to increase our commercial tax base.

1587
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:51,241
[SPEAKER_17]: But for us to unilaterally impose this on residential property owners to turn them into commercial land brokers, I don't think it's fair or right.

1588
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:52,381
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think it makes sense.

1589
02:10:53,162 --> 02:11:03,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so if you can build an apartment building by right, that's three stories in an apartment, one district, like say off of Salem street on tainter street, which is an apartment, one district.

1590
02:11:04,123 --> 02:11:09,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, if someone has 6,000 square feet, they're eligible to build a two family home by right.

1591
02:11:10,164 --> 02:11:11,165
[SPEAKER_17]: It's three stories high.

1592
02:11:11,585 --> 02:11:13,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So now on tainter street,

1593
02:11:13,541 --> 02:11:18,644
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have a home that's now part home, 25% business.

1594
02:11:19,924 --> 02:11:21,765
[SPEAKER_17]: The business use that's allowed there.

1595
02:11:21,805 --> 02:11:23,946
[SPEAKER_17]: If we look at the use shot is very limiting.

1596
02:11:23,966 --> 02:11:26,327
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not restaurants and bakeries, Mr. President.

1597
02:11:26,788 --> 02:11:28,408
[SPEAKER_17]: It's daycares.

1598
02:11:28,789 --> 02:11:29,829
[SPEAKER_17]: It's let's see here.

1599
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:33,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I got it written down right here somewhere.

1600
02:11:34,291 --> 02:11:36,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it's daycares.

1601
02:11:36,272 --> 02:11:37,793
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, um, medical uses.

1602
02:11:38,205 --> 02:11:42,447
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nothing that, you know, brings, uh, sustainable jobs to the community.

1603
02:11:42,487 --> 02:11:44,789
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nothing that brings jobs to create a living wage.

1604
02:11:45,409 --> 02:11:47,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it's private clubs are allowed by right.

1605
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:51,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but nothing, no consumer service industries whatsoever.

1606
02:11:52,033 --> 02:11:53,274
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't have a law office.

1607
02:11:53,714 --> 02:11:54,874
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't have a tax prep.

1608
02:11:55,255 --> 02:11:56,435
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't have a laundry mat.

1609
02:11:56,896 --> 02:11:58,416
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't have a convenience store.

1610
02:11:58,817 --> 02:12:02,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I just think this is a misguided proposal from the start, Mr. President.

1611
02:12:02,679 --> 02:12:04,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but whereas it is a zoning proposal,

1612
02:12:05,202 --> 02:12:08,904
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be happy to send it to the Community Development Board and get their feedback on it.

1613
02:12:09,764 --> 02:12:16,227
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I feel as though the presentation that was made, it's not exactly an accurate reflection of what the paper does.

1614
02:12:16,867 --> 02:12:29,773
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the allowed uses and special permit uses that are defined are really not conducive to any economic development strategy that would bring a living, a job to provide a living wage to the community.

1615
02:12:32,485 --> 02:12:33,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1616
02:12:33,446 --> 02:12:35,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a number of Councilors that want to speak on this.

1617
02:12:35,348 --> 02:12:41,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, are you pulling back your original motion and offering a motion to send this to the CD board?

1618
02:12:42,914 --> 02:12:55,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, my original motion was asking that the administration withdraw the proposal based on the fact that the Council just one hour ago voted to move forward in a certain format and forum for codification of zoning as the first step in zoning reform.

1619
02:12:55,844 --> 02:12:59,968
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that, you know,

1620
02:13:01,771 --> 02:13:05,434
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I have a few questions for the chief of staff on this as well.

1621
02:13:05,854 --> 02:13:10,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Were was there any consultants involved in putting together this plan?

1622
02:13:11,978 --> 02:13:13,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Consultants planning consultants?

1623
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:14,019
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1624
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:15,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1625
02:13:16,081 --> 02:13:18,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Was there any community input and putting together this plan?

1626
02:13:18,517 --> 02:13:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this piece was designed to start the conversation.

1627
02:13:21,779 --> 02:13:34,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So although the goal that it was stated, and it's something that's certainly worthy of debate, how do we get to the position of diversifying the incoming developments and reintegrating commercial development into

1628
02:13:35,591 --> 02:13:38,515
[SPEAKER_05]: into our current stock is worthy of debate.

1629
02:13:38,555 --> 02:13:43,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worthy of talking to and how we get there is not as important as getting there.

1630
02:13:43,621 --> 02:13:52,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mayor feels very strongly about increasing that commercial tax base in order to maintain the ability for residents to age in place and for

1631
02:13:53,072 --> 02:13:56,693
[SPEAKER_05]: affordable housing to exist in a more diversified market.

1632
02:13:57,154 --> 02:14:00,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So we feel very strongly about starting this conversation.

1633
02:14:00,035 --> 02:14:05,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any expectation that this particular proposal is going to come out exactly the same way that it was proposed.

1634
02:14:06,657 --> 02:14:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to start the conversation if things need to be changed.

1635
02:14:09,478 --> 02:14:13,219
[SPEAKER_05]: We're willing to engage with the discussion on changing if we want to talk to experts.

1636
02:14:13,239 --> 02:14:16,120
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk to experts We think the cd board should be involved.

1637
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: We think the council should be more on board We think that at the end of the day that this is something that's worthy of discussion and something that the mayor feels very strongly on moving forward with You it through this process in order to increase it in in light of the financial difficulties that we all are well aware of facing Increasing that commercial tax base is going to be able to read his digest being able to do so in a meaningful way as important

1638
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:40,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1639
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:50,043
[SPEAKER_17]: So is there any briefing by the mayor or the OCD direct OCD director on the impact that this is going to have in writing on how it relates to the vision of growth in the community?

1640
02:14:53,084 --> 02:14:54,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Or work yet?

1641
02:14:54,225 --> 02:14:55,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet?

1642
02:14:55,785 --> 02:14:56,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1643
02:14:56,325 --> 02:15:04,428
[SPEAKER_17]: And is there a zoning consultant that's provided any independent analysis and made this information available on the website prior to the introduction to the legislative proposal?

1644
02:15:06,622 --> 02:15:10,083
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like I said, this was designed to be the start of the conversation, not the end.

1645
02:15:11,123 --> 02:15:28,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, because the reason I ask these questions, Mr. President, is because if we go back to August 12, 2019, there's an opinion piece that says a detailed plan to approach Medford zoning written by the current mayor.

1646
02:15:29,887 --> 02:15:32,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And this

1647
02:15:32,615 --> 02:15:37,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Op Ed has 18 ideas to improve engagement and results in how our city changes.

1648
02:15:39,098 --> 02:15:56,105
[SPEAKER_17]: And this article starts off saying that before any type of measure like this would be made, there'd be a review of the zoning map after public input with consultants and a high degree of community input, where they will identify multi-use zones where local businesses would benefit from additional growth and development.

1649
02:15:57,145 --> 02:16:00,547
[SPEAKER_17]: It then goes on to say that any legislative proposal, which this is,

1650
02:16:01,108 --> 02:16:09,537
[SPEAKER_17]: would include a full briefing by the mayor and the OCD director on the impact with an explanation and writing on how it would relate to the vision of growth in the community.

1651
02:16:10,498 --> 02:16:16,645
[SPEAKER_17]: And further, it says it would require a zoning consultant to provide independent analysis and make this information available on the website.

1652
02:16:17,182 --> 02:16:21,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So apparently a lot's changed from August 12th, 2019 till today, Mr. President.

1653
02:16:21,866 --> 02:16:25,510
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I again reiterate that this is an item that's a zoning amendment.

1654
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:31,656
[SPEAKER_17]: I have no problem forwarding it to the community development board as required by chapter 48, section five.

1655
02:16:32,216 --> 02:16:35,599
[SPEAKER_17]: However, when this thing comes back, there's no way in hell I could forget support this thing.

1656
02:16:37,101 --> 02:16:40,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like a chance to respond if possible, Mr. President.

1657
02:16:40,464 --> 02:16:41,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of staff Rodriguez.

1658
02:16:42,252 --> 02:16:46,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of what Councilor Knight makes some very well taken points.

1659
02:16:46,795 --> 02:16:52,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that a lot of what was described and what he just referenced is a comprehensive plan.

1660
02:16:52,598 --> 02:16:59,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's certainly something that we plan on moving forward with in the new fiscal year, utilizing CDBG funds in order to do that.

1661
02:16:59,923 --> 02:17:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And exactly what you described is exactly what we're gonna be looking to do.

1662
02:17:03,685 --> 02:17:06,467
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor was very clear at our inaugural that we were gonna spend FY20.

1663
02:17:06,527 --> 02:17:09,829
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a zoning amendment.

1664
02:17:09,989 --> 02:17:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to just finish.

1665
02:17:12,563 --> 02:17:15,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, let's let's let's let's let Chief of Staff Rodriguez finish then.

1666
02:17:18,581 --> 02:17:18,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of staff.

1667
02:17:19,001 --> 02:17:20,862
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to continue moving forward, and I'll be brief.

1668
02:17:21,523 --> 02:17:26,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to move forward with a comprehensive plan in the new year utilizing CDBG funding to do that.

1669
02:17:26,525 --> 02:17:36,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is an engagement process from start to finish, one that we referenced with the council in the opening days of the administration, and one that there was a difference in opinion on how to move forward.

1670
02:17:36,531 --> 02:17:42,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to move forward on our own using the CD board along with the CD board to engage with the comprehensive plan.

1671
02:17:44,655 --> 02:17:45,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1672
02:17:45,275 --> 02:17:45,796
[SPEAKER_17]: I missed that.

1673
02:17:45,976 --> 02:17:48,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you say how you're going to move forward again?

1674
02:17:50,701 --> 02:17:51,181
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that?

1675
02:17:51,201 --> 02:17:52,042
[SPEAKER_17]: The conference of plan.

1676
02:17:53,242 --> 02:17:55,583
[SPEAKER_05]: On our own.

1677
02:17:58,724 --> 02:18:02,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, I'd like a chance to respond, please.

1678
02:18:03,266 --> 02:18:05,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief of staff Rodriguez, you said you were going to move ahead.

1679
02:18:06,027 --> 02:18:06,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

1680
02:18:06,728 --> 02:18:10,549
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to move ahead with the conference of plan alongside the CD board as required by law.

1681
02:18:11,269 --> 02:18:12,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're going to do.

1682
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:12,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1683
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:16,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor, do you have any further questions?

1684
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:19,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to refer to the community development board as required by chapter 48 section 5.

1685
02:18:21,232 --> 02:18:24,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, on the motion of council, I'd like to move to the CD board, seconded by?

1686
02:18:25,894 --> 02:18:26,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Second, Mr. President.

1687
02:18:27,435 --> 02:18:30,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Caraviello, we have a couple of questions.

1688
02:18:30,976 --> 02:18:34,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, we have Councilor Bears has his hand up, and then Councilor Morell.

1689
02:18:34,838 --> 02:18:38,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears, you go first.

1690
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:46,723
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I don't presume to be an expert, but I definitely support the intent here of bringing more commercial in, more mixed use development,

1691
02:18:47,612 --> 02:18:51,173
[SPEAKER_18]: more control back to this council over major projects.

1692
02:18:51,333 --> 02:18:57,634
[SPEAKER_18]: This might not be the exact language, but I'd like to, I would vote to send this to community development board and see what they say.

1693
02:18:57,694 --> 02:19:03,316
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that some of the concepts here are things that we discussed during our zoning review.

1694
02:19:04,656 --> 02:19:04,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1695
02:19:04,876 --> 02:19:06,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears, Councilor Morell.

1696
02:19:07,137 --> 02:19:08,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1697
02:19:08,537 --> 02:19:12,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I also, I see the intention behind this, but this feels overly broad to me in its current form.

1698
02:19:13,612 --> 02:19:17,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Like Councilor Knight, I do have some reluctance in pushing something like this forward.

1699
02:19:17,353 --> 02:19:22,715
[SPEAKER_16]: The body is moving forward in a holistic approach to zoning and recodification of our existing laws.

1700
02:19:23,756 --> 02:19:34,939
[SPEAKER_16]: But as I understand, other cities have similar ordinances focusing on ratios, but they often rely on overlay districts to apply something like this, which, you know, seems more something I'd be more in favor of.

1701
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:36,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I would also hope that

1702
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:45,261
[SPEAKER_16]: with zoning ideas like this to encourage more mixed use, that the administration also is exploring ways to support and encourage businesses looking for these spaces.

1703
02:19:45,661 --> 02:19:52,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Opening up a business and having a business that's supportive of the community in Medford is much more than just having a physical space for it.

1704
02:19:52,983 --> 02:19:59,024
[SPEAKER_16]: But nonetheless, I would also support the motion to hear from the city board on this.

1705
02:20:00,044 --> 02:20:00,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1706
02:20:01,044 --> 02:20:02,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1707
02:20:02,865 --> 02:20:04,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Councilor Marks.

1708
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:06,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1709
02:20:06,701 --> 02:20:09,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

1710
02:20:09,982 --> 02:20:14,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my understanding, Mr. President, this applies to large-scale projects.

1711
02:20:15,585 --> 02:20:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think anyone that's been on the Council for a number of years can recall the Locust Street project and how members of the Council, when we sat down with the developer,

1712
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: were urging, and I believe Council Vice President Caraviello did the same, we were urging them to add more retail space within the project itself.

1713
02:20:37,157 --> 02:20:39,338
[SPEAKER_04]: They were strictly looking to put residential.

1714
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:48,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't wanna create these giant housing outlets that had no community feel to them.

1715
02:20:52,727 --> 02:20:57,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think this is one way of attaching whatever's built.

1716
02:20:57,750 --> 02:21:03,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think this applies to small mom and pop, two or three family homes and so forth.

1717
02:21:03,834 --> 02:21:08,217
[SPEAKER_04]: This is large scale projects that they have some type of community feel to it.

1718
02:21:08,597 --> 02:21:18,928
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, for instance, when we looked at the revitalization of Medford Square, the projects that were sent to us had very little commercial retail space within them.

1719
02:21:19,269 --> 02:21:20,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all residential.

1720
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:30,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the east side of Medford Square near City Hall, it kind of created just an area where there was housing and no reason to go, to be quite honest with you.

1721
02:21:31,121 --> 02:21:41,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was something that we were looking at as a council saying, you know what, we don't want these large scale projects taking place without that community feeling and without that community input.

1722
02:21:42,189 --> 02:21:53,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So I welcome this for anyone to think that because we started this process of recodifying that we shouldn't look at anything else for the next year should have their head examined.

1723
02:21:53,517 --> 02:21:56,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we should always be looking for low-lying fruit.

1724
02:21:57,101 --> 02:22:08,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We should always be looking to take advantage of ways that we may be able to push something forward, Mr. President, and not wait if it's something we can do easily, Mr. President.

1725
02:22:09,495 --> 02:22:11,456
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this is something worth exploring.

1726
02:22:11,856 --> 02:22:15,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it merits, I will support sending it to the community development.

1727
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: As anyone knows that's familiar with this, this requires public hearings.

1728
02:22:21,862 --> 02:22:28,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So to say that there's no public hearings or public input won't take place is not correct, Mr. President.

1729
02:22:28,385 --> 02:22:34,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be ample time for public input, public hearings, business input, and that's the process that we follow.

1730
02:22:34,969 --> 02:22:37,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support this, Mr. President.

1731
02:22:38,231 --> 02:22:41,637
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, any way we can improve the process in our community.

1732
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:46,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is one way of keeping our commercial base up.

1733
02:22:47,815 --> 02:22:53,278
[SPEAKER_04]: which we know once that dwindles, residential taxpayers are going to feel the burden.

1734
02:22:53,618 --> 02:22:56,240
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to feel the heat on that, Mr. President.

1735
02:22:56,600 --> 02:22:59,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's up to us to make sure there's a good balance out there.

1736
02:23:00,022 --> 02:23:08,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I'm seeing, between 40B projects and a number of other initiatives, that we seem to be losing a lot of our commercial base.

1737
02:23:09,067 --> 02:23:12,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, as one member of the council, I'm not going to allow that to happen, Mr. President.

1738
02:23:13,543 --> 02:23:14,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much.

1739
02:23:14,588 --> 02:23:17,984
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Vice President Caraviello's up next and Councilor Scarpelli.

1740
02:23:18,454 --> 02:23:19,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1741
02:23:20,955 --> 02:23:26,976
[SPEAKER_20]: We just spent $47,000 to hire a zoning consultant, and now we're going ahead without him.

1742
02:23:27,996 --> 02:23:31,097
[SPEAKER_20]: The man is supposed to be the foremost authority in zoning.

1743
02:23:31,917 --> 02:23:35,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Why not get his opinion on this before we do this?

1744
02:23:35,398 --> 02:23:37,258
[SPEAKER_20]: And you want to talk about the 40B projects?

1745
02:23:37,538 --> 02:23:39,499
[SPEAKER_20]: That horse is already out of the barn, Mr. President.

1746
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:45,780
[SPEAKER_20]: So anything we pass is exempt from those projects going forward.

1747
02:23:47,297 --> 02:23:54,080
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's say those are already in the pipeline and you can't change the rules for stuff that's already in the pipeline.

1748
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:56,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1749
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:57,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1750
02:23:57,921 --> 02:23:58,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1751
02:23:58,721 --> 02:24:03,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I can appreciate the intent of this resolution and the zoning change.

1752
02:24:04,003 --> 02:24:14,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I think that council bring up many good points that we need to vet out to get to a final destination.

1753
02:24:14,467 --> 02:24:16,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that looking at

1754
02:24:18,012 --> 02:24:38,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Council's night's point that you know, the the recodification and hiring the consultant now is a very important point But I also agree with Councilor Marks when it doesn't mean that we're going to stand still in the future Zoning questions, but at the same time I think there are enough questions there that are alarming to our neighborhoods and when you're talking about what?

1755
02:24:39,226 --> 02:24:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: can and what can can't happen so I I like the idea to revert it to

1756
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:49,713
[SPEAKER_06]: the board and then get some clarity on a couple of concerns that I have.

1757
02:24:49,773 --> 02:24:52,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I thank all the parties involved.

1758
02:24:53,915 --> 02:24:58,078
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why this council is doing what we're doing.

1759
02:24:58,118 --> 02:25:00,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to vet our important issues.

1760
02:25:00,459 --> 02:25:04,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we can see, this council isn't sitting back.

1761
02:25:05,202 --> 02:25:10,426
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making huge strides and moving forward in what our thoughts and beliefs are to move our city forward.

1762
02:25:10,466 --> 02:25:12,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1763
02:25:13,977 --> 02:25:15,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

1764
02:25:16,038 --> 02:25:16,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1765
02:25:16,658 --> 02:25:18,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the council?

1766
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other comments?

1767
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:21,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, no.

1768
02:25:21,381 --> 02:25:26,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Arnabes, any emails come in or any questions from the general public?

1769
02:25:27,704 --> 02:25:28,505
[SPEAKER_09]: No emails on this.

1770
02:25:30,265 --> 02:25:31,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, seeing and hearing none.

1771
02:25:31,686 --> 02:25:38,670
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello to send this paper to the CD board.

1772
02:25:39,630 --> 02:25:40,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk Arnabes, please call the roll.

1773
02:25:41,191 --> 02:25:42,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick clarification on this end.

1774
02:25:43,025 --> 02:25:52,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So Councilor Knight, you're withdrawing your original motion to ask the administration to withdraw the amendment and the new motion is to refer to the CD board, correct?

1775
02:25:53,672 --> 02:25:58,054
[SPEAKER_17]: I would certainly be happy to reintroduce my motion to have the administration withdraw the amendment.

1776
02:25:58,094 --> 02:26:02,897
[SPEAKER_17]: However, it seems as though they weren't willing to do such based upon the presentation that they gave at the time.

1777
02:26:02,977 --> 02:26:07,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll revert to the second motion that I did make, yes, to send it to the CD board.

1778
02:26:07,605 --> 02:26:10,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we'll withdraw the first one and you're taking a vote on the second one?

1779
02:26:10,988 --> 02:26:12,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

1780
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:13,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1781
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:14,991
[SPEAKER_09]: And here comes the vote on that.

1782
02:26:16,132 --> 02:26:16,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

1783
02:26:18,373 --> 02:26:18,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1784
02:26:19,434 --> 02:26:20,375
