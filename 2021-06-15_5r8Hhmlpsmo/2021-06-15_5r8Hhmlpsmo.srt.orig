[SPEAKER_47]: Director of Health Services, Ms.

33
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:57,747
[SPEAKER_47]: Toni Wray.

34
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:14,530
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Gordon is going to turn that on for you right now.

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening Mayor, Superintendent and members of the school committee.

36
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:26,577
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot went on during our year of COVID testing so I will try to be as succinct as possible.

37
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,599
[SPEAKER_08]: The Medford Public Schools in partnership with

38
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:45,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Tufts University, Medford Board of Health, and Mayor Longo Kern implemented a robust COVID-19 surveillance testing program starting in the fall of 2020 and continuing through June of 2021.

39
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:52,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Financial support for the program was shared by Tufts University and the City of Medford using CARES and stimulus funding.

40
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,581
[SPEAKER_08]: The model of the program evolved as we moved through the school year.

41
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:01,785
[SPEAKER_08]: starting with the use of individual PCR tests and transitioning to pooled tests.

42
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:04,107
[SPEAKER_08]: A timeline.

43
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:14,814
[SPEAKER_08]: COVID-19 screening using individual PCR tests began in September for teachers of high needs and MEEP students who were returning to in-person teaching.

44
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:19,717
[SPEAKER_08]: The testing support was provided by Armstrong Ambulance and the Medford Board of Health.

45
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:27,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And tests were initially administered by the EMTs and soon after we transitioned to a self-swab method.

46
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:33,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Recruitment of student consent forms began in mid-November, and we started training the school nurses.

47
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:42,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Site visits were made to all of the schools, and a testing location in every school that met the Board of Health Requirements was identified.

48
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: The program began testing students on November 30th, 2020, and we still involved the Armstrong Ambulance EMTs, but this time the school nurses joined in with administering the tests.

49
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:05,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Nurses taught students in grades six to eight to self swab and the students in grades pre-K to five were swabbed by the staff.

50
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:11,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Testing for high school students began in January prior to the return from the December break.

51
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:15,368
[SPEAKER_08]: And all students in high school were taught to self swab.

52
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:23,053
[SPEAKER_08]: As we looked forward to district wide testing, it was apparent that the cost of running the program would be prohibitive.

53
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:25,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So we examined several cost saving measures.

54
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: and ultimately implemented them, including the transition to pooled testing and the use of school nurses to administer the tests.

55
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:39,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Negotiations with Northeastern University School of Nursing were very fruitful.

56
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:49,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford would provide the clinical placement for 76 senior nursing students, who in return would provide testing support to the school nurses.

57
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:55,429
[SPEAKER_08]: In February, the surveillance program transitioned to the pooled testing method.

58
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:04,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the positive pools were reflex tested, meaning that they received a rapid test and an individual PCR test the next day.

59
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:14,515
[SPEAKER_08]: School nurses managed the testing, the reflex testing, contact tracing, education of staff and students and parents, and all the follow-up case management.

60
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:17,816
[SPEAKER_08]: A brief summary of the numbers.

61
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Between September and December 20th of 2020,

62
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:30,066
[SPEAKER_08]: we did 14,571 individual PCR tests.

63
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:40,773
[SPEAKER_08]: 62 of those tests were positive, 247 were coded as TNP or test not performed, and 61 PCR tests were invalid.

64
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Those tests had to be repeated to get accurate results.

65
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:47,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Between December 22nd and June 10th, 2021,

66
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:58,209
[SPEAKER_08]: 8,896 individual PCR tests were completed, 8,624 were negative, 53 were positive, and 219 were test not performed.

67
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:04,113
[SPEAKER_08]: For pooled testing, we tested 6,019 pools, 5,954 pools were negative, 32 pools were positive, and 33 were test not performed.

68
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:30,177
[SPEAKER_08]: When you break down or open up the pools to count how many individuals were tested, we tested 58,823 individuals.

69
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,018
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of work.

70
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,443
[SPEAKER_08]: 58,210 were negative, 317 were positive, and 296 were test not performed.

71
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: In conclusion, school nurses assumed a public health nursing role, even as they maintained their traditional school nurse responsibilities.

72
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:05,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Positive COVID-19 cases were identified early, prompting isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of exposed individuals.

73
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:13,668
[SPEAKER_08]: The percent positivity rate remained extremely low, ranging from 0.01 to 1%, depending on where we were in the school year.

74
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:26,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Surveillance COVID-19 testing can be efficiently administered in the school setting in a sustainable manner through a pooled testing program.

75
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:42,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Public Schools takes great pride in the multidisciplinary partnerships that instilled confidence in the public health conditions with the school environment and minimize the disruption to the instructional day to approximately four to six minutes per class time.

76
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:49,249
[SPEAKER_08]: which we were very pleased with that we were not disrupting students in their educational day.

77
00:07:50,150 --> 00:08:09,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, I'd like to thank the mayor, the superintendent, assistant superintendent David Murphy, Marianne O'Connor from the Board of Health, Chris Sidori and Karen Gradiano from Tufts University, Armstrong Ambulance Company, Northeastern University School of Nursing, Kim Miles, and then the school nurses.

78
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms Wray, we have a surprise for you i'll turn it over to oh my goodness good evening mayor members of the school committee uh when director ray announced her retirement earlier this year she was very clear that uh she did not want any over-the-top celebrations or extravaganzas uh however

79
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:18,327
[SPEAKER_03]: The work that she has done for our district, particularly over the course of the last year, has truly been singular, and the impact it has had, both in keeping people safe and in instilling confidence in all of us that we would be safe.

80
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:33,042
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a series of presentations, understanding that there is an agenda that we have to get to later this evening, starting with a gift certificate for Director Ray and her husband to enjoy when they leave the meeting after this first agenda item.

81
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next presentation is on behalf of our elementary school community assistant superintendent, Suzanne Galusi.

82
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:13,434
[SPEAKER_62]: All right, so I know we're probably all gonna echo the same sentiment when it comes to Tony, but I just wanna say her leadership, she's measured and thoughtful and just so knowledgeable and so collaborative.

83
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:20,876
[SPEAKER_62]: And as both a principal and in this new role this year, it's just been an absolute pleasure being able to work with her.

84
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:25,977
[SPEAKER_62]: This is very bittersweet because we're so very happy for Tony, but very sad for us.

85
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:34,776
[SPEAKER_62]: So this is a little retirement bag of treats for the summer with some cards from elementary students.

86
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:35,317
[SPEAKER_62]: Oh, how sweet.

87
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:40,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

88
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:46,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

89
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen, our Director of Pupil Services, and Mariana O'Connor, Director of Public Health for the city, would also like to address tonight.

90
00:10:52,932 --> 00:11:04,795
[SPEAKER_21]: So Tony, on behalf of all the special ed students in the community, all the work that you've done, it's been an honor to work with you and I'm going to miss you and we wish you well on your vacation and your retirement.

91
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:18,239
[SPEAKER_46]: We met today about summer school and it was really hard to say anything, but we did it.

92
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,283
[SPEAKER_46]: So I did write down, and I'll be brief, but I have to, Tony.

93
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:38,713
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Superintendent and Dave and the administration for including me in this, because I'm really happy to recognize your leadership, your hard work, your dedication to the staff and students of Medford School Department on the occasion of your well earned retirement.

94
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:45,318
[SPEAKER_46]: Six years ago, we became colleagues in protecting the health and well-being of the Medford Schools community.

95
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:54,801
[SPEAKER_46]: Whether it was meeting as part of the School Health Advisory Committee, implementing youth risk behavior surveys, tackling behavioral and mental health issues facing our students.

96
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,624
[SPEAKER_46]: You remember all the work on the vaping public health crisis?

97
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:00,785
[SPEAKER_46]: We thought that was challenging.

98
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,688
[SPEAKER_46]: Then along came COVID.

99
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:09,451
[SPEAKER_46]: You immediately went from being my colleague to being my partner.

100
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,694
[SPEAKER_46]: You jumped in with contact tracing and offered your staff to assist from day one.

101
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,383
[SPEAKER_46]: metric meetings, reopening plans to testing, we quickly became attached to the hip.

102
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:27,347
[SPEAKER_46]: Your leadership, your support, your counsel on tough positions will never be forgotten.

103
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:42,177
[SPEAKER_46]: Most of all, the numerous early morning meetings and late night phone calls where often I just needed a friend to vent to and you were always there and my partner became my friend.

104
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,599
[SPEAKER_46]: I can't thank you enough.

105
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:55,086
[SPEAKER_46]: When I was wavering, you always reeled me in and you stuck with the science and the data and the facts.

106
00:12:56,947 --> 00:13:03,051
[SPEAKER_46]: So in closing now, I just wanna mention something that sticks out in my mind still.

107
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:13,578
[SPEAKER_46]: On one of many ridiculously early Saturday morning calls regarding testing results, I remember calling you while I was still in my pajamas, looking at the results coming in.

108
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,079
[SPEAKER_46]: You picked up the phone and said,

109
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:17,063
[SPEAKER_46]: Let me call you back in two minutes.

110
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,984
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm just checking out at the grocery store.

111
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,685
[SPEAKER_46]: I remember thinking, wow, she is amazing.

112
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:28,066
[SPEAKER_46]: And you are.

113
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,266
[SPEAKER_46]: Enjoy your retirement.

114
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,467
[SPEAKER_46]: You'll be great in this.

115
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:32,907
[SPEAKER_46]: Congratulations.

116
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony, Dr. Cushing has a presentation from our secondary school

117
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:55,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Nurse Wray, there's really not much that can be said that hasn't already been said, but I'll try.

118
00:13:55,345 --> 00:14:09,656
[SPEAKER_19]: On behalf of the Medford Secondary Schools, whose athletics, proms, graduations, and many other events definitely taxed you and the Medford Public Health Board of Health, this is a small token of our gratitude.

119
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:19,823
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have to say to any and all students and parents watching, all of those events that we were able to pull off were able to be pulled off because of the guidance of Nurse Ray,

120
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:32,475
[SPEAKER_19]: and her tireless work on behalf of our students to get students tested, to make sure that they were wearing their masks, and to make sure that we were being safe on a daily basis, to beat back the worst pandemic in over 100 years.

121
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,236
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you, Nurse Ray, on behalf of Medford Secondary School.

122
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Before hearing from Tony's team,

123
00:14:49,662 --> 00:15:13,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say there's never been a meeting that we've been in where in the course of whether it's setting up testing or responding to emergencies, the most constant refrain coming out of Tony's mouth has been the gratitude she has felt for her team, the strength of that team, the talent of that team, be it in the school nurse's office or sometimes on the way to school responding to various emergencies.

124
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:17,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And the school nurse team is here to make that presentation.

125
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,937
[SPEAKER_44]: Hey, Tony, you wrote this article.

126
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:24,258
[SPEAKER_44]: It's for you.

127
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:25,718
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you so much.

128
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:27,279
[SPEAKER_44]: It's been quite a year.

129
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:29,079
[SPEAKER_44]: I work with Tony and Lawrence.

130
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,960
[SPEAKER_44]: I followed her in one of the schools, and I followed her here.

131
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,461
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'm so glad I did.

132
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,942
[SPEAKER_44]: We just appreciate all you've done for us.

133
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:42,865
[SPEAKER_44]: You're always there to answer the phone and guide us through all the complex problems we've had.

134
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,906
[SPEAKER_44]: We really appreciate everything, Tony.

135
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,066
[SPEAKER_44]: We're going to miss you.

136
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,472
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for guiding us through a pandemic relentlessly.

137
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,452
[SPEAKER_42]: Almost.

138
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:08,116
[SPEAKER_42]: So, Tony, on behalf of the central office team,

139
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We came down to two ideas for recognizing you.

140
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:39,539
[SPEAKER_03]: The first was to line up all of your friends, family, and colleagues, and ask you to give us all one final ceremonial nose swab.

141
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:47,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And that got voted down.

142
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:54,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead, we are presenting you with, and I bet this is the only time you're ever given this as a gift.

143
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:10,791
[SPEAKER_03]: These are in bronzed N95 masks.

144
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also why the superintendent's conference room smells like spray paint.

145
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we know so much about Eric's room.

146
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the windows open.

147
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be fine.

148
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the inscription reads, Nurse Tony Ray, MSRN, NCSN, Medford Public Schools, 0.01 to 1% positivity, depending on the week.

149
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% of Mustangs grateful, so.

150
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:37,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

151
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:47,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some presentations from the school committee, the mayor and the superintendent as well.

152
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:48,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted an Irish apologist.

153
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,001
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Kreatz?

154
00:17:53,083 --> 00:18:07,874
[SPEAKER_47]: Maybe you could speak into the microphone, Member Van der Kloot, please?

155
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:13,486
[SPEAKER_44]: Kathy and I have the honor to present to you from the House of Representatives.

156
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:27,171
[SPEAKER_44]: Be it hereby known to all, the Massachusetts House of Representatives offers its sincerest congratulations to Tony Ray in recognition of your years of dedicated and outstanding service to the Medford Public Schools.

160

161
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:57,630
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'd like to express our thanks to every one of you as well, because that's what Tony would want.

[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for all of your work up to the pandemic.

165
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:06,675
[SPEAKER_44]: And then thank you for getting us through the pandemic.

166
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,897
[SPEAKER_44]: Tony worked tirelessly.

167
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:18,382
[SPEAKER_44]: She worked on weekends around the clock to make sure that our students and teachers were safe.

168
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:19,489
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you so much.

169
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:20,089

179
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:29,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a competition at the Statehouse for size of documents.

185
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:33,788
[SPEAKER_46]: personally because you were so gracious taking care of our little girl when she had to have a body cast in a wheelchair for two months and you and your staff with her open wounds and everything else, you just made us feel confident handing her over to you.

186
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,190
[SPEAKER_46]: And we know that you make every family feel that way.

187

00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,896
[SPEAKER_47]: So I was just gonna read that if you don't mind.

198

[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you isn't even enough, but just thank you for your service, your faithfulness, your dedication to Medford Public Schools.

210
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:46,103
[SPEAKER_30]: As was said earlier, your job was not a Monday to Friday.

211
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:51,291
[SPEAKER_30]: It was Monday all the way again to Monday all the way again.

212
00:23:51,311 --> 00:24:02,736
[SPEAKER_30]: It was seven days a week, receiving the texts on the weekends, communicating with you, especially when things were, you know, when we were having our little hotspots.

213
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:10,600
[SPEAKER_30]: So I thank you so much for all of that time where you weren't publicly recognized, but you were doing the work because it needed to get done.

214
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,621
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you for that.

215

[SPEAKER_30]: They have come out to support you and to really show their true love and support for all that you have done.

218
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:38,648
[SPEAKER_30]: We have a small, small token that the vocational school, Mr. Fallon, they worked on.

219
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:46,412
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's engraved with the city seal and it says,

220
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:50,693
[SPEAKER_30]: for leadership in sickness and in health.

221

222
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:17,030

223
00:25:17,962 --> 00:25:23,890
[SPEAKER_30]: And since I've been here, I selected an administrator of the year.

224
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,994
[SPEAKER_30]: Last year, we were unable to do that.

225
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:32,120
[SPEAKER_30]: And so for school year, which was last year, 2000,

226
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:35,774
[SPEAKER_30]: 19 to 2020.

229
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,787
[SPEAKER_30]: So we'll get that to you.

230
00:25:57,987 --> 00:25:58,768
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much.

231
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,941

[SPEAKER_30]: Tony, would you like to have the floor?

233
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,324
[SPEAKER_08]: All I can say is thank you.

234
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had a long career in the schools.

235
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:22,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It was preceded by a long career in the hospital.

236
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:31,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really looking forward to the next adventures and I will be around here and there to help out, but.

240
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:51,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, coming from the hospitals, you always wonder, is this going to be a stimulating place to work?

241
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has been.

242
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've learned a lot.

243
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:59,610

00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:38,374
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

282
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:39,875
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloot.

283
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:40,215
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

284
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:41,376
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Lungo-Kern.

285
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:41,676
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

286
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:43,456
[SPEAKER_47]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

287
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:44,757
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion is approved.

288
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,618
[SPEAKER_47]: Dr. Cushing is here to present.

289
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:47,778
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Kloet.

290
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:54,601
[SPEAKER_44]: Before we do that, after that, as we're taking things out of order, I would ask that we move on to the presentation

291
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:56,529
[SPEAKER_44]: of the advisory committee.

292
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:00,110
[SPEAKER_47]: Of number nine, old business, absolutely.

293
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,730
[SPEAKER_47]: Is that a motion?

294
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,991
[SPEAKER_47]: Is that a motion on the floor, seconded by?

295
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:05,051
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

296
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:05,351
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

297
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:07,312
[SPEAKER_47]: Member McLaughlin, roll call, please.

298
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:11,032
[SPEAKER_47]: If you'd like to speak.

299
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:11,492
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

300
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:13,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

301
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:21,955
[SPEAKER_05]: We have several other items on the agenda, including one that if we don't vote on tonight, it means it'll be an entire year, which children will not be eating in our school system.

302
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we want to take that one up at 1 AM?

303
00:34:25,836 --> 00:34:31,800
[SPEAKER_44]: Mayor, I am happy to stay here to get to the entire agenda, no matter how late we go.

304
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,961
[SPEAKER_44]: But in the meantime, we have an audience.

305
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,642
[SPEAKER_44]: And we know why they're here.

306
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,023
[SPEAKER_44]: We have an advisory council.

307
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,044
[SPEAKER_44]: We know why that we're here.

308
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:41,566
[SPEAKER_44]: We've already asked them graciously, not really asked, but

309
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:46,309
[SPEAKER_44]: They graciously sat here for our wonderful presentation to Tony Wray.

310
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:50,232
[SPEAKER_44]: We wanna take up our seventh graders and that I think it's only appropriate.

311
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:55,035
[SPEAKER_44]: I guarantee you to my colleague, we will get to everything on the agenda.

312
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:57,157
[SPEAKER_44]: No one's gonna rush out of here.

313
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:01,440
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion for approval, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call.

314
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,821
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Ruseau.

315
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:07,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I am perfectly fine, but if that means we're here when the sun comes up, I'll hold you to it.

316
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:07,684
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

317
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

318
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:08,845
[SPEAKER_47]: No problem.

319
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,848
[SPEAKER_47]: roll call please.

320
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:12,830
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Graham.

321
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:14,171
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

322
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:15,453
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry.

323
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:16,454
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kreatz.

324
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:16,854
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

325
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,056
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin.

326
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:18,276
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

327
00:35:18,336 --> 00:35:19,017
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Mustone.

328
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:19,257
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

329
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:20,219
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Ruseau.

330
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:20,499
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

331
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:21,680
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Vanden Heuvel.

332
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,961
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

333
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,842
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Longo Kern.

334
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:23,102
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

335
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,704
[SPEAKER_47]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

336
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,446
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion passes.

337
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:27,668
[SPEAKER_47]: Dr. Cushing.

338
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:29,858
[SPEAKER_18]: school committee.

339
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:47,563
[SPEAKER_18]: A few weeks ago I received an email from one of our seventh grade teachers at the McGlynn Middle School making me aware of the projects that our students in the Global Scholars Program had been working on and I felt that it's very important that we bring these students forward to you as representatives to their students.

340
00:35:47,723 --> 00:35:51,524
[SPEAKER_18]: I also think that it's really great that we have such a large audience tonight

341
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:55,095
[SPEAKER_18]: for all of Medford to see the great things that our students are doing.

342
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:03,299
[SPEAKER_18]: As we mentioned last week at the strategic plan, everything has a focus on student learning and improving student outcomes.

343
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:14,684
[SPEAKER_18]: So this evening, I wanna turn it over, they're on Zoom, so turn your attention to monitors, but I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Villard, Mr. McCarthy, and the three students that they will introduce.

344
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:19,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, and take it away, Mr. Villard, Mr. McCarthy, and our students.

345
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:27,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Dr. Cushing, and thank you school committee for your time and your attention.

346
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,545
[SPEAKER_00]: As Dr. Cushing said, this presentation, the letter that the students will read is the culmination of

347
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_00]: a global scholars program that all seventh graders complete.

348
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:56,150
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our sixth year running the program, and it always ends in the spring with a community action project, where the students are asked to design and complete a project that will improve their community in some way, and they generally have an environmental focus.

349
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:05,946
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we had trash pickup groups, we had folks working with recycling in our cafeteria.

350
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:21,572
[SPEAKER_00]: We have projects across the spectrum, but I had one particularly ambitious group who would like to make a request of the city after learning about climate crisis and learning about different ways that we can be involved as a city.

351
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:25,314
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve our response to that.

352
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank everyone for your time.

353
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:34,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And without further ado, I'd like to give it away to Kevin, Pedro, and Leila, who are here to read the letter.

354
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:45,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are supported by at least a dozen of my students who are also here just in support of this project, whether they were a part of this particular one or not.

355
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:46,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin, please go ahead.

356
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,200
[SPEAKER_56]: Medford school committee members.

357
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:58,446
[SPEAKER_56]: We are a group of seventh grade students at the McGlynn Middle School and we want to take action for the climate crisis.

358
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:07,650
[SPEAKER_01]: The climate crisis is a global issue that is causing changes in temperatures, climates all over the globe.

359
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And these changes are damaging ecosystems and affecting lives everywhere.

360
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:21,700
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why we are here tonight asking you to take one step that will help to mitigate its harmful effects.

361
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,725
[SPEAKER_01]: The climate crisis is being caused by human activities like deforestation and burning fossil fuels.

362
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:38,430
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes our unsustainable transportation methods in order to reduce the problems that it's causing.

363
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:43,733
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to quickly work to enact all the solutions we can.

364
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:51,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Our class decided to come up with an action that we think is most suitable and effective.

365
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:57,901
[SPEAKER_12]: One helpful action we ask you to take is adding more public electric car chargers throughout the city.

366
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,222
[SPEAKER_12]: This makes car

367
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,463
[SPEAKER_12]: electric cars easier to own.

368
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:07,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Electric cars have been considered as a good idea before and now they are being encouraged more than ever.

369
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:14,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Recently, major car companies like Ford have announced that they are planning on selling more electric cars.

370
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:24,044
[SPEAKER_12]: This could have a significant impact on the amount of gasoline cars that are being sold and the cost as well as reducing the gas emissions in the environment.

371
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:32,495
[SPEAKER_56]: By having more charging stations available to everyone, more people will be willing to buy electric cars.

372
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:40,558
[SPEAKER_56]: We would like to have electric car charging stations added at all of the elementary schools, middle schools, and at Hormel Stadium.

373
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:47,440
[SPEAKER_56]: We think this is the right choice because it would help make transportation in this area much more sustainable.

374
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:56,564
[SPEAKER_56]: Electric car charging stations need to be spread around strategically since the amount of miles you can travel with one charge can be more limited than with gasoline cars.

375
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:02,829
[SPEAKER_56]: Owning and charging electric vehicles is more convenient when electric car chargers are more available.

376
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:10,534
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Massachusetts is aiming to make electric car stations widely available.

377
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:23,989
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Massachusetts will fund up 100% of the cost up to $50,000 for each address for the hardware and installation of government owned electric car stations.

378
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:31,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that they have to be on public property and accessible to the public.

379
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:38,134
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they can be available at school lots and hormonal because they meet that requirement.

380
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,789
[SPEAKER_12]: The climate crisis is happening right now and continuing to the future.

381
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:50,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless we unite and enact solutions immediately, we won't be able to have a safe environment.

382
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:58,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Electric cars are one of the many solutions for climate crisis that we need to promote inside our Medford community.

383
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,223
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the best ways to make this solution more effective is to spread

384
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:05,685
[SPEAKER_12]: EV stations throughout the city of Medford.

385
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:08,086
[SPEAKER_12]: That includes putting them in schools.

386
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:15,030
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be easier to achieve than it looks because the state of Massachusetts pays for 100% of the cost for EV stations.

387
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:18,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for listening and we hope that you consider our request.

388
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:32,477
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Ruseau.

389
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:33,478
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

390
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:34,839
[SPEAKER_05]: This was an excellent presentation.

391
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I was completely shocked that the state of Massachusetts won't pay for 100%.

392
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:42,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't usually get a lot of things that don't cost us anything coming before us.

393
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:50,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I drive an electric car, and the challenges around charging are very real.

394
00:41:50,232 --> 00:41:51,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have off-street parking.

395
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:52,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a home charger.

396
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a real problem.

397
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We certainly don't want electric car uptake to only be for people who have off-street parking

398
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,348
[SPEAKER_05]: garages.

399
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:05,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not describe most of the residents of Medford, so I'm very excited by this.

400
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a question around authority.

401
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:18,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we simply make a vote to say we want one installed at every parking lot that we have authority over, whereas the city, I don't actually know legally what's involved.

402
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:21,158
[SPEAKER_47]: I have an update from Ms.

403
00:42:21,198 --> 00:42:22,179
[SPEAKER_47]: Hunt, but please speak.

404
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,719
[SPEAKER_43]: You might be answering it.

405
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,322
[SPEAKER_43]: Just about Hormel, I thought the Hormel Commission wouldn't be under our purview.

406
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:33,037
[SPEAKER_47]: No, that will be under Hormel Commission, but that's the next location they're looking for.

407
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:35,738
[SPEAKER_47]: They're looking to do Hormel Stadium.

408
00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:38,599
[SPEAKER_47]: We are, we do have charging stations at the VOC.

409
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:39,679
[SPEAKER_47]: And Ms.

410
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:46,681
[SPEAKER_47]: Hunt, who is the new Development Planning and Sustainability Director, is interested in looking into putting it into the schools.

411
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:50,562
[SPEAKER_47]: She'd like to know what percentage of teachers and parents would use them.

412
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:57,392
[SPEAKER_47]: and wants to assess the parking situations at some of the schools, but she's happy to, she wants to put them all over the city.

413
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:58,773
[SPEAKER_47]: So she's happy to look into this.

414
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:04,076
[SPEAKER_47]: I let her know the seventh graders would be, scholar program would be presenting to us tonight.

415
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:10,399
[SPEAKER_47]: And she is excited to learn more and look into seeing where else we can have them, including our schools.

416
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,602
[SPEAKER_47]: So maybe we can send a motion to member Rousseau.

417
00:43:14,782 --> 00:43:15,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

418
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:19,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion to, well, first of all, it would be helpful to,

419
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:28,851
[SPEAKER_05]: we get an email or something about whether or not this program expires, if there is an expiration date, what it is, because I think that would affect the urgency with which we want to take advantage of it.

420
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:35,816
[SPEAKER_05]: If it doesn't expire over the summer or something, then I think a little bit more planning makes sense.

421
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:44,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would certainly make a motion to have at least one electric car charger installed at every single public school building parking area.

422
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can assess whether that's enough, but, you know,

423
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:55,512
[SPEAKER_05]: teachers and staff that are considering buying a new vehicle, charging at work is where I always charged.

424
00:43:56,152 --> 00:44:01,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when the pandemic hit and I couldn't go to work, it was a real problem, but our teachers are still coming to work.

425
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that taking that out of the equation for them when they decide whether to buy a new vehicle is really critical.

426
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:17,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would make a motion that we install one per building within the confines of the

427
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the law or whatever that's reimbursed.

428
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,283
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion for... Member Van der Kloot?

429
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:25,843
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes.

430
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:37,270
[SPEAKER_44]: The only thing is, I wondered whether we should specify one, because if there's one or more, or because sometimes if you're putting in one, putting in a second one might not be that.

431
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,392
[SPEAKER_44]: So I don't want to limit it.

432
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:41,413
[SPEAKER_47]: One has two charging courts.

433
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:43,094
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, so it charged two cars.

434
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:47,449
[SPEAKER_47]: I just started parking is limited in some of the schools.

435
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:49,429
[SPEAKER_47]: So we'll have them assess the legal motion.

436
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,990
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by member Van de Kloet.

437
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:53,751

[SPEAKER_47]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:10,036
[SPEAKER_47]: That was an amazing presentation.

455
00:45:10,656 --> 00:45:11,316
[SPEAKER_42]: Very proud of you.

456
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:31,901
[SPEAKER_47]: Before I call the next item, I just wanna let any speaker that would like to speak know just to make your name and address for the record.

457
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:39,286
[SPEAKER_47]: If you would like to participate through Zoom, we ask that you use the raised hand function.

458
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:46,030
[SPEAKER_47]: Dr. Edward Vincent will be on the laptop to see who wants to participate in Zoom.

459
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,213
[SPEAKER_47]: If you're present, you can just form a line like you would do at any city council meeting.

460
00:45:51,274 --> 00:46:00,744
[SPEAKER_47]: We also have 27 emails that have come through that are going to be summarized and read into the record as best as possible through summary.

461
00:46:01,565 --> 00:46:08,732
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to take probably three people present, and then we'll go to Zoom, and then I'll turn it over to you, Ms.

462
00:46:08,952 --> 00:46:10,874
[SPEAKER_47]: Finch-Klute, and we'll just take it in order.

00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,616
[SPEAKER_47]: And that's obviously after the presentation.

464
00:46:14,882 --> 00:46:18,625
[SPEAKER_47]: Each member can speak on this one time for for up to three minutes.

465
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:21,346
[SPEAKER_47]: We have miss evangelista who's here keeping time.

466
00:46:21,366 --> 00:46:27,510
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to keep to that because 27 plus online plus here we we have several hours ahead of us.

467
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,053
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm sure I'm asking everybody to just please be respectful.

468
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,215
[SPEAKER_47]: No name calling no swearing.

469
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:39,918
[SPEAKER_47]: If that happens, I'm going to have to just shut the microphone off where I'm going to really try to be respectful.

470
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:40,599
[SPEAKER_47]: We have three

471
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:45,836
[SPEAKER_47]: amazing options to rename the Columbus school and we hope to get that job done tonight.

[SPEAKER_47]: Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

475
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just also, I think it'd be good to also remind that lots of children are watching, especially the Columbus students.

476
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:58,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're, they're all glued to their TVs, I think.

477
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:00,049
[SPEAKER_47]: There may be students watching.

478
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:00,309
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

479
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:01,430
[SPEAKER_47]: So yeah, please.

480
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,031

[SPEAKER_47]: Member McLaughlin.

00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:04,213
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm all set.

00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:04,493
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

484
00:47:06,161 --> 00:47:17,330
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, this is number nine under old business presentation by the advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School followed by a vote by school committee members to select the new name.

485
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,912
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm gonna turn it over to our chair, Mr. Jim Lister.

486
00:47:19,932 --> 00:47:22,234
[SPEAKER_47]: Here we go.

487
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:28,059
[SPEAKER_48]: It will turn.

488
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:43,677
[SPEAKER_47]: And I think before you start, a thank you needs to go out to you, Mr. Lister, as well as the 20 plus advisory committee members that have spent countless hours crammed over the last month, month and a half and all your hard work.

489
00:47:43,717 --> 00:47:45,118
[SPEAKER_47]: So we really appreciate that.

490
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:45,718
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

491
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:50,942
[SPEAKER_49]: All right.

[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you, superintendent, school committee members.

[SPEAKER_49]: We've chosen Ron Giovino to do our MC tonight for our presentation.

496
00:47:59,188 --> 00:47:59,528
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay.

497
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:10,324
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Givino, thank you.

498
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:11,785
[SPEAKER_47]: Just name and address for the record.

499
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,667
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll start off right now.

500
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:17,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Ron Givino, 326 East Porter Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

501
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:23,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor, Superintendent, members of the school committee, good evening.

502
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:26,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for giving us this opportunity to present tonight.

503
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:38,447
[SPEAKER_10]: On behalf of the Columbus Elementary School Renaming Advisory Committee, I would like to introduce the advisory board members who are either here in the hall tonight or watching us on Zoom.

504
00:48:40,111 --> 00:49:08,479
[SPEAKER_10]: You've already met our chairman, Jim Lister, Dr. Kathleen Kay, Columbus School Principal, three brothers, Dr. Grace Paldara, Paul Donato Jr., Josie Dupor, Beth Fuller, Janelle Golan McKenzie, Erin Genia, Matthew Havistar, Seth Hill, Lou Intapa, Leroy LaFleur, Kenneth Mallon,

505
00:49:09,804 --> 00:49:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Patrick McCabe, Melissa Miguel, Danielle Puccio, Maria Rocha, Laura Rotola, Kristen Scalise, and Kathleen Shaughnessy.

506
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:35,263
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here to present to you the work we have accomplished over the past six weeks and the final names that we are recommending for the renaming of Christopher Columbus School.

507
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:38,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Our agenda tonight,

508
00:49:41,135 --> 00:49:58,052
[SPEAKER_10]: is our mission statement, some background information, our process, which will include receiving and review, how we received and reviewed public submissions, scoring rubric, public participation, discussion, final selection, and our three recommendations.

509
00:49:59,674 --> 00:50:02,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to turn the mic over to our chairman, Jim Lister.

510
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:20,139
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, our mission and goal, the advisory committee was charged with the task of choosing up to three possible names for consideration as the new name of the Columbus Elementary School.

511
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:37,025
[SPEAKER_49]: The process included vetting names submitted by consideration by the community, soliciting feedback from the community, as well as Columbus teachers and students and weighing the relative strength of submissions against criteria we developed.

512
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:38,926
[SPEAKER_49]: The criteria included,

513
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:51,788
[SPEAKER_49]: potential for the name to bring the community together, the potential for the name to stand as a role model for the Medford students, and the potential for the name to represent the Medford community's proud history.

514
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:58,411
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, the next slide is gonna be done by Maria Rocha.

515
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:04,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my name is Maria Rocha, 3620 Mystic Valley Parkway.

516
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So some background.

517
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: During the June 15th, 2020 school committee meeting, school committee members voted six to one to rename the Christopher Columbus school by July 1st, 2021.

518
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:34,249
[SPEAKER_07]: On March 10th, 2021, the school committee voted to create the 23 member advisory committee with the previously mentioned mission and goal of choosing three names up to three names, meeting the explicit criteria as outlined in the charter.

519
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:42,484
[SPEAKER_07]: On March 16th, the applications for the advisory committee as well as a suggestion form for the new names were opened for the public.

520
00:51:43,144 --> 00:51:50,285
[SPEAKER_07]: The application was open for one month and on April 16th, 2021 at 5 p.m., both forms were closed.

521
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:57,047
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 days later on April 26th, the advisory committee was officially formed and the 23 members were named.

522
00:51:57,627 --> 00:52:00,067
[SPEAKER_07]: The committee met six times between May 4th and June 8th, 2021.

523
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide, please.

524
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:19,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So the original community suggestions form that was open from March 16 to April 16 the committee reviewed the community survey and created a list of 66 unique name submissions for the advisory committee to review.

525
00:52:20,822 --> 00:52:29,629
[SPEAKER_07]: As outlined in our charter, the advisory committee was to vet these 66 names as candidates for renaming the school and could not consider names outside of these submissions.

526
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:42,898
[SPEAKER_07]: On May 4th, the advisory committee adopted a resolution put forth by Dr. Grace Caldera, outlining the process to research all the names and reduce the list down from the original list of suggested names.

527
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:50,304
[SPEAKER_07]: The first reduction of the list was to remove all current living suggestions and suggestions made in bad faith

528
00:52:50,987 --> 00:52:58,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the remaining names were randomly assigned to five committee members to evaluate and score the names based on the following rubrics.

529
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And our next presenter will be Dr. Grace Caldera.

530
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:07,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, Dr. Grace Caldera, 33 Governors Avenue, Medford.

531
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:16,515
[SPEAKER_44]: So this is our rubric, and it was used by our committee to evaluate the names of the submissions.

532
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,996
[SPEAKER_44]: The rubric outlined three different criteria.

533
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:35,449
[SPEAKER_44]: the potential for the name to bring the community together, two, the potential for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and three, the potential for the name to represent Medford community's proud history.

534
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:48,575
[SPEAKER_44]: Each one of the criteria had a scoring range from one to four, four being the highest a name could receive in any category, and one being the lowest score that a name should have received.

535
00:53:49,585 --> 00:54:15,439
[SPEAKER_44]: Thus, the top score of any one suggestion that they could receive is a 12, and any name with a 12 would be significant to multiple historically marginalized groups and not polarizing, known for exceptional deeds, community involvement, or contribution to society with a historical notable legacy that would last decades, or if it wasn't a person, it would still have historical significance that would last decades.

536
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,680
[SPEAKER_44]: And lastly, if it was a person,

537
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:28,824
[SPEAKER_44]: They would have lived in Medford with a Medford specific reputation, or if it was not a person, it would have a long standing ties to Medford with a positive history.

538
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:31,746
[SPEAKER_36]: Next slide.

539
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:34,687
[SPEAKER_44]: Our public participation process.

540
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:42,508
[SPEAKER_44]: After all of the names were scored, the top scoring 15 names were to move on with the public participation.

541
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:47,193
[SPEAKER_44]: However, due to a tie, we ended up with a top 17 names to move forward.

542
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:52,619
[SPEAKER_44]: And then after looking at the list, we realized we had accidentally removed a name that should have been considered.

543
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:58,745
[SPEAKER_44]: So we therefore added that name on to continue with the process, leaving us with 18 names to present to the public.

544
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:11,947
[SPEAKER_44]: On May 11th, the committee adopted and formalized a process of how we should receive public input on those 18 names as outlined in a resolution brought forward by Heinrich Ginnies.

545
00:55:12,428 --> 00:55:15,851
[SPEAKER_44]: And a subcommittee was established to create the public input form.

546
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:22,858
[SPEAKER_44]: And the survey was open for one week to collect written responses for or against any of the 18 names.

547
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:28,750
[SPEAKER_44]: The survey itself was translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Portuguese.

548
00:55:29,271 --> 00:55:34,194
[SPEAKER_44]: There were hard copies also made available at Medford City Hall and the superintendent's office.

549
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:42,199
[SPEAKER_44]: And overall, the committee received over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper submissions.

550
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:52,146
[SPEAKER_44]: The top 18 names were also independently researched and rescored by each of the committee members.

551
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:59,054
[SPEAKER_44]: via the process previously described by the rubric, all 23 members of the advisory committee did this.

552
00:56:00,055 --> 00:56:05,802
[SPEAKER_44]: The scores were then collected, averaged, and ranked as one point for the committee members to consider.

553
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:11,549
[SPEAKER_44]: The committee then moved forward to reduce the finalists down to the

554
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:28,306
[SPEAKER_44]: Using an adopted process as outlined and brought forth by Patrick McCabe, the committee started with a list of names in alphabetical order, and if a committee member had stated that that name was their top three, that name would remain in consideration.

555
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:34,931
[SPEAKER_44]: If no one on the committee said they would include that name in their top three, that name was stricken from the list.

556
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,193
[SPEAKER_44]: This reduced the official list down from 18 to 13 names,

557
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:52,072
[SPEAKER_44]: And next, every committee member was given up to three minutes to advocate for which nominee or nominees they thought should be sent forward to the school committee based on their own research, the rubric and public input.

558
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:58,674
[SPEAKER_44]: Each committee member voted for one of the nominees.

559
00:56:59,094 --> 00:57:03,735
[SPEAKER_44]: And after the first round of votes were recorded, only three of the candidates had received a vote.

560
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:06,236
[SPEAKER_44]: And a motion put forth by Paul Donato Jr.

561
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:11,155
[SPEAKER_44]: was made that we should just accept those three and send them forth.

562
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:18,178
[SPEAKER_44]: And that was adopted and the three names that received votes were on the board.

563
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:28,581
[SPEAKER_44]: And so our first few names that, these three names were Misituk, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton.

564
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:33,643
[SPEAKER_44]: The first of the three names here for you tonight is Misituk.

565
00:57:34,939 --> 00:57:42,701
[SPEAKER_44]: The land that the city of Medford sits on was inhabited by the Massachusetts tribe and other Native Americans for thousands of years.

566
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:48,702
[SPEAKER_44]: The indigenous people that lived on the land called the river Mistituck, which means Great Tidal River.

567
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:57,724
[SPEAKER_44]: As English colonists came to the area, the name of the river was altered in a more familiar English word, Mystic.

568
00:57:58,663 --> 00:58:09,907
[SPEAKER_44]: The river has been very important throughout the history of Medford, and it was used for fishing and for water by the indigenous tribe, and then by the colonists, and it also became essential for trade.

569
00:58:11,428 --> 00:58:16,850
[SPEAKER_44]: It became a subject of poems, such as, Over the River and Through the Wood, and Paul Revere's Ride.

570
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:22,392
[SPEAKER_44]: This river has been a source of community pride for centuries.

571
00:58:25,254 --> 00:58:26,134
[SPEAKER_44]: The Missituck River,

572
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,329
[SPEAKER_44]: as previously mentioned, has been bringing people together.

573
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:34,332
[SPEAKER_44]: It was a source of the food and water for indigenous tribes and the first colonists.

574
00:58:34,832 --> 00:58:42,958
[SPEAKER_44]: It then became a place that allowed Medford to take part in trade industry, being a port and preparing goods to ship out and even building ships.

575
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:47,401
[SPEAKER_44]: The city of Medford grew because of the Mistook River.

576
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:54,866
[SPEAKER_44]: And today, the river is used for walking, hiking, boating, fishing, and other various community events.

577
00:58:56,032 --> 00:59:00,935
[SPEAKER_44]: There is a widespread effort underway to continue to work to restore the river and the land surrounding it.

578
00:59:01,796 --> 00:59:14,825
[SPEAKER_44]: And by using the Native American name, Misutuk, we are taking time to honor those who had originally inhabited these lands and taking a step to acknowledge the past and as we do this, stepping into the future.

579
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:23,771
[SPEAKER_44]: These are just three responses that we received from the community input survey.

580
00:59:24,704 --> 00:59:26,825
[SPEAKER_44]: There were so many wonderful responses.

581
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:40,632
[SPEAKER_44]: And even though that this was not a vote, all of these responses were used and considered and provided the committee wonderful information into getting us to these final three names.

582
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:52,658
[SPEAKER_44]: These three quotes here really exemplified why Missittook is a positive influence, not only for the city and for the students of the school,

583
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:55,950
[SPEAKER_44]: but also for the rest of the children in the community.

584
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:06,135
[SPEAKER_44]: Some of the feedback expressed that it was a reflection of the river and how the river has been a focal point for our community for centuries.

585
01:00:06,816 --> 01:00:12,839
[SPEAKER_44]: People also shared that it acknowledged the native people for who originally inhabited this land.

586
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:17,781
[SPEAKER_44]: And it also provided a physical connection between our past and our present.

587
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:22,764
[SPEAKER_44]: It was also shared that people liked it because it wasn't a single person.

588
01:00:23,561 --> 01:00:29,566
[SPEAKER_44]: but rather it celebrated a shared space and an aspect of a physical environment.

589
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:35,931
[SPEAKER_44]: And lastly, Missittook represents Medford's proud history.

590
01:00:36,751 --> 01:00:43,196
[SPEAKER_44]: As previously mentioned, the Missittook has been here long before Medford has even existed.

591
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:51,703
[SPEAKER_44]: The Missittook watershed was home to the indigenous people of Massachusetts prior to colonization of the area by the Europeans.

592
01:00:52,554 --> 01:01:05,342
[SPEAKER_44]: The name may have morphed into Mystic, but it does not diminish the role or the value of the Missitook River and what it has played in building Medford by providing resources of not only food, but also trade.

593
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:12,587
[SPEAKER_44]: The river powered tide mills that allowed for the process of corn, tobacco, textiles, and wood.

594
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:20,372
[SPEAKER_44]: It was the home of the first bridge over the river, allowing the city to play a key part in the founding of this nation.

595
01:01:21,653 --> 01:01:25,376
[SPEAKER_44]: The river is also the subject of well-known poems and stories.

596
01:01:26,297 --> 01:01:36,705
[SPEAKER_44]: And while the river may now be known as Mystic, the name Mistituk gives nod to those who came before us, honoring them and acknowledging their language and homelands.

597
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:41,389
[SPEAKER_44]: It's a reminder that Medford's history didn't start when the Europeans came here.

598
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:44,431
[SPEAKER_44]: It began long before the first boats arrived.

599
01:01:56,015 --> 01:02:09,418
[SPEAKER_10]: The next name that the committee is presenting to the school committee is Jean Barry Sutherland, a beloved educator, community leader, and principal for the very elementary school we are process of renaming.

600
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:14,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean was actively involved in Medford for over 30 years.

601
01:02:15,939 --> 01:02:22,080
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1969, she became a teacher at the Gleason Elementary and then moved on to teach at the Waite Elementary School in 1970.

602
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,381
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a teacher at the Waite Elementary for 11 years

603
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:34,287
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1981, she went on to teach at Dame Elementary, where she later became assistant principal and then principal in 1998.

604
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:45,917
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2003, when the new Columbus Elementary School on Hicks Ave opened, she became the very first principal for the next three years until she retired in 2006.

605
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:54,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Throughout her lifetime, she was an active member of the community and was involved in a number of community efforts

606
01:02:55,290 --> 01:03:02,215
[SPEAKER_10]: including, but not limited to, the Thursday night, fortnightly Club of Medford, the Women's Club of Medford.

607
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:11,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean was vice president of Medford Health Matter, as instrumental in gaining many grants for the city to combat underage smoking, drinking, substance abuse.

608
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:19,087
[SPEAKER_10]: She was involved with the annual Santa Polar Express and the Medford Jingle Bells Festival.

609
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:24,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean also represented Medford at a cultural exchange

610
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:27,709
[SPEAKER_10]: with our sister city, Novioka, Japan.

611
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:35,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean had a kind heart and would go the extra mile for her students.

612
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:40,039
[SPEAKER_10]: She greeted them and their parents with a hug or a handshake.

613
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,507
[SPEAKER_10]: She went above and beyond her typical classroom duties and even spent time over the summer to help paint and maintain each of her schools.

614
01:03:51,709 --> 01:03:53,290
[SPEAKER_10]: She was an active member of the community

615
01:03:54,315 --> 01:04:10,348
[SPEAKER_10]: working to make Medford a better place through her numerous community efforts, like anti-smoking campaigns, interest in creating dog parks, reading stories on the Polar Express to help raise money for Hallmark Health, and working on improving elder services.

616
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:17,273
[SPEAKER_10]: One example of what Jean worked on was a $5,000 grant to Medford for work against underage smoking.

617
01:04:17,894 --> 01:04:21,717
[SPEAKER_10]: She also fought to shut down a convenience store on Salem Street for three weeks

618
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:24,602
[SPEAKER_10]: due to their sales of cigarettes to minors.

619
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:35,748
[SPEAKER_10]: She would also often encounter students who had ridden their bikes to her house just to say hi or even stay for a longer visit.

620
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:44,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean brought the community together as a loving wife, daughter, neighbor, teacher, and community leader.

621
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:51,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Barry Sutherland was a passionate advocate for special education and the needs of the Medford children

622
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:53,144
[SPEAKER_10]: and their families.

623
01:04:59,388 --> 01:05:05,512
[SPEAKER_10]: The testimony of the community played an important role in choosing all three finalists.

624
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean received great feedback and wonderful responses.

625
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:13,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Picking just a few to highlight was very difficult.

626
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:17,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I will not read from the small sample up on the screen.

627
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:22,063
[SPEAKER_10]: The feedback for Jean included, but was not limited to,

628
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,349
[SPEAKER_10]: many of the people Jean passed in her path through life.

629
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:40,358
[SPEAKER_10]: For those who feared going to school for the first time, to the student who feared just being in this country for the first time, who writes how Jean made a huge difference in his transition to America.

630
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:49,364
[SPEAKER_10]: There were submissions from many students who wrote that Jean played a role in their decision to become teachers.

631
01:05:50,065 --> 01:05:53,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the firefighter who credits Jean with helping him become

632
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,001
[SPEAKER_10]: the man he is today.

633
01:05:57,624 --> 01:06:06,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Many students wrote about the difference Jean made during trying times in their home lives, or how Jean helped them overcome their personal challenges.

634
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:13,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, the many responses from Jean's colleagues who talked about her leadership and guidance.

635
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:19,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Barry Sutherland was undeniably a positive role model for Medford.

636
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:30,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Barry Sutherland will always be associated with the soon to be renamed elementary school on Hicks Ave.

637
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:43,355
[SPEAKER_10]: She was the first principal of that building, and because of that, she shaped the culture of the school, not only for the kids, but for the teachers in that building that can still feel it today.

638
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:52,402
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a wonderful educator who helped serve the community in her fight against underage smoking, drinking, substance abuse.

639
01:06:53,720 --> 01:07:02,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean will also be remembered for her involvement in the summer food program in Medford, which brought proper lunches to those in need up to the age of 18.

640
01:07:04,568 --> 01:07:07,391
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a powerful advocate for special education.

641
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:13,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean welcomed children in citywide special education programs to her school.

642
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:16,097
[SPEAKER_10]: She knew their IEPs.

643
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:18,839
[SPEAKER_10]: She often attended IEP meetings.

644
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,961
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, she attended the weekly

645
01:07:21,536 --> 01:07:23,698
[SPEAKER_10]: meetings with the special ed consultants.

646
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean was an inspirational leader who led by example, action, and consensus building.

647
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:48,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Having the name of Jean Barry Sutherland on the school will give the children of Medford an example of someone who not only helped make a big difference in Medford, she did it right from the corridors of the very school we are to rename tonight.

648
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:07,433
[SPEAKER_51]: Next.

649
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:09,214
[SPEAKER_51]: Next will be Maria Rocha.

650
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:19,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Belinda Sutton was born in 1713 in Western Africa, what is now known today as Ghana.

651
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:28,069
[SPEAKER_07]: At 12 years old, she was kidnapped, survived the horrific Middle Passage, and was brought to the Americas to be sold into slavery.

652
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:36,660
[SPEAKER_07]: She was enslaved by Isaac Royal and his family for roughly 50 years, first in Antigua, then at his estate in Medford.

653
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: While there are no portraits or pictures of Belinda Sutton, the picture on the slide from the Royal House is a conception of her working in the Royal House.

654
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1781, when Isaac Royal Jr.

655
01:08:51,028 --> 01:08:54,290
[SPEAKER_07]: died, Belinda was offered her freedom and she took it.

656
01:08:55,586 --> 01:09:01,772
[SPEAKER_07]: As a free woman, she was to receive 30 pounds so as not to become a ward or burden of Medford.

657
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:11,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Due to the fact that she was enslaved, Belinda never learned to read or write, but she knew that she had a right to be paid what she was promised.

658
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:17,306
[SPEAKER_07]: She petitioned the state a total of five times to get what she was owed.

659
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:28,109
[SPEAKER_07]: As the Ghana Museum stated, Belinda Sutton's eloquent petition of 1783 is among the earliest narratives by an African American woman.

660
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It has inspired poets and fascinated histories.

661
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:38,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been seen by some commentators as the first call for reparations for American slavery.

662
01:09:39,918 --> 01:09:45,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And it opens a rare window onto the life of an enslaved woman in colonial North America.

663
01:09:46,463 --> 01:09:46,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

664
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:56,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Belinda Sutton brings the community together as a Black formerly enslaved woman who was forced into Medford, not of her free will.

665
01:09:57,622 --> 01:10:01,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, as a free woman, she chose to stay in the area.

666
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:09,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Despite the horrific experiences she faced while being enslaved, she ultimately chose to make the Medford area her home.

667
01:10:11,562 --> 01:10:24,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Using this name for the school on Hicks Ave acknowledges Medford's role in a horrific time in American history, but does so while celebrating a bold, brave, and inspiring woman.

668
01:10:25,532 --> 01:10:30,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And she can undoubtedly serve as a positive role model for all of Medford.

669
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:41,442
[SPEAKER_07]: These two responses were taken from the numerous public input survey responses written in support of Belinda Sutton.

670
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:49,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And they truly exemplify why she is a role model, not only for the students at the school, but for all children in this community.

671
01:10:50,669 --> 01:11:00,997
[SPEAKER_07]: These comments reflected on how she was able to accomplish these incredible feats after being denied the privilege of education, personhood, and independence for so long.

672
01:11:02,538 --> 01:11:03,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Naming a school after her

673
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,545
[SPEAKER_07]: will remind students how powerful the education that they receive in the building is.

674
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:17,932
[SPEAKER_07]: The quotes also discuss how notable her 1783 petition was and how it was such a courageous act.

675
01:11:19,093 --> 01:11:31,044
[SPEAKER_07]: A few other public comments not listed here mentioned how proud they would be to tell her story to their children and how they are inspired by her actions to address the injustice that she was facing.

676
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:38,399
[SPEAKER_07]: She is an inspiration to people of any race, sex, or religion to keep fighting for what you believe in.

677
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:50,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Belinda Sutton represents the Medford community's proud history, in spite of the fact that the circumstances under which she was brought here were not.

678
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:57,486
[SPEAKER_07]: She was enslaved on the Royal Family Estate, which was previously known as the Ten Hill Farms.

679
01:11:58,086 --> 01:12:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And this estate covered 500 acres in Medford.

680
01:12:02,381 --> 01:12:10,623
[SPEAKER_07]: As previously mentioned, her children were both baptized at a church in Medford, and those records are the earliest documents we have of her.

681
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:23,526
[SPEAKER_07]: As the Royal House has stated, Belinda Sutton is the best known resident of the Royal Estate, and while we know more about her than others who were enslaved, we still know very little.

682
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:32,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of what we know comes from her brave petition to the Massachusetts General Court, where she gave her public statement.

683
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:45,952
[SPEAKER_07]: This petition is historically notable worldwide and is an extremely rare document that is forever linked to the city of Medford as a sign of courage and bravery that is an inspiration for anyone.

684
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:59,293
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a model of courage, perseverance, and is a symbol of the freedom and equality that we as a community and all the children at the schools strive to reach every day.

685
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,123
[SPEAKER_10]: As we close, we'd love to thank the members of the public

686
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,381
[SPEAKER_10]: for all their wonderful suggestions and responses to the public input.

687
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:24,703
[SPEAKER_10]: We also wish to thank you, the school committee, for your time.

688
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:33,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to thank Lisa and Susan for the, couldn't be the easiest customers you've ever had, but I'll risk it.

689
01:13:34,468 --> 01:13:35,789
[SPEAKER_10]: That concludes our presentation.

690
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:38,991
[SPEAKER_10]: We're happy to answer any questions that the school committee may.

691
01:13:39,411 --> 01:13:40,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

692
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:44,474
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much, Mr. Giovino.

693
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:46,982
[SPEAKER_47]: and all the presented.

694
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:49,884
[SPEAKER_47]: Are there any questions or should we open up to public comment?

695
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:51,685
[SPEAKER_47]: Member McLaughlin.

696
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:52,846
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

697
01:13:53,086 --> 01:13:57,370
[SPEAKER_46]: I want to thank the members of the Columbus Renaming Committee for the excellent presentation.

698
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:05,796
[SPEAKER_46]: Three fascinating and incredibly wonderful choices, and it's a great position to be in to be able to have three choices to choose from.

699
01:14:06,837 --> 01:14:15,904
[SPEAKER_46]: I did want to note that the beginning of the presentation, I believe it says that the vote to rename the Columbus School was six to one, and if I'm not mistaking, I think it was unanimous.

700
01:14:16,658 --> 01:14:17,338
[SPEAKER_42]: seven to zero.

701
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,560
[SPEAKER_46]: It was not it was six to one.

702
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:21,841
[SPEAKER_46]: So my mistake.

703
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:22,281
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

704
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:24,202
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you for the presentation.

705
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,546
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Kloot, would you like to start us off with three emails?

706
01:14:32,906 --> 01:14:34,447
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, yeah.

707
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:35,027
[SPEAKER_47]: Sorry.

708
01:14:35,188 --> 01:14:35,828
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

709
01:14:36,008 --> 01:14:36,888
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

710
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:42,571
[SPEAKER_33]: I wanted to thank personally thank the advisory committee for all their hard work in volunteerism.

711
01:14:43,552 --> 01:14:45,873
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, you spend, you know, hours just

712
01:14:46,246 --> 01:14:49,807
[SPEAKER_33]: sorting through all the information and we really appreciate everything you did.

713
01:14:50,907 --> 01:14:53,888
[SPEAKER_33]: I do have a question or just something I wanted to share.

714
01:14:53,908 --> 01:15:08,813
[SPEAKER_33]: I was, over the weekend, somebody shared with me that one of the names is Mr. Duck, and I guess there's a proposed bill that is, you know, coming out where the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education

715
01:15:09,894 --> 01:15:27,624
[SPEAKER_33]: is going to promulgate regulations to ensure that no public school uses athletic name, logo, or mascot, which names refer to or associated with Native Americans, including Native American cultures and specific Native American tribes.

716
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:38,671
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not sure where this bill is right now, but I just wanted to mention it where if this is gonna be coming a regulation,

717
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:48,458
[SPEAKER_33]: that you know possibly in the near future if we were to choose a name like that we might have to have another renaming committee in the future.

718
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:50,738
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just wanted to share that.

719
01:15:51,538 --> 01:15:55,319
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you member Kratz.

720
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:02,201
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, so at the present the 27 letters have ballooned over 40.

721
01:16:03,202 --> 01:16:08,123
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm going to I'm going to condense them where appropriate.

722
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:16,358
[SPEAKER_44]: first from, and I'm starting from the ones that, the first one that came in was from Carrie Parker of 6 Hurlcross Ave.

723
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:23,180
[SPEAKER_44]: She said, I am writing to you because I want to support the renaming of the Columbus Elementary School at tonight's school committee meeting.

724
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:31,643
[SPEAKER_44]: The school committee set up a transparent process carefully naming the committee, and the committee did extensive work to identify three possible names that reflect Medford.

725
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:34,304
[SPEAKER_44]: They are inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.

726
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:36,245
[SPEAKER_44]: I am proud that Medford is taking a step forward.

727
01:16:36,636 --> 01:16:38,717
[SPEAKER_44]: and look forward to seeing the committee's work completed.

728
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:40,678
[SPEAKER_44]: That's Carrie Parker, 6 Earlcroft.

729
01:16:41,258 --> 01:16:47,361
[SPEAKER_44]: The next one is April Evans of 46 Brewster, April Evans and David Douglas.

730
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:51,023
[SPEAKER_44]: And they too support the renaming effort.

731
01:16:51,103 --> 01:16:54,805
[SPEAKER_44]: They do not specify, neither letter specifies the preference and choice.

732
01:16:56,046 --> 01:17:01,409
[SPEAKER_44]: The third letter is from Lizzie Wyatt of 134 Auburn Street.

733
01:17:04,765 --> 01:17:07,167
[SPEAKER_44]: She has two children who attend the Columbus Elementary.

734
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:18,095
[SPEAKER_44]: She strongly supports the Columbus School renaming and she would prefer the Belinda Sutton School.

735
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:24,819
[SPEAKER_44]: I deeply appreciate that we have the opportunity to honor a former slave who represents an important part of the history of our community.

736
01:17:29,322 --> 01:17:31,744
[SPEAKER_44]: So thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.

737
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,206
[SPEAKER_44]: The next one is from Michael Glenn.

738
01:17:36,002 --> 01:17:38,703
[SPEAKER_44]: I like the idea of changing the school's name.

739
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:40,784
[SPEAKER_44]: I support Jean Barry Southerland.

740
01:17:42,485 --> 01:17:44,726
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'll do one more right now.

741
01:17:44,866 --> 01:17:48,348
[SPEAKER_44]: My name is from Julie Bogart and I live at 132 Auburn Street.

742
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:52,110
[SPEAKER_44]: My daughter is currently a first grader and my son will start kindergarten there.

743
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:56,453
[SPEAKER_44]: I am writing to express my strong support of the current effort to rename the Columbus.

744
01:17:58,153 --> 01:18:01,035
[SPEAKER_44]: I urge the committee to consider Belinda Sutton as the new school name.

745
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:07,662
[SPEAKER_44]: because I can't think of a better way to both honor Medford's often unrecognized history and celebrate the diversity of our community.

746
01:18:08,302 --> 01:18:09,263
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for your efforts.

747
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:10,965
[SPEAKER_44]: Best, Julie Bogart.

748
01:18:11,445 --> 01:18:14,688
[SPEAKER_44]: So those are the first five that I'll read right now.

749
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:15,649
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, thank you so much.

750
01:18:15,709 --> 01:18:21,535
[SPEAKER_47]: I know we have one person joining us virtually, Lisa, that has her hand up.

751
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:24,418
[SPEAKER_43]: So we'll give Lisa to state your name and address for the record, please.

752
01:18:31,513 --> 01:18:31,873
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

753
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:34,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

754
01:18:36,259 --> 01:18:36,619
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

755
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:43,228
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Lisa Hodgson I live on Lyman Avenue and I have a child finishing third grade at the school which is being renamed.

756
01:18:44,089 --> 01:18:45,470
[SPEAKER_22]: I spent a good chunk of my day.

757
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:52,701
[SPEAKER_22]: reading and moderating multiple discussions of the full name change that is happening here tonight.

758
01:18:53,442 --> 01:19:00,547
[SPEAKER_22]: While I know that we would all love to choose a name to bring the community together, we all know full well that this is not going to happen.

759
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,369
[SPEAKER_22]: The community is divided on by issues much deeper than a name.

760
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:10,233
[SPEAKER_22]: And the disrespect of others that has been on display throughout this process has caused immense harm.

761
01:19:11,074 --> 01:19:17,018
[SPEAKER_22]: We cannot heal this harm by listening only the loudest voices who have the most access.

762
01:19:18,573 --> 01:19:26,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Once you have heard enough public input, I hope you will have a thoughtful discussion about what the new name will represent, and who will feel included going forward.

763
01:19:27,318 --> 01:19:34,802
[SPEAKER_22]: The students and teachers had thoughtful discussions in their classrooms, and many of them are watching this meeting tonight, hoping that their voices will be heard.

764
01:19:35,883 --> 01:19:43,227
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe both Misato and Belinda Sutton as names recognize people who have been marginalized and harmed in our history.

765
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:50,706
[SPEAKER_22]: These can expand our understanding of who our community includes and can inspire students at the school today and going forward.

766
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:57,129
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you will choose Missittook, the preference of the students and teachers for the new name for my child's elementary school.

767
01:19:57,849 --> 01:19:59,370
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I hope we can move forward.

768
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:08,654
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope we can find causes that bring us together and I deeply appreciate the other actions the school committee is taking to improve equity in our schools.

769
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:19,058
[SPEAKER_22]: by expanding the religious holiday observances, by committing to full school meals, by taking urgent steps to reduce the cost by overheating in the school buildings.

770
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:29,222
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope that we can, we see more energy directed toward diminishing our budget challenges rather than punishing each other.

771
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:29,902
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

772
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:47,122
[SPEAKER_20]: You want more?

773
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:52,426
[SPEAKER_47]: If somebody would like to come up from the audience, I'm just waiting for the line to anybody.

774
01:20:52,907 --> 01:20:54,468
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

775
01:20:57,751 --> 01:21:00,393
[SPEAKER_44]: The next one is from Dana McNamee, 173 High Street.

776
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:13,358
[SPEAKER_44]: I support the name change to a positive, inclusive, and anti-racist name, Dana-Mae.

777
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:24,223
[SPEAKER_44]: Then from Steven Daly of 132 Auburn Street, I have two children who will attend the Columbus Elementary School.

778
01:21:24,624 --> 01:21:27,505
[SPEAKER_44]: My oldest child is in first grade and my youngest is a kindergartner.

779
01:21:29,746 --> 01:21:32,647
[SPEAKER_44]: I wish to fully support the Columbus Elementary renaming.

780
01:21:34,288 --> 01:21:37,690
[SPEAKER_44]: I strongly support the changing the name to Belinda Sutton School.

781
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:49,596
[SPEAKER_44]: And, should I do one more?

782
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:51,637
[SPEAKER_47]: We have a line.

783
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:51,977
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

784
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:52,678
[SPEAKER_47]: Take a breath.

785
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:57,080
[SPEAKER_47]: Just reminding everybody, there are children on the call.

786
01:21:57,181 --> 01:22:01,863
[SPEAKER_47]: So I'm going to say again, name and address of the record, three minutes, please be respectful.

787
01:22:02,003 --> 01:22:02,303
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

788
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:05,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, my name is Martha Andrus.

789
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:08,027
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

790
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:19,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here mainly to commend the work of the committee and the naming committee and the school committee and changing the name of the school.

791
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:22,752
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a very important move and thank you for doing it.

792
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:31,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I personally support the name Belinda Sutton, but I also think the other choices are perfectly acceptable.

793
01:22:32,236 --> 01:22:32,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

794
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:42,255
[SPEAKER_60]: Brittany Lanzilli, 16 Benham Street.

795
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:47,780
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm a lifelong resident of Medford, proud product of the Medford public school system.

796
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:56,107
[SPEAKER_60]: So while considering this renaming process, I believe it's important to reflect on our past in Medford and remember and honor those who came before us.

797
01:22:56,728 --> 01:23:06,076
[SPEAKER_60]: I believe we would be deeply remiss to not take this opportunity to recognize an educator, principal, and great role model that Medford was fortunate enough to have led and guided our schools for over 35 years.

798
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:15,369
[SPEAKER_60]: an individual who quite literally walked the halls of the school that we're in the process of renaming, while inspiring and guiding so many along the way.

799
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:18,393
[SPEAKER_60]: This individual is none other than Jean Barry Sutherland.

800
01:23:19,707 --> 01:23:21,808
[SPEAKER_60]: Jean Barry Sutherland set a standard for excellence.

801
01:23:22,188 --> 01:23:32,434
[SPEAKER_60]: As a teacher and principal, she taught us lessons that textbooks could never teach, such as respect, self-worth, being kind to one another, and the importance of coming into the building with a smile each day.

802
01:23:33,314 --> 01:23:39,097
[SPEAKER_60]: I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been lucky enough to have Miss Barry as a principal at the Dame and Columbus School.

803
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:43,880
[SPEAKER_60]: When the Dame School closed, I was to start the 2004 school year at the Columbus Elementary.

804
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,043
[SPEAKER_60]: This new unfamiliar school was very daunting.

805
01:23:47,543 --> 01:23:49,285
[SPEAKER_60]: I'll never forget my first day at the Columbus.

806
01:23:49,766 --> 01:23:52,029
[SPEAKER_60]: Very anxious of what was to come.

807
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,323
[SPEAKER_60]: Miss Barry was at the front door waiting to greet and welcome me.

808
01:23:56,803 --> 01:24:01,967
[SPEAKER_60]: She assured me that we were about to have a wonderful school year, and she reminded me she would be with me every step of the way.

809
01:24:02,908 --> 01:24:07,592
[SPEAKER_60]: That moment, which may seem like a simple gesture, brought so much relief and comfort to my young self.

810
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:14,157
[SPEAKER_60]: Although I was just one of the hundred students attending this new school, it was evident just how much she cared for each and every one of us.

811
01:24:14,978 --> 01:24:25,769
[SPEAKER_60]: So much so that I am confident if you took the time to read the 423 submissions in favor of Miss Barry, you would read about the similar ways she positively influenced so many of us growing up at Medford.

812
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:32,225
[SPEAKER_60]: She left an incredible mark on me and thousands of other students and educators who were lucky enough to cross her path.

813
01:24:32,745 --> 01:24:36,526
[SPEAKER_60]: It's not often you come across such a genuine, dedicated and outstanding individual.

814
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:40,487
[SPEAKER_60]: However, the students in the Medford Public School System were those among the fortunate.

815
01:24:41,307 --> 01:24:45,628
[SPEAKER_60]: I find this quote, leave it better than you found it, to be extremely representative and accurate of Ms.

816
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:46,628
[SPEAKER_60]: Barry's time in Medford.

817
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:51,629
[SPEAKER_60]: The impact she had will live on within the thousands of students and educators she touched.

818
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:54,630
[SPEAKER_60]: The Medford Public School System is a better place because of Ms.

819
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:54,910
[SPEAKER_60]: Barry.

820
01:24:57,475 --> 01:25:00,896
[SPEAKER_60]: I beg you, use your power to unite Medford, not add to the division.

821
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:04,597
[SPEAKER_60]: Use this opportunity to listen to the citizens of Medford.

822
01:25:05,218 --> 01:25:07,878
[SPEAKER_60]: They chose Miss Barry Sutherland.

823
01:25:08,118 --> 01:25:08,479
[SPEAKER_60]: 423 votes.

824
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,640
[SPEAKER_60]: Use this opportunity to learn about Medford and those who paved the way for many of us today.

825
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,642
[SPEAKER_60]: Those who made Medford the city you chose to live in and you chose to educate your children in today.

826
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:25,283
[SPEAKER_60]: Today I stand before you respectfully asking you to put aside politics, agendas, and personal bias.

827
01:25:25,723 --> 01:25:28,565
[SPEAKER_60]: Let this decision be based solely on the most qualified candidate.

828
01:25:29,106 --> 01:25:36,611
[SPEAKER_60]: Again, 423 submissions, 35 years leading the Medford Public Schools, active community member, giving back to the city.

829
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:44,576
[SPEAKER_60]: She went above and beyond in the school system and the community, not because she had to, rather because she cared about the people and the community of Medford.

830
01:25:45,076 --> 01:25:47,978
[SPEAKER_60]: There's no denying that Jean Barry Sutherland deserves this honor.

831
01:25:48,379 --> 01:25:50,260
[SPEAKER_60]: Please, please, please do the right thing.

832
01:26:13,177 --> 01:26:13,657
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?

833
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:16,340
[SPEAKER_13]: John Tancrede, 179 Governor's Avenue.

834
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,623
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the committee did a phenomenal job with that presentation.

835
01:26:20,643 --> 01:26:22,085
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, a lot of detail in there.

836
01:26:22,605 --> 01:26:24,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Love detail, love facts.

837
01:26:24,267 --> 01:26:25,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Facts are great in history.

838
01:26:25,528 --> 01:26:27,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford's a historical city.

839
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:32,574
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard things in there like history and reparations and things like that.

840
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:39,159
[SPEAKER_13]: I think facts are great to go on with history and where we have such,

841
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:44,263
[SPEAKER_13]: a close knit community that really knows each other.

842
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:54,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that you should go with somebody from the community who was really well known by the people and opened a lot of doors.

843
01:26:55,750 --> 01:27:02,254
[SPEAKER_13]: It was even in the presentation that unfortunately we don't have a lot of details about the other individual.

844
01:27:02,554 --> 01:27:05,936
[SPEAKER_13]: And as mentioned, there are some things coming up with using

845
01:27:06,997 --> 01:27:13,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Native American names and stuff, I would say possibly consider

846
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:21,711
[SPEAKER_13]: from Miss Sutton, perhaps a monument at the Royal House rather than naming a school.

847
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:26,092
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think it's great what she did and it's phenomenal and inspiring.

848
01:27:26,432 --> 01:27:33,413
[SPEAKER_13]: However, like the presentation said, there's not that many facts that we can go on about the person, more so the document.

849
01:27:33,773 --> 01:27:36,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So perhaps praise the document in that sense.

850
01:27:36,774 --> 01:27:40,275
[SPEAKER_13]: However, keep the school for the educator and the people that we knew.

851
01:27:42,096 --> 01:27:42,897
[SPEAKER_13]: my personal opinion.

852
01:27:43,017 --> 01:27:43,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, guys.

853
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:05,504
[SPEAKER_44]: Next letter I received was from Ellery Klein.

854
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:11,809
[SPEAKER_44]: Please know that I am supporting you tonight as you face a contentious meeting regarding the school name change for the Columbus Elementary.

855
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:13,591
[SPEAKER_44]: I would like to just offer one thought.

856
01:28:13,991 --> 01:28:20,816
[SPEAKER_44]: A friend of color told me she felt that naming the school after an enslaved person, Belinda Sutton, was not inspiring for the kids of color in the building.

857
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:31,945
[SPEAKER_44]: While I initially liked the story as Mrs. Sutton used her obviously strong powers of persuasive writing and the US justice system of the time to earn her freedom and a recompense for her

858
01:28:32,546 --> 01:28:41,775
[SPEAKER_44]: experience of one of the worst injustices a human being can face and hopefully went on to a better life and freedom, I was willing to hear and absorb this perspective from my friend.

859
01:28:42,475 --> 01:28:50,343
[SPEAKER_44]: While I do think it shows agency and power on the part of Miss Sutton, and one could argue that Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman were also enslaved, yet nevertheless,

860
01:28:50,822 --> 01:28:58,484
[SPEAKER_44]: inspiring fears, I do want to make sure that we have heard from enough voices of color to feel comfortable choosing Belinda Sutton as the name should we choose to do so.

861
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:07,166
[SPEAKER_44]: If the voices in support of the beloved Medford-educated Jean Barry Sutherland are still unanimous and no hidden secrets have emerged, I also think this is a fine choice.

862
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:11,487
[SPEAKER_44]: However, I would urge the mayor to set firm guidelines, which we have.

863
01:29:12,187 --> 01:29:18,609
[SPEAKER_44]: I fully remain in support of the name change of the Columbus to one that is more in line with justice, freedom, hope, and kindness.

864
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:20,389
[SPEAKER_44]: Regards, Ellery Klein.

865
01:29:22,276 --> 01:29:25,678
[SPEAKER_44]: The next letter is from Jen Lewis, in support of Miss attack.

866
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:33,423
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm writing in support of the name miss attack for our self Medford elementary school, the school students voted for the name and their input is significant.

867
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:44,411
[SPEAKER_44]: I appreciate the name will recognize and honor the people so lived here for hundreds of years, and encourage all students to residents to learn more about their rich history in the theater community to which I belong over the last few years.

868
01:29:44,861 --> 01:29:51,843
[SPEAKER_44]: We have begun each performance with a land acknowledgement, recognizing the often forgotten people who lived here before European colonization.

869
01:29:52,844 --> 01:29:54,324
[SPEAKER_44]: Jen Lewis, 20 Russell Street.

870
01:29:56,405 --> 01:30:03,328
[SPEAKER_44]: Talia Andrea Lata, and I'm sorry if I'm butchering any names, from the 75 Lawrence Road.

871
01:30:04,048 --> 01:30:07,129
[SPEAKER_44]: I am writing to express my strong support for the name of the Columbus School.

872
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:13,151
[SPEAKER_44]: This is a symbolic decision that the Medford School Committee must make in order to express commitment to anti-racism

873
01:30:13,638 --> 01:30:16,181
[SPEAKER_44]: and equitable education in our public schools.

874
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:23,448
[SPEAKER_44]: The next one, Columbus name change from Carlene McGorty, 19 Austin Terrace.

875
01:30:24,048 --> 01:30:29,113
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm writing to express my hope that you vote on the name change today and end this turmoil.

876
01:30:29,654 --> 01:30:30,594
[SPEAKER_44]: It is the right thing to do.

877
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:37,297
[SPEAKER_44]: Personally, I liked the name Lydia Maria Childs.

878
01:30:37,677 --> 01:30:39,738
[SPEAKER_44]: However, now I think the name should not be a person.

879
01:30:39,778 --> 01:30:44,601
[SPEAKER_44]: I wish South Medford Elementary School had been a suggestion, as there is no room for dispute over that one.

880
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:47,202
[SPEAKER_44]: Of the choices, I think Missituck would be a good name.

881
01:30:47,582 --> 01:30:50,664
[SPEAKER_44]: I heard Missituck won the student vote, which should count for something.

882
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,825
[SPEAKER_44]: It honors our Native American history and our location.

883
01:30:54,666 --> 01:30:54,926
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

884
01:30:56,966 --> 01:31:00,308
[SPEAKER_47]: And we have one more person with their hand up virtually.

885
01:31:00,328 --> 01:31:02,109
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll go to Chris next.

886
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:10,372
[SPEAKER_47]: But before we have anybody speak, I just want to say, and I know the committee will agree, there's three well-deserving names.

887
01:31:10,693 --> 01:31:18,496
[SPEAKER_47]: So I ask that if you're going to speak tonight, that you speak positively about the name you choose, if that's what you choose to do.

888
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:22,558
[SPEAKER_47]: And we try to not say anything negative about the other two.

889
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:23,258
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

890
01:31:24,139 --> 01:31:24,319
[SPEAKER_47]: Chris.

891
01:31:26,351 --> 01:31:31,434
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, my name is Chris Cuiate, and it looks like my video is not working.

892
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:32,315
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry about that.

893
01:31:33,776 --> 01:31:36,157
[SPEAKER_26]: I live at 1 Bellevue Terrace in Medford.

894
01:31:36,177 --> 01:31:44,382
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanted to say first that when you get that echo, it will probably be helpful for everybody to mute their microphones.

895
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:47,824
[SPEAKER_26]: So I wanted to,

896
01:31:49,935 --> 01:31:53,577
[SPEAKER_26]: to echo what folks were saying about Missituk.

897
01:31:53,777 --> 01:31:57,819
[SPEAKER_26]: I like that the Columbus students voted for that.

898
01:31:58,459 --> 01:32:01,801
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that would be wonderful to support their wishes.

899
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:13,106
[SPEAKER_26]: And I really like the connection to Native American culture, especially considering the name we're changing it from.

900
01:32:14,607 --> 01:32:18,469
[SPEAKER_26]: And I want to applaud all the members of the committee for their hard work.

901
01:32:19,324 --> 01:32:26,970
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that all the choices were carefully thought about and are good choices.

902
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,171
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's my preference.

903
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:29,672
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

904
01:32:29,692 --> 01:32:31,093
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Chris.

905
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:35,116
[SPEAKER_47]: Anybody would like Ms.

906
01:32:35,136 --> 01:32:35,376
[SPEAKER_47]: Cugno?

907
01:32:47,392 --> 01:32:47,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I should know.

908
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:48,252
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

909
01:32:48,733 --> 01:32:48,973
Okay.

910
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my name is Ann Marie Cugno, 871 Fellsway Medford Mass.

911
01:32:54,655 --> 01:32:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening.

912
01:32:55,316 --> 01:33:06,741
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I would just want to say thank you to the school committee, to the mayor, to the superintendent because I know she was involved, and to the advisory committee for doing their due diligence and really coming up with three wonderful names.

913
01:33:08,348 --> 01:33:22,743
[SPEAKER_04]: What I've been hearing over and over again, no matter who is trying to have their name shared for this school, it's heartbreaking to hear the dividedness that has been becoming in our city and that has become in our city.

914
01:33:23,383 --> 01:33:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight, I am going to ask you to do your due diligence to put

915
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:43,702
[SPEAKER_04]: your agenda, and I'm not trying to say it in a bad way, just put it aside and really in your hearts, find why you are all being elected as our school officials.

916
01:33:44,542 --> 01:33:45,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here for the people.

917
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:54,110
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was behind this and sitting there, it was basically to hear the people in our city.

918
01:33:54,850 --> 01:34:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't just to hear a small group, it was to hear the large group and to really try to make it as fair as possible and respectful as possible to everyone.

919
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the numbers tonight that have been shared of the people that have voted or had contacted the advisory committee have shared what their wishes would like to be in this city.

920
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try the healing tonight.

921
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree with the gentleman that was up here before.

922
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:26,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what Ms.

923
01:34:26,605 --> 01:34:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Sutton represents is tremendous.

924
01:34:29,727 --> 01:34:36,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's incredible and I think it's very important that our school children know the history of that.

925
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:41,131
[SPEAKER_04]: but we need someone to also represent the school.

926
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:43,352
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a connection with Ms.

927
01:34:43,372 --> 01:34:43,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Sutherland.

928
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: She walked those halls.

929
01:34:46,552 --> 01:34:48,913
[SPEAKER_04]: The children know that she walked those halls.

930
01:34:49,673 --> 01:34:53,254
[SPEAKER_04]: She was the smiling face that they saw every morning.

931
01:34:53,734 --> 01:35:01,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There are parents now that are sending their children there because of those memories that they've had and they have chosen to stay in our city.

932
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:10,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do just with graciousness ask you to really listen to why you had all been elected.

933
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The people have spoken, their wishes have been really expressed.

934
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:22,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really asking, let this city start healing and bring us together again.

935
01:35:23,305 --> 01:35:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

936
01:35:32,295 --> 01:35:34,656
[SPEAKER_52]: Good evening, Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

937
01:35:34,976 --> 01:35:40,977
[SPEAKER_52]: I actually wanted to speak to one of the speakers earlier that had said that don't listen to the loudest voices.

938
01:35:42,297 --> 01:35:49,239
[SPEAKER_52]: My point to that is don't listen to all the voices because there are very quiet voices that are just as powerful.

939
01:35:49,939 --> 01:36:00,202
[SPEAKER_52]: I came to you in a Zoom meeting somewhere in the winter season where we're all put away in our homes and asked you, implored you, please table this.

940
01:36:00,402 --> 01:36:01,902
[SPEAKER_52]: Please give the opportunity.

941
01:36:02,645 --> 01:36:06,128
[SPEAKER_52]: of the community to absorb what it is you're trying to do.

942
01:36:06,448 --> 01:36:15,476
[SPEAKER_52]: I did not agree, I wanna be very clear, I did not agree with the process, nor did I agree with the decision, but to at least give them the opportunity to absorb this.

943
01:36:16,057 --> 01:36:22,743
[SPEAKER_52]: And I was met with absolute silence, just like that, silence.

944
01:36:23,443 --> 01:36:27,167
[SPEAKER_52]: Silence is equally as powerful as the loudest voice.

945
01:36:28,127 --> 01:36:29,729
[SPEAKER_52]: Now, here we are today,

946
01:36:30,717 --> 01:36:38,800
[SPEAKER_52]: And I was standing back there and a couple of folks came into the room and they were looking around and they said, I'm not sure where to sit, which side should I be on?

947
01:36:39,441 --> 01:36:45,223
[SPEAKER_52]: My response to them was, this is the Medford community, sit wherever you want.

948
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:47,524
[SPEAKER_52]: This is who we are.

949
01:36:47,544 --> 01:36:56,188
[SPEAKER_52]: And this is who you need to represent, the Medford community.

950
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,762
[SPEAKER_52]: There's not a hundred people in this community.

951
01:36:58,802 --> 01:37:00,643
[SPEAKER_52]: There's not a thousand people in this community.

952
01:37:00,923 --> 01:37:04,606
[SPEAKER_52]: There's over 58,000 people in this community.

953
01:37:05,047 --> 01:37:06,788
[SPEAKER_52]: You need to represent them all.

954
01:37:07,649 --> 01:37:25,884
[SPEAKER_52]: So please take that into consideration when you take these names into consideration, because you have that one opportunity to take that dividing rod that has been thrown straight into the middle of this city and pull it out and destroy it forever, but it's up to you.

955
01:37:26,445 --> 01:37:26,845
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

956
01:37:36,888 --> 01:37:37,368
[SPEAKER_36]: Good evening.

957
01:37:38,089 --> 01:37:39,549
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

958
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:40,589
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Jean Muzo.

959
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:42,230
[SPEAKER_36]: I live at 35 Parris Street.

960
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:46,251
[SPEAKER_37]: First, I want to take a moment to thank the committee for their hard work.

961
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:47,411
[SPEAKER_37]: I watched much of it.

962
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:50,832
[SPEAKER_37]: It was painful to watch.

963
01:37:50,972 --> 01:37:52,673
[SPEAKER_37]: They worked very diligently.

964
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,391
[SPEAKER_37]: I want to give you a frame of reference.

965
01:37:55,831 --> 01:38:00,654
[SPEAKER_44]: Some of you may recall, I am Native American and I am Southern Italian.

966
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:02,155
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm an Italian immigrant.

967
01:38:02,635 --> 01:38:08,818
[SPEAKER_44]: My dad, I like to say, came to this country with lint in his pocket and a recipe for rock soup.

968
01:38:09,438 --> 01:38:12,260
[SPEAKER_36]: My mom is where I get my Native American background.

969
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:18,463
[SPEAKER_36]: And we are from the Mohican tribe, which is in Massachusetts and all the way up to Winooski, Vermont.

970
01:38:19,103 --> 01:38:20,264
[SPEAKER_44]: So that is my background.

971
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:33,602
[SPEAKER_37]: And I put that lens on, that dual lens, when I look at this issue, and I recognize that there are some people who, for reasons other than discovering America, hold Columbus important.

972
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,384
[SPEAKER_37]: And this has been a very painful discussion.

973
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:40,727
[SPEAKER_37]: And for others, Columbus himself is a very painful issue.

974
01:38:42,028 --> 01:38:44,029
[SPEAKER_37]: We continue to be divided.

975
01:38:44,397 --> 01:38:51,999
[SPEAKER_37]: the speed at which this had to be done, the haste that was taken, the committee spoke regularly about, I wish we would have had more time.

976
01:38:52,799 --> 01:39:04,443
[SPEAKER_37]: What I have learned from watching is that the 18 names, as well as the other 40 some odd names that were submitted, all in their own right were viable options.

977
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:08,904
[SPEAKER_37]: And I wish we had more opportunity to learn more about them.

978
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:12,585
[SPEAKER_37]: And when I consider these last three and consider

979
01:39:13,466 --> 01:39:22,252
[SPEAKER_36]: what Member Kretz has told us about the potential that we're seeing throughout the state to reconsider naming for Native American tribes and individuals.

980
01:39:23,232 --> 01:39:33,459
[SPEAKER_36]: I look at Belinda Sutton and I look at Jean Barry Sutherland, and I wish I had known both of them because they seem to be amazing women and amazing individuals in their own right.

981
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,061
[SPEAKER_36]: But I often talk about things in context when we talk about history.

982
01:39:38,081 --> 01:39:42,204
[SPEAKER_36]: I've spoken in the past about buildings in context and spaces in context.

983
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:52,186
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think there is a compelling context to have the school that is currently the Columbus School named for Jean Barry Sutherland.

984
01:39:52,727 --> 01:39:55,729
[SPEAKER_36]: I would implore you to consider that it's not a zero sum game.

985
01:39:55,769 --> 01:39:57,810
[SPEAKER_36]: There are other opportunities in this city.

986
01:39:58,430 --> 01:40:05,174
[SPEAKER_36]: And had we had more time, maybe we could have even talked about a Medford week where we learn about all of these Medford individuals.

987
01:40:05,774 --> 01:40:07,275
[SPEAKER_37]: It is a really tough choice.

988
01:40:07,996 --> 01:40:11,578
[SPEAKER_37]: I hope that as you talk about it this evening,

989
01:40:12,059 --> 01:40:19,242
[SPEAKER_37]: you pick the solution that really does bring us together because I'm very saddened by a lot of the vitriol and hatred I've seen online.

990
01:40:19,862 --> 01:40:24,344
[SPEAKER_36]: And I would encourage people to try to consider each other's positions.

991
01:40:24,404 --> 01:40:30,347
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a very difficult situation and we do all have to live in this community come tomorrow morning after the choice.

992
01:40:30,927 --> 01:40:31,707
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for your time.

993
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,742
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi, Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street, Medford, Mass.

994
01:40:47,623 --> 01:40:49,084
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes.

995
01:40:49,304 --> 01:40:52,066
[SPEAKER_37]: For me, this has been a very difficult time.

996
01:40:53,067 --> 01:40:56,168
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm only a 40-year resident of Medford, Mass.

997
01:40:56,249 --> 01:40:58,210
[SPEAKER_36]: My son went to the Columbus School.

998
01:40:58,630 --> 01:40:59,971
[SPEAKER_36]: It was very disheartened.

999
01:41:00,651 --> 01:41:05,894
[SPEAKER_36]: I, first of all, want to thank everybody who put time and effort into this to pick the names.

1000
01:41:06,635 --> 01:41:10,497
[SPEAKER_37]: The process, however, has divided this city

1001
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:16,932
[SPEAKER_36]: to some, I don't even know if it can be put back together again.

1002
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:19,434
[SPEAKER_36]: I wanna bring up one point.

1003
01:41:19,634 --> 01:41:25,699
[SPEAKER_37]: The one point I wanna bring up is we have a school here in Medford named the McGlynn School.

1004
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:28,441
[SPEAKER_37]: Why was it named the McGlynn School?

1005
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:35,927
[SPEAKER_37]: Because most people in this community knew Michael McGlynn, knew the McGlynn family, did they not?

1006
01:41:37,935 --> 01:41:42,197
[SPEAKER_37]: Jean Barry Sutherland is a name this community knows.

1007
01:41:42,737 --> 01:41:52,982
[SPEAKER_37]: While the river is very important historically, I personally don't identify with the river from Medford.

1008
01:41:53,103 --> 01:41:55,904
[SPEAKER_42]: It's just my thing.

1009
01:41:55,984 --> 01:41:58,185
[SPEAKER_42]: I just don't identify with the river.

1010
01:41:58,285 --> 01:41:59,126
[SPEAKER_44]: It's beautiful.

1011
01:41:59,206 --> 01:41:59,706
[SPEAKER_44]: I love it.

1012
01:41:59,766 --> 01:42:00,586
[SPEAKER_44]: I know it's there.

1013
01:42:00,666 --> 01:42:01,847
[SPEAKER_44]: I know its significance.

1014
01:42:02,387 --> 01:42:04,108
[SPEAKER_44]: But it doesn't mean that much to me.

1015
01:42:07,478 --> 01:42:08,139
[SPEAKER_39]: Belinda.

1016
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,962
[SPEAKER_47]: Maybe the great things about gene.

1017
01:42:12,062 --> 01:42:12,622
[SPEAKER_47]: Did you know her.

1018
01:42:14,043 --> 01:42:17,987
[SPEAKER_43]: Stick to the positives about I'm trying to stick to thank you.

1019
01:42:18,187 --> 01:42:22,710
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, my son said wonderful things about her when she was principal of school.

1020
01:42:26,283 --> 01:42:29,645
[SPEAKER_37]: Most people in this community can identify with her.

1021
01:42:29,705 --> 01:42:41,393
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think as a way to, the school committee is supposed to be our voice, our voice, not your voice for what you want for our community.

1022
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:51,760
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm going to beg you as the others have to kindly consider one Mary Sutherland and put the community back together.

1023
01:42:51,961 --> 01:42:52,361
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1024
01:42:57,953 --> 01:43:05,418
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going to let Mr. Hollings speak, and then we have a hand raised on virtual, and then we'll call up Mr. Van de Kloot.

1025
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:08,440
[SPEAKER_57]: Good evening.

1026
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:10,921
[SPEAKER_57]: My name is Paul Hollings, 29, rural Alves.

1027
01:43:11,962 --> 01:43:15,304
[SPEAKER_58]: So I've been following this process a lot since the beginning.

1028
01:43:16,205 --> 01:43:18,886
[SPEAKER_58]: I've been in Memphis about eight years and wasn't born and raised there.

1029
01:43:19,807 --> 01:43:24,550
[SPEAKER_58]: The Columbus name, it really didn't bother me, but I understood why people had the feeling they wanted to change.

1030
01:43:25,134 --> 01:43:32,679
[SPEAKER_58]: I started getting involved when I seen the, you know, discussion, the community and a lot of the feedback and the, you know, pushback and it was kind of disheartening a little bit.

1031
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:37,442
[SPEAKER_58]: Cause you feel like, you know, you understand this from my opinion, you seem like there's two groups that are battling out right.

1032
01:43:37,462 --> 01:43:52,792
[SPEAKER_58]: And then there's everybody else who's, you know, feels like they're just part of the community, but have an opinion, but you know, God forbid you say one thing and you offend someone, someone in the school yard doesn't want to talk to, you know, and my whole thing in the beginning was, I just said, I'd like to see named after somebody who had a positive impact in the city.

1033
01:43:53,943 --> 01:43:56,585
[SPEAKER_58]: possibly an educator, this was long before any names come up.

1034
01:43:57,525 --> 01:44:04,050
[SPEAKER_58]: You know, I do support the name for Gene Barry Southerland only because that's the way I felt in the beginning before the process, before names come out.

1035
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:06,331
[SPEAKER_58]: And that's just, you know, what my preference was.

1036
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:11,655
[SPEAKER_58]: I feel like I have a little unique perspective going in here because, you know, I was born and raised in Charlestown.

1037
01:44:11,695 --> 01:44:15,437
[SPEAKER_58]: I, you know, small community, which was, had an influx of a lot of people coming in.

1038
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:18,079
[SPEAKER_58]: When people came in, we were very disheartened by it.

1039
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:19,059
[SPEAKER_58]: Why are these people coming in?

1040
01:44:19,099 --> 01:44:21,541
[SPEAKER_58]: Why are they telling us how to run our schools, our little league, our football?

1041
01:44:22,059 --> 01:44:27,161
[SPEAKER_58]: You know, we've been here, our families have been here, we've been raising, you know, and we felt like it was our city, right?

1042
01:44:27,982 --> 01:44:30,903
[SPEAKER_58]: And then as you get out, you realize it's not, it belongs to everybody.

1043
01:44:31,163 --> 01:44:34,445
[SPEAKER_58]: So no matter how long you lived here, you know, it's your community.

1044
01:44:34,465 --> 01:44:36,826
[SPEAKER_58]: When you make yourself a part of that community, it's your community.

1045
01:44:36,926 --> 01:44:48,631
[SPEAKER_58]: But I also have the perspective of, I understand that the people of Method who have been here a long time, who have lived here a long time, you know, they have that same feeling that I had at one point where I don't need people coming and telling me how to do my thing.

1046
01:44:48,932 --> 01:44:49,792
[SPEAKER_58]: My family's been here.

1047
01:44:50,236 --> 01:44:51,797
[SPEAKER_58]: They've raised money for certain charities.

1048
01:44:51,837 --> 01:44:54,519
[SPEAKER_58]: They've raised, you know, volunteered in little league football.

1049
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:57,021
[SPEAKER_58]: They've coached, you know, here, there, they've been down the hockey rink.

1050
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,063
[SPEAKER_58]: You know, it's just, it's tough.

1051
01:44:59,103 --> 01:45:03,166
[SPEAKER_58]: But one thing I noticed is things got better in Charlestown people.

1052
01:45:03,326 --> 01:45:05,288
[SPEAKER_58]: It's everything gets better.

1053
01:45:05,508 --> 01:45:06,709
[SPEAKER_58]: It's going to get better in this community.

1054
01:45:06,989 --> 01:45:09,731
[SPEAKER_58]: It's going to take some time, but it just is what it is.

1055
01:45:09,912 --> 01:45:10,512
[SPEAKER_58]: You know, I agree.

1056
01:45:10,552 --> 01:45:12,914
[SPEAKER_58]: There is a, there's a place for Blender Sutton in this town.

1057
01:45:12,934 --> 01:45:17,898
[SPEAKER_58]: I think that something really enjoying the history part of it, because it's got me to learn what, um,

1058
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:20,592
[SPEAKER_58]: I think there's definitely something that should be done for her.

1059
01:45:21,612 --> 01:45:25,535
[SPEAKER_58]: And just one other historic aspect before I let you go is Medford was originally part of Charleston.

1060
01:45:25,555 --> 01:45:34,302
[SPEAKER_58]: So technically you guys all live in my town.

1061
01:45:42,368 --> 01:45:46,911
[SPEAKER_47]: If we can keep the clapping to 30 seconds, miss Joan Yeager.

1062
01:45:58,457 --> 01:45:58,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Ms.

1063
01:45:58,797 --> 01:45:59,397
[SPEAKER_42]: Joan Yeager.

1064
01:46:00,678 --> 01:46:01,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, everyone.

1065
01:46:01,838 --> 01:46:05,780
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to first of all thank everyone on the committee for the hard work.

1066
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:10,342
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it's been very controversial.

1067
01:46:10,362 --> 01:46:14,103
[SPEAKER_25]: And certainly a very... Can you hear me?

1068
01:46:14,304 --> 01:46:18,225
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to first of all thank everyone on the committee for the hard work.

1069
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:20,246
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's been very controversial.

1070
01:46:20,366 --> 01:46:21,687
[SPEAKER_24]: And certainly a very...

1071
01:46:28,212 --> 01:46:31,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Turn it off.

1072
01:46:31,754 --> 01:46:32,354
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

1073
01:46:32,414 --> 01:46:36,277
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that my video or rather my audio cut out.

1074
01:46:36,877 --> 01:46:45,882
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll start again by saying that I want to thank all of the people on the committee for doing what I know was a very difficult job.

1075
01:46:47,003 --> 01:46:53,126
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel that I'm in a very unique position to speak on Jean Barry Sutherland.

1076
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,202
[SPEAKER_25]: I, at first of all, met her when I was a parent of children at the Dame School.

1077
01:46:59,683 --> 01:47:00,963
[SPEAKER_25]: We became colleagues.

1078
01:47:01,424 --> 01:47:07,787
[SPEAKER_25]: And then I was fortunate enough to follow in her footsteps after she retired from the Columbus School in 2006.

1079
01:47:08,128 --> 01:47:19,054
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to speak about the topic of historical significance, because I know that historical significance plays well into making

1080
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:22,218
[SPEAKER_25]: a change of the name of the school.

1081
01:47:22,278 --> 01:47:31,091
[SPEAKER_25]: You want someone that years from now will say, oh, Jean Barry Sutherland was a person who

1082
01:47:32,296 --> 01:47:36,538
[SPEAKER_25]: And I respect the historical significance of Linda Sutton.

1083
01:47:37,179 --> 01:47:41,061
[SPEAKER_25]: I certainly respect the historical significance of Missitook.

1084
01:47:41,841 --> 01:47:50,646
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to talk about the historical significance that Jean Barry Sutherland will certainly be a part of in years to come.

1085
01:47:51,286 --> 01:47:56,109
[SPEAKER_25]: If you ask my children, who were students of Miss Barry Sutherland,

1086
01:47:56,889 --> 01:48:06,438
[SPEAKER_25]: now that they are wonderful adults, they will speak of the historical significance of the modeling that Jean did for them.

1087
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:20,411
[SPEAKER_25]: 50 years from now, if you speak to residents of Medford and children who then will attend the Columbus School, where Jean's breath still literally lives in that school,

1088
01:48:21,977 --> 01:48:33,521
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe his her historical significance will always be a legacy to the blood, sweat and tears that she poured into the opening of that school.

1089
01:48:34,581 --> 01:48:38,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, when she retired in 2006 she didn't stop.

1090
01:48:41,184 --> 01:48:45,425
[SPEAKER_25]: She went on to her work throughout the city of Medford with Medford Health Matters.

1091
01:48:46,285 --> 01:48:55,688
[SPEAKER_25]: And if there was a group or some type of positive committee action going on in Medford, and Jean wasn't a part of it, I'd like to know what it was.

1092
01:48:56,348 --> 01:48:58,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Because she was present at every

1093
01:48:59,649 --> 01:49:27,177
[SPEAKER_25]: event, every committee, so proud of the diversity in the city of Medford, so proud of her population at the Columbus School, that I would like you to consider the words historical significance when you think of Jean Barry Sutherland and the pride that will go to the now Columbus School when it is renamed the Jean Barry Sutherland School.

1094
01:49:27,737 --> 01:49:28,457
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1095
01:49:38,004 --> 01:49:39,725
[SPEAKER_47]: Next up, we have Reverend Wendy.

1096
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:52,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me turn off my microphone, my speaker.

1097
01:49:53,633 --> 01:49:54,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1098
01:49:54,153 --> 01:50:00,697
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to celebrate the amazing job that the school committee and the team did in

1099
01:50:01,823 --> 01:50:09,208
[SPEAKER_20]: discerning such a beautiful story about all of the folk who have been presented.

1100
01:50:09,968 --> 01:50:18,714
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to say that I have not elected you to your office for the sole purpose of having you make decisions based on the majority opinion.

1101
01:50:19,554 --> 01:50:20,815
[SPEAKER_20]: I expect you to lead.

1102
01:50:21,465 --> 01:50:42,591
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are many times in life, business, and government that leaders have to make decisions that move people and the community past the status quo, beyond the systems that have been in place for generations, and forward to create a new way, another way, a third way that will move us to become an anti-racist city.

1103
01:50:43,091 --> 01:50:45,512
[SPEAKER_20]: This decision is one of those moments.

1104
01:50:46,315 --> 01:50:54,600
[SPEAKER_20]: I elected you for you to help us to move to a place of repair, renewal, and restoration.

1105
01:50:55,060 --> 01:51:10,769
[SPEAKER_20]: I encourage the school committee to return to the rubric that has guided and defined this process and make their decisions based on those values, especially the value of teaching and transforming our future based on our history.

1106
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:14,992
[SPEAKER_20]: Make your decisions based on those values, not the politics,

1107
01:51:15,808 --> 01:51:21,990
[SPEAKER_20]: and the name calling and the division, you know, the dividing rod that people are talking about.

1108
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:26,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Make your decision based on those values, not the emotions of this moment.

1109
01:51:26,972 --> 01:51:28,532
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for honoring my time.

1110
01:51:40,216 --> 01:51:42,197
[SPEAKER_47]: It will pop on in one second.

1111
01:51:42,777 --> 01:51:43,017
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1112
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:48,541
[SPEAKER_51]: Hello, my name is Richard Orlando, 13 Winfrey Way.

1113
01:51:48,681 --> 01:51:56,622
[SPEAKER_51]: As I was sitting there, I wasn't, I was thinking of not speaking tonight because my comments are more about the overall activity in the community.

1114
01:51:57,502 --> 01:52:01,083
[SPEAKER_51]: And a few speakers talked about your role as a school committee.

1115
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:04,423
[SPEAKER_51]: I just heard some comments, which caused me to say, I need to speak.

1116
01:52:05,223 --> 01:52:08,244
[SPEAKER_51]: So I want to provide information related to pressing issues in the city.

1117
01:52:10,124 --> 01:52:14,525
[SPEAKER_51]: I would hope that the school committee tonight, and they seem to be doing, providing citizens the opportunity to speak.

1118
01:52:14,878 --> 01:52:16,498
[SPEAKER_51]: two areas I would like to discuss.

1119
01:52:17,218 --> 01:52:27,220
[SPEAKER_51]: First, the incorrect narrative that is being actively spoken by some elected officials and some citizens of Medford that we are a systematically racist community.

1120
01:52:28,561 --> 01:52:31,121
[SPEAKER_51]: Second, the priorities of the school committee.

1121
01:52:31,721 --> 01:52:36,642
[SPEAKER_51]: On the first issue, and this is not a history lesson, it is relevant to the current school committee.

1122
01:52:37,122 --> 01:52:42,604
[SPEAKER_51]: Approximately 20 years ago, Medford successfully planned, built, and opened six schools.

1123
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:44,724
[SPEAKER_51]: I would ask rhetorically,

1124
01:52:45,086 --> 01:52:51,610
[SPEAKER_51]: Who knows the definition of category one funding under the state building assistance program at the time the schools were built?

1125
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:54,271
[SPEAKER_51]: I think some may know, but not all.

1126
01:52:55,212 --> 01:53:03,116
[SPEAKER_51]: Category one funding was available to cities and towns that were looking to improve racial equality across their schools.

1127
01:53:03,817 --> 01:53:06,778
[SPEAKER_51]: It provided 90% funding to those that qualify.

1128
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:09,360
[SPEAKER_51]: It was not provided, it was just asked.

1129
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:14,863
[SPEAKER_51]: Medford was required to deliver a comprehensive and implementable plan that included

1130
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:18,980
[SPEAKER_51]: a racial balance plan, an educational plan, and a maintenance plan.

1131
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:23,101
[SPEAKER_51]: The racial balance plan was developed by skilled individuals in Medford.

1132
01:53:24,302 --> 01:53:32,424
[SPEAKER_51]: The school administration, Michael Alves from Brown University, was regarded as the expert on the controlled choice model process.

1133
01:53:33,165 --> 01:53:38,466
[SPEAKER_51]: That plan was approved by the state and successfully implemented in the new schools and used for years.

1134
01:53:39,267 --> 01:53:43,868
[SPEAKER_51]: It is very interesting that Medford, a community that embraced category one racial balance

1135
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:49,653
[SPEAKER_51]: in the controlled choice model is now characterized as racist by some.

1136
01:53:51,014 --> 01:53:53,155
[SPEAKER_51]: However, the disconnect even gets stronger.

1137
01:53:53,675 --> 01:54:08,424
[SPEAKER_51]: The racial balance plan rolled out in 2001 took its foundation from Medford's existing magnet school program, which conveyed the integration and communicate activities such along that line for 20 years.

1138
01:54:09,105 --> 01:54:14,548
[SPEAKER_51]: I've had the privilege of working with many individuals over the years, both lifelong and new citizens in the community.

1139
01:54:15,029 --> 01:54:19,751
[SPEAKER_51]: Those experiences were always exhibited with goodwill and intent for all.

1140
01:54:20,911 --> 01:54:27,714
[SPEAKER_51]: The longstanding commitment to diversity and equality truly represents the character of Medford and the equality of its citizens.

1141
01:54:28,134 --> 01:54:31,776
[SPEAKER_51]: This is a sharp contrast to some of the divisive opinions of some.

1142
01:54:32,696 --> 01:54:42,580
[SPEAKER_51]: I'm running out of time, but in other areas, the maintenance plan, which was part of that, that is also an issue which this committee should be taking care of.

1143
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:44,001
[SPEAKER_51]: So in closing, I will say,

1144
01:54:44,594 --> 01:54:46,715
[SPEAKER_51]: What are the priorities of the school committee?

1145
01:54:47,495 --> 01:54:49,555
[SPEAKER_51]: What have we put you in place to do?

1146
01:54:50,656 --> 01:54:54,257
[SPEAKER_51]: On the racial balance plan, you changed that and failed.

1147
01:54:54,777 --> 01:54:59,738
[SPEAKER_51]: The maintenance plan has not been supported, and there are serious issues going on in the community.

1148
01:55:00,278 --> 01:55:01,919
[SPEAKER_51]: Again, what are your priorities?

1149
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:03,219
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Orlando.

1150
01:55:14,394 --> 01:55:15,574
[SPEAKER_47]: We're gonna take Ms.

1151
01:55:15,614 --> 01:55:18,355
[SPEAKER_47]: Harris, and then we're gonna read a few more emails, please.

1152
01:55:18,555 --> 01:55:21,016
[SPEAKER_47]: And then we have one more hand raised on Zoom.

1153
01:55:22,016 --> 01:55:24,797
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, Valerie Harris, 13 Pool Street.

1154
01:55:25,677 --> 01:55:28,417
[SPEAKER_39]: Wasn't gonna speak tonight, but I've held my tongue long enough.

1155
01:55:29,018 --> 01:55:37,300
[SPEAKER_39]: Shame on this school committee, because you guys took this, it's absurd that you're dealing with this during a pandemic.

1156
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,620
[SPEAKER_39]: Our children were neglected by you.

1157
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,681
[SPEAKER_39]: You should have taken all this energy and all this,

1158
01:55:44,194 --> 01:55:48,718
[SPEAKER_39]: commitment from everybody, put it towards getting our children back in school where they belong.

1159
01:55:49,398 --> 01:55:55,022
[SPEAKER_39]: And I hold each and every one of you responsible, because this is a show just for you guys.

1160
01:55:55,482 --> 01:55:56,903
[SPEAKER_39]: You have already made your decision.

1161
01:55:57,123 --> 01:56:00,966
[SPEAKER_39]: We know that that was said back on day one, back in June.

1162
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:10,253
[SPEAKER_39]: All I have to do is, I really hope the voters remember this at election time.

1163
01:56:11,154 --> 01:56:11,594
[SPEAKER_39]: Because

1164
01:56:12,469 --> 01:56:13,810
[SPEAKER_39]: You neglected our children.

1165
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:15,150
[SPEAKER_39]: This could have waited.

1166
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,131
[SPEAKER_39]: This was not an immediate.

1167
01:56:17,991 --> 01:56:18,992
[SPEAKER_39]: What was the urgency?

1168
01:56:19,792 --> 01:56:20,992
[SPEAKER_39]: What was the urgency?

1169
01:56:21,492 --> 01:56:21,853
[SPEAKER_39]: Nothing.

1170
01:56:22,373 --> 01:56:23,373
[SPEAKER_39]: We had a pandemic.

1171
01:56:23,593 --> 01:56:33,077
[SPEAKER_39]: We couldn't leave our houses, couldn't go to work, couldn't be six feet from family members dying in a hospital, yet this was your priority.

1172
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:36,558
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh my God, shame on every one of you.

1173
01:56:36,598 --> 01:56:38,159
[SPEAKER_39]: Shame on you.

1174
01:56:39,648 --> 01:56:40,428
[SPEAKER_36]: And both of you.

1175
01:56:40,448 --> 01:56:41,529
[SPEAKER_36]: Point of order, ma'am.

1176
01:56:41,569 --> 01:56:43,350
[SPEAKER_36]: Point of order, ma'am, ma'am.

1177
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:44,390
[SPEAKER_36]: Point of order.

1178
01:56:44,690 --> 01:56:45,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Excuse me.

1179
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:48,311
[SPEAKER_24]: We're calling for an order in the room.

1180
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:50,812
[SPEAKER_48]: Chair.

1181
01:56:50,873 --> 01:57:04,118
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you have a point of order?

1182
01:57:04,198 --> 01:57:06,559
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Kloot, if you could read a few more emails, please.

1183
01:57:06,599 --> 01:57:07,039
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure.

1184
01:57:07,515 --> 01:57:13,179
[SPEAKER_44]: So these are emails that have been received into the school committee account that I am reading for the record.

1185
01:57:13,919 --> 01:57:16,801
[SPEAKER_44]: I am shortening them because of the pure numbers.

1186
01:57:18,082 --> 01:57:22,825
[SPEAKER_44]: Sarah Florence, 35 Sagamore Ave, in support of the name change.

1187
01:57:23,505 --> 01:57:24,946
[SPEAKER_44]: She prefers Belinda Sutton.

1188
01:57:25,246 --> 01:57:28,869
[SPEAKER_44]: Talk about persevering despite having the odds stacked against you.

1189
01:57:29,249 --> 01:57:34,292
[SPEAKER_44]: Our miss attack, no future worries about naming the school after a person who turns out to be less than perfect.

1190
01:57:36,189 --> 01:57:44,113
[SPEAKER_44]: The next one is by Matt Weyant, W-E-Y-A-N-T of 134 Auburn Street.

1191
01:57:45,114 --> 01:57:46,355
[SPEAKER_44]: I strongly support the proposed.

1192
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:54,239
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what the comment was.

1193
01:57:54,279 --> 01:57:54,359
[SPEAKER_44]: It's 134.

1194
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:54,779
[SPEAKER_44]: 134 Weyant Street.

1195
01:58:01,804 --> 01:58:06,266
[SPEAKER_44]: I strongly support the proposal to change the school's name to the Belinda Sutton School.

1196
01:58:08,007 --> 01:58:11,408
[SPEAKER_44]: Michael Denton, One Bellevue Terrace.

1197
01:58:13,729 --> 01:58:17,631
[SPEAKER_44]: All three choices are fine, Missittook, Sutton, Sutherland.

1198
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:21,253
[SPEAKER_44]: I would, however, offer the following for your consideration.

1199
01:58:22,533 --> 01:58:28,836
[SPEAKER_44]: Of the three choices, Missittook would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the indigenous people for whom this land was stolen.

1200
01:58:29,977 --> 01:58:34,100
[SPEAKER_44]: in the grand scheme of thing that represents a small step, but a step nonetheless toward healing.

1201
01:58:35,121 --> 01:58:45,489
[SPEAKER_44]: Another of the choices has been Linda Sutton would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the black people who were kidnapped from their homes in Africa and forcibly brought to the country and made to work as slaves.

1202
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:52,474
[SPEAKER_44]: Your third choice, Jean Barry Sutherland would honor the first principal of the school and a person who had a big impact on a number of lives.

1203
01:58:53,455 --> 01:58:55,196
[SPEAKER_44]: On the surface, it seems like a fine choice,

1204
01:58:55,609 --> 01:59:02,634
[SPEAKER_44]: However, given the larger historical, cultural, and societal context in which we are living, it would also be a choice that serves to reinforce the status quo.

1205
01:59:03,435 --> 01:59:12,502
[SPEAKER_44]: I imagine some might be thinking that choosing the name after Jean Barry Sutherland would be a good compromise name because she was a great educator who impacted a lot of our lives.

1206
01:59:13,082 --> 01:59:19,927
[SPEAKER_44]: But please remember this, it's never been more clear than it has over the past five years that this country needs healing.

1207
01:59:21,228 --> 01:59:22,349
[SPEAKER_44]: Shall I go on to a different?

1208
01:59:25,256 --> 01:59:26,616
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, we've got people standing.

1209
01:59:27,117 --> 01:59:29,617
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, yeah, we'll take, and then we have, and then we're gonna go to virtually.

1210
01:59:30,278 --> 01:59:30,938
[SPEAKER_44]: Hello, hello.

1211
01:59:32,078 --> 01:59:36,600
[SPEAKER_50]: Good evening, my name is Kieran Romanowski, and I do not live in Medford.

1212
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:41,221
[SPEAKER_50]: However, I taught in Medford for 35 years as a special educator.

1213
01:59:44,322 --> 01:59:46,843
[SPEAKER_50]: I have known Mrs. Barry Sutherland.

1214
01:59:47,843 --> 01:59:53,085
[SPEAKER_50]: When I first started at the Dame School, she was to me as Jean Barry, and

1215
01:59:54,286 --> 02:00:03,533
[SPEAKER_50]: I have to say that Mrs. Barry Sutherland was the most dedicated teacher and principal at the Dame and the Columbus.

1216
02:00:04,474 --> 02:00:10,598
[SPEAKER_50]: I had the great honor and privilege of being her assistant to the principal from 1998 to 2003.

1217
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:21,106
[SPEAKER_50]: Mrs. Barry Sutherland spent her entire day at the Dame and at the Columbus School

1218
02:00:21,755 --> 02:00:24,977
[SPEAKER_50]: She would start at seven in the morning and leave at seven in the evening.

1219
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:30,001
[SPEAKER_50]: I had the privilege of working with her in inclusion in 1998.

1220
02:00:31,482 --> 02:00:35,745
[SPEAKER_50]: She was a champion for the rights of special needs children.

1221
02:00:36,686 --> 02:00:42,190
[SPEAKER_50]: She advocated for the adaptive learning programs in both the Dame and the Columbus school.

1222
02:00:43,051 --> 02:00:47,574
[SPEAKER_50]: And she spent hours and hours dealing with students with special needs

1223
02:00:48,457 --> 02:00:55,761
[SPEAKER_50]: And she was well-loved and respected by all her colleagues and students at both schools.

1224
02:00:56,641 --> 02:00:57,902
[SPEAKER_50]: And I thank you for your time.

1225
02:00:58,262 --> 02:01:05,965
[SPEAKER_50]: And I also acknowledge that this is the most difficult decision that you have to make in renaming the school.

1226
02:01:06,906 --> 02:01:14,990
[SPEAKER_50]: And I also thank the committee for their long time service in finding the names for renaming the school.

1227
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:15,990
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you very much.

1228
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:17,211
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1229
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:26,931
[SPEAKER_42]: Barbara, Sam, and then Mr. Petrello.

1230
02:01:36,053 --> 02:01:44,254
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, my name is Barbara Panucci and I live at 45 Century Street here in Medford.

1231
02:01:46,735 --> 02:01:47,215
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the

1232
02:01:48,522 --> 02:02:00,527
[SPEAKER_28]: Most, the point that I would like to make is that the currently named Columbus School is the most diverse school in the Medford school system other than the high school.

1233
02:02:01,448 --> 02:02:08,811
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that that's something that needs to be taken into consideration in the naming of the school.

1234
02:02:10,632 --> 02:02:12,353
[SPEAKER_28]: I definitely have my preference.

1235
02:02:13,793 --> 02:02:17,055
[SPEAKER_28]: I do think that the three choices are excellent, but

1236
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:24,875
[SPEAKER_28]: I think the school population, as it is, needs to be part of the decision.

1237
02:02:26,276 --> 02:02:26,676
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1238
02:02:29,378 --> 02:02:29,698
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1239
02:02:30,058 --> 02:02:31,439
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Sam Collins?

1240
02:02:35,702 --> 02:02:36,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everybody.

1241
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:37,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, battery's low, no video.

1242
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:40,725
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm at 172 Jerome in Medford.

1243
02:02:41,986 --> 02:02:43,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I second everything Barbara said.

1244
02:02:43,347 --> 02:02:45,588
[SPEAKER_14]: She made my points gonna be very short.

1245
02:02:46,364 --> 02:02:49,126
[SPEAKER_14]: very diverse and you should listen to what the kids say.

1246
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:54,369
[SPEAKER_14]: My vote is also for Mr. Tuck, but I think we actually are really lucky.

1247
02:02:54,409 --> 02:02:57,071
[SPEAKER_14]: We have three great names, all historically significant.

1248
02:02:57,431 --> 02:02:58,392
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd all be great choices.

1249
02:02:58,872 --> 02:03:00,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's just go with what the kids want.

1250
02:03:00,813 --> 02:03:03,275
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think it happens to be the coolest sounding name.

1251
02:03:03,935 --> 02:03:10,199
[SPEAKER_14]: And a word of caution and a reason that I dialed in, this has been very polite and pleasant for the most part.

1252
02:03:10,779 --> 02:03:14,742
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would just caution people who are worried about divisiveness and negativity,

1253
02:03:15,287 --> 02:03:19,289
[SPEAKER_14]: to be careful how you come across, because many of them have been divisive and negative.

1254
02:03:19,509 --> 02:03:24,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's stay positive, let's support the kids, let's move forward and get the next piece of business.

1255
02:03:24,651 --> 02:03:25,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time.

1256
02:03:27,072 --> 02:03:27,912
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Collins.

1257
02:03:35,175 --> 02:03:40,377
[SPEAKER_27]: John Petrola, I live at 61 Loca Street, Method Mass, lifelong resident.

1258
02:03:41,738 --> 02:03:44,939
[SPEAKER_27]: This school committee has a chance

1259
02:03:45,458 --> 02:03:49,240
[SPEAKER_27]: tonight to bring a community together.

1260
02:03:51,661 --> 02:03:54,703
[SPEAKER_27]: This whole process has been difficult.

1261
02:03:56,984 --> 02:04:04,387
[SPEAKER_27]: It really took a big part of the city and just completely tore it apart.

1262
02:04:06,168 --> 02:04:12,831
[SPEAKER_27]: My personal opinion, which doesn't matter right now, is this process should have never taken place.

1263
02:04:16,687 --> 02:04:17,727
[SPEAKER_27]: You just don't get it.

1264
02:04:17,867 --> 02:04:21,588
[SPEAKER_27]: You're completely avoided.

1265
02:04:22,269 --> 02:04:24,829
[SPEAKER_27]: You didn't listen to this city.

1266
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:27,370
[SPEAKER_27]: You just feel like you avoided us.

1267
02:04:30,911 --> 02:04:32,592
[SPEAKER_27]: Listen, I know it's a tough job.

1268
02:04:32,632 --> 02:04:41,935
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys got your job to do, ladies, but you're just, it's like, we are so left out of this process.

1269
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:44,635
[SPEAKER_27]: That school means a lot.

1270
02:04:44,695 --> 02:04:46,436
[SPEAKER_27]: It meant a lot to my grandparents.

1271
02:04:46,877 --> 02:04:49,017
[SPEAKER_27]: my mother and father, okay?

1272
02:04:49,437 --> 02:04:57,059
[SPEAKER_27]: The things that have been said, I'm not even gonna get into it, the Italian Americans and the cheating and all the other stuff, okay?

1273
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:57,539
[SPEAKER_27]: It hurts.

1274
02:04:58,599 --> 02:05:04,380
[SPEAKER_27]: This school committee tore apart this city and it didn't have to happen.

1275
02:05:09,601 --> 02:05:13,822
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess you all have an opportunity tonight to do the right thing.

1276
02:05:15,037 --> 02:05:18,939
[SPEAKER_27]: I really do think the people that you haven't listened to spoke.

1277
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,560
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay?

1278
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:27,343
[SPEAKER_27]: The amount of votes that Gene Barry, Sutherland received, I mean, that tells you.

1279
02:05:28,144 --> 02:05:29,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Put us back in the process.

1280
02:05:30,245 --> 02:05:30,765
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

1281
02:05:31,185 --> 02:05:32,066
[SPEAKER_27]: We're left out.

1282
02:05:32,126 --> 02:05:33,647
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't want to be left out anymore.

1283
02:05:34,107 --> 02:05:35,087
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a say.

1284
02:05:35,147 --> 02:05:35,768
[SPEAKER_27]: We matter.

1285
02:05:36,308 --> 02:05:36,868
[SPEAKER_27]: We matter.

1286
02:05:37,349 --> 02:05:37,709
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay?

1287
02:05:37,909 --> 02:05:38,329
[SPEAKER_27]: That's it.

1288
02:05:38,569 --> 02:05:39,410
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all I have to say.

1289
02:05:49,362 --> 02:05:53,104
[SPEAKER_44]: I'll continue with reading letters that came in.

1290
02:05:54,685 --> 02:06:05,612
[SPEAKER_44]: From Barry Ingbar of 9 Draper Street, he writes, I support a new name for the Columbus School that is positive, inclusive, and anti-racist.

1291
02:06:06,733 --> 02:06:14,958
[SPEAKER_44]: Terry Biscardi of 28th 9th Street says, I am okay with all three options.

1292
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:17,040
[SPEAKER_44]: I am thankful for changing the name

1293
02:06:17,912 --> 02:06:18,713
[SPEAKER_44]: Columbus School.

1294
02:06:19,273 --> 02:06:24,216
[SPEAKER_44]: Maura Albert of Arlington, we'll skip.

1295
02:06:25,918 --> 02:06:34,243
[SPEAKER_44]: Lisa Eichel says of 19 Dearborn Street, I think it would be a wonderful to rename the Columbus School and hope you'll vote tonight to make this change.

1296
02:06:36,065 --> 02:06:40,348
[SPEAKER_44]: We should have a name that all of the community is comfortable with, not just some.

1297
02:06:41,609 --> 02:06:47,673
[SPEAKER_44]: Maggie Petillo of 32 Irving Street says, just wanted to thank school committee and show my support for renaming.

1298
02:06:48,943 --> 02:06:51,545
[SPEAKER_44]: We want an inclusive anti-racist and progressive name.

1299
02:06:52,186 --> 02:07:11,942
[SPEAKER_44]: Katie Ryan writes, Katie Ryan of 15 Canal Street says, I write to you tonight for the last time to urge you to be strong tonight and to stick to your morals and what you know is right, even in the face of hatred, even when people don't actually know you, disparage you, and accuse you of character traits and political agendas that you do not have.

1300
02:07:13,499 --> 02:07:19,744
[SPEAKER_44]: I am able to write you because I was a recipient of special education services when I was a child in the 1980s and 1990s.

1301
02:07:20,264 --> 02:07:26,669
[SPEAKER_44]: When the Columbus Elementary School was first named, I would not have been able to attend it, and neither would many of my friends and loved ones.

1302
02:07:26,769 --> 02:07:34,134
[SPEAKER_44]: I am glad that progress meant I would be included in schools, even though when kids with disabilities first went to public schools, people didn't like it.

1303
02:07:34,755 --> 02:07:38,758
[SPEAKER_44]: Today, disabled people are included because people fought for change and fought for equality.

1304
02:07:39,158 --> 02:07:41,780
[SPEAKER_44]: People change, times change, and we see positive progress.

1305
02:07:44,278 --> 02:07:45,058
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you very much.

1306
02:07:45,578 --> 02:07:50,420
[SPEAKER_44]: Mimi Oliver writes, I strongly support changing the Columbus School.

1307
02:07:53,681 --> 02:07:56,481
[SPEAKER_44]: Name does not name a particular person.

1308
02:07:58,802 --> 02:08:06,284
[SPEAKER_44]: Katie Lagusa of 93 Gaskin says, I'm writing in support of changing the name of the Columbus School.

1309
02:08:08,865 --> 02:08:13,646
[SPEAKER_44]: So Columbus Day and all of the family emphasis on Columbus Day that followed is related to my family history.

1310
02:08:14,093 --> 02:08:18,674
[SPEAKER_44]: My dad's family immigrated from Sicily and faced discrimination here in the U.S.

1311
02:08:19,255 --> 02:08:25,237
[SPEAKER_44]: My understanding is that Columbus Day was created in part as a way to uplift Italian heritage in the U.S.

1312
02:08:25,277 --> 02:08:26,877
[SPEAKER_44]: and to ease tensions between the U.S.

1313
02:08:26,917 --> 02:08:27,357
[SPEAKER_44]: and Italy.

1314
02:08:30,358 --> 02:08:35,680
[SPEAKER_44]: Columbus was one of the many people who changed the world through colonialism and capitalism.

1315
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:42,522
[SPEAKER_44]: All students should learn about him and the truly new interconnected world he helped to bring about as they study history.

1316
02:08:42,858 --> 02:08:51,582
[SPEAKER_44]: but I do not want my children to have to extend a school named after someone who represents the beginning of an era of mass exploitation.

1317
02:08:51,802 --> 02:08:52,562
[SPEAKER_44]: What is the holdup?

1318
02:08:55,924 --> 02:08:59,486
[SPEAKER_44]: I love the idea of naming our school after a local courageous and creative person.

1319
02:09:01,026 --> 02:09:11,211
[SPEAKER_44]: Lisa Foss of 78 Sagamore Ave says, while I understand that when the Columbus School was named, the name was chosen with the best intentions and I believe that should be remembered.

1320
02:09:11,598 --> 02:09:18,104
[SPEAKER_44]: However, as we become more aware of how we have neglected to meet the needs of everyone in our community, I truly believe it is time to change the name.

1321
02:09:19,505 --> 02:09:26,751
[SPEAKER_44]: Diane Bellinger writes, I am writing in support of changing the name of the Columbus School to something more positive, inclusive, and anti-racist.

1322
02:09:27,232 --> 02:09:33,237
[SPEAKER_44]: I stand with the children of the Columbus who chose Missitook or Belinda Sutton as the new name for their school.

1323
02:09:33,657 --> 02:09:36,900
[SPEAKER_44]: Teresa Racicot of One Bellevue Terrace writes,

1324
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:47,166
[SPEAKER_44]: The three names you were voting on are all fine choices, but two of the names show conscious thought of Medford moving towards a more inclusive and anti-racist future.

1325
02:09:48,607 --> 02:10:02,194
[SPEAKER_44]: When we think of the horrendous acts of genocide, renaming the school to honor either the indigenous name, this area, or to honor a black woman enslaved at the royal house, who was the first African to ask for reparations.

1326
02:10:02,654 --> 02:10:05,355
[SPEAKER_44]: Clearly one can see that either name is a good choice towards healing.

1327
02:10:05,795 --> 02:10:07,236
[SPEAKER_44]: I hope that you vote for one of these.

1328
02:10:07,296 --> 02:10:08,037
[SPEAKER_44]: This is my ask.

1329
02:10:09,153 --> 02:10:10,033
[SPEAKER_44]: That's Teresa.

1330
02:10:11,314 --> 02:10:16,136
[SPEAKER_44]: T. Stash, this message is to support the name change of the Columbus School.

1331
02:10:16,516 --> 02:10:20,078
[SPEAKER_44]: I believe the name should be new, inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.

1332
02:10:20,478 --> 02:10:21,839
[SPEAKER_44]: She's of 7 Wildwood Road.

1333
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:24,920
[SPEAKER_44]: There weren't more.

1334
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:26,421
[SPEAKER_47]: OK, I'll give you a break.

1335
02:10:26,461 --> 02:10:27,481
[SPEAKER_47]: Is that OK?

1336
02:10:27,521 --> 02:10:31,823
[SPEAKER_47]: We're going virtual to Jessica.

1337
02:10:37,688 --> 02:10:38,248
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

1338
02:10:38,688 --> 02:10:40,709
[SPEAKER_31]: I wanted to thank you for letting me speak.

1339
02:10:43,371 --> 02:10:47,353
[SPEAKER_31]: As far as the choices, I know that you've already made your address on the record, please.

1340
02:10:47,973 --> 02:10:48,433
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1341
02:10:48,453 --> 02:10:51,215
[SPEAKER_31]: 622 Boston Ave, lifelong Medford resident.

1342
02:10:53,696 --> 02:10:54,996
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to say a couple of things.

1343
02:10:55,076 --> 02:11:00,719
[SPEAKER_31]: So first of all, sometimes change for the sake of change is not necessarily the best way to go.

1344
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:05,882
[SPEAKER_31]: Secondly, you have been derelict in your duties for our children.

1345
02:11:06,550 --> 02:11:16,474
[SPEAKER_31]: during a crucial time in their lives where they were without direction, you decided to do this underhandedly and deceptively.

1346
02:11:17,374 --> 02:11:24,217
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to remind this committee also that the Constitution of this country states that discrimination based upon sex,

1347
02:11:25,032 --> 02:11:30,273
[SPEAKER_31]: national origin, religion, and color is not okay.

1348
02:11:30,833 --> 02:11:40,375
[SPEAKER_31]: So just because you're going to change the name for against Italian Americans and put a black American in there, doesn't mean you're not continuing to be discriminatory.

1349
02:11:41,156 --> 02:11:43,156
[SPEAKER_31]: Italian Americans live in South Medford.

1350
02:11:43,756 --> 02:11:45,257
[SPEAKER_31]: We love that area.

1351
02:11:45,637 --> 02:11:47,317
[SPEAKER_31]: And just for a point of information, Mayor,

1352
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:50,621
[SPEAKER_31]: South Medford booth where you got most of your votes from.

1353
02:11:51,262 --> 02:11:55,925
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm going to say to you that you should really look into your consciences and think about what you're doing.

1354
02:11:56,305 --> 02:12:01,508
[SPEAKER_31]: Think about whether you're serving the children of this city the way that you swore to do.

1355
02:12:02,248 --> 02:12:04,089
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I'm going to tell you, you have not.

1356
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:13,295
[SPEAKER_31]: And I would appreciate this committee to stop being discriminatory under the Constitution of this country against my national origin.

1357
02:12:13,795 --> 02:12:14,215
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1358
02:12:15,356 --> 02:12:16,717
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Jessica.

1359
02:12:23,938 --> 02:12:24,778
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Seth Hill.

1360
02:12:31,761 --> 02:12:35,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1361
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:38,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to speak.

1362
02:12:38,343 --> 02:12:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I had submitted a letter to the school committee as well.

1363
02:12:46,366 --> 02:12:47,366
[SPEAKER_47]: Your address for the record, please.

1364
02:12:49,264 --> 02:12:50,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

1365
02:12:50,665 --> 02:12:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm sorry.

1366
02:12:52,206 --> 02:12:54,807
[SPEAKER_06]: 34 Henry Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1367
02:12:56,048 --> 02:12:59,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, my name is Seth Hill.

1368
02:13:03,732 --> 02:13:04,052
[SPEAKER_06]: All set?

1369
02:13:05,032 --> 02:13:05,953
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, please.

1370
02:13:06,673 --> 02:13:07,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1371
02:13:09,235 --> 02:13:13,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I had sent a item in because I thought I had family commitments this evening.

1372
02:13:13,577 --> 02:13:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm now able to join.

1373
02:13:16,661 --> 02:13:20,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to read my letter in to the record.

1374
02:13:22,044 --> 02:13:31,790
[SPEAKER_06]: My letter reads, Madam Mayor, other members of the school committee, fellow former members of the advisory committee, and other members of our community.

1375
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:41,896
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Seth Hill, and I recently had the honor to serve as one of the many members of the advisory committee to rename the Columbus School.

1376
02:13:42,956 --> 02:13:44,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I was excited to do so.

1377
02:13:50,151 --> 02:13:58,955
[SPEAKER_06]: At age 10, she's the same age as those who Columbus and his crew would abduct for enslavement and sex trafficking.

1378
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:03,137
[SPEAKER_06]: A better name to memorialize was sorely needed.

1379
02:14:04,178 --> 02:14:08,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbus was raised up as a hero through a false narrative that left out the brutality of his story.

1380
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:14,383
[SPEAKER_06]: His own contemporaries imprisoned him and stripped him of his honors because of it.

1381
02:14:15,243 --> 02:14:17,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And those titles were never returned to him.

1382
02:14:17,884 --> 02:14:18,685
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the wrong choice.

1383
02:14:19,462 --> 02:14:21,143
[SPEAKER_06]: but not entirely for the wrong reasons.

1384
02:14:21,903 --> 02:14:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: His name was used to lift up an immigrant group that was being wrongly marginalized with much of the same hateful xenophobic language then as we hear now with other groups, criminality, racial inferiority, radical politics, religious heresy and extremism, economic impact on the job market or social services, et cetera, et cetera.

1385
02:14:46,034 --> 02:14:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the opportunity to do better tonight.

1386
02:14:49,738 --> 02:14:53,479
[SPEAKER_06]: There are names that explicitly address the racism that's still prevalent in our community.

1387
02:14:54,500 --> 02:15:03,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Our community recently censured former committee member, Melissa Miguel for remarks that continue to erase.

1388
02:15:04,363 --> 02:15:11,346
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, calm down, calm down.

1389
02:15:11,946 --> 02:15:13,927
[SPEAKER_42]: No names, no names, please.

1390
02:15:15,627 --> 02:15:16,968
[SPEAKER_06]: These were remarks on the record.

1391
02:15:20,521 --> 02:15:22,221
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not.

1392
02:15:23,822 --> 02:15:27,103
[SPEAKER_42]: How much longer did he have?

1393
02:15:31,744 --> 02:15:33,764
[SPEAKER_47]: There's been some negativity on both sides.

1394
02:15:33,864 --> 02:15:39,586
[SPEAKER_48]: Please, please.

1395
02:15:39,986 --> 02:15:41,166
[SPEAKER_43]: Miss Kelly Cunha.

1396
02:15:51,092 --> 02:15:52,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, my name is Kelly Cunha.

1397
02:15:53,064 --> 02:15:54,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at 20 Walter Street.

1398
02:15:55,851 --> 02:15:59,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to share, I have a preference for the name.

1399
02:15:59,453 --> 02:16:02,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to share what it is, because at this point, I don't think it matters.

1400
02:16:03,416 --> 02:16:07,739
[SPEAKER_15]: I want it to reflect, like previous people have said, what the students and the diversity.

1401
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:13,942
[SPEAKER_15]: What I wanted to say was that if my name that I really want doesn't get chosen, I'm going to be OK.

1402
02:16:13,963 --> 02:16:16,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want everyone to know that you're going to be OK.

1403
02:16:17,885 --> 02:16:22,028
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a little concerned with what I've seen tonight and the literal being

1404
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:27,381
[SPEAKER_15]: being sent at our elected officials and at each other.

1405
02:16:27,461 --> 02:16:33,484
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just, I think we all have to take a step back, realize that at the end of the day, we have three choices.

1406
02:16:33,584 --> 02:16:35,885
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all good choices, I think.

1407
02:16:35,925 --> 02:16:38,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I have a very strong preference.

1408
02:16:38,305 --> 02:16:46,008
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if I don't get what I want, I'm going to model for my daughters in the Medford public school system that it's okay.

1409
02:16:46,148 --> 02:16:52,851
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the end of the day, the most important thing is how we treat each other and how we talk to each other and that

1410
02:16:53,462 --> 02:16:55,923
[SPEAKER_15]: we are working to be better in every way.

1411
02:16:55,983 --> 02:16:58,424
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just really want to caution everybody.

1412
02:16:58,724 --> 02:17:04,906
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually a little nervous and scared when we have, when people say what the name is of what's going to happen.

1413
02:17:04,926 --> 02:17:09,308
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's actually really sad to me that I feel that way.

1414
02:17:10,048 --> 02:17:15,570
[SPEAKER_15]: We talk a lot about divisiveness, but maybe we need to reflect on who we are in our own particular

1415
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:24,655
[SPEAKER_15]: responses to people where the ones that are calling out devices and stuff are also the ones screaming and yelling and saying derogatory things on both sides of everything.

1416
02:17:24,755 --> 02:17:25,756
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just wanted to say that.

1417
02:17:25,776 --> 02:17:29,198
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's all take a minute to reflect and just think we can all handle this.

1418
02:17:29,238 --> 02:17:32,439
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a name and no matter what the choice is, it'll be okay.

1419
02:17:39,563 --> 02:17:40,164
[SPEAKER_47]: Greta?

1420
02:17:42,905 --> 02:17:44,066
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1421
02:17:46,089 --> 02:17:51,851
[SPEAKER_54]: Hi, so my name is Greta Rubinstein, 52 Ashcroft Road in Medford.

1422
02:17:52,591 --> 02:17:58,994
[SPEAKER_54]: So I came here tonight liking all the names and not really having a clear choice, but now I think I do.

1423
02:17:59,014 --> 02:18:10,478
[SPEAKER_54]: It's Belinda Sutton because I noticed that almost everyone who stood up and talked about wanting their voices heard or not having a voice or not being listened to are all white people.

1424
02:18:11,198 --> 02:18:15,800
[SPEAKER_54]: So the point is actually that white people have a voice and have been heard.

1425
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:27,985
[SPEAKER_54]: So I just wanted to say the people there that feel upset about not having their voices heard or votes count, that's exactly what Native people and people of color feel like all the time.

1426
02:18:28,005 --> 02:18:33,347
[SPEAKER_54]: I vote for Belinda Stutton, but mostly I'm just thrilled it'll no longer be the Columbus.

1427
02:18:33,867 --> 02:18:34,307
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1428
02:18:36,008 --> 02:18:36,388
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1429
02:18:36,508 --> 02:18:36,808
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1430
02:18:48,474 --> 02:18:50,495
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Gordon, if you could just put the microphone on for them.

1431
02:18:51,335 --> 02:18:53,476
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1432
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:58,058
[SPEAKER_43]: Donna Lanzelli, 16 Benham Street, lifelong resident of Medford.

1433
02:18:58,439 --> 02:19:02,060
[SPEAKER_43]: All four of my children went to Columbus School, Dame School, Columbus School.

1434
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:05,082
[SPEAKER_43]: They all, like I said, had Miss Barry for their principal.

1435
02:19:05,422 --> 02:19:08,404
[SPEAKER_43]: Two of them dyslexic, thank goodness for Jean Barry Sutherland.

1436
02:19:08,764 --> 02:19:09,904
[SPEAKER_43]: Wouldn't be where they are today.

1437
02:19:10,184 --> 02:19:11,385
[SPEAKER_43]: One's a teacher, one's a firefighter.

1438
02:19:12,174 --> 02:19:16,035
[SPEAKER_43]: But what I want to do is I just want to reiterate the three candidates.

1439
02:19:16,455 --> 02:19:20,057
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, I'm not knocking any of them, but there is a place for each one of them.

1440
02:19:21,297 --> 02:19:26,739
[SPEAKER_43]: The Missituck, like again, I don't see that as a role model for our students, our citizens.

1441
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:28,299
[SPEAKER_43]: I just, I don't get that.

1442
02:19:28,419 --> 02:19:30,740
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm sorry if I'm sounding like it, but I don't get it.

1443
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:35,281
[SPEAKER_43]: And what Kathy said, this is something that we need to be cautious of.

1444
02:19:35,661 --> 02:19:37,382
[SPEAKER_43]: There is proposal, there is a bill.

1445
02:19:37,955 --> 02:19:42,259
[SPEAKER_43]: saying no public schools can use a Native American name.

1446
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,181
[SPEAKER_43]: That's happening now.

1447
02:19:44,261 --> 02:19:46,804
[SPEAKER_43]: Who's to say in two years, this is going to go further.

1448
02:19:46,844 --> 02:19:47,565
[SPEAKER_43]: It's going to be building.

1449
02:19:47,605 --> 02:19:48,426
[SPEAKER_43]: It's going to be parks.

1450
02:19:48,446 --> 02:19:50,307
[SPEAKER_43]: You're going to be doing this all over again.

1451
02:19:51,569 --> 02:19:52,990
[SPEAKER_43]: I just think stay clear of that.

1452
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:56,694
[SPEAKER_32]: Belinda Sutton, by all means, I respect her story.

1453
02:19:57,213 --> 02:19:59,414
[SPEAKER_36]: But you know what, her story belongs at the Royal House.

1454
02:19:59,774 --> 02:20:07,958
[SPEAKER_36]: In all my years, in all my years living in Medford, all my visits to the Royal House, never once did I hear about Belinda Sutton.

1455
02:20:08,858 --> 02:20:11,259
[SPEAKER_43]: I didn't hear about Belinda Sutton until last June.

1456
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,361
[SPEAKER_43]: Again, it's time for, you know what, let's learn about her.

1457
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:18,783
[SPEAKER_43]: Do something for her at the Royal House, be it a statue, name a building after her.

1458
02:20:19,083 --> 02:20:20,223
[SPEAKER_43]: But again, it's a shame.

1459
02:20:20,363 --> 02:20:22,905
[SPEAKER_43]: You can ask any kid, how many visits do you take to the Royal House?

1460
02:20:23,165 --> 02:20:24,445
[SPEAKER_31]: Never ever spoke of her.

1461
02:20:24,905 --> 02:20:25,986
[SPEAKER_31]: Again, let's honor her.

1462
02:20:26,545 --> 02:20:27,305
[SPEAKER_31]: at the Royal House.

1463
02:20:27,626 --> 02:20:28,746
[SPEAKER_39]: That is her place.

1464
02:20:29,086 --> 02:20:29,787
[SPEAKER_39]: That's her history.

1465
02:20:29,847 --> 02:20:31,047
[SPEAKER_39]: That is for us to learn.

1466
02:20:31,968 --> 02:20:35,949
[SPEAKER_43]: Jean Barry Sutherland, her name needs to be across that top of that school.

1467
02:20:36,410 --> 02:20:37,370
[SPEAKER_43]: That is her place.

1468
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,671
[SPEAKER_43]: She was the first principal.

1469
02:20:38,731 --> 02:20:39,671
[SPEAKER_43]: She was an educator.

1470
02:20:39,931 --> 02:20:43,973
[SPEAKER_43]: Not only did she do for the students of Medford, she did for the city of Medford.

1471
02:20:44,353 --> 02:20:47,515
[SPEAKER_43]: She is someone that is a role model to all of us.

1472
02:20:48,475 --> 02:20:50,376
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think we all, we know that.

1473
02:20:50,396 --> 02:20:52,417
[SPEAKER_43]: I don't understand what the pushback is here.

1474
02:20:53,686 --> 02:20:58,370
[SPEAKER_43]: Jean Barry Sutherland, without a doubt, should be named the new Columbus School.

1475
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:00,791
[SPEAKER_43]: I mean, she's our role model.

1476
02:21:00,971 --> 02:21:02,813
[SPEAKER_43]: She's a historic role model.

1477
02:21:02,853 --> 02:21:04,634
[SPEAKER_31]: In years to come, people will be talking about her.

1478
02:21:04,814 --> 02:21:05,895
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll be talking about her forever.

1479
02:21:05,915 --> 02:21:10,238
[SPEAKER_31]: Melinda Sutton, the name is just not going to stick with someone.

1480
02:21:10,258 --> 02:21:12,140
[SPEAKER_31]: They're not going to look at that name and learn from her.

1481
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:13,861
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to learn from her at the Royal House.

1482
02:21:14,181 --> 02:21:14,301
[SPEAKER_31]: Ms.

1483
02:21:14,321 --> 02:21:18,104
[SPEAKER_31]: Suttuck, that's a little iffy, because again, that proposal is going through.

1484
02:21:18,585 --> 02:21:20,566
[SPEAKER_31]: There'll be no Native American names on anything.

1485
02:21:21,167 --> 02:21:23,088
[SPEAKER_31]: So again, let's choose wisely.

1486
02:21:33,598 --> 02:21:34,118
[SPEAKER_41]: Jessica.

1487
02:21:40,483 --> 02:21:43,786
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Jessica Zubart, 79 Governors Ave.

1488
02:21:44,326 --> 02:21:46,188
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to offer a point of clarification.

1489
02:21:46,228 --> 02:21:53,353
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not chiming in to just kind of say my preference for a particular name, but I think there's a sort of a dangerous misunderstanding.

1490
02:21:53,393 --> 02:21:59,177
[SPEAKER_32]: I believe it's Bill S294, which there've been several mentions to about,

1491
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:09,066
[SPEAKER_32]: legislation saying that there will be sort of prohibited naming against or for Native American cultures or tribes.

1492
02:22:09,086 --> 02:22:14,670
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just wanted to read what that bill actually says just so that we're all clear because it actually refers to mascots.

1493
02:22:15,111 --> 02:22:27,119
[SPEAKER_32]: The board of elementary and secondary education shall promulgate regulations prohibiting public schools from using an athletic team name, logo or mascot, which names refers to represents or is associated

1494
02:22:27,452 --> 02:22:33,455
[SPEAKER_32]: with Native Americans, including aspects of Native American cultures and specific Native American tribes.

1495
02:22:33,935 --> 02:22:40,458
[SPEAKER_32]: The board shall establish a date by which any school in violation of said regulations shall choose a new team name, logo, or mascot.

1496
02:22:40,778 --> 02:22:54,004
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we recognize and can appreciate that there has been a movement to remove mascots that really sort of don't pay homage to the Native American culture and are using it to actually just make money.

1497
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:59,902
[SPEAKER_32]: and further capitalize on culture that has already been decimated by Americans.

1498
02:23:00,122 --> 02:23:03,743
[SPEAKER_32]: So with that, I do want to thank everyone that's done a lot of work here.

1499
02:23:03,803 --> 02:23:06,384
[SPEAKER_32]: I think a gentleman earlier asked, what are your priorities?

1500
02:23:06,824 --> 02:23:16,527
[SPEAKER_32]: And personally, it seems to me, and this is the uncomfortable truth, that the priority has been intended to be inclusive of a full community, not just a vocal community.

1501
02:23:18,917 --> 02:23:24,520
[SPEAKER_32]: few on both sides of this, but rather inclusive of everyone in this Medford community.

1502
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:29,022
[SPEAKER_32]: So regardless of how long you've lived here, I actually have not, I'm not a lifelong member of Medford.

1503
02:23:29,322 --> 02:23:38,046
[SPEAKER_32]: And at times I actually feel it's very not inclusive for everyone to kind of talk about how long you have to live here in order to have a voice or in order to feel valued.

1504
02:23:38,326 --> 02:23:47,010
[SPEAKER_32]: So personally, I'm actually quite happy to see Mr. Tuck mentioned, and I was actually very pleased to see that the students voted for it as well.

1505
02:23:47,271 --> 02:23:48,091
[SPEAKER_32]: So I thank you for your time.

1506
02:23:51,732 --> 02:23:53,233
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Shelly.

1507
02:23:59,358 --> 02:23:59,839
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1508
02:23:59,859 --> 02:24:00,639
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you hear me?

1509
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:02,101
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1510
02:24:02,201 --> 02:24:04,382
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address of the record, please.

1511
02:24:04,563 --> 02:24:05,884
[SPEAKER_23]: 32 Pearl Street, Medford, Mass.

1512
02:24:09,687 --> 02:24:10,027
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks.

1513
02:24:10,207 --> 02:24:12,069
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to make two points.

1514
02:24:12,769 --> 02:24:13,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Firstly,

1515
02:24:13,914 --> 02:24:22,079
[SPEAKER_23]: The entire point of education is to expand our perspective and to understand an event in the context of time and place.

1516
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:31,606
[SPEAKER_23]: And so if we're able to do that around a personality and a historical character like Columbus, we can also do that for Miss Belinda Sutton.

1517
02:24:31,646 --> 02:24:33,827
[SPEAKER_23]: We can also do that for the Mississippi community.

1518
02:24:34,968 --> 02:24:36,549
[SPEAKER_23]: We have no business not doing so.

1519
02:24:37,129 --> 02:24:38,510
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't make any sense.

1520
02:24:38,831 --> 02:24:41,353
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm really struggling with the response here tonight.

1521
02:24:42,094 --> 02:24:57,788
[SPEAKER_23]: And secondly, make no mistake, the reason that we don't have data and facts on Belinda Sutton or Native American culture, community history, is because white people did not allow the dignity of humanity to have that data preserved and collected.

1522
02:24:58,308 --> 02:24:58,669
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1523
02:25:01,411 --> 02:25:01,812
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1524
02:25:02,572 --> 02:25:03,233
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Kloet?

1525
02:25:03,854 --> 02:25:05,815
[SPEAKER_47]: Do you have more emails, if you're not ready?

1526
02:25:06,155 --> 02:25:07,656
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, could you give me a second?

1527
02:25:07,696 --> 02:25:07,896
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1528
02:25:11,397 --> 02:25:18,000
[SPEAKER_47]: Would anybody else like to speak that is present tonight before we wrap up the emails and start our debate?

1529
02:25:22,002 --> 02:25:24,243
[SPEAKER_47]: We have Mrs. O, and then take your time.

1530
02:25:27,744 --> 02:25:28,985
[SPEAKER_47]: Microphone, Mr. Gordon, please.

1531
02:25:29,005 --> 02:25:32,346
[SPEAKER_29]: Is it ready?

1532
02:25:33,674 --> 02:25:36,636
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Dorothy Dizzo, I live at 8 Fenham Street in Medford.

1533
02:25:37,437 --> 02:25:43,221
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to say that I had three children go through Medford Public Schools, one who is now a teacher in the Medford Public Schools.

1534
02:25:44,882 --> 02:25:47,184
[SPEAKER_29]: Jean Barry Sutherland really brought a lot to them.

1535
02:25:47,384 --> 02:25:54,309
[SPEAKER_29]: I showed up there with Frankie and then two years later came with Kerry and then nine years later I came in with Tyler.

1536
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:58,492
[SPEAKER_29]: Jean Barry met all three of my children that day at the gate.

1537
02:25:59,701 --> 02:26:05,063
[SPEAKER_29]: From there, Tyler went up to Columbus, Frank and Kerry were now in high school, and she met us up there again.

1538
02:26:05,083 --> 02:26:08,043
[SPEAKER_29]: I have nothing but good things to say about her.

1539
02:26:08,163 --> 02:26:10,404
[SPEAKER_29]: My children have gone so far because of her.

1540
02:26:11,264 --> 02:26:15,926
[SPEAKER_29]: And also, the James School in Columbus was a family, and that's all because of her.

1541
02:26:16,326 --> 02:26:17,446
[SPEAKER_29]: She brought us together.

1542
02:26:18,006 --> 02:26:24,468
[SPEAKER_29]: She brought our kids up there, and we're meeting all new students and new parents and new families, and we all became one big family there.

1543
02:26:25,407 --> 02:26:30,808
[SPEAKER_29]: So deep down, I think she belongs there, her name belongs there, and her legacy needs to stay there.

1544
02:26:31,148 --> 02:26:31,628
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1545
02:26:43,011 --> 02:26:47,352
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, sorry, how many devices?

1546
02:26:48,292 --> 02:26:48,532
[SPEAKER_44]: From

1547
02:26:49,659 --> 02:26:51,981
[SPEAKER_44]: Tamara Morrow of 7 Wildwood Road.

1548
02:26:52,481 --> 02:26:55,544
[SPEAKER_44]: The message is to support the name change of the Columbus School.

1549
02:26:55,644 --> 02:27:01,188
[SPEAKER_44]: I believe the name should be new, inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.

1550
02:27:02,109 --> 02:27:04,971
[SPEAKER_44]: Lauren Zawanda of 14 Webster Street.

1551
02:27:05,271 --> 02:27:08,034
[SPEAKER_44]: I support the Columbus name change.

1552
02:27:08,814 --> 02:27:11,516
[SPEAKER_44]: I want something positive, inclusive for all of our children.

1553
02:27:12,437 --> 02:27:13,978
[SPEAKER_44]: Seth Hill we heard from.

1554
02:27:14,899 --> 02:27:17,221
[SPEAKER_44]: Kate Elwell, my name,

1555
02:27:17,785 --> 02:27:20,307
[SPEAKER_44]: is Kate Elwell, and I live at 55 Windsor Road.

1556
02:27:21,247 --> 02:27:24,929
[SPEAKER_44]: My children will be starting kindergarten at the formerly Columbus School.

1557
02:27:25,390 --> 02:27:26,691
[SPEAKER_44]: I support renaming the school.

1558
02:27:26,751 --> 02:27:28,031
[SPEAKER_44]: I like all three choices.

1559
02:27:28,692 --> 02:27:36,096
[SPEAKER_44]: Julia Roberts, again, supports any of the choices, just would like to change.

1560
02:27:36,156 --> 02:27:38,098
[SPEAKER_44]: That's 254 Arlington Street.

1561
02:27:38,978 --> 02:27:40,059
[SPEAKER_44]: Jennifer Yanko.

1562
02:27:44,341 --> 02:27:46,603
[SPEAKER_44]: I support the change of the Columbus School.

1563
02:27:47,502 --> 02:27:50,623
[SPEAKER_44]: and does not specify which of the names.

1564
02:27:51,064 --> 02:27:51,964
[SPEAKER_44]: Jessica Farrell.

1565
02:27:54,885 --> 02:27:59,647
[SPEAKER_44]: My preference among the names is the one the student survey showed most support for, Missituck.

1566
02:28:01,268 --> 02:28:03,869
[SPEAKER_44]: Monica Rushford of 44 West Street.

1567
02:28:04,009 --> 02:28:09,611
[SPEAKER_44]: I urge you to adopt a new inclusive positive name, anti-racist name at tonight's meeting.

1568
02:28:09,651 --> 02:28:10,492
[SPEAKER_44]: The time is now.

1569
02:28:11,652 --> 02:28:16,154
[SPEAKER_44]: Christine, sorry, Wendy Cliggett.

1570
02:28:16,838 --> 02:28:20,981
[SPEAKER_44]: of 7 West Street.

1571
02:28:22,322 --> 02:28:23,302
[SPEAKER_44]: This is a longer one.

1572
02:28:27,004 --> 02:28:33,448
[SPEAKER_44]: It is my hope that the school committee will choose the name Mistah, the Native American word for the Mystic River, meaning the great tidal river.

1573
02:28:34,269 --> 02:28:37,331
[SPEAKER_44]: It is the backbone of Medford and what binds us as a community.

1574
02:28:38,732 --> 02:28:40,713
[SPEAKER_44]: People originally settled here because of the river.

1575
02:28:40,853 --> 02:28:43,114
[SPEAKER_44]: Over the years, it was misused, polluted, and neglected.

1576
02:28:43,495 --> 02:28:44,075
[SPEAKER_44]: Many did not

1577
02:28:44,639 --> 02:28:48,362
[SPEAKER_44]: realized that the river was polluted due to its beauty and seemingly healthy flow.

1578
02:28:49,663 --> 02:28:55,867
[SPEAKER_44]: Raw sewage was expelled into the river.

1579
02:28:56,788 --> 02:28:59,210
[SPEAKER_44]: And she goes on speaking about the river.

1580
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:05,875
[SPEAKER_44]: Mrs. Tuck reminds us of those who came before us and our obligation to respect our city's lifeblood and our planet.

1581
02:29:06,675 --> 02:29:12,960
[SPEAKER_44]: It would be naming the school for our river is symbolic of the common bonds that flow through our city.

1582
02:29:17,088 --> 02:29:17,709
[SPEAKER_44]: That was Wendy.

1583
02:29:18,730 --> 02:29:24,014
[SPEAKER_44]: Then this is Christina McGuarty.

1584
02:29:24,315 --> 02:29:27,898
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for continuing to work toward getting a new name for the Columbus School.

1585
02:29:30,821 --> 02:29:37,627
[SPEAKER_44]: The children at CES voted, and Misato came in first, Belinda Sutton second, and Jean Barrett came in third.

1586
02:29:37,687 --> 02:29:39,949
[SPEAKER_44]: I think it's important that everyone knows how they voted.

1587
02:29:42,099 --> 02:29:46,702
[SPEAKER_44]: Many adults have made this issue so divisive over the last year and they see the names as choosing sides.

1588
02:29:47,122 --> 02:29:49,943
[SPEAKER_44]: I think we owe it to the kids to take their thoughts into consideration.

1589
02:29:50,404 --> 02:30:00,469
[SPEAKER_44]: I also think Mr. Tuck best addresses the request of many of the teachers at the Columbus Elementary School to have a name that wasn't in honor of an individual and to not make anyone feel left out.

1590
02:30:04,631 --> 02:30:07,353
[SPEAKER_44]: Lisa Hodson, I live on Lyman Avenue.

1591
02:30:08,554 --> 02:30:09,314
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, she spoke, sorry.

1592
02:30:12,763 --> 02:30:13,424
[SPEAKER_44]: Jen Lewis.

1593
02:30:15,725 --> 02:30:19,889
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, sorry, that was about the, she supports the electric car charging.

1594
02:30:22,511 --> 02:30:23,472
[SPEAKER_44]: Ingrid Moncada.

1595
02:30:28,576 --> 02:30:30,318
[SPEAKER_44]: Has her kids in the Columbus School.

1596
02:30:30,418 --> 02:30:33,080
[SPEAKER_44]: I feel very grateful that the name is going to be changed.

1597
02:30:35,267 --> 02:30:39,590
[SPEAKER_44]: When I listened to the letter that the Columbus teachers wrote to the committee, I found myself in complete agreement.

1598
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:45,615
[SPEAKER_44]: In the letter, they point out that renaming the school with the name of a place rather than a person is a more neutral option.

1599
02:30:46,175 --> 02:30:48,757
[SPEAKER_44]: Therefore, I'm writing in support of the name, Missituck.

1600
02:30:51,699 --> 02:31:02,107
[SPEAKER_44]: Jen Zawadsas, 20 Corrine Road, that's Z-A-W-A-D-Z-K-A-S, sorry for the mispronunciation.

1601
02:31:03,381 --> 02:31:06,403
[SPEAKER_44]: I would like to end my voice to support Mr. Orr Sutton.

1602
02:31:08,424 --> 02:31:14,267
[SPEAKER_44]: Scott Sitaki, 131 Budget Ave, Burgett Ave in Medford.

1603
02:31:18,089 --> 02:31:24,652
[SPEAKER_44]: Please note that how many people talk in favor of the name tonight's student effective results, community participation is not a vote.

1604
02:31:28,674 --> 02:31:30,395
[SPEAKER_44]: We just received

1605
02:31:31,092 --> 02:31:39,317
[SPEAKER_44]: And the last one that I have right now is from Jack McGoldrick, father of third grader, Ethan McGoldrick of the Columbus.

1606
02:31:39,897 --> 02:31:51,363
[SPEAKER_44]: I hear the children of the school have chosen either the name Misituk in honor of the Native American tribe or Belinda Sutton in honor of the woman who helped initiate an end to slavery in the area.

1607
02:31:52,244 --> 02:31:54,865
[SPEAKER_44]: I think those are great names and I stand behind the children's choices 100%.

1608
02:31:55,005 --> 02:31:57,206
[SPEAKER_44]: Please add my vote alongside theirs.

1609
02:31:57,446 --> 02:31:58,307
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Member Rancic.

1610
02:32:04,824 --> 02:32:08,987
[SPEAKER_37]: Good evening, Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street, Medford.

1611
02:32:09,988 --> 02:32:12,070
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to try and remain positive.

1612
02:32:12,130 --> 02:32:13,831
[SPEAKER_37]: I had a very negative speech.

1613
02:32:15,132 --> 02:32:18,355
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll forego that because the request was to remain positive.

1614
02:32:19,196 --> 02:32:27,543
[SPEAKER_37]: I will tell you that I wish I had the privilege of having Jean Barry Sutherland as my principal.

1615
02:32:32,503 --> 02:32:44,533
[SPEAKER_37]: I will tell you that when I went to school, my principal did not shake our hands or hug us or greet us at the door.

1616
02:32:45,053 --> 02:32:59,125
[SPEAKER_37]: She just used her finger like this to single someone out of at least a dozen people for bad behavior and you came and the rest was, you know, not pleasant.

1617
02:32:59,765 --> 02:33:01,907
[SPEAKER_37]: But certainly in this context,

1618
02:33:03,095 --> 02:33:08,499
[SPEAKER_37]: Jean Barry Sutherland, this is a school, an institution of learning.

1619
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,742
[SPEAKER_37]: Belinda Sutton's story is marvelous.

1620
02:33:12,823 --> 02:33:14,984
[SPEAKER_37]: She was illiterate.

1621
02:33:16,165 --> 02:33:31,597
[SPEAKER_37]: And I would just, I was thinking, I'm sure if Jean Barry Sutherland knew Belinda Sutton, she probably would have greeted her at the door, hugged her and said, come on,

1622
02:33:32,637 --> 02:33:37,221
[SPEAKER_37]: let's get you ready to learn to read and write.

1623
02:33:37,241 --> 02:33:40,745
[SPEAKER_37]: I think this was the type of person she was.

1624
02:33:44,268 --> 02:33:48,452
[SPEAKER_37]: She really, I mean, from all accounts, she was amazing.

1625
02:33:49,173 --> 02:33:53,417
[SPEAKER_37]: And this is, again, an educational institution.

1626
02:33:55,339 --> 02:33:57,621
[SPEAKER_37]: What better context, what better

1627
02:33:58,524 --> 02:34:07,307
[SPEAKER_37]: What better way to honor the profession of educators than to name it after a wonderful, wonderful educator.

1628
02:34:08,668 --> 02:34:20,652
[SPEAKER_37]: And I will just say, I have to say this, this should have been put to a vote on a ballot so all of Medford's citizens could voice their desire.

1629
02:34:21,433 --> 02:34:21,933
[SPEAKER_37]: One minute.

1630
02:34:24,711 --> 02:34:32,999
[SPEAKER_37]: I for one would accept that result as I will accept graciously what is announced tonight or whenever.

1631
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:36,742
[SPEAKER_37]: Medford has changed in this instance.

1632
02:34:37,683 --> 02:34:39,305
[SPEAKER_37]: Change is not always good.

1633
02:34:40,085 --> 02:34:47,252
[SPEAKER_37]: And this, this is change that has yielded nothing but enmity, division, and some hate.

1634
02:34:47,773 --> 02:34:48,773
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's change that.

1635
02:34:49,893 --> 02:34:55,316
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's name the school after a wonderful educator, Jean Barry Sutherland.

1636
02:34:55,436 --> 02:34:55,877
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1637
02:34:55,897 --> 02:35:05,782
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Nadine Moretti-Bergedahl.

1638
02:35:06,483 --> 02:35:07,623
[SPEAKER_43]: Thanks for letting me speak tonight.

1639
02:35:08,244 --> 02:35:13,927
[SPEAKER_43]: When we first had our first meeting about this last June, and I remember I said something to the effect that

1640
02:35:14,744 --> 02:35:19,388
[SPEAKER_43]: It wasn't what was on the outside of the school that mattered, but was a, you know, what was on the inside of the school.

1641
02:35:19,488 --> 02:35:21,910
[SPEAKER_43]: And someone wrote something today that reminded me of that.

1642
02:35:22,490 --> 02:35:28,215
[SPEAKER_43]: And I still truly believe that, that the name of the school on the outside, you know, shouldn't be all we're focusing on.

1643
02:35:28,355 --> 02:35:35,440
[SPEAKER_43]: And we're losing sight of the fact that in one year we're focusing on this name that everyone's made very negative.

1644
02:35:35,581 --> 02:35:39,744
[SPEAKER_43]: And I spent 10 years there with my kids and we had a wonderful experience.

1645
02:35:40,044 --> 02:35:42,286
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, we had Mrs. Yeager as our first principal,

1646
02:35:43,132 --> 02:35:43,272
[SPEAKER_43]: Ms.

1647
02:35:43,312 --> 02:35:45,493
[SPEAKER_43]: Kay is our principal when we graduated.

1648
02:35:45,773 --> 02:35:47,574
[SPEAKER_43]: And it was an amazing experience.

1649
02:35:47,774 --> 02:35:50,035
[SPEAKER_43]: And this whole year has been disheartening.

1650
02:35:50,135 --> 02:35:52,876
[SPEAKER_43]: I know everybody's well aware of how I feel about the name change.

1651
02:35:53,757 --> 02:35:55,417
[SPEAKER_43]: Should we have to change it?

1652
02:35:55,598 --> 02:35:58,219
[SPEAKER_43]: Jean Barry Sutherland, to me, is the more appropriate name.

1653
02:35:58,339 --> 02:36:00,780
[SPEAKER_43]: And again, the other two names are great selections.

1654
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:10,684
[SPEAKER_43]: But we need to stop focusing on the name that's on the outside, because that's all, I would assume, these children from K through five now are focusing on.

1655
02:36:10,824 --> 02:36:12,525
[SPEAKER_43]: And I don't know what it's like for those parents.

1656
02:36:13,083 --> 02:36:15,845
[SPEAKER_43]: Thankfully, my kids are in high school, and we don't have to think about that.

1657
02:36:15,965 --> 02:36:22,590
[SPEAKER_43]: But as negative as everything was tonight, some positives, a lot of negativity, which we've seen.

1658
02:36:22,610 --> 02:36:26,432
[SPEAKER_43]: I just don't think this is a good look either for these children that are probably watching us.

1659
02:36:26,512 --> 02:36:37,020
[SPEAKER_43]: So I hope they know that no matter what the name is of the school, they should be proud to be in it, be proud to have the teachers and the friends that they have, and know that they're getting a top-notch education.

1660
02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:42,164
[SPEAKER_43]: But we've lost sight of that with putting so much pressure on this name change.

1661
02:36:43,206 --> 02:36:46,107
[SPEAKER_43]: I hope that we think differently when we go forward.

1662
02:36:46,147 --> 02:36:50,768
[SPEAKER_43]: So thank you.

1663
02:36:54,329 --> 02:36:58,131
[SPEAKER_17]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1664
02:37:00,251 --> 02:37:03,912
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel I've been really privileged to learn a lot during this process.

1665
02:37:06,913 --> 02:37:12,135
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to learn about the way that early 20th century Italian immigrants were treated, and it wasn't right.

1666
02:37:13,888 --> 02:37:15,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to learn about Belinda Sutton.

1667
02:37:16,890 --> 02:37:23,314
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to learn about the Misty Took River and how it gets its name and how there are other communities in Massachusetts.

1668
02:37:24,034 --> 02:37:25,755
[SPEAKER_17]: My family once lived in Mystic, Connecticut.

1669
02:37:25,795 --> 02:37:28,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I know where that got its name and I found that very interesting and enlightening.

1670
02:37:31,739 --> 02:37:34,861
[SPEAKER_17]: I was happy to learn about Belinda Sutton and I think that's very valuable.

1671
02:37:36,782 --> 02:37:43,606
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really hope that we can all reflect on what we learned and including the school committee

1672
02:37:44,056 --> 02:37:55,782
[SPEAKER_17]: to ensure that I think one of the things is that some of the Italian Americans don't feel like they're being heard, but maybe that's because their history in the early 20th century has also been neglected.

1673
02:37:55,842 --> 02:37:57,322
[SPEAKER_17]: People don't know the history of Columbus.

1674
02:37:58,463 --> 02:38:02,925
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that, I think whatever name is chosen is going to be great.

1675
02:38:03,025 --> 02:38:12,110
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really feel thankful we went through this process and I hope we can all learn from it and make sure that none of this history gets neglected anymore.

1676
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:12,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1677
02:38:22,523 --> 02:38:25,404
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello, Nicole DeMonica, 51 Burnside Street.

1678
02:38:26,185 --> 02:38:27,585
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wasn't going to speak tonight.

1679
02:38:27,885 --> 02:38:31,626
[SPEAKER_36]: I first want to say thank you to all of you for wanting to listen to us.

1680
02:38:31,867 --> 02:38:35,728
[SPEAKER_36]: I know this must have been hard because we do have a passionate group here.

1681
02:38:36,084 --> 02:38:39,666
[SPEAKER_36]: But I think what does that show is that how passionate they are.

1682
02:38:39,686 --> 02:38:46,931
[SPEAKER_36]: I think the people who come here and who actually voice their opinions for Belinda's son and Jean were the ones that really cared about this.

1683
02:38:47,071 --> 02:38:48,772
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that's what we have to remember.

1684
02:38:48,792 --> 02:38:55,396
[SPEAKER_36]: These are the people right here that in the community that really cared enough to come out here to tell you how they feel.

1685
02:38:56,197 --> 02:38:57,458
[SPEAKER_36]: That's one thing I didn't want to say.

1686
02:39:02,856 --> 02:39:08,658
[SPEAKER_36]: Another thing I want to bring up is that you have to also remember that a lot of people in this community are Italian American.

1687
02:39:09,138 --> 02:39:14,720
[SPEAKER_36]: A lot of people in this community did not want this change, but we did it because we had no choice.

1688
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:19,562
[SPEAKER_36]: And then when we did, we decided to choose somebody that the children chose.

1689
02:39:19,862 --> 02:39:22,283
[SPEAKER_36]: The Dane children are the ones who told us

1690
02:39:22,723 --> 02:39:25,767
[SPEAKER_36]: Jean Barry was the person that should be chosen.

1691
02:39:26,188 --> 02:39:32,116
[SPEAKER_36]: So then we said you know what, if we have to choose anybody want to choose somebody who was impactful of the city.

1692
02:39:32,837 --> 02:39:36,442
[SPEAKER_36]: I absolutely think Belinda Sutton is she went through it.

1693
02:39:36,462 --> 02:39:40,147
[SPEAKER_36]: I honestly think that she deserves honor.

1694
02:39:40,697 --> 02:39:53,392
[SPEAKER_36]: And that but at that should be at the Royal House, but I do think the name should be gene, and that is just the reason why of all these people here, the submissions that she that was already sent into 413 or 423 people sent in surveys, which they were discredited by.

1695
02:39:57,957 --> 02:39:58,977
[SPEAKER_36]: That's pretty hard on them.

1696
02:39:59,538 --> 02:40:04,939
[SPEAKER_36]: Someone for actually to send in a survey about somebody and then to say that they're cheating.

1697
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:07,980
[SPEAKER_36]: And most of those people were children who sent those in.

1698
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:09,761
[SPEAKER_36]: You really have to think about that.

1699
02:40:10,481 --> 02:40:10,841
[SPEAKER_36]: Really.

1700
02:40:11,381 --> 02:40:16,443
[SPEAKER_36]: I know there's some people want certain things and I understand maybe you want certain things and you're passionate about things.

1701
02:40:16,623 --> 02:40:17,383
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand that.

1702
02:40:17,743 --> 02:40:20,684
[SPEAKER_36]: But you have to think now about the city.

1703
02:40:21,845 --> 02:40:24,666
[SPEAKER_36]: One thing we want to do, we all have to bring on, we want to heal.

1704
02:40:24,686 --> 02:40:25,406
[SPEAKER_36]: Is that correct?

1705
02:40:26,263 --> 02:40:27,784
[SPEAKER_36]: Is that what we all want to do right now?

1706
02:40:27,804 --> 02:40:31,105
[SPEAKER_36]: I think so.

1707
02:40:31,125 --> 02:40:36,507
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think the one way we can heal right now is doing the right thing.

1708
02:40:36,867 --> 02:40:37,267
[SPEAKER_36]: One minute.

1709
02:40:37,728 --> 02:40:38,068
[SPEAKER_43]: That's all.

1710
02:40:38,388 --> 02:40:38,708
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1711
02:40:51,584 --> 02:40:58,525
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, my name is Samantha Sinek and I just wanted to come and speak on behalf of Belinda Sutton.

1712
02:40:59,406 --> 02:41:06,027
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that the naming of the schools is not just about the person and the name, it's about the story that it tells us.

1713
02:41:06,807 --> 02:41:14,889
[SPEAKER_36]: And the one thing we know about Belinda Sutton is that when she tried something, she was turned away.

1714
02:41:15,209 --> 02:41:19,630
[SPEAKER_36]: Like we know of her because she wrote five petitions to get what she was owed.

1715
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:23,992
[SPEAKER_36]: And every time she was turned away, but she didn't stop.

1716
02:41:24,072 --> 02:41:24,812
[SPEAKER_36]: She didn't give up.

1717
02:41:25,592 --> 02:41:30,253
[SPEAKER_36]: She stood up and she tried again and she kept fighting for what was hers.

1718
02:41:31,414 --> 02:41:34,235
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, Belinda Sutton's story doesn't end happily.

1719
02:41:34,255 --> 02:41:36,835
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, she never got what she was owed.

1720
02:41:39,396 --> 02:41:47,098
[SPEAKER_36]: But I think that we can put her name on a building and then we can take that message to ourselves when we can learn

1721
02:41:47,895 --> 02:41:52,817
[SPEAKER_36]: that there are a lot of people who don't get what they're owed, and we can work to be better about that.

1722
02:41:53,518 --> 02:42:06,344
[SPEAKER_36]: And two, we can remember that there are a lot of people who need to remember that when the world works against them, when the universe is set against them, when the world gets them down, they can still stand up and try again.

1723
02:42:06,884 --> 02:42:10,346
[SPEAKER_36]: Because in the end, we can all make our mark on the world.

1724
02:42:11,007 --> 02:42:13,289
[SPEAKER_36]: and Belinda Sutton made her mark by not quitting.

1725
02:42:14,009 --> 02:42:21,115
[SPEAKER_36]: So I just wanted to speak for her name because her story is really powerful and I think I would like to see it on a building.

1726
02:42:22,576 --> 02:42:22,916
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1727
02:42:28,201 --> 02:42:28,941
[SPEAKER_43]: Judy Kim.

1728
02:42:35,987 --> 02:42:37,488
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, Mr. Thomas Lynch.

1729
02:42:45,748 --> 02:42:47,950
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, how are you all?

1730
02:42:49,911 --> 02:42:58,097
[SPEAKER_45]: Just let you know that I've been an educator and a coach in Medford for 27 years.

1731
02:43:00,419 --> 02:43:01,300
[SPEAKER_45]: Honorable Ms.

1732
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:03,922
[SPEAKER_45]: Mayer ran track for me and she was phenomenal.

1733
02:43:06,303 --> 02:43:08,305
[SPEAKER_45]: But I had a great experience growing up in Medford.

1734
02:43:09,466 --> 02:43:10,547
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm one of eight children.

1735
02:43:13,329 --> 02:43:14,910
[SPEAKER_45]: And I grew up in South Medford.

1736
02:43:16,206 --> 02:43:17,107
[SPEAKER_45]: And we were proud.

1737
02:43:18,487 --> 02:43:22,090
[SPEAKER_45]: My parents, my father worked for the highway department for 35 years.

1738
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:26,052
[SPEAKER_45]: And my mom was a stay at home mom, take care of eight children.

1739
02:43:27,233 --> 02:43:27,993
[SPEAKER_45]: Can everyone hear me?

1740
02:43:28,474 --> 02:43:29,254
[SPEAKER_45]: Brianna, can they hear me?

1741
02:43:30,015 --> 02:43:31,435
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, we can hear you very clearly.

1742
02:43:31,495 --> 02:43:32,276
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1743
02:43:33,497 --> 02:43:34,017
[SPEAKER_45]: And you know what?

1744
02:43:34,177 --> 02:43:45,164
[SPEAKER_45]: We're very proud, very proud to grow up in South Method in a neighborhood of Irish and Italian immigrants and a combination of everyone that got along well, right?

1745
02:43:47,185 --> 02:43:51,487
[SPEAKER_45]: I went to the Columbus Elementary, so did my, can you hear me, Bea?

1746
02:43:52,788 --> 02:43:54,289
[SPEAKER_45]: Bea, should I stop?

1747
02:43:54,309 --> 02:43:54,849
[SPEAKER_45]: Should I stop?

1748
02:43:56,130 --> 02:43:56,650
[SPEAKER_45]: Should I stop?

1749
02:43:56,670 --> 02:44:00,872
[SPEAKER_45]: Because I can't hear you.

1750
02:44:02,894 --> 02:44:14,580
[SPEAKER_45]: We grew up in the housing projects, and my father worked for the city, and my mom and dad had eight beautiful children that all went to the Columbus Elementary School, okay?

1751
02:44:16,914 --> 02:44:20,075
[SPEAKER_45]: We were proud of our Columbus Elementary School.

1752
02:44:20,655 --> 02:44:21,195
[SPEAKER_45]: You know why?

1753
02:44:21,295 --> 02:44:28,438
[SPEAKER_45]: Because whoever was the superintendent at the time put beautiful people in place.

1754
02:44:28,478 --> 02:44:34,460
[SPEAKER_45]: I think the principal might've been Miss Cunningham and all the teachers were beautiful teachers.

1755
02:44:35,220 --> 02:44:38,321
[SPEAKER_45]: And they let all the kids in South Method know that they were loved.

1756
02:44:41,354 --> 02:44:42,796
[SPEAKER_45]: loved and they were valued.

1757
02:44:43,156 --> 02:44:50,545
[SPEAKER_45]: Whether you went, whether you were born in the projects or your parents didn't own a home, they loved you no matter what.

1758
02:44:51,587 --> 02:44:52,268
[SPEAKER_45]: And you went to school.

1759
02:44:52,288 --> 02:44:52,548
[SPEAKER_45]: One minute.

1760
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:54,791
[SPEAKER_45]: Oh God, I got a minute?

1761
02:44:55,792 --> 02:44:56,233
[SPEAKER_45]: Oh gosh.

1762
02:44:58,396 --> 02:45:00,056
[SPEAKER_45]: All right, I guess I'm done.

1763
02:45:00,196 --> 02:45:13,479
[SPEAKER_45]: Listen, listen, I am against renaming the Columbus Elementary School for any reason whatsoever, because I was proud to be a Columbus School member, and so would my other seven brothers and sisters.

1764
02:45:13,919 --> 02:45:24,300
[SPEAKER_45]: And then, and one of my brothers that fought in Afghanistan, he would still, that has soon passed, not long ago, he would still be proud to say, I went to the Columbus.

1765
02:45:24,841 --> 02:45:26,241
[SPEAKER_45]: I was proud to be a Columbus.

1766
02:45:26,261 --> 02:45:26,821
[SPEAKER_44]: 30 seconds.

1767
02:45:27,984 --> 02:45:29,765
[SPEAKER_45]: All right, give me 29 more seconds.

1768
02:45:30,326 --> 02:45:36,330
[SPEAKER_45]: I was proud, and my family's proud, and we're still proud to be Columbus Elementary School graduates.

1769
02:45:36,990 --> 02:45:48,038
[SPEAKER_45]: But if you change the name, do it in good faith, because there are a lot of people in that neighborhood that were proud to be from that school, okay?

1770
02:45:48,118 --> 02:45:49,599
[SPEAKER_45]: The teachers and principals alike.

1771
02:45:53,061 --> 02:45:53,702
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Mr. Lynch.

1772
02:46:00,266 --> 02:46:00,586
[SPEAKER_37]: Three.

1773
02:46:11,776 --> 02:46:15,459
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Vindiclude, if you... I have no more letters.

1774
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:19,823
[SPEAKER_47]: No more letters.

1775
02:46:19,863 --> 02:46:21,945
[SPEAKER_47]: We can't get audio for three.

1776
02:46:24,305 --> 02:46:26,407
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, well, let me check again.

1777
02:46:27,227 --> 02:46:33,671
[SPEAKER_47]: If there's any last words from anybody who has not spoken, now's your time before we begin deliberation.

1778
02:46:34,452 --> 02:46:36,753
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, wait, I now have two more letters.

1779
02:46:36,773 --> 02:46:38,474
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, I'm going to let Mr. Puccio.

1780
02:46:40,555 --> 02:46:44,358
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Kloot would just let somebody speak at the railing and then I'll go over to you.

1781
02:46:45,078 --> 02:46:45,298
Thank you.

1782
02:46:46,479 --> 02:46:47,200
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1783
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:49,781
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you everyone for this opportunity to speak.

1784
02:46:50,662 --> 02:46:52,443
[SPEAKER_59]: My name is Anthony Puccio, 11 Tantor Street.

1785
02:46:53,001 --> 02:46:55,222
[SPEAKER_59]: a 42-year member, proud member of this community.

1786
02:46:56,203 --> 02:46:58,324
[SPEAKER_59]: My intention is to keep this positive.

1787
02:46:58,364 --> 02:47:10,812
[SPEAKER_59]: Unfortunately, I must address a situation that may be interpreted as negativity based on the position some of us may have taken to the nationality that is a reality before your name, before the word American.

1788
02:47:12,172 --> 02:47:21,638
[SPEAKER_59]: I would just like to take the time to remind all that renaming the Columbus School to the indigenous name, Misituk, is the equivalent to changing Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.

1789
02:47:22,421 --> 02:47:39,251
[SPEAKER_59]: Even though we're already celebrating indigenous people in the community, the indigenous community at the end of November, to remove the name Columbus based on the misinformation is a direct slap in the face to the Italian community of Medford, and to rename it another indigenous name is just an extra kick while we're down.

1790
02:47:39,971 --> 02:47:44,174
[SPEAKER_59]: This is by definition, the current buzzword of the day, cultural appropriation.

1791
02:47:44,974 --> 02:47:49,897
[SPEAKER_59]: By renaming the Columbus School of Mesotaucus, you will be pushing one nationality over another.

1792
02:47:50,711 --> 02:48:00,795
[SPEAKER_59]: I would ask that the committee members, through the chair, begin asking for a point of order and correct speakers whenever anyone steps up here or online and begins to make false, unprovable claims about Columbus.

1793
02:48:01,915 --> 02:48:09,418
[SPEAKER_59]: The supporters, the ones not present and the ones here behind me right now, you're not white supremacists.

1794
02:48:09,838 --> 02:48:11,059
[SPEAKER_59]: We're not hateful people.

1795
02:48:11,799 --> 02:48:15,380
[SPEAKER_59]: We're just good people who care to come and support what we believe in.

1796
02:48:15,981 --> 02:48:17,241
[SPEAKER_59]: We don't want to hurt anyone.

1797
02:48:20,305 --> 02:48:23,027
[SPEAKER_59]: We care about this community just as much as everyone else.

1798
02:48:23,628 --> 02:48:27,271
[SPEAKER_59]: The messages that are getting spread are just so false and incorrect.

1799
02:48:29,593 --> 02:48:30,894
[SPEAKER_59]: They cared to come out to be heard.

1800
02:48:30,914 --> 02:48:33,616
[SPEAKER_59]: We were all asked to be part of the process.

1801
02:48:34,117 --> 02:48:35,198
[SPEAKER_59]: We were.

1802
02:48:35,918 --> 02:48:41,803
[SPEAKER_59]: We follow the guidelines that this very school committee and the renaming committee that you created proposed.

1803
02:48:41,963 --> 02:48:43,404
[SPEAKER_59]: We follow those guidelines.

1804
02:48:43,985 --> 02:48:47,348
[SPEAKER_59]: Our voices were and are still pretty loud and clear.

1805
02:48:47,975 --> 02:48:50,456
[SPEAKER_59]: Please do the right thing for the City of Medford.

1806
02:48:50,956 --> 02:48:58,279
[SPEAKER_59]: The only correct choice, if it cannot be the Columbus School, is the Jean Barry Sutherland School.

1807
02:48:59,319 --> 02:48:59,719
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

1808
02:49:08,442 --> 02:49:09,782
[SPEAKER_43]: Bri and then Judy Kim.

1809
02:49:13,083 --> 02:49:13,364
[SPEAKER_53]: Hi.

1810
02:49:13,884 --> 02:49:14,624
[SPEAKER_53]: Can everyone hear me?

1811
02:49:15,964 --> 02:49:16,165
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

1812
02:49:16,185 --> 02:49:17,365
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1813
02:49:18,476 --> 02:49:18,796
[SPEAKER_53]: Thanks.

1814
02:49:19,136 --> 02:49:20,437
[SPEAKER_53]: Uh, this is, uh, Brie brothers.

1815
02:49:20,737 --> 02:49:23,598
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm at, uh, 31 Gleason street in Medford.

1816
02:49:24,459 --> 02:49:31,982
[SPEAKER_53]: Um, I'm also one of the, uh, committee members that served on the advisory committee.

1817
02:49:32,603 --> 02:49:39,146
[SPEAKER_53]: Um, it was a really great experience and a really great honor to do that.

1818
02:49:39,466 --> 02:49:42,507
[SPEAKER_53]: And like so many others here, I, I learned a lot.

1819
02:49:43,208 --> 02:49:45,048
[SPEAKER_53]: I learned, I learned a ton.

1820
02:49:45,449 --> 02:49:47,710
[SPEAKER_53]: I learned so much about so many of these names.

1821
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:48,170
[SPEAKER_53]: Um,

1822
02:49:49,397 --> 02:50:08,520
[SPEAKER_53]: But one thing I wanted to point out is that, um, you know, as, as mayor pointed out at the beginning of the meeting, that we were trying to keep things respectful and, um, not say anything negative about any of these other candidates.

1823
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:16,742
[SPEAKER_53]: I I'd like to ask that folks consider that like in a more subtle way, when

1824
02:50:18,883 --> 02:50:24,847
[SPEAKER_53]: We say things like we should honor Belinda Sutton by keeping her at the slave house.

1825
02:50:26,648 --> 02:50:34,234
[SPEAKER_53]: I just, I really want to encourage folks to really think about what we say when we say things like that.

1826
02:50:34,614 --> 02:50:39,997
[SPEAKER_53]: And I'm not going against the idea that all of these names have a place because they do.

1827
02:50:40,238 --> 02:50:44,100
[SPEAKER_53]: And it would be great to see these names everywhere.

1828
02:50:44,921 --> 02:50:48,003
[SPEAKER_53]: But when we say things like let's honor.

1829
02:50:48,806 --> 02:50:53,607
[SPEAKER_53]: the black enslaved woman by keeping her at the slave house.

1830
02:50:54,727 --> 02:50:55,947
[SPEAKER_53]: That is disrespectful.

1831
02:50:56,787 --> 02:51:00,348
[SPEAKER_53]: It's not a good message for the children that are here listening.

1832
02:51:01,248 --> 02:51:04,469
[SPEAKER_53]: And, um, again, I appreciate it.

1833
02:51:04,829 --> 02:51:16,531
[SPEAKER_53]: It is not outwardly, you know, saying something bad about one of these names, but I just, I'd encourage people to sit with that and

1834
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:44,446
[SPEAKER_53]: really examine if that's truly how you feel because it's just it's it's incredibly hurtful to the people in this in this community so um that's all thank you so much for uh thank you for letting me speak um Judy Kim should have bounced off again oh geez Eileen Lerner

1835
02:51:49,981 --> 02:52:00,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to say that I find it sad that many people view inclusion as replacement.

1836
02:52:02,765 --> 02:52:04,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody's being replaced.

1837
02:52:04,766 --> 02:52:07,327
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just being asked to include.

1838
02:52:08,307 --> 02:52:14,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And now especially you have a school where the population is very diverse.

1839
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:15,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean,

1840
02:52:16,897 --> 02:52:24,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Why shouldn't they have a name that reflects something other than white culture?

1841
02:52:24,685 --> 02:52:27,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes we need to change things, you know?

1842
02:52:28,148 --> 02:52:36,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to also say the argument that this could get us into legal trouble because of this law,

1843
02:52:37,591 --> 02:52:52,456
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it's really not interpreting the law correctly, as the woman talked about before, because what that law is saying is that you can't trivialize other people's culture.

1844
02:52:52,516 --> 02:52:59,379
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't make them mascots or emblems and put them on your sports shirts or on your flags.

1845
02:53:00,339 --> 02:53:08,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that is not at all comparable to honoring somebody by calling a school after them.

1846
02:53:08,041 --> 02:53:10,722
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a specious argument.

1847
02:53:11,742 --> 02:53:19,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry to some of the older Italian people that live in town who feel so discriminated against.

1848
02:53:19,244 --> 02:53:24,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really sorry that you feel that way because you're not being discriminated against.

1849
02:53:25,166 --> 02:53:27,287
[SPEAKER_11]: You're being asked to include

1850
02:53:28,087 --> 02:53:31,993
[SPEAKER_11]: include you are not being replaced.

1851
02:53:33,174 --> 02:53:34,476
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I have to say.

1852
02:53:35,818 --> 02:53:36,219
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1853
02:53:43,911 --> 02:53:46,253
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so I received two more letters.

1854
02:53:47,313 --> 02:54:04,724
[SPEAKER_44]: One was from Michelle Chiccolo and she had sent the school committee actually a letter earlier about reaching out to the Mass Center for Native American Awareness just to get a clarification about the using of indigenous names.

1855
02:54:05,565 --> 02:54:11,388
[SPEAKER_44]: As we heard clarified before, that has to do with using names for sports teams and they would,

1856
02:54:13,024 --> 02:54:17,426
[SPEAKER_44]: would not see the are using of Misita in a negative light.

1857
02:54:18,066 --> 02:54:19,667
[SPEAKER_44]: So just a clarification there.

1858
02:54:20,047 --> 02:54:25,109
[SPEAKER_44]: And then we had Jeremy Raeland from Brewster Road and a parent of a second grader at a Columbus.

1859
02:54:25,269 --> 02:54:26,210
[SPEAKER_44]: I agree with the students.

1860
02:54:26,250 --> 02:54:30,292
[SPEAKER_44]: Let's show how the democratic process works and go with the name they chose, Misita.

1861
02:54:32,413 --> 02:54:33,553
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, member VanderKloof.

1862
02:54:34,013 --> 02:54:34,313
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1863
02:54:35,114 --> 02:54:36,554
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, my name is Annette Lister.

1864
02:54:36,594 --> 02:54:38,435
[SPEAKER_43]: I live at 193 Winthrop Street.

1865
02:54:39,716 --> 02:54:42,477
[SPEAKER_43]: I didn't intend on getting up here, but from what I'm seeing,

1866
02:54:43,379 --> 02:54:44,660
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm saddened by this whole thing.

1867
02:54:45,661 --> 02:54:46,582
[SPEAKER_43]: I grew up in Method.

1868
02:54:46,602 --> 02:54:47,723
[SPEAKER_43]: My kids grew up in Method.

1869
02:54:48,084 --> 02:54:49,485
[SPEAKER_43]: My kids went to the James School.

1870
02:54:49,545 --> 02:54:51,347
[SPEAKER_37]: They are 34 and 32 years old.

1871
02:54:51,407 --> 02:54:53,749
[SPEAKER_37]: They're both adults with children.

1872
02:54:54,190 --> 02:54:59,455
[SPEAKER_37]: They both had Jean Barry Sutherland, fourth grade teacher and vice principal.

1873
02:55:00,316 --> 02:55:02,979
[SPEAKER_37]: All my nieces and nephews had Jean Barry Sutherland.

1874
02:55:03,900 --> 02:55:05,301
[SPEAKER_37]: This breaks my heart.

1875
02:55:05,871 --> 02:55:10,494
[SPEAKER_37]: that we have to beg to get a name change at a school.

1876
02:55:11,154 --> 02:55:16,297
[SPEAKER_37]: So this woman so well deserves to be up in front of that school.

1877
02:55:16,777 --> 02:55:19,018
[SPEAKER_37]: She brought all walks of life together.

1878
02:55:19,899 --> 02:55:22,861
[SPEAKER_37]: We were greeted every day with a smile.

1879
02:55:23,161 --> 02:55:24,862
[SPEAKER_37]: That's how our children were taught.

1880
02:55:26,264 --> 02:55:31,229
[SPEAKER_37]: I feel that my kids are the people that they are today.

1881
02:55:31,269 --> 02:55:32,450
[SPEAKER_31]: They are both professionals.

1882
02:55:32,530 --> 02:55:37,595
[SPEAKER_31]: I have a financial advisor and I have a daughter who's a nurse, who's a hospice nurse.

1883
02:55:38,115 --> 02:55:47,724
[SPEAKER_37]: My kids to this day will tell you it was Jean Barry Sutherland who brought all these kids together who had a smile on their face.

1884
02:55:51,829 --> 02:55:55,492
[SPEAKER_37]: You have to stand here and watch what is going on.

1885
02:55:55,572 --> 02:55:56,372
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a disgrace.

1886
02:55:57,853 --> 02:55:59,034
[SPEAKER_37]: Why is this happening?

1887
02:56:01,636 --> 02:56:02,957
[SPEAKER_37]: She was an educator.

1888
02:56:04,978 --> 02:56:08,180
[SPEAKER_37]: She brought, like I said, all walks of life together.

1889
02:56:08,781 --> 02:56:11,422
[SPEAKER_37]: Never divided any one of us.

1890
02:56:12,183 --> 02:56:14,424
[SPEAKER_37]: We were one big family.

1891
02:56:16,766 --> 02:56:20,729
[SPEAKER_37]: That's all I have to say, but please consider her, Jean,

1892
02:56:21,311 --> 02:56:22,692
[SPEAKER_37]: Barry Sutherland.

1893
02:56:23,032 --> 02:56:26,834
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1894
02:56:33,557 --> 02:56:37,219
[SPEAKER_47]: I believe we have somebody with 30 seconds left, Mr. Hill.

1895
02:56:40,260 --> 02:56:41,421
[SPEAKER_47]: Please, no names.

1896
02:56:43,982 --> 02:56:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1897
02:56:44,862 --> 02:56:45,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.

1898
02:56:46,383 --> 02:56:49,785
[SPEAKER_06]: One moment while I finish.

1899
02:56:51,087 --> 02:56:52,207
[SPEAKER_47]: 30 seconds, he has 30 seconds.

1900
02:56:53,248 --> 02:56:54,128
[SPEAKER_47]: He has 30 seconds.

1901
02:56:57,049 --> 02:56:57,809
[SPEAKER_47]: I cut him off.

1902
02:56:58,929 --> 02:57:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean Barry Sutherland did her job well and was well loved.

1903
02:57:02,250 --> 02:57:12,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But whether she'll continue to inspire 100 years from now is questionable and we'll rely on continued retelling of general platitudes about service and commitment.

1904
02:57:13,593 --> 02:57:17,394
[SPEAKER_06]: The other choices are better ones and we'll make better monuments for the future.

1905
02:57:18,499 --> 02:57:30,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Misituk can better acknowledge that we are standing on native land, and Belinda Sutton can bring the community together if the community is worthy enough to see it.

1906
02:57:31,345 --> 02:57:39,848
[SPEAKER_06]: If we tell stories to set examples and to shelter those less fortunate, Belinda Sutton's story encompasses all.

1907
02:57:40,649 --> 02:57:43,170
[SPEAKER_06]: She advocated for herself when no one else would.

1908
02:57:43,750 --> 02:57:47,372
[SPEAKER_06]: She knew what was right, and the only reason history knows her name

1909
02:57:53,711 --> 02:57:59,555
[SPEAKER_47]: If there's any last comment before the committee deliberates, now's the chance, just no more emails.

1910
02:57:59,895 --> 02:58:01,837
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, virtually we've got everybody.

1911
02:58:01,857 --> 02:58:05,779
[SPEAKER_47]: You can only speak once, so if anybody.

1912
02:58:05,799 --> 02:58:10,122
[SPEAKER_47]: No, you sister.

1913
02:58:10,142 --> 02:58:16,587
[SPEAKER_47]: I have to stick to it or else we will be here all night, I'm sorry.

1914
02:58:17,087 --> 02:58:18,088
[SPEAKER_44]: Can I make a motion, Mayor?

1915
02:58:19,649 --> 02:58:20,350
[SPEAKER_47]: Member McStone.

1916
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:20,670
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah.

1917
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:28,055
[SPEAKER_44]: Can I make a motion that we each state our first choice as a straw poll to see where we all are right now?

1918
02:58:29,515 --> 02:58:33,298
[SPEAKER_44]: Mia, I would rather, I would like to be able to make a statement.

1919
02:58:34,579 --> 02:58:35,059
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure.

1920
02:58:35,179 --> 02:58:37,220
[SPEAKER_44]: If you want to change your motion that we each make a statement.

1921
02:58:38,001 --> 02:58:40,803
[SPEAKER_44]: You can make a statement if you'd like to make a statement.

1922
02:58:41,223 --> 02:58:41,623
[SPEAKER_44]: Mayor.

1923
02:58:41,703 --> 02:58:41,963
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure.

1924
02:58:43,464 --> 02:58:45,325
[SPEAKER_44]: Point of clarification, point of information.

1925
02:58:45,986 --> 02:58:47,667
[SPEAKER_44]: Is public comment complete now?

1926
02:58:51,569 --> 02:58:57,411
[SPEAKER_44]: I just want to be clear about whether the public can continue to participate or if they cannot.

1927
02:58:57,811 --> 02:59:01,853
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay there's been no motion to stop public comment.

1928
02:59:01,873 --> 02:59:08,535
[SPEAKER_47]: We have one more virtually and some gentlemen standing so let's give them the chance to speak.

1929
02:59:12,317 --> 02:59:13,717
[SPEAKER_44]: There's a member here.

1930
02:59:17,672 --> 02:59:21,313
[SPEAKER_61]: Hi, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.

1931
02:59:21,974 --> 02:59:23,434
[SPEAKER_61]: My name is Munir Germanus.

1932
02:59:23,574 --> 02:59:27,356
[SPEAKER_61]: I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1933
02:59:27,876 --> 02:59:31,197
[SPEAKER_61]: I've been living in Medford for over 35 years.

1934
02:59:32,417 --> 02:59:41,741
[SPEAKER_61]: And my recommendation is to listen to the voice of the amazing students of the school.

1935
02:59:43,001 --> 02:59:52,904
[SPEAKER_61]: They are the ones that are going to have to live with this for the next 30, 40 years, and not myself or not most of you.

1936
02:59:53,844 --> 03:00:09,748
[SPEAKER_61]: So let history record that listen to the voice of these students, listen to the voice, give them the name, give the name of the school to the Native Americans who

1937
03:00:10,769 --> 03:00:20,757
[SPEAKER_61]: owned and were in this land long before any of us or any of our fathers or mothers or grandfathers were.

1938
03:00:22,418 --> 03:00:25,480
[SPEAKER_61]: Vote your conscience and thank you for the opportunity.

1939
03:00:27,262 --> 03:00:27,682
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1940
03:00:29,303 --> 03:00:32,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

1941
03:00:33,506 --> 03:00:38,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to, what no one's really put out there, I mean everybody already said everything that they wanted to say about

1942
03:00:39,588 --> 03:01:02,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Gene Barry, and I echo everything that they say, but one thing that no one's bringing up is out of the over 1,000 people that submitted, we've heard the number of 423 of Gene Barry, but no one, the next, the lowest was Belinda Sutton from the community with only 86 submissions, I believe.

1943
03:01:03,226 --> 03:01:07,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that actually speaks volumes of what people actually want.

1944
03:01:14,582 --> 03:01:16,263
[SPEAKER_47]: Would anybody else like to say any?

1945
03:01:24,909 --> 03:01:26,050
[SPEAKER_47]: Name and address for the record, please.

1946
03:01:26,530 --> 03:01:31,734
[SPEAKER_44]: Janine Phaley, 75 Forest Street, and I was a Dame School graduate, 1996.

1947
03:01:32,234 --> 03:01:39,759
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm the oldest of five, and all five of us had Miss Barry as a teacher, as a principal,

1948
03:01:40,839 --> 03:01:42,600
[SPEAKER_44]: at the Dame and then the Columbus.

1949
03:01:43,301 --> 03:01:57,633
[SPEAKER_44]: And she was the type of person you went to after you graduated school, after you graduated college, was there to help you with, you know, future goals and anything you needed to talk to her about, she was there.

1950
03:01:57,653 --> 03:02:04,618
[SPEAKER_44]: I would go after school while I was in college for education and just talk about life.

1951
03:02:05,259 --> 03:02:10,503
[SPEAKER_44]: And that's why I think, you know, we should name the school after Miss Barry.

1952
03:02:22,202 --> 03:02:24,303
[SPEAKER_47]: Rebecca, name and address of the record, please.

1953
03:02:27,004 --> 03:02:29,885
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes, thank you, Rebecca Davidson 63 West Street.

1954
03:02:31,025 --> 03:02:46,051
[SPEAKER_55]: And I just wanted to say that as a mother of a future student at the school in question here tonight, I just wanted to echo a lot of the sentiment heard that I believe that we should listen to the students who have spoken about choosing the name that

1955
03:02:46,551 --> 03:02:48,273
[SPEAKER_55]: they feel most passionate about.

1956
03:02:49,374 --> 03:02:58,064
[SPEAKER_55]: And I also want to say that I have a really strong connection to the Mystic River and as I walk along the riverbank every day I think often of the people who lived here before us.

1957
03:02:58,785 --> 03:03:03,970
[SPEAKER_55]: And as Dr. Caldera mentioned, we as a city have invested in the restoration of the river.

1958
03:03:04,671 --> 03:03:08,652
[SPEAKER_55]: And in my view, this has really helped to bring back more wildlife to our beautiful city.

1959
03:03:09,332 --> 03:03:18,234
[SPEAKER_55]: And I believe that the Misitech name helps to reflect the value of our environment and our acknowledgement and respect of those who lived on the riverbank before us.

1960
03:03:18,915 --> 03:03:32,098
[SPEAKER_55]: And when we think about moving forward and building a community where everyone feels welcome, I think it's incredibly important to think of taking steps, albeit small, to heal the past in order to build an inclusive future.

1961
03:03:32,118 --> 03:03:32,718
[SPEAKER_55]: Thanks.

1962
03:03:36,087 --> 03:03:36,667
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Rebecca.

1963
03:03:36,687 --> 03:03:39,630
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, my name is Marion Barry Rivani.

1964
03:03:39,750 --> 03:03:41,671
[SPEAKER_41]: I live at 11 Thomas Street in Sargas.

1965
03:03:43,173 --> 03:03:46,035
[SPEAKER_41]: I am a past resident of Medford for 45 years.

1966
03:03:46,115 --> 03:03:48,237
[SPEAKER_41]: And yes, I am Jean Barry Sutherland's sister.

1967
03:03:48,257 --> 03:04:02,007
[SPEAKER_41]: And I just, I want to thank the committee and all the residents and everyone who has come out to support Jean.

1968
03:04:04,159 --> 03:04:07,861
[SPEAKER_41]: I respect all that all of you have done and I am grateful.

1969
03:04:09,202 --> 03:04:11,504
[SPEAKER_41]: I only can imagine how Jean would have felt about this.

1970
03:04:11,964 --> 03:04:15,166
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, she would have been humbled and she would have been on it.

1971
03:04:17,868 --> 03:04:24,252
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't have to stand here and defend Jean's reputation or give her a recommendation for the school.

1972
03:04:24,893 --> 03:04:26,114
[SPEAKER_41]: I think the people have spoken.

1973
03:04:27,254 --> 03:04:31,097
[SPEAKER_41]: The woman just said, let the students who are going to the school speak.

1974
03:04:32,358 --> 03:04:49,673
[SPEAKER_41]: After listening to all the young people that have spoken and their parents and the community, I say, why not listen to the students who Jean impacted their lives?

1975
03:04:49,933 --> 03:04:54,577
[SPEAKER_41]: She made a positive difference in the lives of every person that she has met.

1976
03:04:56,859 --> 03:04:59,101
[SPEAKER_41]: If you did not have the opportunity to meet her,

1977
03:05:01,138 --> 03:05:03,639
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sad that you didn't because you would have liked her.

1978
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:05,039
[SPEAKER_41]: You would have loved her.

1979
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:09,140
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know anyone that has a bad word to say about her.

1980
03:05:10,640 --> 03:05:12,200
[SPEAKER_41]: She was outgoing.

1981
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:13,561
[SPEAKER_41]: She was an educator.

1982
03:05:13,601 --> 03:05:15,781
[SPEAKER_41]: She was a friend.

1983
03:05:16,321 --> 03:05:17,341
[SPEAKER_41]: She was a peer.

1984
03:05:17,381 --> 03:05:18,282
[SPEAKER_41]: She was a leader.

1985
03:05:19,742 --> 03:05:20,842
[SPEAKER_41]: She was one in a million.

1986
03:05:21,202 --> 03:05:27,824
[SPEAKER_41]: She truly made a difference, not only to me as my sister and to my other siblings,

1987
03:05:29,565 --> 03:05:36,549
[SPEAKER_41]: but to her coworkers, to administrators, to the young people that went to that school, she made a positive difference.

1988
03:05:37,229 --> 03:05:42,292
[SPEAKER_41]: And I am proud to sit here and listen to all the great things that they had to say about her.

1989
03:05:43,092 --> 03:05:44,613
[SPEAKER_41]: And I just want to say thank you all very much.

1990
03:05:59,278 --> 03:05:59,639
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, Dana.

1991
03:06:01,803 --> 03:06:04,649
[SPEAKER_40]: Hi, Dana Rockman is a picture of in.

1992
03:06:07,481 --> 03:06:10,223
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to echo a lot of what other people were saying.

1993
03:06:10,243 --> 03:06:28,773
[SPEAKER_40]: I love the idea of inclusion, representation, making space to more accurately include more people in our community, but the one thing that's really striking me right now is that all of us, these adults are standing here, we're speaking our mind, we're advocating for what we love, we're advocating for what we believe in, right?

1994
03:06:31,297 --> 03:06:36,140
[SPEAKER_40]: that same principle was given to the children at the Columbus School, right?

1995
03:06:36,180 --> 03:06:43,664
[SPEAKER_40]: We were trying to express to them how important it is to speak up for what you want, to speak up for what you believe in.

1996
03:06:43,684 --> 03:06:49,787
[SPEAKER_40]: And they answered that question by when they said that this was the name that they chose.

1997
03:06:50,307 --> 03:06:54,830
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think it's really telling, well, I completely appreciate what,

1998
03:06:55,710 --> 03:07:00,774
[SPEAKER_40]: the previous speaker just said about listening to the past students, that's a very valid point.

1999
03:07:01,234 --> 03:07:19,008
[SPEAKER_40]: But I just wanted the committee to consider the message that it sends to ask a group of students for their opinion, to ask a group of students to practice this self-advocacy, to ask them to engage in

2000
03:07:19,908 --> 03:07:23,769
[SPEAKER_40]: speaking your mind and then say that we're going to listen to the results instead.

2001
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:26,210
[SPEAKER_40]: And the impact that that has on kids.

2002
03:07:27,130 --> 03:07:29,710
[SPEAKER_40]: And the impact that that has on the kids in Medford.

2003
03:07:30,351 --> 03:07:34,212
[SPEAKER_40]: Because I think it is important to let them know that their opinions matter, too.

2004
03:07:35,492 --> 03:07:35,812
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2005
03:07:38,112 --> 03:07:38,513
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2006
03:07:43,854 --> 03:07:44,454
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Van de Groot?

2007
03:07:49,571 --> 03:07:51,473
[SPEAKER_44]: Are we closing public participation?

2008
03:07:52,333 --> 03:07:53,875
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't want to speak until we do.

2009
03:07:53,935 --> 03:07:54,715
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, nobody.

2010
03:07:55,816 --> 03:07:56,497
[SPEAKER_44]: Is there a motion?

2011
03:07:57,398 --> 03:07:59,920
[SPEAKER_44]: I make a motion to close public participation at this time.

2012
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:00,961
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a second?

2013
03:08:02,502 --> 03:08:03,743
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Member Stone.

2014
03:08:03,963 --> 03:08:04,604
[SPEAKER_47]: Roll call, please.

2015
03:08:07,566 --> 03:08:08,167

2016
03:08:08,387 --> 03:08:08,647
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2017
03:08:09,428 --> 03:08:10,028
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kratz?

2018
03:08:10,309 --> 03:08:10,529
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2019
03:08:11,049 --> 03:08:11,770
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin?

2020
03:08:11,790 --> 03:08:12,030
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2021
03:08:12,130 --> 03:08:12,831
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Stone?

2022
03:08:12,851 --> 03:08:13,091
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

2023
03:08:13,611 --> 03:08:14,292
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Rousseau?

2024
03:08:14,612 --> 03:08:14,832
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2025
03:08:15,253 --> 03:08:16,053
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloet?

2026
03:08:16,294 --> 03:08:16,514
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2027
03:08:16,774 --> 03:08:17,475
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Longo-Kern?

2028
03:08:17,555 --> 03:08:17,735
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2029
03:08:18,582 --> 03:08:19,903
[SPEAKER_47]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

2030
03:08:21,164 --> 03:08:23,205
[SPEAKER_47]: Closed at 9.40 p.m.

2031
03:08:25,446 --> 03:08:27,027
[SPEAKER_44]: I'll turn it over to you.

2032
03:08:27,087 --> 03:08:27,428
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

2033
03:08:28,588 --> 03:08:34,752
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm going to address several things as I speak tonight, things that really need to be talked about.

2034
03:08:34,772 --> 03:08:42,197
[SPEAKER_44]: I want to tell you that I really haven't felt this nervous coming to a school committee meeting, and that makes me incredibly sad.

2035
03:08:42,837 --> 03:08:47,400
[SPEAKER_44]: This whole divisiveness in our community makes me incredibly

2036
03:08:47,984 --> 03:08:48,344
[SPEAKER_44]: sad.

2037
03:08:49,345 --> 03:08:50,806
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's been really, really tough.

2038
03:08:51,526 --> 03:08:56,249
[SPEAKER_44]: But I looked out here and I felt better when I came in because I said, oh, wait, why was I nervous?

2039
03:08:56,289 --> 03:08:57,590
[SPEAKER_44]: These are, I know these people.

2040
03:08:57,650 --> 03:08:58,351
[SPEAKER_44]: These are my friends.

2041
03:08:58,391 --> 03:08:59,151
[SPEAKER_44]: These are my neighbors.

2042
03:08:59,571 --> 03:09:01,353
[SPEAKER_44]: These are the person who walks down my street.

2043
03:09:01,853 --> 03:09:02,593
[SPEAKER_44]: I know these people.

2044
03:09:03,374 --> 03:09:07,556
[SPEAKER_44]: But yet sometimes during the course of this evening, I've not been feeling very happy.

2045
03:09:08,217 --> 03:09:14,461
[SPEAKER_44]: I know you mean to support each other by the calls and cat calls and whatever, but that's not what we're about.

2046
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:22,504
[SPEAKER_44]: What we are about is that we've got three great names before us and we're making a very difficult change for some.

2047
03:09:23,305 --> 03:09:35,252
[SPEAKER_44]: And that for me is extremely important because I have to be true to myself and people, there will be, no matter what I do, there will be people who are going to be unhappy with my decision or my colleagues' decisions.

2048
03:09:36,052 --> 03:09:38,734
[SPEAKER_44]: I ask you, by the way, don't, after I speak,

2049
03:09:39,164 --> 03:09:42,425
[SPEAKER_44]: Don't clap or catcall and don't do the same for them either.

2050
03:09:42,846 --> 03:09:44,947
[SPEAKER_44]: Let us have an intelligent discussion now.

2051
03:09:45,247 --> 03:09:55,271
[SPEAKER_44]: You may disagree with us, but I have to tell you, everyone is coming here after giving so much thought and so much pain.

2052
03:09:57,532 --> 03:10:03,615
[SPEAKER_44]: I listened to, after when we brought out this discussion, one of the biggest things that

2053
03:10:04,454 --> 03:10:16,265
[SPEAKER_44]: that is motivating me for my discussion is hearing some of the portion of our community who felt disenfranchised by our removing the name Columbus.

2054
03:10:17,646 --> 03:10:25,053
[SPEAKER_44]: I voted to remove the name Columbus because I thought it was the right thing to do, but I heard pain in people speaking.

2055
03:10:26,134 --> 03:10:27,656
[SPEAKER_44]: And I very much recognize that.

2056
03:10:28,035 --> 03:10:28,877
[SPEAKER_44]: and appreciate that.

2057
03:10:29,098 --> 03:10:33,150
[SPEAKER_44]: By the way, before I go on, I do want to call out to the advisory committee.

2058
03:10:33,611 --> 03:10:35,917
[SPEAKER_44]: I thank you and appreciate the work that you did.

2059
03:10:36,610 --> 03:10:41,934
[SPEAKER_44]: did we know how incredibly difficult we were going to put you into a particular circumstance?

2060
03:10:42,414 --> 03:10:49,259
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't agree with all of you of what you said when I got to watch pieces of it, but I certainly understood and appreciated the commitment.

2061
03:10:49,699 --> 03:10:54,302
[SPEAKER_44]: And frankly, I felt kind of sorry for you at times when you got to the wordsmithing part.

2062
03:10:55,023 --> 03:11:00,967
[SPEAKER_44]: And then the other part that was very amusing was when you were talking about the school committee, it was this bunch of overs, what were we going to do?

2063
03:11:00,987 --> 03:11:02,468
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just mentioned that.

2064
03:11:03,329 --> 03:11:04,149
[SPEAKER_44]: But anyway, um,

2065
03:11:07,253 --> 03:11:18,259
[SPEAKER_44]: My long-term here on the school committee means that there were names who were on the list who didn't make it in to even that list of whatever it was, 17 or 18 people.

2066
03:11:18,939 --> 03:11:21,660
[SPEAKER_44]: Tony Lucci, my God, what a guy he was.

2067
03:11:22,321 --> 03:11:23,501
[SPEAKER_44]: He owned the sports store.

2068
03:11:24,001 --> 03:11:25,242
[SPEAKER_44]: He loved kids.

2069
03:11:25,502 --> 03:11:29,184
[SPEAKER_44]: He gave every kid, if they needed some free shoes or something like that.

2070
03:11:29,624 --> 03:11:31,265
[SPEAKER_44]: Now we have recognized Tony.

2071
03:11:31,685 --> 03:11:35,147
[SPEAKER_44]: We put his name up on the corner, but he's a guy who was terrific.

2072
03:11:36,324 --> 03:11:46,688
[SPEAKER_44]: Miriam Morrissey, another fabulous educator, a person in our community, sister of Amelia Earhart, but someone who really stayed and worked in our community.

2073
03:11:47,629 --> 03:11:55,832
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't get to meet Alphonse Fresa, but he was the editor of the Medford Mercury, and they used to call him Mr. Medford.

2074
03:11:56,872 --> 03:12:00,674
[SPEAKER_44]: If we were doing this years ago, his name would have been at the top of the list.

2075
03:12:01,554 --> 03:12:04,536
[SPEAKER_44]: Ray Murano was superintendent of schools, and there were others.

2076
03:12:06,092 --> 03:12:09,934
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, part of the interesting thing about this is what we remember.

2077
03:12:10,415 --> 03:12:11,555
[SPEAKER_44]: Where are we calling?

2078
03:12:11,956 --> 03:12:18,220
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, I have an advantage over some of my committee members because I knew Jean Barry Sutherland personally.

2079
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:20,101
[SPEAKER_44]: I knew her well.

2080
03:12:21,021 --> 03:12:22,422
[SPEAKER_44]: And so I have that advantage.

2081
03:12:24,724 --> 03:12:30,708
[SPEAKER_44]: When I think about the others and people have said, do the right thing, but of course, do the right thing means something different to each one of us.

2082
03:12:30,808 --> 03:12:34,450
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's like, do the right thing, do the right thing, but we're interpreting that in different ways.

2083
03:12:35,216 --> 03:12:39,139
[SPEAKER_44]: For me, I'm being true to what I've said and true to myself.

2084
03:12:40,159 --> 03:12:42,701
[SPEAKER_44]: I think Belinda Sutton's story is amazing.

2085
03:12:43,201 --> 03:12:48,565
[SPEAKER_44]: And I want to celebrate her in Medford, not at the Royal House, but someplace else.

2086
03:12:49,265 --> 03:13:04,675
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't have authority to name other things in the city, but maybe when we look, the Belinda Sutton community room at the new library, the Belinda Sutton something, I think that we can, what we have learned about her in this process is extraordinary.

2087
03:13:05,376 --> 03:13:09,078
[SPEAKER_44]: And there's appreciation from everybody of saying, yeah, wow, I didn't know that.

2088
03:13:09,358 --> 03:13:15,902
[SPEAKER_44]: By the way, our kids do get to go to the royal house in fifth grade, and they do learn about Belinda Sutton at that time.

2089
03:13:16,182 --> 03:13:17,043
[SPEAKER_44]: Just wanted you to know that.

2090
03:13:17,523 --> 03:13:18,484
[SPEAKER_44]: They do, it's there.

2091
03:13:19,344 --> 03:13:21,326
[SPEAKER_44]: So maybe they don't remember it, but it's there.

2092
03:13:23,727 --> 03:13:28,130
[SPEAKER_44]: Misituk, I also totally appreciate the name and the origin.

2093
03:13:28,290 --> 03:13:31,291
[SPEAKER_44]: I walk next to the Mystic River every single day.

2094
03:13:32,092 --> 03:13:32,952
[SPEAKER_44]: As I look at that,

2095
03:13:34,400 --> 03:13:38,244
[SPEAKER_44]: The biggest concern for me is in fact, the students who had the poll.

2096
03:13:39,244 --> 03:13:41,026
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. Tuck got 107 votes.

2097
03:13:41,406 --> 03:13:42,768
[SPEAKER_44]: Jean Barry got 84.

2098
03:13:43,008 --> 03:13:43,929
[SPEAKER_44]: Belinda Sutton got 86.

2099
03:13:45,430 --> 03:13:47,132
[SPEAKER_44]: So if I look at 84 and 86, that's 170.

2100
03:13:47,292 --> 03:13:50,675
[SPEAKER_44]: So then there is, you know, it was a three-way vote.

2101
03:13:50,695 --> 03:13:51,736
[SPEAKER_44]: It wasn't a two-way vote.

2102
03:13:52,016 --> 03:13:59,783
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, of course, democratically, if it's, you know, whoever gets the highest vote, I am stuck with that because I wonder if Jean Barry would be saying, go with the kids.

2103
03:13:59,863 --> 03:14:00,884
[SPEAKER_44]: And that's my only problem.

2104
03:14:01,872 --> 03:14:03,053
[SPEAKER_44]: But I knew Jean Barry.

2105
03:14:03,353 --> 03:14:09,138
[SPEAKER_44]: I knew her when she was selected to represent Medford in Nobioka, okay?

2106
03:14:09,318 --> 03:14:11,099
[SPEAKER_44]: That was an incredible honor.

2107
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:15,983
[SPEAKER_44]: Two educators were going off to represent Medford in our sister city of Japan.

2108
03:14:16,604 --> 03:14:27,132
[SPEAKER_44]: And for years, we also had students who were selected, the highest students who got to go and visit Nobioka, our sister city, and in return, they came here.

2109
03:14:27,533 --> 03:14:29,154
[SPEAKER_44]: Jean was the first one who got to go.

2110
03:14:29,494 --> 03:14:30,375
[SPEAKER_44]: It was fabulous.

2111
03:14:31,315 --> 03:14:38,140
[SPEAKER_44]: I knew Jean when she was a teacher at the Dane, and I knew Jean when she welcomed me into the Columbus School.

2112
03:14:38,620 --> 03:14:47,926
[SPEAKER_44]: And she said, as she looked around her classroom, her school, as she toured me, and she said, look at this, isn't this great?

2113
03:14:48,467 --> 03:14:53,550
[SPEAKER_44]: Look how many students we have from all different countries and all different places.

2114
03:14:55,472 --> 03:14:58,534
[SPEAKER_44]: Jean Barry always had a smile across her face.

2115
03:14:59,154 --> 03:15:00,455
[SPEAKER_44]: She was inclusive.

2116
03:15:01,343 --> 03:15:03,744
[SPEAKER_44]: She was involved.

2117
03:15:04,724 --> 03:15:06,764
[SPEAKER_44]: You can't really say a bad thing about Jean.

2118
03:15:06,824 --> 03:15:07,525
[SPEAKER_44]: Someone said it.

2119
03:15:09,685 --> 03:15:10,185
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm lucky.

2120
03:15:10,205 --> 03:15:11,086
[SPEAKER_44]: I knew her.

2121
03:15:12,326 --> 03:15:13,486
[SPEAKER_44]: I wish everybody knew her.

2122
03:15:15,107 --> 03:15:17,027
[SPEAKER_44]: She has been at the school.

2123
03:15:17,207 --> 03:15:26,550
[SPEAKER_44]: There is a tribute to Jean Barry at the school and has been since her death with the sign saying Jean Barry.

2124
03:15:28,569 --> 03:15:30,631
[SPEAKER_44]: That happened because she was so valued.

2125
03:15:31,011 --> 03:15:33,952
[SPEAKER_44]: And when she died, man, it was awfully hard.

2126
03:15:34,073 --> 03:15:36,414
[SPEAKER_44]: I remember how many people were crying.

2127
03:15:36,594 --> 03:15:38,275
[SPEAKER_44]: It was such a loss in our community.

2128
03:15:39,456 --> 03:15:44,078
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm gonna support, that would be my first choice, would be Jean Barry.

2129
03:15:44,499 --> 03:15:49,222
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't want you to clap or anything else like that because you agree with me, okay?

2130
03:15:49,782 --> 03:15:55,065
[SPEAKER_44]: Unfortunately, sometimes in here, there's a feeling that it's been divisive.

2131
03:15:56,161 --> 03:15:57,642
[SPEAKER_44]: Jean Barry was an educator.

2132
03:15:57,822 --> 03:16:04,365
[SPEAKER_44]: As I pick an educator as a member of the school committee, I am upholding every educator that we have had in this community.

2133
03:16:04,885 --> 03:16:15,971
[SPEAKER_44]: Every teacher, every principal, every superintendent, everybody who has committed themselves to education, to me, we can look and we can say to the kids, education is so important.

2134
03:16:16,536 --> 03:16:21,201
[SPEAKER_44]: that this community recognizes an educator on the name of one of our buildings.

2135
03:16:21,861 --> 03:16:25,525
[SPEAKER_44]: That is the perspective that I come from and that I bring.

2136
03:16:26,205 --> 03:16:28,247
[SPEAKER_44]: I think that the other names are fantastic.

2137
03:16:28,648 --> 03:16:31,751
[SPEAKER_44]: I hope we utilize them in our community in a different way.

2138
03:16:34,233 --> 03:16:34,834
[SPEAKER_44]: One last thing.

2139
03:16:36,035 --> 03:16:37,036
[SPEAKER_44]: I take exception.

2140
03:16:38,240 --> 03:16:45,569
[SPEAKER_44]: to the person and the commentary that has happened that has said this school committee didn't function about our education.

2141
03:16:45,909 --> 03:16:47,311
[SPEAKER_44]: We only worried about this.

2142
03:16:48,032 --> 03:16:53,017
[SPEAKER_44]: I need to say this to you as someone who has been on the school committee for many, many years.

2143
03:16:53,538 --> 03:16:55,681
[SPEAKER_44]: This school committee worked hard

2144
03:16:56,361 --> 03:16:58,542
[SPEAKER_44]: This school committee, yes, we had this.

2145
03:16:59,363 --> 03:17:02,804
[SPEAKER_44]: It was at the right time and we could debate that till we were blue in the face.

2146
03:17:03,124 --> 03:17:04,065
[SPEAKER_44]: We don't need to go there.

2147
03:17:04,565 --> 03:17:09,567
[SPEAKER_44]: But what we do need to let you know is in the month of March, this school committee had 23 meetings.

2148
03:17:11,539 --> 03:17:19,101
[SPEAKER_44]: Earlier, when we started out, we took Tony Ray, our nurse, and we held her up because she's been such an incredible force.

2149
03:17:19,761 --> 03:17:31,784
[SPEAKER_44]: This school committee, our administrative people, our school committee members, we're not looking for your praise, but to sit here and hear you say you didn't care about our kids is simply wrong.

2150
03:17:32,024 --> 03:17:33,264
[SPEAKER_44]: And if I don't say it,

2151
03:17:33,965 --> 03:17:39,467
[SPEAKER_44]: okay, I cannot live with the feeling of just sort of sitting here and nodding my head and saying, oh, yeah, right.

2152
03:17:39,727 --> 03:17:40,327
[SPEAKER_44]: That was true.

2153
03:17:40,587 --> 03:17:41,388
[SPEAKER_44]: That wasn't true.

2154
03:17:41,628 --> 03:17:43,288
[SPEAKER_44]: We worked damn hard.

2155
03:17:45,349 --> 03:17:46,289
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Member van de Kloet.

2156
03:17:46,309 --> 03:17:46,829
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Kretz?

2157
03:17:47,150 --> 03:17:48,070
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, thank you.

2158
03:17:48,190 --> 03:17:54,992
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just want to thank everybody who came out tonight and spoke at the podium or on Zoom and the emails that were sent in.

2159
03:17:56,333 --> 03:18:02,895
[SPEAKER_33]: So I, you know, first off, all of the choices were excellent and deserving of being the name on a school building.

2160
03:18:03,926 --> 03:18:07,109
[SPEAKER_33]: I am in favor of Jean Barry Sutherland.

2161
03:18:07,750 --> 03:18:09,972
[SPEAKER_33]: She served as an educator over 30 years.

2162
03:18:10,712 --> 03:18:15,837
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm one of eight myself, and I had the privilege to have her as one of my teachers at the Waite School.

2163
03:18:16,517 --> 03:18:17,578
[SPEAKER_33]: It was a neighborhood school.

2164
03:18:17,958 --> 03:18:20,881
[SPEAKER_33]: She was a genuine, dedicated teacher, truly outstanding.

2165
03:18:21,361 --> 03:18:24,985
[SPEAKER_33]: My siblings and friends, we would go by to visit her after school.

2166
03:18:25,205 --> 03:18:28,207
[SPEAKER_33]: She lived in the neighborhood, and we always wanted to go see Ms.

2167
03:18:28,227 --> 03:18:28,908
[SPEAKER_33]: Barry, and she's

2168
03:18:29,206 --> 03:18:32,008
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, be planting outside or taking care of our grass.

2169
03:18:32,068 --> 03:18:35,210
[SPEAKER_33]: And we'd always say, hi, Miss Barry, and, you know, wave along.

2170
03:18:36,171 --> 03:18:39,534
[SPEAKER_33]: She would stay after school and help with anything that we were struggling with.

2171
03:18:40,154 --> 03:18:43,417
[SPEAKER_33]: I had difficulty with reading and she would stay after with me.

2172
03:18:43,697 --> 03:18:53,004
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, when she did pass away, I'm part of the Waite School Facebook group, and so many stories were shared about her.

2173
03:18:53,144 --> 03:18:58,688
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's just, you know, everything that was said tonight is all factual, historical,

2174
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:04,122
[SPEAKER_33]: I still remember going to the Wade School, walking with the neighborhood friends.

2175
03:19:04,202 --> 03:19:07,764
[SPEAKER_33]: We just all walked together down the Wade School path to the school.

2176
03:19:09,064 --> 03:19:11,325
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, the Memphis School is in a better place because of Ms.

2177
03:19:11,365 --> 03:19:11,845
[SPEAKER_33]: Barry.

2178
03:19:12,486 --> 03:19:22,910
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a unique opportunity to honor an educator and pay respect, especially to a person who walked and led in the school that we're renaming right now.

2179
03:19:25,046 --> 03:19:32,953
[SPEAKER_33]: She was a great leader, honoring Jean would also honor all the educators that rose to the many challenges of the unknown during the pandemic.

2180
03:19:33,513 --> 03:19:36,996
[SPEAKER_33]: And there's no one more deserving of renaming the school after.

2181
03:19:37,817 --> 03:19:39,658
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's my thought.

2182
03:19:39,898 --> 03:19:41,700
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just wanted to share that with everybody.

2183
03:19:42,320 --> 03:19:42,701
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2184
03:19:42,781 --> 03:19:44,102
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't want to clap either.

2185
03:19:44,222 --> 03:19:45,223
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you.

2186
03:19:45,523 --> 03:19:47,525
[SPEAKER_33]: So please, no claps or anything.

2187
03:19:47,605 --> 03:19:48,025
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2188
03:19:48,225 --> 03:19:48,986
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Member Kretz.

2189
03:19:55,666 --> 03:19:57,787
[SPEAKER_47]: I could go from the chair.

2190
03:20:00,989 --> 03:20:03,691
[SPEAKER_47]: Does anybody like to speak before me?

2191
03:20:03,711 --> 03:20:08,314
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, I'll go.

2192
03:20:08,514 --> 03:20:18,660
[SPEAKER_47]: I figured it's probably timely to go after member Van de Kloet and member Kretz spoke because I too was one of the lucky ones that got to know Ms.

2193
03:20:18,860 --> 03:20:19,941
[SPEAKER_47]: Jean Barry Sutherland.

2194
03:20:20,561 --> 03:20:24,704
[SPEAKER_47]: My mother worked in the school department at the same time Jean did.

2195
03:20:25,250 --> 03:20:33,655
[SPEAKER_47]: and I knew her personally, and she was a fantastic, hardworking, inclusive educator and principal.

2196
03:20:34,796 --> 03:20:48,744
[SPEAKER_47]: I remember her fondly, and even when we just saw her picture on the screen, it just brought back kind of memories, and I'm sure it did for her sisters who's standing here today speaking before us.

2197
03:20:50,465 --> 03:20:52,286
[SPEAKER_47]: With that being said, I agree with

2198
03:20:52,937 --> 03:20:58,299
[SPEAKER_47]: My colleagues that I've already spoke, these are three fantastic, fantastic choices.

2199
03:20:58,580 --> 03:21:04,362
[SPEAKER_47]: And I do believe all three need to be honored within this community at some point in the near future.

2200
03:21:05,443 --> 03:21:07,584
[SPEAKER_47]: I learned a lot about Ms.

2201
03:21:07,704 --> 03:21:10,225
[SPEAKER_47]: Belinda Sutton and Ms.

2202
03:21:10,285 --> 03:21:21,530
[SPEAKER_47]: Atuk that I knew some, but I learned a lot more thanks to the amazing work that 20 plus person committee did over the last six weeks.

2203
03:21:24,477 --> 03:21:26,777
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't think we could necessarily go wrong.

2204
03:21:27,037 --> 03:21:28,538
[SPEAKER_47]: I think they're great choices.

2205
03:21:30,499 --> 03:21:37,941
[SPEAKER_47]: Misutuk is also a great choice, and I know that the students chose it, so that's hard to vote against.

2206
03:21:38,041 --> 03:21:46,044
[SPEAKER_47]: And then Miss Sutton's story is pretty amazing, to say the least, and it's hard to vote against that as well.

2207
03:21:46,874 --> 03:21:53,319
[SPEAKER_47]: I wish that we could incorporate them all somehow in this one name change, but I know there's more things to come.

2208
03:21:53,379 --> 03:22:01,645
[SPEAKER_47]: Like you said, member Vanden Heuvel, the library, there's gonna be opportunities and I would love to see where we can take that.

2209
03:22:02,406 --> 03:22:04,167
[SPEAKER_47]: So that's where I stand.

2210
03:22:04,207 --> 03:22:10,272
[SPEAKER_47]: I think they're all fantastic choices, but to have known Ms.

2211
03:22:10,913 --> 03:22:12,634
[SPEAKER_47]: Barry Sutherland is,

2212
03:22:15,802 --> 03:22:18,104
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm glad her name was there and that would be my choice.

2213
03:22:23,668 --> 03:22:23,928
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor?

2214
03:22:25,189 --> 03:22:25,910
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin?

2215
03:22:26,330 --> 03:22:26,771
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2216
03:22:27,271 --> 03:22:29,213
[SPEAKER_46]: First, I want to thank the committee for all their hard work.

2217
03:22:29,233 --> 03:22:30,334
[SPEAKER_46]: I know that was a lot.

2218
03:22:30,954 --> 03:22:37,980
[SPEAKER_46]: I watched several of the meetings as well, and I know that it's been a rough year for everyone in multiple ways, for sure.

2219
03:22:38,800 --> 03:22:43,424
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'm going to speak my heart like I always do, and I'm going to speak my values.

2220
03:22:44,073 --> 03:22:46,995
[SPEAKER_46]: First, I want to say, I wish I had known your sister.

2221
03:22:47,275 --> 03:22:48,895
[SPEAKER_46]: She sounds quite remarkable.

2222
03:22:49,396 --> 03:22:52,637
[SPEAKER_46]: And I want to thank you for being here tonight because I know that that wasn't easy.

2223
03:22:52,677 --> 03:22:57,960
[SPEAKER_46]: And I also watched her husband at the city council meeting.

2224
03:22:57,980 --> 03:22:58,941
[SPEAKER_46]: It was very powerful.

2225
03:22:58,961 --> 03:23:00,982
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

2226
03:23:01,462 --> 03:23:01,722
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2227
03:23:02,282 --> 03:23:03,143
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you for being here.

2228
03:23:03,643 --> 03:23:04,784
[SPEAKER_46]: And it was really good to hear you.

2229
03:23:07,105 --> 03:23:08,726
[SPEAKER_46]: And she does sound quite remarkable.

2230
03:23:08,866 --> 03:23:12,568
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think that the division in the community has been really something to watch.

2231
03:23:13,672 --> 03:23:22,814
[SPEAKER_46]: especially as a first time school committee member and also, you know, deliberating in my own mind and debating at night and staying up at night over a lot of this.

2232
03:23:23,234 --> 03:23:35,357
[SPEAKER_46]: I think the one thing that will sort of stay with me tonight more than anything else was the individual who mentioned that we had neglected the children.

2233
03:23:36,777 --> 03:23:42,018
[SPEAKER_46]: And I felt really, I took that to heart and I have to share with you guys, you know, and I sometimes overshare, I guess,

2234
03:23:43,195 --> 03:23:45,516
[SPEAKER_46]: whatever, but I was a neglected child.

2235
03:23:45,596 --> 03:23:49,157
[SPEAKER_46]: I was awarded the state and I know what it means to be a neglected child.

2236
03:23:49,877 --> 03:23:53,118
[SPEAKER_46]: And I have not neglected the children of this school district.

2237
03:23:53,198 --> 03:24:00,580
[SPEAKER_46]: I have worked really hard for the children in this community and especially the marginalized children in this community having been a marginalized child.

2238
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:07,282
[SPEAKER_46]: And I will continue to do that whether I'm on the school committee or not, I can promise you all that I will do that because that's just my nature.

2239
03:24:07,302 --> 03:24:12,303
[SPEAKER_46]: And I wanna say that I know we all feel passionate about things here.

2240
03:24:13,342 --> 03:24:18,864
[SPEAKER_46]: And I really, really, really hope that we can come together as a community because Medford is an amazing community.

2241
03:24:19,084 --> 03:24:20,384
[SPEAKER_46]: I am so fortunate to live here.

2242
03:24:20,845 --> 03:24:21,905
[SPEAKER_46]: I have raised my children here.

2243
03:24:21,925 --> 03:24:23,105
[SPEAKER_46]: I've been here 24 years.

2244
03:24:23,245 --> 03:24:26,847
[SPEAKER_46]: I have three kids who are lifelong Medford residents.

2245
03:24:27,587 --> 03:24:28,927
[SPEAKER_46]: And I'm proud to be here.

2246
03:24:29,067 --> 03:24:30,088
[SPEAKER_46]: And this is my community.

2247
03:24:30,328 --> 03:24:31,328
[SPEAKER_46]: This is my city too.

2248
03:24:31,408 --> 03:24:32,869
[SPEAKER_46]: And I do have to see you all tomorrow.

2249
03:24:33,469 --> 03:24:34,209
[SPEAKER_46]: I understand that.

2250
03:24:35,470 --> 03:24:42,272
[SPEAKER_46]: And I wanna share with you for my reasons and for the things that have kept me up at night and for all of the things that I'm sharing with you now,

2251
03:24:43,324 --> 03:24:47,365
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm going with the children and I will be voting Mr. Tuck.

2252
03:24:47,525 --> 03:24:50,386
[SPEAKER_46]: And I wanna thank you all for being here tonight and thank you for listening to me.

2253
03:25:00,509 --> 03:25:03,349
[SPEAKER_47]: Would anybody else like to speak?

2254
03:25:09,051 --> 03:25:09,911
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2255
03:25:14,615 --> 03:25:17,037
[SPEAKER_44]: I guess I'm just, I wasn't sure of the process.

2256
03:25:17,097 --> 03:25:19,398
[SPEAKER_44]: If we're all making a statement, is that a straw poll?

2257
03:25:20,059 --> 03:25:23,861
[SPEAKER_44]: If you don't want to make a statement, we can do a roll call, but you just need a motion on the floor.

2258
03:25:24,381 --> 03:25:28,544
[SPEAKER_44]: Well, probably just saying a name probably doesn't give people an understanding of where I was coming from.

2259
03:25:29,745 --> 03:25:37,550
[SPEAKER_44]: So like everyone else, this has been a challenging year, and I'm glad we're here tonight to move forward.

2260
03:25:38,691 --> 03:25:39,971
[SPEAKER_44]: They are three great names.

2261
03:25:41,337 --> 03:25:46,479
[SPEAKER_44]: saw Lewin Topper at our son's baseball game the other day and we had a conversation about it.

2262
03:25:47,579 --> 03:25:57,123
[SPEAKER_44]: You might remember that a few months back the school was originally or the school was originally in the mystic a few months back I made a motion to just let's return to the name of the original school

2263
03:25:57,623 --> 03:25:59,104
[SPEAKER_44]: that did not move forward.

2264
03:25:59,604 --> 03:26:20,572
[SPEAKER_44]: I still think Mystic made the most sense, but now we're at this point and I do think the Mississippi Tech makes the most sense that it is something that is all-encompassing because it is more about geography and that the students are all very supportive of it.

2265
03:26:20,932 --> 03:26:24,934
[SPEAKER_44]: And I do want to say I did not know

2266
03:26:26,539 --> 03:26:28,840
[SPEAKER_44]: Unfortunately, I did not know Miss Jean Barry Sutherland.

2267
03:26:29,140 --> 03:26:36,242
[SPEAKER_44]: I didn't have the opportunity and hearing her sister speak made me wish I had the opportunity to meet her.

2268
03:26:36,902 --> 03:26:38,923
[SPEAKER_44]: And I appreciate her husband being here.

2269
03:26:39,503 --> 03:26:56,168
[SPEAKER_44]: And I, my heart goes out to them for someone who's, you've lost someone so young, but I do want to say that I think for the community moving forward, I think the river is something that is, that is connected to all of us here and that

2270
03:26:58,665 --> 03:27:04,090
[SPEAKER_44]: I wasn't going to share this story because you never know how people take it.

2271
03:27:04,170 --> 03:27:04,790
[SPEAKER_44]: My father

2272
03:27:07,056 --> 03:27:09,477
[SPEAKER_44]: He grew up in Ireland, but always driving up Fulton Street.

2273
03:27:09,517 --> 03:27:18,183
[SPEAKER_44]: I grew up at 350 Fulton Street, and my father always going up the hill, he would say, you know, Mia, long before us, there were Native Americans who walked up Fulton Street.

2274
03:27:18,203 --> 03:27:22,306
[SPEAKER_44]: It wasn't called Fulton Street, obviously, but to Wright's Pond, and that's where they got their water.

2275
03:27:22,366 --> 03:27:26,769
[SPEAKER_44]: And as a kid, it never really registered with me that there were people here before us.

2276
03:27:27,029 --> 03:27:34,934
[SPEAKER_44]: And now it kind of came full circle for me that this is an opportunity to recognize the Native Americans and the tribes that were here.

2277
03:27:35,526 --> 03:27:37,126
[SPEAKER_44]: before us, long before us.

2278
03:27:37,247 --> 03:27:39,627
[SPEAKER_44]: So I appreciate all the community.

2279
03:27:39,707 --> 03:27:42,948
[SPEAKER_44]: I've had a lot of great conversations, a lot of great email exchanges.

2280
03:27:43,088 --> 03:27:55,812
[SPEAKER_44]: And I, I feel like I do have a piece about us that we are moving forward in that we can all work together to make Medford inclusive and welcoming for everybody.

2281
03:27:55,892 --> 03:27:56,472
[SPEAKER_44]: So thank you.

2282
03:27:58,433 --> 03:27:58,693
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2283
03:27:58,713 --> 03:27:59,353
[SPEAKER_44]: Member Stone.

2284
03:27:59,633 --> 03:28:00,093
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Graham.

2285
03:28:02,014 --> 03:28:02,374
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2286
03:28:02,967 --> 03:28:05,568
[SPEAKER_35]: I also wanted to thank the Advisory Committee.

2287
03:28:05,728 --> 03:28:13,931
[SPEAKER_35]: I think anytime you sign on for a volunteer gig, it always is more than we promise.

2288
03:28:14,771 --> 03:28:16,012
[SPEAKER_35]: And this is no exception.

2289
03:28:16,652 --> 03:28:20,713
[SPEAKER_44]: I know that members of the Advisory Committee worked hard in meetings.

2290
03:28:20,853 --> 03:28:21,734
[SPEAKER_44]: I watched them all.

2291
03:28:22,554 --> 03:28:24,435
[SPEAKER_35]: I know they worked hard outside of the meetings.

2292
03:28:24,535 --> 03:28:30,697
[SPEAKER_35]: And I know they worked hard to find a way forward, even though they, at times, intensely disagree with each other.

2293
03:28:31,944 --> 03:28:34,645
[SPEAKER_44]: I think that is the true spirit of public discourse.

2294
03:28:35,285 --> 03:28:46,628
[SPEAKER_44]: And I appreciate and thank you all for your actions and for the grace that you and compassion that you showed as you put this together and came before us tonight.

2295
03:28:47,208 --> 03:29:00,051
[SPEAKER_35]: I will say one of the things that has been the most striking to me throughout this process is the letter that we received from a good number of the teachers at the Columbus School, citing their favor to Misatoch,

2296
03:29:00,860 --> 03:29:05,604
[SPEAKER_44]: And, you know, one of the things that they talked about was in fact moving forward.

2297
03:29:06,204 --> 03:29:14,630
[SPEAKER_44]: I think the letter may have acknowledged that there were some number of teachers, which I think is really reasonable to expect that didn't want to change the name at all.

2298
03:29:15,371 --> 03:29:16,592
[SPEAKER_44]: And as educators.

2299
03:29:17,119 --> 03:29:38,294
[SPEAKER_44]: And as the folks, the adults in the room that we expect to take care of and protect the students who go to school there, I really appreciated their thoughtfulness and the way that they sat back and reflected beyond sort of what they might have individually thought and said, what is the best thing for our school community?

2300
03:29:38,795 --> 03:29:41,477
[SPEAKER_44]: And what do we think is the best thing for the children who go here?

2301
03:29:41,557 --> 03:29:43,998
[SPEAKER_44]: So I am in favor of Ms.

2302
03:29:44,038 --> 03:29:44,219
[SPEAKER_44]: Tuck.

2303
03:29:44,759 --> 03:29:45,039
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

2304
03:29:47,113 --> 03:30:14,428
[SPEAKER_46]: member so I make a motion to vote on the name change for Columbus school is that how the committee wants to proceed for three votes or motion to vote on the name change for the Columbus school so you want a 4-3 vote or do we want to know I didn't I thought we were going to do a roll call no

2305
03:30:15,589 --> 03:30:21,033
[SPEAKER_47]: if we know what the last member is deciding, we could maybe, it's up to the committee, try to.

2306
03:30:21,714 --> 03:30:30,440
[SPEAKER_44]: The appropriate way to do it, Mayor, would be to have us each state, I mean, like, that's the name probably that we would go for.

2307
03:30:31,001 --> 03:30:34,623
[SPEAKER_44]: I did receive another, I was distracted only because I saw another letter came in.

2308
03:30:36,005 --> 03:30:36,505
[SPEAKER_43]: But we'll close.

2309
03:30:36,545 --> 03:30:37,526
[SPEAKER_44]: Anticipation's closed.

2310
03:30:37,586 --> 03:30:37,826
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay.

2311
03:30:38,526 --> 03:30:38,767
[SPEAKER_44]: Yep.

2312
03:30:39,187 --> 03:30:39,387
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2313
03:30:40,288 --> 03:30:40,548
[SPEAKER_43]: Mayor?

2314
03:30:40,568 --> 03:30:41,249
[SPEAKER_44]: You call the roll?

2315
03:30:41,709 --> 03:30:43,810
[SPEAKER_44]: I do believe that before,

2316
03:30:45,461 --> 03:30:52,844
[SPEAKER_44]: we are done voting, we have to make a motion for a name and then vote for that name.

2317
03:30:52,904 --> 03:31:08,749
[SPEAKER_35]: So, you know, we can straw poll, I think that's great and fine, but at some point, I think we will have to take an actual vote to rename the school to something specific, just to make sure that we are adhering to the rules of order.

2318
03:31:10,890 --> 03:31:14,311
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Moghulafan, if you could call the roll, we could state the name.

2319
03:31:17,085 --> 03:31:17,685
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

2320
03:31:18,646 --> 03:31:19,166
[SPEAKER_46]: Misutak.

2321
03:31:20,867 --> 03:31:21,527
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kretz.

03:31:22,388 --> 03:31:23,528

03:31:26,610 --> 03:31:27,090

[SPEAKER_47]: So is there a motion on the floor?

[SPEAKER_47]: meeting which was tabled for May 24th and June 7th.

2364
03:34:49,432 --> 03:34:52,437
[SPEAKER_05]: May I make an amendment?

2365
03:35:07,537 --> 03:35:13,020
[SPEAKER_05]: to remove the public participation emails from those minutes and then motion to approve them without those.

2366
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:16,022
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion for approve as amended, seconded by member Graham.

2367

2368
03:35:19,004 --> 03:35:20,685

03:35:20,705 --> 03:35:20,945
[SPEAKER_05]: May, sorry.

2370
03:35:36,869 --> 03:35:40,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Freedom of Information Act requirements, all emails are the same.

2371
03:35:41,213 --> 03:35:46,777
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah.

2372
03:35:48,138 --> 03:35:48,979
[SPEAKER_48]: Yeah.

2373

2374
03:35:51,281 --> 03:35:54,364
[SPEAKER_48]: Oh.

2375
03:35:57,506 --> 03:35:59,008
[SPEAKER_44]: Can I make a friendly amendment if...

2376
03:36:00,505 --> 03:36:07,388
[SPEAKER_38]: I believe on city Council when they have e-mails, they just put the name and address.

2377
03:36:07,408 --> 03:36:08,669
[SPEAKER_38]: I couldn't hear your motion.

2378
03:36:09,970 --> 03:36:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion was to remove the public participation e-mails from the minutes and approve them without that, which is what we do in all of our other minutes.

2379
03:36:19,494 --> 03:36:20,875

[SPEAKER_46]: No, there's not.

2428
03:37:53,868 --> 03:37:54,708
[SPEAKER_47]: Reports of committees.

2429
03:37:55,984 --> 03:37:58,987
[SPEAKER_47]: keep this just to a brief summary, yep.

2430
03:37:59,928 --> 03:38:03,993
[SPEAKER_47]: Rules, policy, equity subcommittee meeting on June 9th, 2021.

2431
03:38:04,073 --> 03:38:04,473
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Russo.

2432
03:38:06,374 --> 03:38:06,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

2433
03:38:08,074 --> 03:38:12,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rules, policy and equity subcommittee meeting met on June 9th to review three policies.

2434
03:38:13,515 --> 03:38:14,996
[SPEAKER_05]: They are contained in your packet.

2435
03:38:15,136 --> 03:38:20,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't read the minutes because, well, because I assume you've read the minutes.

2436
03:38:21,777 --> 03:38:26,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is, so I guess then we, I always forget.

2437
03:38:26,478 --> 03:38:31,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we just first do a motion on the minutes and then we do the three policies, Mayor?

2438
03:38:32,686 --> 03:38:33,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I always get confused.

2439
03:38:33,347 --> 03:38:36,189
[SPEAKER_47]: Could you just please describe just the three points?

2440
03:38:36,289 --> 03:38:36,770
[SPEAKER_47]: Sure.

2441
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:37,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2442
03:38:37,510 --> 03:38:40,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had three items on our agenda.

2443
03:38:40,453 --> 03:38:44,116
[SPEAKER_05]: One was policy ICICA, which is the school year calendar.

2444
03:38:44,816 --> 03:38:53,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a meeting to discuss updating it to include Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and Lunar New Year as excused as no school days.

2445
03:38:58,223 --> 03:39:05,709
[SPEAKER_05]: the committee, the subcommittee voted unanimously to recommend that the full committee makes that change.

2446
03:39:07,270 --> 03:39:20,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We had an extensive conversation around snow days and one of the interesting things is that the majority of our, well, these three holidays are holidays that are lunar holidays or based on the lunar calendar.

2447
03:39:22,062 --> 03:39:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So each year there'll be a different number of,

2448
03:39:27,017 --> 03:39:29,537
[SPEAKER_05]: of days that actually end up landing on a school day.

2449
03:39:30,578 --> 03:39:41,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe a member of the community on the meeting looked out like five years and they were not all actually going to be school days that would be an excused day off.

2450
03:39:43,260 --> 03:39:51,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but it's possible that at some future date, there will be too many holidays in a particular year.

2451
03:39:52,142 --> 03:39:54,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be rare, but it could happen.

2452
03:39:55,241 --> 03:40:01,404
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've actually amended the policy to include, to cover that particular scenario if it should happen.

2453
03:40:03,045 --> 03:40:05,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the first item.

2454
03:40:06,567 --> 03:40:11,449
[SPEAKER_05]: The second item was a, I'm sorry, there's too many different papers in front of me.

2455
03:40:11,669 --> 03:40:14,310
[SPEAKER_05]: The second item was our public participation policy.

2456
03:40:16,431 --> 03:40:16,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2457
03:40:17,432 --> 03:40:20,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So the current public participation policy is like

2458
03:40:21,052 --> 03:40:27,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make a comment on this.

2459
03:40:27,098 --> 03:40:29,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is a dramatic expansion of the policy.

2460
03:40:30,341 --> 03:40:36,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It really makes things much more explicit for the public, for the committee, for the chair.

2461
03:40:39,429 --> 03:41:02,654
[SPEAKER_05]: well frankly for for new members but also for people in the public who are newly interested in public participation that they know which ends up because frankly the old policy which was just a few sentences is really not it's not instructional it's it's sort of it's just not instructional um so for the uninitiated and frankly for the initiated frankly

2462
03:41:03,121 --> 03:41:06,662
[SPEAKER_05]: on a regular basis, the old policy was not enough to go on.

2463
03:41:07,102 --> 03:41:12,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We experienced that in our last meeting last Monday, where there was confusion.

2464
03:41:12,303 --> 03:41:22,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that this new policy, which was unanimously recommended by the subcommittee, will in fact clarify a lot of that and that we shouldn't really have those problems going forward.

2465
03:41:23,632 --> 03:41:31,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the third item that we unanimously approved as well was an entirely new format for our agenda.

2466
03:41:32,324 --> 03:41:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And I assume that the members have all read this, so I'm not going to read the whole thing, but the highlights are that

2467
03:41:41,903 --> 03:41:43,784
[SPEAKER_05]: We have moved things around a bit.

2468
03:41:43,904 --> 03:41:52,009
[SPEAKER_05]: We've created a consent agenda so that there's just one vote to cover a bunch of things that we might normally do as separate votes.

2469
03:41:53,210 --> 03:42:01,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Really a key goal of the subcommittee's work on this was to chip away at the time we spend in our meeting.

2470
03:42:01,715 --> 03:42:09,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything we can do to make the meeting shorter without actually affecting the quality or the work that we're doing seemed like a really good idea.

2471
03:42:11,061 --> 03:42:30,688
[SPEAKER_05]: then so we've moved the consent agenda to the front we have the report of the subcommittees we've also identified a few things as being informational only at the end of the agenda we for instance are adding an item called next meetings this is not something that the chair will read this will just be printed on the agenda and

2472
03:42:33,377 --> 03:42:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at many different agenda formats in other communities to create this, but Medford, every community is so different in their format, and as everybody here knows, Medford's school committee meetings are three times longer.

2473
03:42:53,467 --> 03:42:56,348
[SPEAKER_05]: on a regular basis than a normal meeting in other communities.

2474
03:42:57,649 --> 03:43:05,772
[SPEAKER_05]: My goal is not to get us to an hour and a half, because I think that's like boiling the ocean with a match.

2475
03:43:05,912 --> 03:43:08,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too big of a leap.

2476
03:43:08,793 --> 03:43:14,736
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we can chip away and bring it down a half an hour, an hour, I think that will be good for everybody.

2477
03:43:17,435 --> 03:43:19,497
[SPEAKER_05]: The there's some other.

2478
03:43:19,957 --> 03:43:25,983
[SPEAKER_05]: So this new policy on the agenda, though, is this is not a copy of what an agenda will look like.

2479
03:43:26,103 --> 03:43:28,505
[SPEAKER_05]: These are instructions, frankly.

2480
03:43:29,744 --> 03:43:32,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this entire document will be the policy and it helps.

2481
03:43:33,707 --> 03:43:43,735
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we discussed was that when the mayor became chair, she hadn't chaired the school committee before and we didn't hand her a packet with an instruction set on how to do it.

2482
03:43:44,976 --> 03:43:46,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not like the city council.

2483
03:43:46,817 --> 03:43:55,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So it seemed really like we had a lot and when we have new members, we also have that problem of new members come in and there's like, well, how does this work?

2484
03:43:56,925 --> 03:44:11,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is sort of trying to build that muscle so that the uninitiated, whether it's the mayor, or it's the school committee members, or the public, you know what it is we, what's our process.

2485
03:44:13,520 --> 03:44:16,983
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some things in here for the mayor explicitly, for the chair.

2486
03:44:17,924 --> 03:44:18,804
[SPEAKER_05]: We've actually added,

2487
03:44:20,606 --> 03:44:27,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Instructions, you know, I do need to make an, offer an amendment on page one of the agenda policy.

2488
03:44:28,030 --> 03:44:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It says each item under sections four, five, six, and seven, the chair will proceed as follows.

2489
03:44:34,494 --> 03:44:37,135
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually sections seven and eight.

2490
03:44:40,497 --> 03:44:44,039
[SPEAKER_05]: On the very first page of the policy for the agenda.

2491
03:44:44,059 --> 03:44:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's this document.

2492
03:44:48,521 --> 03:44:50,162
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's no, it's on the very first page.

2493
03:44:51,676 --> 03:44:57,899
[SPEAKER_05]: This is agenda item VI 6.1.3, if you're looking for it.

2494
03:44:58,519 --> 03:45:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We rearranged things during the meeting and I forgot to update the numbers.

2495
03:45:06,183 --> 03:45:18,969
[SPEAKER_05]: This new policy on the agenda also helps us with the fact that we will have people on Zoom and people in the room and it just makes things clear so that we don't end up where we accidentally move along

2496
03:45:19,619 --> 03:45:22,360
[SPEAKER_05]: and then somebody was waiting to speak on an item.

2497
03:45:23,401 --> 03:45:30,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, when we get to the point where we think we're ready to go, we vote and move because it's late.

2498
03:45:31,325 --> 03:45:33,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will help to prevent the vote and move.

2499
03:45:34,027 --> 03:45:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, 15 minutes later, somebody wants to talk about something that we're already done with.

2500
03:45:40,590 --> 03:45:47,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happens a lot, frankly, or they just give up because they're like, oh, I missed my chance.

2501
03:45:48,749 --> 03:45:52,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and what else?

2502
03:45:53,233 --> 03:46:01,019
[SPEAKER_05]: The other members of the subcommittee, member McLaughlin and member Graham, are there other highlights of these policies you think are really important?

2503
03:46:01,979 --> 03:46:13,128
[SPEAKER_35]: Mayor, actually, I think one of the things we spent a fair bit of time talking about was sort of this contention of like, how do we strike a balance between not asking our administrators to be here at midnight and

2504
03:46:14,830 --> 03:46:31,243
[SPEAKER_35]: respecting the valuable role the public plays in providing input so one of the things that we did in the redesign of the agenda was move all of the school committee business to the front of the agenda so that that part of the agenda can start earlier in the evening.

2505
03:46:32,084 --> 03:46:38,589
[SPEAKER_35]: We can continue to do executive session ahead of time if necessary we can do all of that business with a commitment to the public

2506
03:46:39,029 --> 03:46:46,493
[SPEAKER_35]: that we won't begin public comment or any new business resolutions from the school committee until 7 p.m.

2507
03:46:47,033 --> 03:46:50,895
[SPEAKER_35]: So that way we don't have to wait to start a meeting until 7 p.m.

2508
03:46:50,975 --> 03:47:00,000
[SPEAKER_35]: We can get moving with the things on our agenda that we must do as a committee by law and statute like approve the minutes, approve the bills, all of those things

2509
03:47:00,495 --> 03:47:17,447
[SPEAKER_35]: receive the report of the superintendent, but that also we acknowledge and respect the fact that turning out at a meeting at five o'clock is not easy for some people and having an option for them to be able to participate with us starting at seven is much more palatable and traditional.

2510
03:47:18,294 --> 03:47:40,067
[SPEAKER_35]: we sort of bifurcated the agenda, uh, intentionally so that, you know, we could end up in a situation where all of our business is done at six 30, and then we just will recess till seven for the public to know that on, you know, religiously, we will not start before 7pm, um, and trying to sort of respect all of those things in balance.

2511
03:47:40,207 --> 03:47:41,908
[SPEAKER_35]: So I think that's, um,

2512
03:47:42,737 --> 03:47:44,258
[SPEAKER_35]: work that we did really thoughtfully.

2513
03:47:44,278 --> 03:47:58,626
[SPEAKER_35]: We had nice input from the public on that, and I really do think it's worth a try, particularly as we make all of these transitions in our meetings going forward.

2514
03:48:00,487 --> 03:48:01,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member Rousseau.

2515
03:48:01,768 --> 03:48:02,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2516
03:48:02,788 --> 03:48:08,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And also along those lines of the not starting the item six until 7 p.m., we

2517
03:48:12,233 --> 03:48:14,854
[SPEAKER_05]: what you won't see here is that we've specified a start time.

2518
03:48:14,934 --> 03:48:29,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So last Monday's meeting, the report of the superintendent included actually 10, there was the superintendent update, there were 10 other reports, and there were no superfluous reports, they all had to happen.

2519
03:48:29,818 --> 03:48:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that was what the superintendent imagined that the agenda needed to look like, well, this sort of gives her the authority to say, we're starting at five tonight, folks,

2520
03:48:42,285 --> 03:48:47,468
[SPEAKER_05]: and seven o'clock is the public part, the public participation part, will not begin before seven.

2521
03:48:47,508 --> 03:48:52,950
[SPEAKER_05]: If she looks at those 10 items and says, it's gonna take two hours, she can set the agenda for 5 p.m.

2522
03:48:53,330 --> 03:49:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But if the next week there's one item, I think we have one item on the superintendent's thing here tonight, then she can start at 6.30.

2523
03:49:03,115 --> 03:49:09,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not setting the start time because that stuff is, the public doesn't come up in like,

2524
03:49:10,276 --> 03:49:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: interview people doing a presentation to us.

2525
03:49:13,698 --> 03:49:18,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the part, we represent the community when we're getting reports.

2526
03:49:19,462 --> 03:49:26,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there is no public participation on those items for a reason.

2527
03:49:26,866 --> 03:49:27,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our job.

2528
03:49:28,467 --> 03:49:37,372
[SPEAKER_05]: But once the public participation part starts, we swear that we won't start till seven, even if we all have to like, you know, chit chat for half an hour.

2529
03:49:38,957 --> 03:49:55,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think that when I look back at other agendas, sometimes there's 10, sometimes there's one, and it's like setting a specific start time in stone means that we really have to set the start time really late.

2530
03:49:55,884 --> 03:50:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the administrators and principals and other folks are here till midnight and have to be back at 7 a.m.

2531
03:50:02,827 --> 03:50:05,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the goal in hopes of that.

2532
03:50:08,217 --> 03:50:09,378
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a lot of summary, sorry.

2533
03:50:12,341 --> 03:50:13,442
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Kratz?

2534
03:50:13,622 --> 03:50:15,164
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, I've had the light on.

2535
03:50:15,204 --> 03:50:18,607
[SPEAKER_33]: I just have questions about each of the policies.

2536
03:50:19,648 --> 03:50:24,093
[SPEAKER_33]: First, I'm going to start with the calendar policy.

2537
03:50:24,573 --> 03:50:27,336
[SPEAKER_33]: I did watch the meeting on YouTube.

2538
03:50:27,516 --> 03:50:28,077
[SPEAKER_33]: I watched it.

2539
03:50:29,841 --> 03:50:32,242
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, I tried to follow it the best I could.

2540
03:50:32,882 --> 03:50:39,244
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just have concerns about adding three additional no school days to the calendar.

2541
03:50:40,184 --> 03:50:50,448
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, last week we had, you know, the high heat temperature days and I was getting messages from parents saying that I'm not sending my child to school.

2542
03:50:50,588 --> 03:50:52,129
[SPEAKER_33]: It's too hot to be in the schools.

2543
03:50:52,869 --> 03:50:55,790
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, this is going to be, you know,

2544
03:50:56,750 --> 03:51:16,737
[SPEAKER_33]: happening if we're going to having the kids go to school to June 28 June 30th it they're going to be going in the hot hot temperatures adding three more no school days onto the calendar and with all the snow days I mean we don't know in New England it's unpredictable with what the snow days are going to be.

2545
03:51:16,917 --> 03:51:23,520
[SPEAKER_33]: I do recall one year that my son went to school until June 29th because there were so many snow days and

2546
03:51:24,180 --> 03:51:26,281
[SPEAKER_33]: It was really difficult for the students.

2547
03:51:26,522 --> 03:51:29,203
[SPEAKER_33]: And in fact, the students were done.

2548
03:51:29,223 --> 03:51:36,167
[SPEAKER_33]: They didn't wanna go and some families just went off on their vacations and didn't finish the school year.

2549
03:51:37,428 --> 03:51:49,515
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would like to have an opportunity to see what other school districts in the greater Boston area are doing or in our neighboring area to know what the implication is of adding the three additional no school days to the calendar.

2550
03:51:50,115 --> 03:51:51,636
[SPEAKER_33]: So I would like that information

2551
03:51:52,157 --> 03:51:55,837
[SPEAKER_33]: before I was going to make a vote on adding those calendar days.

2552
03:51:57,147 --> 03:51:59,609
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's what, you know, that's what I have for that.

2553
03:52:00,169 --> 03:52:07,513
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know if you want me to go on with the public comment and then I have for the agenda, I have some questions or thoughts for the agenda.

2554
03:52:07,533 --> 03:52:09,334
[SPEAKER_33]: Do you have an answer to that question?

2555
03:52:09,354 --> 03:52:09,714
[SPEAKER_33]: I do actually.

2556
03:52:09,754 --> 03:52:14,096
[SPEAKER_35]: I came up in a subcommittee meeting and we actually talked about the city of Cambridge.

2557
03:52:14,236 --> 03:52:17,097
[SPEAKER_35]: So Cambridge does not start school earlier than we do.

2558
03:52:18,158 --> 03:52:25,282
[SPEAKER_35]: I believe that they don't observe the Lunar New Year as a no school day, but the other two are observed.

2559
03:52:26,282 --> 03:52:27,784
[SPEAKER_35]: days off from school.

2560
03:52:28,484 --> 03:52:33,128
[SPEAKER_35]: And on the whole, they don't really appear to get out any later than we do.

2561
03:52:34,269 --> 03:52:43,657
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think really, if you look at like next year, I think none of these three days actually fall on a Monday to Friday in a calendar year.

2562
03:52:43,677 --> 03:52:47,240
[SPEAKER_35]: And they're not like observances, like we observe

2563
03:52:48,580 --> 03:52:54,847
[SPEAKER_35]: Like we observe Christmas on a day that's not a weekend if Christmas falls on a Saturday, right?

2564
03:52:54,967 --> 03:52:57,569
[SPEAKER_35]: So that is not what the proposal is.

2565
03:52:57,609 --> 03:53:00,292
[SPEAKER_35]: The proposal is to observe these religious holidays,

2566
03:53:00,759 --> 03:53:05,942
[SPEAKER_35]: that are really meaningful to a portion of our community on the days in which they observe them.

2567
03:53:06,163 --> 03:53:11,006
[SPEAKER_35]: If they happen to fall Monday to Friday during our 180 day school year.

2568
03:53:11,306 --> 03:53:19,311
[SPEAKER_35]: I believe next year, one of them is on a Saturday, one of them is in July and one of them is on April vacation or something like that.

2569
03:53:19,391 --> 03:53:26,156
[SPEAKER_35]: So, and as member Russo said, there's not a year for about five years before there's really

2570
03:53:27,456 --> 03:53:30,458
[SPEAKER_35]: any significant sort of shifting of the calendar.

2571
03:53:30,698 --> 03:53:38,302
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think, you know, when I thought about this, I want my kids out of school as soon as possible this year.

2572
03:53:38,402 --> 03:53:49,427
[SPEAKER_35]: And usually I'm sort of there every year myself, but I also tried to think about like, what would happen if somebody tried to take away Christmas from my kids?

2573
03:53:49,867 --> 03:53:51,308
[SPEAKER_35]: And that is how we,

2574
03:53:52,748 --> 03:53:55,811
[SPEAKER_35]: observe or don't observe holidays for another portion of our communities.

2575
03:53:55,891 --> 03:53:57,192
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that's important to note.

2576
03:53:58,813 --> 03:54:10,062
[SPEAKER_35]: I also think you know when we talk about how hot the schools are we have to deal with that problem because that problem exists it's real and it's not going away in 2 days.

2577
03:54:11,465 --> 03:54:13,927
[SPEAKER_35]: give or take is really not going to change very much.

2578
03:54:15,267 --> 03:54:26,254
[SPEAKER_35]: As I thought about how do we compromise about this, I thought it would be wildly unpalatable for the community to talk about taking away holidays that already are on the calendar.

2579
03:54:27,955 --> 03:54:37,200
[SPEAKER_35]: Instead of that, I thought it might make sense to try this, not next year, but starting the following year to respect the community's

2580
03:54:37,930 --> 03:54:45,011
[SPEAKER_35]: in our population that really go without right now when it comes to observance of their holidays.

2581
03:54:45,211 --> 03:54:47,632
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think like anything, we can try it.

2582
03:54:49,052 --> 03:54:53,293
[SPEAKER_35]: We can figure out what works about it and what doesn't, and we can revisit it.

2583
03:54:53,353 --> 03:54:57,313
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not set in stone, but there are other communities doing it.

2584
03:54:58,194 --> 03:54:59,054
[SPEAKER_35]: We are not alone.

2585
03:55:01,374 --> 03:55:05,655
[SPEAKER_35]: And I would be happy to be on the leading edge of this.

2586
03:55:06,385 --> 03:55:14,732
[SPEAKER_47]: And member Cressy you could always add that they be reviewed in 3 to 4 years before that 5th year where maybe an issue that makes you more comfortable.

2587
03:55:15,913 --> 03:55:17,374
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll think about that, thank you.

2588
03:55:17,794 --> 03:55:25,398
[SPEAKER_33]: And then in regards to the public comment, so- Mayor, excuse me, could we just discuss one policy at a time?

2589
03:55:26,118 --> 03:55:26,518
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, okay.

2590
03:55:26,858 --> 03:55:27,298
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

2591
03:55:27,318 --> 03:55:28,579
[SPEAKER_47]: So do you wanna approve the minutes?

2592
03:55:28,599 --> 03:55:30,580
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve the minutes?

2593
03:55:31,300 --> 03:55:33,041
[SPEAKER_47]: And then we'll- Motion to approve the minutes.

2594
03:55:33,321 --> 03:55:33,521
[SPEAKER_35]: Second.

2595
03:55:33,541 --> 03:55:36,883
[SPEAKER_47]: By member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call.

2596
03:55:37,763 --> 03:55:38,344
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham?

2597
03:55:39,064 --> 03:55:39,284
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2598
03:55:39,884 --> 03:55:40,465
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Kratz?

2599
03:55:41,945 --> 03:55:42,146
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2600
03:55:43,086 --> 03:55:44,086
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

2601
03:55:44,146 --> 03:55:44,847
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McStone?

2602
03:55:45,854 --> 03:55:46,816
[SPEAKER_46]: And we're so yes.

2603
03:55:46,836 --> 03:55:49,860
[SPEAKER_46]: And we're going to come along the car.

2604
03:55:50,601 --> 03:55:56,750
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes 70 from 0 negative minutes are approved and now on number one policy for the school year calendar.

2605
03:55:57,531 --> 03:56:01,297
[SPEAKER_47]: That's if you're finished on that topic but remember and include.

2606
03:56:26,617 --> 03:56:35,062
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, who are working and then all of a sudden now there's another I mean, you know, so part of me is saying, it seems like would also be incumbent on us.

2607
03:56:35,843 --> 03:56:45,690
[SPEAKER_44]: And we might have to speak to Megan fiddler carry about this to also be able to provide some sort of daycare options on those unusual holidays.

2608
03:56:45,750 --> 03:56:47,251
[SPEAKER_44]: We're not a majority of the kids.

2609
03:56:47,847 --> 03:56:56,110
[SPEAKER_44]: you know, like let's Christmas, people are going to be off, but all of a sudden I'm concerned about these, especially when they're floating holidays.

2610
03:56:56,890 --> 03:57:02,372
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, so I, I think that has to be now foremost on our mind if we adopt this.

2611
03:57:03,532 --> 03:57:07,074
[SPEAKER_44]: Um, so anyway, just my thoughts.

2612
03:57:08,754 --> 03:57:08,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

2613
03:57:10,275 --> 03:57:10,835
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Roussel.

2614
03:57:11,055 --> 03:57:11,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2615
03:57:11,475 --> 03:57:15,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So we already have adopted two floating holidays, um, in December.

2616
03:57:15,577 --> 03:57:15,817
[SPEAKER_61]: Okay.

2617
03:57:16,017 --> 03:57:16,077
[SPEAKER_61]: Um,

2618
03:57:17,299 --> 03:57:33,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly agree that when we communicate out our schedule, which will now be happening in November, so this is actually for the 2022-2023 year, because we've already released the upcoming calendar year.

2619
03:57:33,802 --> 03:57:44,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But because we are now going to be announcing our following year calendar far earlier than ever, we also wanna make sure to incorporate

2620
03:57:45,566 --> 03:57:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: a more robust messaging about the fact that, you know, you've always, you know, even if you're not Christian, you've always known in this country, at least January 25th, whether you like it or not, you know it.

2621
03:57:58,905 --> 03:58:00,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, from childhood, you know it.

2622
03:58:00,505 --> 03:58:01,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean December 25th?

2623
03:58:01,705 --> 03:58:02,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what, what did I say?

2624
03:58:02,666 --> 03:58:03,126
[SPEAKER_05]: January 25th.

2625
03:58:03,186 --> 03:58:04,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, December 25th.

2626
03:58:04,446 --> 03:58:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that, okay.

2627
03:58:06,646 --> 03:58:17,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But my point is just like, we will have to make sure to message that a little more strongly that, you know, in the years where these end up landing on a day that, you know, you're like in the middle of March, and there's no holidays in March, right?

2628
03:58:17,868 --> 03:58:19,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And then suddenly there is one year.

2629
03:58:21,089 --> 03:58:28,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents are gonna wanna have that information, but I think that's easy to solve.

2630
03:58:28,863 --> 03:58:37,950
[SPEAKER_44]: Mayor, but you see, one of the other things I have a concern about is if we're and you know, I absolutely understand why we should.

2631
03:58:38,791 --> 03:58:46,677
[SPEAKER_44]: But if we're elongating the school year, then all of a sudden we're elongating because we're also going to observe Juneteenth.

2632
03:58:47,698 --> 03:58:49,820
[SPEAKER_44]: And so there's the potential then that

2633
03:58:50,916 --> 03:58:57,337
[SPEAKER_44]: you know, because we've elongated now, like this year, it doesn't matter because school is over before Juneteenth.

2634
03:58:57,477 --> 03:59:08,940
[SPEAKER_44]: So, you know, it's just, I can't help but be concerned because I know in the years when all of a sudden, and Kathy mentioned school finished, you know, the 28th or 29th, it's awful.

2635
03:59:09,780 --> 03:59:12,681
[SPEAKER_44]: And so that's my biggest concern with this.

2636
03:59:14,061 --> 03:59:17,862
[SPEAKER_44]: Again, I didn't look, you say that you've worked it out for,

2637
03:59:21,297 --> 03:59:21,837
[SPEAKER_44]: 21, 22, 22, 23, which?

2638
03:59:21,857 --> 03:59:21,837
22, 23.

2639
03:59:22,037 --> 03:59:26,281
[SPEAKER_44]: This won't start until 22, 23.

2640
03:59:26,661 --> 03:59:28,522
[SPEAKER_44]: And it worked out that year okay?

2641
03:59:29,043 --> 03:59:30,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually for the next five years.

2642
03:59:31,545 --> 03:59:32,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2643
03:59:32,746 --> 03:59:33,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Roussell.

2644
03:59:33,806 --> 03:59:42,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to make sure the committee sees on the second page, just before section three observance list, there is a new paragraph we added.

2645
03:59:42,873 --> 03:59:44,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't sit down and like

2646
03:59:45,342 --> 03:59:51,046
[SPEAKER_05]: it's actually a little bit of work to look up every single holiday and the number of years out.

2647
03:59:53,467 --> 03:59:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Susie knows this.

2648
03:59:56,069 --> 04:00:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did add a paragraph here so that in the unlikely event, not impossible though, in the unlikely event that when the calendar is being created, the superintendent is like, oh God, that means we have to go to July 1, which we can't legally even do.

2649
04:00:14,382 --> 04:00:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: that the policy says she'll come to us, and we will make a decision, frankly, as to which holiday to cut, which will be a very unfun conversation, but we have a legally required number of school days, and that's that.

2650
04:00:28,810 --> 04:00:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not really a conversation I wanna have, but it's many years into the future, and I think that if we were to ask any of the community impacted by the addition of these holidays,

2651
04:00:42,802 --> 04:00:51,710
[SPEAKER_05]: If once every 20 years, you had to give up one of your holidays to get your holidays, the other 19 years, I find it hard to believe they would be like, nevermind.

2652
04:00:52,351 --> 04:00:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want them for the other 19 years.

2653
04:00:54,152 --> 04:00:56,034
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make sense as a conversation.

2654
04:00:56,654 --> 04:00:58,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to point that out.

2655
04:00:58,632 --> 04:01:16,481
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think there were members of the Muslim community in particular who expressed that during the meeting that, you know, the folks who came to the meeting were so appreciative of our consideration that, you know, they acknowledged like this does at some point, right?

2656
04:01:16,501 --> 04:01:20,323
[SPEAKER_35]: At some point we will break the calendar and we will have to figure out what we do with that.

2657
04:01:20,403 --> 04:01:27,146
[SPEAKER_35]: And they, you know, they just were so willing to have that conversation and be part of the dialogue.

2658
04:01:29,278 --> 04:01:37,561
[SPEAKER_35]: you know, frankly, and in a way that's much more gracious than really we deserve because we've not observed their holidays for so many years.

2659
04:01:37,641 --> 04:01:39,461
[SPEAKER_35]: So it was nice to hear that.

2660
04:01:39,741 --> 04:01:50,545
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, and I think when the time comes for that to discussion to happen, um, we'll want to have it with the right stakeholders in the room, um, and come up with the right answer.

2661
04:01:51,905 --> 04:01:52,185
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

2662
04:01:52,225 --> 04:01:52,545
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2663
04:01:56,026 --> 04:01:58,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just want to, um, when we,

2664
04:01:58,760 --> 04:02:04,762
[SPEAKER_05]: as members, if we approve this, go out into the community, some of us may get emails like more.

2665
04:02:05,442 --> 04:02:08,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I got them when we added the two in December, actually.

2666
04:02:09,023 --> 04:02:15,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also like, I wanna pack the camper the day after school gets out and frankly get out of here.

2667
04:02:16,206 --> 04:02:21,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm totally in line with the earlier release is a better thing.

2668
04:02:22,408 --> 04:02:23,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that,

2669
04:02:24,813 --> 04:02:39,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's helpful to have the, I had this conversation actually over the summer at rights pawn and a chair six feet away from another member of our community about how Christian centered everything is that we don't know it, it's like it's the air, we don't know it.

2670
04:02:39,801 --> 04:02:42,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we don't have winter break, we have Christmas.

2671
04:02:43,786 --> 04:02:49,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anybody wants to argue with me, I suggest you look at the teacher's contract, which explicitly calls it the Christmas break.

2672
04:02:50,288 --> 04:02:55,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take all kinds of days off all year long for Christian holidays, whether you are Christian or not.

2673
04:02:56,690 --> 04:02:59,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying we change any of that.

2674
04:02:59,471 --> 04:03:12,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that adding one day for our Chinese community, where Lunar New Year is a huge deal, when we have 10 days for Christmas and

2675
04:03:12,864 --> 04:03:13,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Good Friday.

2676
04:03:13,884 --> 04:03:19,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have like so many other days for other members of our community and value that, and I think we should.

2677
04:03:20,806 --> 04:03:31,069
[SPEAKER_05]: That it's important to kind of, you know, put it side by side with reality and say, look, we're not giving Ramadan off.

2678
04:03:31,889 --> 04:03:33,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ramadan's a lot of days.

2679
04:03:33,550 --> 04:03:35,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not asking for Ramadan off.

2680
04:03:35,728 --> 04:03:55,041
[SPEAKER_05]: but if this was a majority Muslim community, actually that's too many days, I don't think anybody would do that, but that's just my point is you can take that information to that conversation and I think it's really helpful to kind of like be open about what do we really already do for the Christian holidays?

2681
04:03:55,182 --> 04:03:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just my suggestion.

2682
04:03:57,463 --> 04:03:58,384
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2683
04:03:59,665 --> 04:04:00,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

2684
04:04:00,305 --> 04:04:01,386
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

2685
04:04:01,426 --> 04:04:02,767
[SPEAKER_47]: So seconded by Member Graham.

2686
04:04:05,427 --> 04:04:07,908
[SPEAKER_47]: Anybody want this looked at in a few years, or?

2687
04:04:08,569 --> 04:04:10,570
[SPEAKER_47]: We set it to one year, Mayor.

2688
04:04:10,670 --> 04:04:12,571
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, we reviewed every one year, perfect.

2689
04:04:12,651 --> 04:04:15,893
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, motion by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

2690
04:04:15,953 --> 04:04:16,473
[SPEAKER_47]: Roll call.

2691
04:04:18,455 --> 04:04:19,015
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

2692
04:04:19,195 --> 04:04:19,435
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2693
04:04:20,616 --> 04:04:21,196
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kretz.

2694
04:04:21,616 --> 04:04:22,137
[SPEAKER_46]: Abstain.

2695
04:04:24,678 --> 04:04:25,939
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

2696
04:04:26,759 --> 04:04:27,560
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McStone.

2697
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:27,900
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2698
04:04:28,700 --> 04:04:29,421
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Rousseau.

2699
04:04:29,621 --> 04:04:29,821
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2700
04:04:30,461 --> 04:04:31,322
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloet.

2701
04:04:31,462 --> 04:04:31,662
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

2702
04:04:32,443 --> 04:04:33,123
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Longo Kern.

2703
04:04:33,533 --> 04:04:37,715
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one who abstained.

2704
04:04:38,576 --> 04:04:39,456
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion is approved.

2705
04:04:39,576 --> 04:04:43,018
[SPEAKER_47]: Number two policy, BEDH public participation update.

2706
04:04:43,598 --> 04:04:44,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

2707
04:04:44,999 --> 04:04:48,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So really quickly peruse this.

2708
04:04:49,941 --> 04:04:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the policy that will, I mean, our current policy is like two or three sentences.

2709
04:04:56,104 --> 04:05:01,447
[SPEAKER_05]: This breaks, we're going to all have to kind of help each other to change our language a little bit here.

2710
04:05:01,991 --> 04:05:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We have in our current policy and in our agendas, we call it public participation or community, we like kind of just roam around what we call it.

2711
04:05:12,138 --> 04:05:16,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And that caused a lot of confusion and frankly, very upset people last week.

2712
04:05:17,622 --> 04:05:20,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fair that they were upset because our language was not clear.

2713
04:05:21,004 --> 04:05:28,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So this new policy, if it's approved, we have public comment, public comment is on items on the agenda, that's it.

2714
04:05:29,397 --> 04:05:32,519
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to call it community participation or public input.

2715
04:05:32,880 --> 04:05:41,366
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to kind of hold each other to this to rename it public comment because the words get mixed up and nobody knows which one we're talking about.

2716
04:05:42,087 --> 04:05:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: None of this conceptually is new, though.

2717
04:05:44,629 --> 04:05:49,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So public comment is that thing where we just did public comment.

2718
04:05:50,711 --> 04:05:59,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We have changed the community presentation or public presentations, I forget what the old name was, if we adopt this, to submitting a presentation.

2719
04:06:00,058 --> 04:06:06,122
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually just got rid of a bunch of the words and chose a new one, submitting a presentation.

2720
04:06:06,162 --> 04:06:08,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the dyslexia presentation we had.

2721
04:06:08,363 --> 04:06:10,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, could I?

2722
04:06:10,425 --> 04:06:12,906
[SPEAKER_05]: No, sorry, presentations of the public.

2723
04:06:13,127 --> 04:06:15,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgive me, I've already screwed up.

2724
04:06:16,342 --> 04:06:19,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have public comment and we have presentations of the public.

2725
04:06:19,503 --> 04:06:28,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So that dyslexia, I constantly reference it because it's the last one we had where somebody submits a presentation and then they're on the agenda.

2726
04:06:28,527 --> 04:06:30,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are called presentations of the public.

2727
04:06:33,829 --> 04:06:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, the other big change, I'm just gonna quickly go to the public comment.

2728
04:06:43,427 --> 04:06:50,130
[SPEAKER_05]: everything there is actually the same, I believe, from our current thing, current policy or statement.

2729
04:06:52,651 --> 04:07:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: We did add under section two, it's on page one, it says when writing or emailing, please provide this information, this required information

2730
04:07:02,364 --> 04:07:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: We did ask them to actually say the number and name of the item on the agenda in their communication.

2731
04:07:07,989 --> 04:07:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That should help member van der Klooter, whoever's job it is at that point in time, to know when you've got 30 emails, which ones go with which items on the agenda.

2732
04:07:20,399 --> 04:07:22,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other change is that

2733
04:07:23,220 --> 04:07:34,910
[SPEAKER_05]: When a member of the public submits a presentation for consideration at our meeting, this hasn't happened that I'm aware of, but I'm a software developer, so I'm always thinking about the what ifs.

2734
04:07:35,610 --> 04:07:44,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really became evident to me that the current policy provided no opportunity if the superintendent said, no, you can't present that to the school committee.

2735
04:07:45,499 --> 04:07:55,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are very, very valid legal reasons why some presentations would absolutely not be allowed here if somebody wanted to give a presentation on the performance of a principal.

2736
04:07:57,303 --> 04:08:00,805
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't want to write a big check to a loss for a lawsuit.

2737
04:08:01,265 --> 04:08:07,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So the superintendent needs to have the ability to say no, you cannot give that presentation.

2738
04:08:09,813 --> 04:08:15,417
[SPEAKER_05]: then I also added this whole thing where if they disagree with the superintendent, how can they appeal that determination?

2739
04:08:17,319 --> 04:08:36,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of language, but it's really just lays out the steps that I think are rational and both give the superintendent the ability to protect the district as well as us to frankly override the superintendent if we determine that we just don't agree with the determination that it's not appropriate.

2740
04:08:38,595 --> 04:08:39,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, an example,

2741
04:08:39,926 --> 04:08:46,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the legal one I just gave, it'd be hard to imagine us overriding the superintendent and say, yes, let's invite a lawsuit.

2742
04:08:46,689 --> 04:08:47,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make a lot of sense.

2743
04:08:48,390 --> 04:08:59,596
[SPEAKER_05]: But another example might be if somebody submits a presentation about city street potholes, the superintendent will reject it saying, this is not within the authority of the school committee, that doesn't make any sense.

2744
04:09:01,837 --> 04:09:07,880
[SPEAKER_05]: If for some reason the majority of us actually wanna hear this presentation, then this will allow that to happen.

2745
04:09:08,680 --> 04:09:09,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we won't.

2746
04:09:10,618 --> 04:09:14,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a substantial change to our current policy.

2747
04:09:15,321 --> 04:09:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of it is actually, I think, how things would happen.

2748
04:09:19,224 --> 04:09:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just laid out in English.

2749
04:09:22,726 --> 04:09:24,047
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I have to say on that.

2750
04:09:43,107 --> 04:09:53,271
[SPEAKER_44]: we used to call community participation and say, I just want to bring to your notice that there's a movie night at the Columbus and we'd like you to come.

2751
04:09:54,872 --> 04:09:59,974
[SPEAKER_47]: That's my question as well, because if I may, through the chair, we have community participation.

2752
04:09:59,994 --> 04:10:02,675
[SPEAKER_47]: We've always let them talk about anything during.

2753
04:10:02,695 --> 04:10:03,296
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true.

2754
04:10:03,316 --> 04:10:07,437
[SPEAKER_47]: We always let anybody talk about.

2755
04:10:07,457 --> 04:10:09,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So we literally never allow that.

2756
04:10:09,960 --> 04:10:10,360
[SPEAKER_47]: But we do.

2757
04:10:10,380 --> 04:10:10,820
[SPEAKER_47]: But we do.

2758
04:10:10,840 --> 04:10:14,902
[SPEAKER_47]: All the emails, they're not all relevant to what's on the agenda.

2759
04:10:14,962 --> 04:10:16,102
[SPEAKER_47]: Most are, but not all.

2760
04:10:17,023 --> 04:10:19,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But it says it right on the agenda what exactly we mean.

2761
04:10:19,924 --> 04:10:21,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It must be an item on the agenda.

2762
04:10:22,525 --> 04:10:30,067
[SPEAKER_44]: But that's, you know, I think that's actually newer because we used to do community participation and someone could get up.

2763
04:10:30,187 --> 04:10:37,070
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, they were always supposed to, the old rule was you were always supposed to inform the,

2764
04:10:38,876 --> 04:10:40,918
[SPEAKER_44]: superintendent's office on the Wednesday before.

2765
04:10:41,419 --> 04:10:45,623
[SPEAKER_44]: But frankly, that often is difficult for people who just want to get up and say, hey,

2766
04:10:48,186 --> 04:11:08,236
[SPEAKER_44]: know so so here um every any presentation that someone wants to do will go through the superintendent's office right is what you're saying for which is a current policy we don't follow people can speak on a community item but they can't get up in community participation and just say anything um

2767
04:11:10,492 --> 04:11:17,774
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, sometimes what we always used to just sort of, but the person would say to a committee member, um, uh, I want to speak on this.

2768
04:11:18,555 --> 04:11:24,677
[SPEAKER_44]: And usually, um, then we would ask the chair, whether we could, whether it was permissible mayor.

2769
04:11:25,037 --> 04:11:25,737
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah.

2770
04:11:25,757 --> 04:11:26,817
[SPEAKER_44]: So you don't want to do that at all.

2771
04:11:27,218 --> 04:11:29,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, if it's an item on the agenda, then that's fine.

2772
04:11:29,318 --> 04:11:33,720
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not an item on the agenda for which we have authority, then it's an open meeting law violations.

2773
04:11:33,960 --> 04:11:36,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's the key part of this.

2774
04:11:37,001 --> 04:11:37,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

2775
04:11:37,705 --> 04:11:46,727
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, tonight we heard from several members of the community who commented that they came and spoke and we just sat here in silence, which is the law.

2776
04:11:50,368 --> 04:11:51,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, that's lovely.

2777
04:11:53,229 --> 04:11:55,089
[SPEAKER_05]: The air conditioning went out and it's so quiet.

2778
04:11:56,530 --> 04:12:01,071
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot just engage in things that are within our authority that are not on the agenda.

2779
04:12:01,171 --> 04:12:05,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a violation of, I'll write an open meeting law violation against us if I have to.

2780
04:12:06,055 --> 04:12:10,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we cannot just go off the rails and talk about whatever we want.

2781
04:12:11,497 --> 04:12:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, do I think that, you know, when there's a real emergency, we have the ability to call an emergency meeting.

2782
04:12:19,780 --> 04:12:26,183
[SPEAKER_44]: But I guess what I'm trying to do, Paul, is I appreciate what you're trying to say is it's the law.

2783
04:12:26,636 --> 04:12:42,271
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm also trying to, and part of this is conjecture, trying to say, hey, how are we being realistic because somebody like the PAC would like to come forward and say, hey, we've got a PAC meeting on next Wednesday and we'd really like you to attend.

2784
04:12:42,291 --> 04:12:47,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's just...

2785
04:12:48,735 --> 04:12:49,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a statement.

2786
04:12:49,195 --> 04:12:52,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the superintendent could probably put that in her section there.

2787
04:12:52,578 --> 04:12:53,699
[SPEAKER_44]: In her report, okay.

2788
04:12:53,719 --> 04:12:55,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or I'm sorry.

2789
04:12:55,861 --> 04:13:00,424
[SPEAKER_44]: I may be trying to, it's late and I may be trying to come up with too many.

2790
04:13:00,724 --> 04:13:16,417
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get to the next agenda, sorry, if I may, the next agenda item, we actually have this next meetings on the agenda, but you're right, if it's like, it's not written down yet because of that, but I think the superintendent or the mayor can make a statement like that and nobody cares.

2791
04:13:17,418 --> 04:13:18,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not voting on it.

2792
04:13:18,399 --> 04:13:20,540
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no deliberation.

2793
04:13:21,461 --> 04:13:24,663
[SPEAKER_47]: So this is to have a presentation section.

2794
04:13:24,723 --> 04:13:28,406
[SPEAKER_47]: If there is one that the superintendent approves, it would just be named presentations.

2795
04:13:28,546 --> 04:13:35,791
[SPEAKER_47]: And then to add the language under making edits on the committee meeting.

2796
04:13:36,711 --> 04:13:38,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be clear on what we're voting for.

2797
04:13:39,193 --> 04:13:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Which page are you on?

2798
04:13:42,275 --> 04:13:42,915
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm on the minutes.

2799
04:13:42,955 --> 04:13:43,616
[SPEAKER_47]: They're not numbered.

2800
04:13:43,636 --> 04:13:46,618
[SPEAKER_47]: One, two, three.

2801
04:13:47,995 --> 04:14:01,181
[SPEAKER_47]: four, it's motion approved, but there's no motion on this, on these minutes, so I'm assuming it's to include a welcoming community as both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

2802
04:14:01,921 --> 04:14:08,284
[SPEAKER_47]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective, and then it's motion to approve, seconded.

2803
04:14:09,144 --> 04:14:10,785
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the minutes, we already approved those.

2804
04:14:11,865 --> 04:14:14,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on to item 6.1.2, which is the actual policy.

2805
04:14:17,639 --> 04:14:21,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's so many pages in this packet, I'm sorry.

2806
04:14:21,401 --> 04:14:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the policy that we're hopefully going to approve.

2807
04:14:37,789 --> 04:14:39,090
[SPEAKER_44]: May I ask a question?

2808
04:14:39,510 --> 04:14:44,473
[SPEAKER_44]: Did you, when passed our attorney, the section on appealing and authority determination,

2809
04:14:49,757 --> 04:14:50,978
[SPEAKER_05]: in what way?

2810
04:14:55,600 --> 04:15:00,862
[SPEAKER_44]: The superintendent may seek advice from the district council about whether to proceed with the following appeals process.

2811
04:15:01,542 --> 04:15:05,224
[SPEAKER_44]: Should the council determine that a presentation cannot proceed, the presenter will be informed.

2812
04:15:06,705 --> 04:15:10,546
[SPEAKER_44]: The appeal will be placed in the next scheduled regular meeting of the school committee under the president.

2813
04:15:10,607 --> 04:15:15,809
[SPEAKER_44]: So I just want to know, usually I would have run something like that by Howard.

2814
04:15:16,488 --> 04:15:19,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we could certainly, if we approve it, we could send it to Howard for comment.

2815
04:15:19,754 --> 04:15:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a good idea.

2816
04:15:20,776 --> 04:15:20,816
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

2817
04:15:23,321 --> 04:15:25,405
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'd like to amend the motion.

2818
04:15:25,485 --> 04:15:26,848
[SPEAKER_44]: Is there a motion for approval on this?

2819
04:15:28,172 --> 04:15:29,473
[SPEAKER_05]: motion to approve.

2820
04:15:29,553 --> 04:15:30,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.

2821
04:15:30,994 --> 04:15:32,636
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes I have my light on.

2822
04:15:33,236 --> 04:15:54,554
[SPEAKER_33]: Yep so I am you know I was just I guess I'm just having trouble like I feel like the public comment part and the agenda kind of go together and you know I'm just and I I tried watching the meeting I'm just I'm just a little bit confused because if I look at our current agenda we have

2823
04:15:56,855 --> 04:16:11,602
[SPEAKER_33]: On our current agenda, currently what we have in this part of the policy, we have community participation, where it does say any citizen may be given permission to speak at the school committee meetings on any agenda item up to three minutes.

2824
04:16:12,162 --> 04:16:15,383
[SPEAKER_33]: That's always been on our agenda.

2825
04:16:15,684 --> 04:16:18,445
[SPEAKER_33]: Then we have the public participation emails.

2826
04:16:19,405 --> 04:16:25,128
[SPEAKER_33]: So is this new policy public comment

2827
04:16:26,008 --> 04:16:30,789
[SPEAKER_33]: is that replacing community participation?

2828
04:16:31,169 --> 04:16:32,890
[SPEAKER_33]: You just changed the name of the word.

2829
04:16:32,930 --> 04:16:39,791
[SPEAKER_33]: Instead of saying community participation, it's now gonna be called public comment, but it's the same thing.

2830
04:16:41,472 --> 04:16:43,972
[SPEAKER_33]: That's where I'm just unsure about that.

2831
04:16:44,412 --> 04:16:44,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

2832
04:16:45,213 --> 04:16:45,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2833
04:16:46,253 --> 04:16:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So our current language, first of all, the language on our agenda is not actually our policy.

2834
04:16:51,718 --> 04:16:55,159
[SPEAKER_05]: In the policy website, you go and look, that's not our policy.

2835
04:16:56,059 --> 04:17:00,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a couple of sentences that are not that helpful.

2836
04:17:00,940 --> 04:17:06,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But you actually just said the most important thing about why I think this is important.

2837
04:17:06,822 --> 04:17:14,724
[SPEAKER_05]: When somebody says, how do you do community participation, do you answer them that they can submit a presentation to the superintendent?

2838
04:17:15,211 --> 04:17:18,513
[SPEAKER_05]: or do you answer them, well, they can speak for three minutes on any item.

2839
04:17:18,573 --> 04:17:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are such different things, but we call them the same thing, and they are not the same.

2840
04:17:23,735 --> 04:17:42,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, writing a presentation, sending it to the superintendent by Wednesday is nothing like just coming and speaking about an item on an agenda, but we call them the same thing right now, and the result of that is people ask, how do I participate in the meeting on an item, and, you know,

2841
04:17:42,452 --> 04:17:44,973
[SPEAKER_05]: do we, which paragraph do we read to them?

2842
04:17:45,073 --> 04:17:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one do they think is for them?

2843
04:17:47,573 --> 04:17:48,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happened last Monday.

2844
04:17:49,154 --> 04:18:02,477
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor read both sections, and I think what happened, I mean, I can't be in the mind of the people that were in the audience, is the first sentence was about speaking on the items on the agenda.

2845
04:18:03,557 --> 04:18:06,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she kept reading, because that's what's on our agenda.

2846
04:18:06,598 --> 04:18:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And that second thing is not about that at all.

2847
04:18:09,118 --> 04:18:11,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about doing something for the following meeting.

2848
04:18:12,332 --> 04:18:15,755
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, submitting something for our agenda.

2849
04:18:15,775 --> 04:18:19,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, it just means two different things.

2850
04:18:19,859 --> 04:18:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And all we tried to do here was saying public comment is that first sentence on our current agenda.

2851
04:18:25,465 --> 04:18:28,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just relabeling that and calling it public comment.

2852
04:18:28,688 --> 04:18:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that second thing which we call community participation also is actually being renamed

2853
04:18:35,165 --> 04:18:40,207
[SPEAKER_05]: completely differently to presentations of the public, which is actually a fairly good name, I think.

2854
04:18:40,667 --> 04:18:43,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who thought of it, somebody in the meeting.

2855
04:18:44,149 --> 04:18:46,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are presentations of the public.

2856
04:18:47,750 --> 04:18:50,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So that there's just not that confusion.

2857
04:18:53,252 --> 04:18:53,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

2858
04:18:53,552 --> 04:18:54,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Did that answer your question?

2859
04:18:55,893 --> 04:18:58,034
[SPEAKER_33]: It does, like it sounds like you're separating it out.

2860
04:18:58,334 --> 04:19:02,376
[SPEAKER_33]: And so I guess I just want some clarification.

2861
04:19:02,416 --> 04:19:04,857
[SPEAKER_33]: So can a resident,

2862
04:19:05,711 --> 04:19:14,393
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, come, you know, before the podium at any point and just speak about something that's not on the agenda or... That's against the law, no.

2863
04:19:14,693 --> 04:19:14,893
[SPEAKER_33]: No.

2864
04:19:15,273 --> 04:19:24,715
[SPEAKER_33]: So that... Because that... It doesn't... In the new policy, it doesn't state any item... Okay, it does state any item on the agenda.

2865
04:19:24,795 --> 04:19:32,977
[SPEAKER_33]: All right, the only other concern I had was... And I heard this before, a couple of meetings back, was that

2866
04:19:33,675 --> 04:19:37,337
[SPEAKER_33]: We asked for the full Medford Street address.

2867
04:19:37,757 --> 04:19:57,768
[SPEAKER_33]: And so the concern is that what if a community member is displaced for whatever reason, whether they're homeless or in foster care, and they don't have a Medford resident address, you know, we specifically, you know, states that it must be a Medford Street address.

2868
04:19:58,488 --> 04:20:01,089
[SPEAKER_33]: So that was something that was brought to my attention.

2869
04:20:02,591 --> 04:20:10,877
[SPEAKER_33]: you know, a while back and I know you were working on these policies.

2870
04:20:10,977 --> 04:20:12,558
[SPEAKER_47]: Member McLaughlin, actually.

2871
04:20:12,578 --> 04:20:13,058
[SPEAKER_47]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2872
04:20:14,439 --> 04:20:15,000
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Mayor.

2873
04:20:15,982 --> 04:20:23,124
[SPEAKER_46]: Yeah, I was just going to try to clarify, because I was having some questions similar to Democrats during the meeting.

2874
04:20:23,184 --> 04:20:33,846
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think we really just wanted to differentiate having been on the other side of the podium and having done presentations and also having participated in the three-minute sort of thing.

2875
04:20:33,886 --> 04:20:43,228
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think people don't realize for the presentation, you submit that a week ahead to the superintendent so that everyone gets them in their packet, what have you.

2876
04:20:44,028 --> 04:20:46,790
[SPEAKER_46]: three minute you can come up on the agenda.

2877
04:20:46,870 --> 04:21:05,080
[SPEAKER_46]: And as Member Rousseau was saying, you may recall last week at the end of the meeting when the gentleman was upset because he felt like he didn't have the opportunity to speak, we just felt like it wasn't really clear to that person when the opportunity was available for them to speak.

2878
04:21:05,160 --> 04:21:11,364
[SPEAKER_46]: So this is really, again, delineating public comment versus public presentation.

2879
04:21:21,269 --> 04:21:21,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2880
04:21:22,370 --> 04:21:32,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the issue of the full street address, I think it's a really good one and definitely ties in with the equity part of the subcommittee that I chair.

2881
04:21:35,077 --> 04:21:40,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would, the most important part of this change actually was not your full street address.

2882
04:21:40,961 --> 04:21:54,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that where you reside, because I think it's just really important that we understand that the people we are receiving feedback from are actually members of our community and not just folks that used to live here or whose grandparents live here.

2883
04:21:54,850 --> 04:21:58,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we are responsible to the community.

2884
04:21:59,113 --> 04:22:07,455
[SPEAKER_05]: the residents of Medford, not people who don't live here anymore or who have some other vested interest in some other related to our policies.

2885
04:22:07,795 --> 04:22:10,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure we've all received some interesting emails of weight.

2886
04:22:11,316 --> 04:22:23,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but the full Medford part, I mean, I would be happy to take that back and try and find a way to include something about those people that are unhoused and

2887
04:22:24,887 --> 04:22:28,909
[SPEAKER_05]: and what can we do to make sure that their feedback can still be included.

2888
04:22:30,730 --> 04:22:32,651
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, I would appreciate that, thank you.

2889
04:22:37,694 --> 04:22:38,454
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion to approve.

2890
04:22:38,474 --> 04:22:40,515
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion to approve by member of Graham, seconded by.

2891
04:22:40,535 --> 04:22:40,715
[SPEAKER_46]: Second.

2892
04:22:41,215 --> 04:22:42,296
[SPEAKER_47]: Member McLaughlin, roll call.

2893
04:22:43,837 --> 04:22:44,477
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

2894
04:22:44,557 --> 04:22:44,777
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2895
04:22:45,818 --> 04:22:46,418
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kretz.

2896
04:22:47,358 --> 04:22:47,438
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

2897
04:22:47,458 --> 04:22:48,659
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

2898
04:22:48,759 --> 04:22:49,439
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Stone.

2899
04:22:49,640 --> 04:22:49,860
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2900
04:22:50,380 --> 04:22:51,060
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Russo.

2901
04:22:51,260 --> 04:22:51,480
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2902
04:22:51,821 --> 04:22:52,581
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kroot.

2903
04:22:53,081 --> 04:22:53,261
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

2904
04:22:59,508 --> 04:23:01,109
[SPEAKER_47]: And the last one, sorry.

2905
04:23:01,610 --> 04:23:02,371
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Russo.

2906
04:23:02,951 --> 04:23:03,411
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

2907
04:23:03,472 --> 04:23:10,217
[SPEAKER_47]: Policy BEDB, agenda creation and format for regular meetings of the school committee update.

2908
04:23:10,758 --> 04:23:11,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2909
04:23:11,879 --> 04:23:21,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, our current policy is also a very, very short policy, which essentially just lists the, you know, item one through nine or 11 or whatever it is.

2910
04:23:22,788 --> 04:23:24,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'll just,

2911
04:23:26,235 --> 04:23:32,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave an overview earlier, but there was a couple other things I wanted to point out.

2912
04:23:34,340 --> 04:23:37,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did say next meetings, that's informational.

2913
04:23:38,042 --> 04:23:40,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody will read it, nobody will have anything to say about it.

2914
04:23:41,203 --> 04:23:48,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, the mayor may want to if she feels the need to, but it does say that she doesn't have to, it's on the agenda.

2915
04:23:49,768 --> 04:23:52,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for reports requested,

2916
04:23:53,766 --> 04:24:01,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of like language in here and I suspect we will need to amend this once this gets used in September, if we approve it.

2917
04:24:01,972 --> 04:24:23,147
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that this, that or the other is clunky, but there are a number of things that are really instructions for the mayor to make sure that we're not missing things or that we, and it's not a reflection of the mayor at all, but like, you know, in number nine reports requested, there'll be a list of our outstanding reports

2918
04:24:24,215 --> 04:24:27,616
[SPEAKER_05]: and the chair will simply ask, are there any updates on outstanding reports?

2919
04:24:27,856 --> 04:24:37,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And the superintendent will say yay or nay, and then there's instructions here for members that want to remove items that they've put on there.

2920
04:24:37,519 --> 04:24:48,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You asked for a report on some reopening thing in June of last year, and here we are, and that report is still there, and it doesn't make any sense, because it was for,

2921
04:24:49,881 --> 04:24:55,766
[SPEAKER_05]: September of 2020, and it just stays there until one of us removes it.

2922
04:24:56,606 --> 04:25:05,473
[SPEAKER_05]: There's instructions actually for reports, should one of us no longer be on the committee, and somebody's asked for it, so that it doesn't just stay on there in perpetuity.

2923
04:25:07,875 --> 04:25:10,857
[SPEAKER_05]: The old business has been renamed to continued business.

2924
04:25:11,017 --> 04:25:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: MASC is very clear, old business is a terrible name for it.

2925
04:25:14,920 --> 04:25:18,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I never actually thought old business was a problem,

2926
04:25:19,278 --> 04:25:23,020
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's definitely best practice to call it continued business.

2927
04:25:23,921 --> 04:25:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a key at the very bottom, just before the policy information, which provides the document format information.

2928
04:25:37,169 --> 04:25:48,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So italicized text is content that will be filled in by the superintendent or her assistant to create the actual agenda.

2929
04:25:48,971 --> 04:26:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Content that's in quotes will actually be read by the chair, and information in brackets is intended to be removed and is simply instruction, so it's part of the policy, but if you are first time doing it or unfamiliar, this tells you how this works.

2930
04:26:08,427 --> 04:26:19,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I did also say that we need to amend the sentence that says each item under sections five, six, and seven really does need to say sections seven and eight.

2931
04:26:26,391 --> 04:26:26,811
[SPEAKER_47]: Any questions?

2932
04:26:26,831 --> 04:26:27,651
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion for approval?

2933
04:26:28,672 --> 04:26:29,292
[SPEAKER_47]: Questions?

2934
04:26:29,472 --> 04:26:30,032
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Kratz?

2935
04:26:31,032 --> 04:26:32,653
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, so I

2936
04:26:35,529 --> 04:26:35,769
[SPEAKER_33]: Ms.

2937
04:26:35,809 --> 04:26:38,011
[SPEAKER_33]: Van de Kloot and myself, we have a resolution.

2938
04:26:38,591 --> 04:26:46,238
[SPEAKER_33]: We haven't got to that point yet on the agenda to have the meeting start at a scheduled time.

2939
04:26:47,138 --> 04:26:54,804
[SPEAKER_33]: We heard from community members, all of us, that they would like a designated time to start.

2940
04:26:55,345 --> 04:27:03,191
[SPEAKER_33]: So I know that what I've heard from the discussion was that you, during your subcommittee meeting,

2941
04:27:05,029 --> 04:27:15,455
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, kind of talking about, you know, having the possibility of having a meeting start, you know, maybe five, six flexible with the superintendent, and I'm okay with that.

2942
04:27:15,875 --> 04:27:23,899
[SPEAKER_33]: However, what we've heard from the community is that, you know, I know that some of the reports that are presented,

2943
04:27:25,931 --> 04:27:37,807
[SPEAKER_33]: might be for us, but some of the community, you know, enjoys, you know, being part of that, you know, discussion and hearing it and, you know, has kind of asked us to have the meeting start.

2944
04:27:38,419 --> 04:27:43,081
[SPEAKER_33]: At seven, which, you know, I tried to kind of go somewhere in the middle between six and seven.

2945
04:27:43,142 --> 04:27:46,603
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, I just kind of came up with the middle time of 630.

2946
04:27:47,064 --> 04:27:49,245
[SPEAKER_33]: We've started a couple of our meetings at 630.

2947
04:27:50,705 --> 04:27:56,989
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I do the goal of all of our meetings is to not have them go, you know,

2948
04:27:58,393 --> 04:28:14,070
[SPEAKER_33]: hours and hours, you know, that's definitely a goal and I know that that's what this plan is, you know, trying to do is trying to, you know, reduce the amount of time that our meetings are going by having a, you know, a consolidated agenda.

2949
04:28:15,051 --> 04:28:16,913
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm just, you know,

2950
04:28:17,751 --> 04:28:30,902
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just concerned where now, you know, we're going to have, which, and I'm totally in support of not having the presentations for the public until at, you know, after 7pm or after.

2951
04:28:31,603 --> 04:28:37,287
[SPEAKER_33]: I do agree with that so that people who are in work can go home, eat, you know, eat their dinner.

2952
04:28:37,708 --> 04:28:42,792
[SPEAKER_33]: And then if they want to either join on Zoom or they're going to come down to the chamber, they can do that.

2953
04:28:44,193 --> 04:28:58,841
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's where I am with that because where I didn't, you know, I heard about your, um, I read, I'm sorry, not read, watched on YouTube after I had already done my resolution.

2954
04:28:58,861 --> 04:28:58,941
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

2955
04:28:59,642 --> 04:29:04,685
[SPEAKER_33]: So it just was like, you know, the timing was like a coincidence, you know, I'm doing the resolution, Ms.

2956
04:29:04,745 --> 04:29:07,786
[SPEAKER_33]: Bandicoot, and then you were having a discussion, you know?

2957
04:29:08,227 --> 04:29:11,509
[SPEAKER_33]: So, um, so, you know, I'm just, you know,

2958
04:29:12,469 --> 04:29:15,473
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, I am definitely I start work very early.

2959
04:29:15,493 --> 04:29:27,247
[SPEAKER_33]: I know the administration does I know the teachers do and, you know, this is like my I don't know like 20th hour right now I'm losing my voice I can't think I'm, I have no voice you know it's just going.

2960
04:29:27,687 --> 04:29:27,988
[SPEAKER_33]: So, I.

2961
04:29:29,349 --> 04:29:49,930
[SPEAKER_33]: and definitely in support of having earlier meetings but at the same time you know it's our duty to serve the public and and that's what has been pointed out to me by you know some of the public that you know we used to do our meetings at seven we every meeting started at seven and then once we had the pandemic

2962
04:29:50,984 --> 04:30:00,446
[SPEAKER_33]: we did kind of cut the, I mean, we started our meetings earlier because we were meeting earlier, but we went just as late.

2963
04:30:01,066 --> 04:30:15,129
[SPEAKER_33]: Like we started, some of our meetings started last year at four, but we still met until 11 o'clock at night, you know, even though we, so we, we, we started to trend towards an earlier hour, you know, so I'm wondering if, you know,

2964
04:30:17,955 --> 04:30:25,101
[SPEAKER_33]: if maybe, like, if we could come up with a set time so that the community knows that we're going to be starting our meetings at a set time.

2965
04:30:25,181 --> 04:30:33,847
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not gonna, you know, my resolution hasn't come up yet, so that's, you know, coming up in the future time, but we are talking about the gender at this time right now.

2966
04:30:35,048 --> 04:30:39,872
[SPEAKER_33]: So from reading this, I'm not sure, like, what time are the meetings gonna start?

2967
04:30:40,152 --> 04:30:41,193
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm just curious myself.

2968
04:30:41,273 --> 04:30:45,116
[SPEAKER_33]: Are they, you know, it doesn't seem like it's going to be set here for a specific time.

2969
04:30:51,184 --> 04:31:14,234
[SPEAKER_35]: Through the chair I think the point of this is to provide some flexibility and some consistency at the same time so the public is particularly interested we're introducing new resolutions where we are deliberating debating and setting policy and all of that would certainly be happening consistently 7 o'clock or later.

2970
04:31:14,254 --> 04:31:17,735
[SPEAKER_35]: The things that are moving up front are the

2971
04:31:18,206 --> 04:31:27,994
[SPEAKER_35]: the things that we do and approve and the public rarely participates although they're welcome to everything is recorded.

2972
04:31:28,014 --> 04:31:32,417
[SPEAKER_35]: And I just feel like this is worth a try.

2973
04:31:32,437 --> 04:31:39,403
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we have to also acknowledge that the administrators are right here with us.

2974
04:31:39,863 --> 04:31:40,924
[SPEAKER_35]: There are employees.

2975
04:31:42,205 --> 04:31:44,447
[SPEAKER_35]: It's an employee's market right now and

2976
04:31:45,091 --> 04:31:48,354
[SPEAKER_35]: we need to be respectful of their time as well.

2977
04:31:48,934 --> 04:32:02,586
[SPEAKER_35]: And so to me, this is a nice compromise between the public who may want to join us on a given night and the administrators who are required to join us every single night.

2978
04:32:03,446 --> 04:32:04,808
[SPEAKER_35]: And I think we should try it.

2979
04:32:05,068 --> 04:32:06,269
[SPEAKER_35]: So I make a motion to approve.

2980
04:32:07,670 --> 04:32:07,950
[SPEAKER_44]: Mayor?

2981
04:32:09,592 --> 04:32:10,873
[SPEAKER_44]: Member van der Kloof.

2982
04:32:11,733 --> 04:32:13,215
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't understand the,

2983
04:32:14,198 --> 04:32:19,643
[SPEAKER_44]: where, how the flexibility of the meeting and the superintendent can start the meeting at different times.

2984
04:32:19,823 --> 04:32:22,426
[SPEAKER_44]: I truly just think that makes it more complicated.

2985
04:32:22,446 --> 04:32:28,291
[SPEAKER_44]: I think that, um, I think we were trying to come up with a standard.

2986
04:32:28,311 --> 04:32:30,954
[SPEAKER_44]: We start at 6 30 when it's a regular school committee meeting.

2987
04:32:31,895 --> 04:32:31,975
[SPEAKER_44]: Um,

2988
04:32:34,649 --> 04:32:37,612
[SPEAKER_44]: So I'm a little mystified how that works.

2989
04:32:38,812 --> 04:32:47,059
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm also mystified because the report of the superintendent, that's the funny part, because for me, that's always like, to me, that's been, okay, that's the most important thing.

2990
04:32:47,199 --> 04:33:00,549
[SPEAKER_44]: That's the meat of the, that's, you know, so it's funny to me, the presentations of public, the resolutions, you know, I'm a little mystified.

2991
04:33:01,549 --> 04:33:03,611
[SPEAKER_44]: It might work and I'm just not seeing it.

2992
04:33:06,727 --> 04:33:12,708
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, the other thing is at the consent agenda, I think, but I'm not sure, but I'm gonna ask Mr. Murphy this.

2993
04:33:14,009 --> 04:33:24,931
[SPEAKER_44]: I thought that if it had to do with finances, like the approval of payrolls or the approval of bills, those two things have to be roll call votes.

2994
04:33:25,551 --> 04:33:26,551
[SPEAKER_44]: Is that correct or not?

2995
04:33:27,691 --> 04:33:27,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

2996
04:33:29,411 --> 04:33:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

2997
04:33:30,952 --> 04:33:32,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We will roll call vote the consent agenda.

2998
04:33:34,093 --> 04:33:35,273
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to do them separately.

2999
04:33:35,774 --> 04:33:36,354
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, OK.

3000
04:33:36,514 --> 04:33:40,035
[SPEAKER_44]: So you'll roll call vote it all as a group?

3001
04:33:40,615 --> 04:33:41,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, once.

3002
04:33:43,536 --> 04:33:44,636
[SPEAKER_44]: And it'll include all of those things?

3003
04:33:44,676 --> 04:33:46,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it includes the finance stuff in there.

3004
04:33:46,137 --> 04:33:47,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll roll call vote it.

3005
04:33:48,737 --> 04:33:49,057
[SPEAKER_44]: OK.

3006
04:33:50,658 --> 04:33:51,238
[SPEAKER_44]: Can we do that?

3007
04:33:53,739 --> 04:33:56,900
[SPEAKER_44]: Again, I just don't know, because we've always done those things separately.

3008
04:34:04,568 --> 04:34:07,030
[SPEAKER_47]: Mr. Gordon, please.

3009
04:34:07,050 --> 04:34:09,152
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3010
04:34:09,172 --> 04:34:11,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

3011
04:34:11,694 --> 04:34:22,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of a specific requirement with regard to the bills and payroll, and I think you would be undermining the purpose of the consent agenda if you took a roll call vote on the consent agenda.

3012
04:34:22,583 --> 04:34:26,366
[SPEAKER_03]: The consent agenda is typically a mechanism to expedite the process.

3013
04:34:27,006 --> 04:34:43,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I wouldn't, if there was something that was a roll call vote, and the only one that comes to mind that is required to be a roll call vote under the law is a vote that you take in executive session so that the minutes can accurately reflect who voted for what, provided it's a permissible vote taking place in executive session.

3014
04:34:43,272 --> 04:34:49,075
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've never heard of the bills in payroll under state law having to be a roll call vote.

3015
04:34:49,095 --> 04:34:52,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible that there's a local policy that's been adopted that I'm not familiar with.

3016
04:34:52,796 --> 04:35:00,598
[SPEAKER_44]: But if someone gives us a donation and it's financial, we have to do a roll call vote.

3017
04:35:01,538 --> 04:35:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Under state law or under a Medford policy?

3018
04:35:05,599 --> 04:35:06,619
[SPEAKER_44]: We've just always done it.

3019
04:35:06,999 --> 04:35:08,279
[SPEAKER_44]: And I was told we had to do it.

3020
04:35:08,319 --> 04:35:09,820
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.

3021
04:35:10,040 --> 04:35:10,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

3022
04:35:10,880 --> 04:35:12,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can say this.

3023
04:35:13,000 --> 04:35:19,542
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is a state law, then there's a lot of law breaking happening across the Commonwealth with respect to donations.

3024
04:35:20,669 --> 04:35:26,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to look into that and confer with Mr. Gransman about it, but I do not believe it is a requirement at the state level.

3025
04:35:27,374 --> 04:35:37,082
[SPEAKER_44]: Okay, so you would say this paragraph, consent agenda, and including the approval of payrolls and the approval of bills, that's all okay?

3026
04:35:37,102 --> 04:35:41,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have any reason to believe that it would be in violation of state law.

3027
04:35:42,455 --> 04:35:43,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there are.

3028
04:35:43,575 --> 04:35:46,016
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't think we have anything that says no.

3029
04:35:46,736 --> 04:35:56,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to take a look at it, and I will certainly communicate to the committee if I find out that there is something that I'm not familiar with.

3030
04:35:57,340 --> 04:36:01,821
[SPEAKER_44]: Can this and our start time of 6.30 work together?

3031
04:36:01,841 --> 04:36:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that for me or the committee?

3032
04:36:06,342 --> 04:36:07,943
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm asking the committee members.

3033
04:36:08,203 --> 04:36:09,903
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm asking the committee members.

3034
04:36:10,083 --> 04:36:10,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3035
04:36:10,363 --> 04:36:10,964
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.30 works.

3036
04:36:12,806 --> 04:36:14,307
[SPEAKER_47]: member Rousseau.

3037
04:36:14,668 --> 04:36:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you, through the chair, are you suggesting that number six would say not to begin before 6.30?

3038
04:36:19,711 --> 04:36:23,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you saying the whole meeting?

3039
04:36:24,015 --> 04:36:29,339
[SPEAKER_44]: No, I'm saying that we have, that we start the roll call for attendance of members at 6.30.

3040
04:36:29,459 --> 04:36:31,680
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, okay, sorry.

3041
04:36:31,900 --> 04:36:36,884
[SPEAKER_44]: And the consent agenda, and that's done all before, and the report of the superintendent.

3042
04:36:36,944 --> 04:36:40,287
[SPEAKER_44]: But again, to me, that those things can all proceed at 6.30.

3043
04:36:43,845 --> 04:36:51,110
[SPEAKER_44]: So, and the only thing that you want to make sure that we don't start before seven is the presentations of the public.

3044
04:36:51,991 --> 04:36:52,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

3045
04:36:54,073 --> 04:36:54,593
[SPEAKER_44]: Member Rousseau.

3046
04:36:56,635 --> 04:36:59,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It's late, so forgive the filtered disappearing.

3047
04:36:59,497 --> 04:37:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get real here.

3048
04:37:01,939 --> 04:37:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: School committees are done in an hour and a half to two hours everywhere else in this state, and we are on six and seven hour meetings.

3049
04:37:09,925 --> 04:37:12,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe our employees are not leaving.

3050
04:37:12,955 --> 04:37:15,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I really can't.

3051
04:37:16,117 --> 04:37:17,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to call it community participation.

3052
04:37:17,978 --> 04:37:20,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We want everybody in the world to have everything they can say.

3053
04:37:20,599 --> 04:37:25,162
[SPEAKER_05]: We can ask endless questions for which we could have just sent an email.

3054
04:37:25,682 --> 04:37:29,784
[SPEAKER_44]: All I want to understand is what time is the meeting going to start?

3055
04:37:31,005 --> 04:37:29,784
6.30.

3056
04:37:31,025 --> 04:37:34,947
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.30.

3057
04:37:31,105 --> 04:37:34,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week that means we would have begun the item on this agenda at 9.30.

3058
04:37:40,129 --> 04:37:45,950
[SPEAKER_35]: Subcommittee said the meeting can start at different times based on what's on the agenda.

3059
04:37:45,970 --> 04:37:48,410
[SPEAKER_35]: If there's one thing on the agenda, maybe it starts at 630.

3060
04:37:48,510 --> 04:37:51,071
[SPEAKER_35]: If there's 12 things on the agenda, maybe it starts at 6.

3061
04:37:51,251 --> 04:37:54,551
[SPEAKER_35]: If we have executive session, maybe it starts at 5.

3062
04:37:55,132 --> 04:38:01,673
[SPEAKER_35]: With the goal being we're not introducing new business or talking about resolutions until 7 o'clock when people can be here.

3063
04:38:02,093 --> 04:38:05,053
[SPEAKER_35]: But the start time of the meeting can shift.

3064
04:38:05,353 --> 04:38:09,334
[SPEAKER_35]: It's the whole reason why we pushed all of this stuff to the front of the agenda.

3065
04:38:10,006 --> 04:38:29,795
[SPEAKER_35]: so that we are covering those things that generally have much less participation, that have to get done to the front so that we can both hear from the community at 7 and start the meeting early so that we can get out of here before midnight.

3066
04:38:32,236 --> 04:38:37,459
[SPEAKER_47]: I think people are going to not be happy with this, but just from the chair.

3067
04:38:38,119 --> 04:38:38,299
[SPEAKER_28]: Mayor?

3068
04:38:40,438 --> 04:38:44,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Members, I would agree that not everybody's gonna be happy.

3069
04:38:44,160 --> 04:38:47,281
[SPEAKER_05]: We could also do what most other communities that I've looked at are doing.

3070
04:38:47,601 --> 04:38:51,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a sign-up sheet and we have 20 minutes for public comment and then it's off.

3071
04:38:52,344 --> 04:38:55,185
[SPEAKER_05]: The public comment ends after 20 minutes.

3072
04:38:55,605 --> 04:38:57,646
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter if there were 400 people here to talk.

3073
04:38:57,986 --> 04:39:07,251
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do in other communities so that we don't have staff that finds out what they've signed up for and are like updating their resumes.

3074
04:39:08,472 --> 04:39:10,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't want to be blunt, but that's the truth.

3075
04:39:10,514 --> 04:39:14,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, I can put up, I can talk all night, as I mentioned earlier to Member Vander Kloot.

3076
04:39:15,458 --> 04:39:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to stay here until the sun comes up, but I also don't have to be at work at 7 a.m., and Mia's looking at me that that's not okay either.

3077
04:39:23,124 --> 04:39:31,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody being happy I didn't think was the goal, and this isn't City Council where it's just us.

3078
04:39:31,490 --> 04:39:36,013
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a host of people who have to stay and will be at work at 7 a.m.

3079
04:39:36,394 --> 04:39:37,955
[SPEAKER_05]: City Council can stay all night if they want.

3080
04:39:38,844 --> 04:39:50,908
[SPEAKER_47]: I think you could pass the policy because, I mean, the superintendent and I discussed what time to start the meeting and this is just changing the order, which is fine.

3081
04:39:53,688 --> 04:39:54,609
[SPEAKER_46]: Motion to approve.

3082
04:39:55,449 --> 04:39:55,769
[SPEAKER_46]: As amended.

3083
04:39:56,149 --> 04:39:56,709
[SPEAKER_46]: As amended.

3084
04:39:58,470 --> 04:39:58,870
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded.

3085
04:39:59,250 --> 04:39:59,610
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

3086
04:40:00,310 --> 04:40:01,711
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Graham, roll call.

3087
04:40:03,211 --> 04:40:03,851
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

3088
04:40:03,931 --> 04:40:04,151
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3089
04:40:05,372 --> 04:40:05,932
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kratz.

3090
04:40:22,898 --> 04:40:27,800
[SPEAKER_33]: and try it and see how the public feels.

3091
04:40:32,063 --> 04:40:32,963
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm gonna have to abstain.

3092
04:40:32,983 --> 04:40:35,464
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sorry, I'm just not ready to do the vote right now.

3093
04:40:38,291 --> 04:40:39,552
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

3094
04:40:39,773 --> 04:40:40,513
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McStone?

3095
04:40:40,553 --> 04:40:40,794
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3096
04:40:41,594 --> 04:40:42,315
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Rousseau?

3097
04:40:42,415 --> 04:40:42,635
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3098
04:40:42,876 --> 04:40:43,696
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloet?

3099
04:40:45,258 --> 04:40:45,358
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

3100
04:40:45,979 --> 04:40:46,699
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Logo-Kern?

3101
04:40:49,182 --> 04:40:52,185
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, five in the affirmative, one no, one abstain.

3102
04:40:52,665 --> 04:40:53,406
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion passes.

3103
04:40:54,848 --> 04:40:57,690
[SPEAKER_47]: Final report of the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee.

3104
04:40:57,710 --> 04:40:59,812
[SPEAKER_47]: If you could be brief, Member McLaughlin.

3105
04:41:02,511 --> 04:41:02,951
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3106
04:41:02,971 --> 04:41:05,572
[SPEAKER_46]: I am going to be very brief actually.

3107
04:41:07,013 --> 04:41:18,797
[SPEAKER_46]: I was assuming that we were gonna be able to have this final report because we had a meeting last month that we had expected to have, but was rescheduled due to a family emergency.

3108
04:41:18,877 --> 04:41:22,418
[SPEAKER_46]: So we are actually scheduled to have our final meeting this Thursday.

3109
04:41:23,519 --> 04:41:27,140
[SPEAKER_46]: So this is not exactly a final report, but I'll just give you folks an update.

3110
04:41:27,160 --> 04:41:29,081
[SPEAKER_46]: I think you know that we've been working on

3111
04:41:30,404 --> 04:41:33,746
[SPEAKER_46]: From a behavioral health perspective, we've been working on trauma-informed schools.

3112
04:41:34,727 --> 04:41:42,792
[SPEAKER_46]: Stacey Shulman and several members of the community have been regularly attending these nine meetings over the course of the past 10 months.

3113
04:41:43,572 --> 04:41:56,340
[SPEAKER_46]: And one of the recommendations that the subcommittee had was having annual training on mental health needs slash issues that

3114
04:41:57,200 --> 04:42:03,924
[SPEAKER_46]: Stacey can be more specific about, but regular two-hour training around suicide prevention, among other things.

3115
04:42:05,185 --> 04:42:17,633
[SPEAKER_46]: And then the special education portion of it, we've been working on building friendships and community for students with and without disabilities and a disability awareness curriculum.

3116
04:42:18,213 --> 04:42:20,674
[SPEAKER_46]: So regarding the building friendships and community,

3117
04:42:22,355 --> 04:42:41,594
[SPEAKER_46]: We've looked at a number of options and we are talking about expanding a high school program and the staff there are looking at how to work with the middle school to extend the program, which is currently a reverse inclusion model where general education students are going into

3118
04:42:42,711 --> 04:42:52,419
[SPEAKER_46]: for example, access classrooms, but having that as part of a class, as a curriculum, as opposed to every now and then occasion.

3119
04:42:53,000 --> 04:42:55,122
[SPEAKER_46]: And then a disability awareness curriculum.

3120
04:42:55,702 --> 04:43:03,269
[SPEAKER_46]: So they're piloting a disability awareness curriculum with Susanna Campbell, and we're hoping to expand that.

3121
04:43:03,329 --> 04:43:04,029
[SPEAKER_46]: So those are the

3122
04:43:04,790 --> 04:43:09,132
[SPEAKER_46]: recommendations at this point and as I said we have one more meeting for the year.

3123
04:43:09,273 --> 04:43:14,616
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's the not quite a report but maybe something more of an update.

3124
04:43:15,396 --> 04:43:16,136
[SPEAKER_35]: Motion to approve?

3125
04:43:21,159 --> 04:43:21,539
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3126
04:43:22,420 --> 04:43:23,060
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

3127
04:43:23,140 --> 04:43:23,360
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

3128
04:43:24,241 --> 04:43:24,881
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kretz.

3129
04:43:27,122 --> 04:43:27,543
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh sorry.

3130
04:43:28,732 --> 04:43:35,256
[SPEAKER_46]: This is a motion to approve the semi-report on the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee member cuts.

3131
04:43:35,897 --> 04:43:36,097
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

3132
04:43:37,678 --> 04:43:38,619
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

3133
04:43:38,679 --> 04:43:39,399
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McStone?

3134
04:43:39,419 --> 04:43:39,479
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3135
04:43:40,340 --> 04:43:41,280
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Rousseau?

3136
04:43:41,360 --> 04:43:41,580
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3137
04:43:41,901 --> 04:43:42,681
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloot?

3138
04:43:42,761 --> 04:43:42,981
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes.

3139
04:43:43,222 --> 04:43:43,922
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Lange-Kern?

3140
04:43:45,243 --> 04:43:46,384
[SPEAKER_46]: Oh, absent.

3141
04:43:47,664 --> 04:43:49,105
[SPEAKER_44]: She stepped out.

3142
04:43:49,125 --> 04:43:50,266
[SPEAKER_44]: She stepped out for a second.

3143
04:43:51,687 --> 04:43:54,269
[SPEAKER_46]: Should I put her down as absent for now for this vote?

3144
04:43:56,230 --> 04:43:56,470
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure.

3145
04:43:56,991 --> 04:43:57,091
[SPEAKER_46]: OK.

3146
04:43:58,061 --> 04:44:03,244
[SPEAKER_44]: So it was six in the affirmative and one stepped out.

3147
04:44:04,965 --> 04:44:08,648
[SPEAKER_44]: Superintendent, now it's time for your report, please.

3148
04:44:13,271 --> 04:44:14,311
[SPEAKER_30]: For the record, it's 11.16 p.m.

3149
04:44:25,737 --> 04:44:28,498
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure, community participation.

3150
04:44:29,138 --> 04:44:37,662
[SPEAKER_44]: Any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.

3151
04:44:38,322 --> 04:44:48,246
[SPEAKER_44]: A community participation portion of the agenda will be established which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee to be heard on any item.

3152
04:44:48,766 --> 04:44:52,448
[SPEAKER_44]: Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools

3153
04:44:52,988 --> 04:44:58,612
[SPEAKER_44]: by the Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.

3154
04:44:59,493 --> 04:45:08,659
[SPEAKER_44]: Public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

3155
04:45:08,999 --> 04:45:11,481
[SPEAKER_44]: Those submitting must include the following information.

3156
04:45:11,941 --> 04:45:13,162
[SPEAKER_44]: One, your name and last name.

3157
04:45:13,222 --> 04:45:14,783
[SPEAKER_44]: Two, your Medford street address.

3158
04:45:14,823 --> 04:45:16,384
[SPEAKER_44]: Three, your question or comment.

3159
04:45:17,338 --> 04:45:23,062
[SPEAKER_44]: Now, number eight, number one, superintendent's updates and comments.

3160
04:45:30,266 --> 04:45:31,447
[SPEAKER_30]: Good evening, everyone.

3161
04:45:34,209 --> 04:45:37,171
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, I just wanted to note that today was definitely Flag Day.

3162
04:45:38,892 --> 04:45:43,515
[SPEAKER_30]: This holiday came into existence on June 14th.

3163
04:45:45,338 --> 04:45:47,419
[SPEAKER_30]: It's commemorating the date in 1777.

3164
04:45:48,199 --> 04:45:52,020
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just wanted to highlight that.

3165
04:45:52,400 --> 04:45:58,802
[SPEAKER_30]: I am not going to go through everything that I had to highlight.

3166
04:45:59,342 --> 04:46:05,204
[SPEAKER_30]: I am just going to pick a few pieces.

3167
04:46:06,564 --> 04:46:08,264
[SPEAKER_30]: One piece is this Thursday.

3168
04:46:09,425 --> 04:46:12,506
[SPEAKER_30]: CCSR is going to be featured on Channel 5 at 7 p.m.

3169
04:46:15,097 --> 04:46:17,497
[SPEAKER_30]: The segment is called Five for Good.

3170
04:46:17,517 --> 04:46:28,219
[SPEAKER_30]: And Erica Tarentall, she was on campus interviewing Mr. Skorger, Mr. Trotter, and our students about their different projects.

3171
04:46:29,599 --> 04:46:36,701
[SPEAKER_30]: So again, I hope you'll be able to watch them on, watch the segment on Channel 5 this coming Thursday.

3172
04:46:39,701 --> 04:46:43,082
[SPEAKER_30]: Also, there's going to be a COVID-19 vaccine

3173
04:46:45,151 --> 04:46:48,393
[SPEAKER_30]: for our students between ages 12 and 17.

3174
04:46:49,373 --> 04:47:05,640
[SPEAKER_30]: Medford's Board of Health is going to be hosting the clinics on June 16th at Mystic Market from 3.30 to 6.30 and also from 3.30 to 5.30 at the Willis Ave Community Center.

3175
04:47:06,721 --> 04:47:12,784
[SPEAKER_30]: On June 19th, the West Medford Community Center will be hosting the clinic from 10 a.m.

3176
04:47:12,864 --> 04:47:13,344
[SPEAKER_30]: to noon.

3177
04:47:14,266 --> 04:47:20,170
[SPEAKER_30]: and then June 26th again at Mystic Market from 3.30 to 6.30 p.m.

3178
04:47:22,771 --> 04:47:35,700
[SPEAKER_30]: I am going to ask Dr. Cushing if he is able just to quickly show the results of a student poll.

3179
04:47:36,600 --> 04:47:42,184
[SPEAKER_30]: We looked at our eighth grade students, eighth through 12th grade,

3180
04:47:42,691 --> 04:47:46,992
[SPEAKER_30]: They were given three choices for signage for Medford High School.

3181
04:47:47,752 --> 04:47:50,493
[SPEAKER_30]: We had about 350 participants.

3182
04:47:51,513 --> 04:48:02,076
[SPEAKER_30]: And that was the sign that the students selected that said Medford High School with the white M and the gray Mustang horse.

3183
04:48:02,916 --> 04:48:10,158
[SPEAKER_30]: And then above the little doorway, even though it's a little blurry, they selected home of the Mustangs to be

3184
04:48:10,825 --> 04:48:11,686
[SPEAKER_30]: above the doorway.

3185
04:48:12,427 --> 04:48:23,818
[SPEAKER_30]: So, um, that was a student choice and this was a recommendation from the building and ground subcommittee to, um, solicit feedback from our students.

3186
04:48:24,578 --> 04:48:34,468
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just wanted to, um, of the 350 responses, uh, participants, this was the clear majority.

3187
04:48:39,216 --> 04:48:48,844
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the last comment that I will make is that this Saturday does mark Juneteenth.

3188
04:48:49,064 --> 04:48:55,889
[SPEAKER_30]: It is a new holiday for Massachusetts, but a long celebrated day for so many in our country.

3189
04:48:57,531 --> 04:49:02,835
[SPEAKER_30]: The Emancipation Proclamation took place or took effect on January 1st, 1863, and the 13th Amendment

3190
04:49:07,273 --> 04:49:11,735
[SPEAKER_30]: Abolishing slavery was passed by Congress on January 31 of 1865.

3191
04:49:13,096 --> 04:49:25,041
[SPEAKER_30]: It wasn't until June 19, 1865, that the enslaved people in Texas learned that they were free.

3192
04:49:27,282 --> 04:49:30,764
[SPEAKER_30]: This day became a celebration for Black Americans in Texas.

3193
04:49:31,983 --> 04:49:38,328
[SPEAKER_30]: and has spread to other areas as a descendants of former slaves migrated to other parts of the country.

3194
04:49:39,608 --> 04:49:45,993
[SPEAKER_30]: Texas was the first state in the union to recognize the holiday in 1980.

3195
04:49:47,934 --> 04:49:54,259
[SPEAKER_30]: In modern day, we have 48 states in the union that are currently recognizing the holiday.

3196
04:49:54,279 --> 04:49:58,722
[SPEAKER_30]: South Dakota and Hawaii are the two abstentions.

3197
04:50:01,008 --> 04:50:15,760
[SPEAKER_30]: A little known fact, if Dr. Cushing is able to show the image, there is a Juneteenth flag, and Boston Ben is what he's known as.

3198
04:50:16,300 --> 04:50:24,006
[SPEAKER_30]: He was one of the key people who was instrumental in the Juneteenth movement.

3199
04:50:24,786 --> 04:50:29,690
[SPEAKER_30]: But Lisa Jean Graff, who's a Boston-based illustrator, she

3200
04:50:31,175 --> 04:50:37,577
[SPEAKER_30]: took the description of what they said, and she was instrumental in the design.

3201
04:50:39,357 --> 04:50:45,939
[SPEAKER_30]: And the design of the Juneteenth flag depicts a bursting new star on the horizon.

3202
04:50:47,280 --> 04:50:52,121
[SPEAKER_30]: The star represents a new freedom, a new people, a new star.

3203
04:50:52,842 --> 04:51:00,784
[SPEAKER_30]: The red, white, and blue colors communicate that the American slaves and their descendants were all Americans.

3204
04:51:03,268 --> 04:51:05,890
[SPEAKER_30]: That's what the Juneteenth flag looks like.

3205
04:51:07,151 --> 04:51:18,139
[SPEAKER_30]: And I just want to say thank you to everyone, and I wish everyone a wonderful summer break, as the last day of school is at the end of this week.

3206
04:51:22,942 --> 04:51:24,203
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent, for the updates.

3210
04:51:31,123 --> 04:51:39,609
[SPEAKER_33]: I make a motion to go ahead with signed option two for the front entrance of Medford High School to be put up for September 1st, 2021.

3211
04:51:40,250 --> 04:51:44,873
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the same sign option that was preferred choice at the subcommittee meeting that we had.

3212
04:51:45,293 --> 04:51:48,215
[SPEAKER_33]: It was just labeled number six during the subcommittee.

3213
04:51:48,235 --> 04:51:51,597
[SPEAKER_33]: We just had more choices, but that was the preferred choice.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor.

3299
04:57:34,843 --> 04:57:36,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, members of the school committee.

3300
04:57:37,185 --> 04:57:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked Dr. Cushing to fast forward through the slides that you were provided with late today.

3301
04:57:42,428 --> 04:57:55,937
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said in my communication to the school committee this afternoon, the update tonight is primarily in preparation for your next and presumably final meeting of the fiscal year.

3302
04:57:56,697 --> 04:58:06,945
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the Committee of the Whole meetings and our budget meetings, we've talked about how the vote that you took on July, excuse me, on June 1st is a request to the municipal government.

3303
04:58:07,786 --> 04:58:13,970
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor and the municipal and the city council then go through their process and ultimately make an appropriation.

3304
04:58:14,551 --> 04:58:25,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we discussed on April 26th, while many school committees do omit that final vote, it is that final vote in which the committee is essentially adopting a budget and seeing a final presentation of those numbers.

3305
04:58:26,645 --> 04:58:42,082
[SPEAKER_03]: As we also said throughout the process and I've skipped most of the process slides but this one is important so I will just point it out that there is a discrepancy as frankly we anticipated that there would be between the committee's request to the administration and the mayor's recommendation to the City Council.

3306
04:58:42,455 --> 04:58:51,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I will point out that it is a modest discrepancy, at least in terms of when we're talking about a budget in the upwards of $67 million.

3307
04:58:52,924 --> 04:59:01,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the information that you have before you and in the memo that I provided to you is preparing for what I anticipate will be the recommendations that

3308
04:59:02,272 --> 04:59:05,815
[SPEAKER_03]: the school administration will bring forward in that final meeting.

3309
04:59:05,895 --> 04:59:21,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're giving you that information now because obviously there's a $760,000 delta, most of which frankly is absorbed by what we communicated, I think pretty clearly would not be in the final recommendations.

3310
04:59:21,286 --> 04:59:22,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm speaking primarily about the

3311
04:59:23,768 --> 04:59:35,360
[SPEAKER_03]: coaching staff instructional coaching staff that in our proposal on June 1st would have amounted to about a five hundred and twenty thousand dollar budget hit but if you recall in the committee of the whole meetings

3312
04:59:36,134 --> 04:59:43,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially what we communicated was that while we think it's a good practice to have both literacy and math coaches, it's an investment that we'd like to make in the near future.

3313
04:59:44,656 --> 04:59:51,258
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, we don't believe, the school administration does not believe that we are structured in a way that would fully capitalize on that investment.

3314
04:59:51,338 --> 04:59:57,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think it's incumbent upon us to become structured in a way that would fully capitalize on that type of investment.

3315
04:59:57,839 --> 05:00:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: and I fully anticipate that there'll be a recommendation forthcoming, be it in the coming months or coming years, to make that investment.

3316
05:00:05,184 --> 05:00:11,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, that's gonna go a long way in terms of bridging that $760,000 gap.

3317
05:00:12,368 --> 05:00:16,711
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some other changes that have come about as a result of just the normal scrubbing process.

3318
05:00:17,391 --> 05:00:22,875
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll see in the memo that we actually adjust the budget by about a million dollars or so, and then there are a few additional

3319
05:00:23,922 --> 05:00:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: investments that we're now recommending or will be recommending as part of that final budget option.

3320
05:00:29,284 --> 05:00:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: If we want to fast forward, I'll run through them very quickly.

3321
05:00:31,825 --> 05:00:39,467
[SPEAKER_03]: The first slide is the reductions and things that you would have seen on June 1st that you will not see in your final meeting.

3322
05:00:40,387 --> 05:00:49,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't believe there will be any surprises here, but certainly be it this evening or if there are questions that committee members would like to send to us, I'm happy to take those one at a time.

3323
05:00:49,810 --> 05:00:51,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of these are just positions

3324
05:00:51,812 --> 05:01:00,204
[SPEAKER_03]: As we were developing the budget process, it made an initial cut in recommendations, and then as we've gotten closer to the close of this fiscal year, and then

3325
05:01:01,055 --> 05:01:09,860
[SPEAKER_03]: by definition closer to the start of the next school year, we've concluded that either we don't need the position or at least that we don't need the position right now.

3326
05:01:10,301 --> 05:01:15,624
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go to the next slide, I will show you some of the investments swinging in the other direction.

3327
05:01:17,185 --> 05:01:27,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these are frankly omissions or things that we didn't know based on our position in developing the original recommendations if we thought it would be prudent to include originally.

3328
05:01:27,931 --> 05:01:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest number there obviously is the $305,000.

3329
05:01:31,673 --> 05:01:41,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our normal practice, at least in recent history, to have a $300,000 personnel line item for unexpected, unanticipated challenges.

3330
05:01:41,179 --> 05:01:43,221
[SPEAKER_03]: We certainly had plenty of those this year.

3331
05:01:43,721 --> 05:01:54,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming into a year in which we have nine expiring collective bargaining agreements, this is frankly a very modest number to reserve, but it's not necessarily representing the reserve in its entirety.

3332
05:01:55,788 --> 05:02:03,813
[SPEAKER_03]: but rather than rush into recommendations in the closing days of the fiscal year, we felt that that would be the most prudent thing to do.

3333
05:02:04,793 --> 05:02:12,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Another piece that you'll see is $100,000 that is being reserved for a potential administrative leadership in the fine arts department.

3334
05:02:12,177 --> 05:02:16,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That was feedback that came back to us throughout the course of the budget process.

3335
05:02:17,580 --> 05:02:19,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still some questions, frankly, within our

3336
05:02:20,001 --> 05:02:29,825
[SPEAKER_03]: internally about what would be the best approach there, be it a director position, multiple coordinator positions at the secondary and elementary level with responsibility for collaborating across levels.

3337
05:02:30,485 --> 05:02:41,409
[SPEAKER_03]: These are pieces that we're still frankly we may be posting positions and then making a determination based on the talent within the applicant pool as to which of those strategies that we would pursue.

3338
05:02:44,230 --> 05:02:51,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be more information than you may be accustomed in terms of just giving you a sense as to what we anticipate our recommendations being.

3339
05:02:52,096 --> 05:03:04,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But given, I think, the hope that we only have a few weeks left in the fiscal year, it's my expectation, based on our previous discussions, that we'll probably be having a, at least relatively speaking, brief meeting to close out the fiscal year.

3340
05:03:05,085 --> 05:03:10,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we present that information, we want to just make sure that you've had time to digest it and understand where we're headed.

3341
05:03:11,049 --> 05:03:12,970
[SPEAKER_03]: The last slide just provides a summary of this.

3342
05:03:14,491 --> 05:03:15,472
[SPEAKER_03]: of basically what I just said.

3343
05:03:15,493 --> 05:03:17,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to take your questions.

3344
05:03:18,737 --> 05:03:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think just from a housekeeping perspective,

3345
05:03:24,059 --> 05:03:32,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard me say this before, I don't believe you need to wait until the city council takes their vote to appropriate funding to see your final budget.

3346
05:03:32,944 --> 05:03:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can convene and you can take the vote with the understanding that should the city council exercise their authority to reduce the budget, knowing that they can't add to it, but should they reduce the school department's budget, we would have to reconvene again after that vote and present you with the final number.

3347
05:03:49,614 --> 05:03:52,415
[SPEAKER_03]: But assuming the number stays at what the mayor has recommended,

3348
05:03:53,792 --> 05:04:05,142
[SPEAKER_03]: That our, our plan is to present you at the end of this week with a revised budget book that will reflect the number in assuming that the city council adopts the mayor's recommendation.

3349
05:04:05,603 --> 05:04:06,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they reduce that?

3350
05:04:06,764 --> 05:04:14,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly their right to do that from a municipal organizational perspective, but we'll, and we'll be prepared to respond to whatever contingency we need to.

3351
05:04:15,606 --> 05:04:17,887
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't think we need to wait until the city council convenes.

3352
05:04:18,387 --> 05:04:24,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a matter of scheduling it, uh, either for later this week or actually that's not, that's not a good idea for next week.

3353
05:04:24,888 --> 05:04:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I put in this presentation recommendation of June 23rd, uh, that was based on our internal discussions of what I understood to be our position, but I think Wednesday or Thursday would be fine.

3354
05:04:37,911 --> 05:04:42,292
[SPEAKER_22]: Could we tentatively schedule then with that information for Thursday, June 24th?

3355
05:04:45,325 --> 05:04:46,885
[SPEAKER_47]: meeting we're going to do the doodle poll for.

3356
05:04:47,126 --> 05:04:47,466
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

3357
05:04:47,666 --> 05:04:53,428
[SPEAKER_22]: But just said, I think we were also thinking that we weren't sure if we had to reconvene after the city council.

3358
05:04:53,468 --> 05:04:56,028
[SPEAKER_22]: So tentatively for June 24th.

3359
05:04:57,889 --> 05:04:58,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

3360
05:04:58,449 --> 05:05:00,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that that I don't think their final vote is scheduled.

3361
05:05:00,810 --> 05:05:01,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my understanding.

3362
05:05:02,450 --> 05:05:06,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, again, we can do frankly, we could probably do as early as Tuesday.

3363
05:05:08,203 --> 05:05:11,564
[SPEAKER_03]: probably don't want to do later than Thursday, and I defer to the committee.

3364
05:05:11,864 --> 05:05:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

3365
05:05:14,004 --> 05:05:17,505
[SPEAKER_44]: I make a motion that we do it on Thursday, June 24.

3366
05:05:20,566 --> 05:05:21,266
[SPEAKER_44]: Second.

3367
05:05:21,966 --> 05:05:22,706

[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, 7, the affirmative, 0, the negative.

3381
05:05:40,008 --> 05:05:42,229
[SPEAKER_47]: Meeting will be on the 24th, which is a Thursday.

3382
05:05:47,512 --> 05:05:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll plan to be Thursday.

3383
05:05:50,113 --> 05:05:51,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

3384
05:05:51,254 --> 05:05:52,414
[SPEAKER_47]: The earlier, the better for me.

3385
05:05:52,875 --> 05:05:53,215
[SPEAKER_47]: Thursday.

3386
05:05:53,275 --> 05:05:53,595
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

3387
05:05:56,877 --> 05:05:57,377

[SPEAKER_47]: Number one, new plaque to commensurate.

3389
05:05:59,658 --> 05:05:59,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

3390
05:06:00,418 --> 05:06:00,658
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3391
05:06:01,159 --> 05:06:02,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to withdraw this.

3392
05:06:02,619 --> 05:06:03,780
[SPEAKER_47]: Motion to withdraw.

3393
05:06:05,481 --> 05:06:05,801
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

3394
05:06:07,366 --> 05:06:08,046
[SPEAKER_47]: All those in favor?

3395
05:06:08,907 --> 05:06:09,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

3396
05:06:09,567 --> 05:06:09,668
Aye.

3397
05:06:11,749 --> 05:06:24,537
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm to be resolved that the regular school committee meetings be posted for its start time at 6.30 PM with the understanding that the actual meeting may begin any time thereafter if an executive session or committee of the whole meeting held prior to the meeting is elongated.

3398
05:06:25,298 --> 05:06:32,663
[SPEAKER_47]: Subcommittee meetings will be scheduled by the chairperson of the school committee at a time which is convenient for the subcommittee members and the administrative team.

3399
05:06:32,823 --> 05:06:35,485
[SPEAKER_47]: All meetings will be recorded and made accessible to the public.

3400
05:06:35,585 --> 05:06:37,266
[SPEAKER_47]: Offered by member Kretz and member van de Kloot.

3401
05:06:39,657 --> 05:06:41,077
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve?

3402
05:06:43,458 --> 05:06:44,278
[SPEAKER_33]: Motion to approve.

3403
05:06:44,398 --> 05:06:46,638
[SPEAKER_47]: Seconded by Member Van de Kloet.

3404
05:06:46,798 --> 05:06:47,238
[SPEAKER_47]: Roll call.

05:06:52,239 --> 05:06:52,819
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Graham.

3406
05:06:53,199 --> 05:06:53,439
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

3407
05:06:53,459 --> 05:06:55,680
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Kretz.

3408
05:06:56,160 --> 05:06:56,400
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3409
05:06:57,800 --> 05:06:58,820
[SPEAKER_46]: Member McLaughlin.

3410
05:07:00,301 --> 05:07:00,521
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

[SPEAKER_46]: Member McStone.

3412
05:07:02,101 --> 05:07:02,301
Yes.

3413
05:07:03,841 --> 05:07:04,561
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Rousseau.

3414
05:07:05,262 --> 05:07:05,482
[SPEAKER_46]: No.

3415
05:07:06,322 --> 05:07:07,122
[SPEAKER_46]: Member Van de Kloet.

3416
05:07:07,262 --> 05:07:07,462
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

3417
05:07:09,093 --> 05:07:09,914
[SPEAKER_46]: Mayor Longo-Karn.

3418
05:07:09,994 --> 05:07:13,256
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, four in the affirmative, three in the negative, motion passes.

3419
05:07:13,477 --> 05:07:33,173
[SPEAKER_47]: Number three, on February 3rd, 2020, this body unanimously voted to make Medford a hunger-free community, and in light of the pending federal legislation, the Universal Schools Meal Program Act of 2021, it is requested the administration plan for all school meals to be provided at no charge to students at the commencement of the fiscal, of the 2021 school year.

3420
05:07:34,634 --> 05:07:36,996
[SPEAKER_47]: Achieving our unanimously approved goal to make Medford

3421
05:07:37,489 --> 05:07:42,674
[SPEAKER_47]: hunger free requires action, regardless of whether the above pending legislation fails to become law.

3422
05:07:42,694 --> 05:07:51,501
[SPEAKER_47]: The request is that the administration offers all school meals at no cost to students and that all funding sources be considered, including ESSER grants.

3423
05:07:51,622 --> 05:07:58,788
[SPEAKER_47]: If ESSER grant funding cannot be utilized and there are no other sources of revenue, the administration will provide an update to the Memphis School Committee.

3424
05:07:59,471 --> 05:08:05,453
[SPEAKER_47]: at our first meeting in September on the projected financial impact to our budget, but the policy of free meals will be implemented nonetheless.

3425
05:08:05,773 --> 05:08:08,254
[SPEAKER_47]: Offered by Member Rousseau, Member McStone, Member Graham.

3426
05:08:09,495 --> 05:08:09,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

3427
05:08:10,215 --> 05:08:11,095
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Rousseau.

3428
05:08:11,395 --> 05:08:11,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3429
05:08:12,936 --> 05:08:20,759
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 34.2% of our students are categorized as economically disadvantaged.

3430
05:08:21,359 --> 05:08:23,079
[SPEAKER_05]: The real number is likely closer to 60%.

3431
05:08:25,157 --> 05:08:34,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts Law Reform Institute in their latest report estimates that 4,852 of our neighbors are eligible for SNAP benefits, but do not receive them.

3432
05:08:35,243 --> 05:08:43,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And nearly 26% of those individuals are food insecure children in our school system.

3433
05:08:44,808 --> 05:08:53,253
[SPEAKER_05]: To put this another way, nearly one in four of our school-age students qualify for free or reduced lunch, but do not receive those benefits.

3434
05:08:54,960 --> 05:08:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one in four on top of the 34% that are getting benefits.

3435
05:09:00,703 --> 05:09:08,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot stand on the false notion that there are ways to feed these children without impacting our bottom line or that Medford cannot afford to do this.

3436
05:09:08,428 --> 05:09:14,211
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford I know and love is not a community that is willing to pretend children are fed when we know that they are not.

3437
05:09:15,231 --> 05:09:21,455
[SPEAKER_05]: This resolution will move us towards meeting our unanimously approved proclamation from just last year.

3438
05:09:23,271 --> 05:09:30,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We as a school committee and as a community must meet this challenge with action and not just words, and I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

3439
05:09:32,637 --> 05:09:33,618
[SPEAKER_44]: Point of clarification?

3440
05:09:37,240 --> 05:09:39,581
[SPEAKER_44]: Does this include then both breakfast and lunch?

3441
05:09:40,302 --> 05:09:40,522
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes.

3442
05:09:41,283 --> 05:09:45,185
[SPEAKER_44]: And what is the approximate cost that we should anticipate?

3443
05:09:45,205 --> 05:09:46,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

3444
05:09:46,946 --> 05:09:49,468
[SPEAKER_47]: $2 a day, 4,000 kids a day, $1.5 million?

3445
05:09:54,807 --> 05:09:55,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

3446
05:09:55,587 --> 05:09:56,208
[SPEAKER_47]: Member Russell?

3447
05:09:56,788 --> 05:10:18,479
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have 34.2% of our students that are on free or reduced lunch, so whatever the costs that are already covered with that amount are being covered through the federal, I don't think it's the state, I think it's the federal government, so it is, it's not the full cost, because we already received a substantial amount of the cost.

3448
05:10:18,779 --> 05:10:23,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the cost is important, and that's part of the original motion that I actually asked for,

3449
05:10:25,466 --> 05:10:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: the administration to tell us what it's going to be.

3450
05:10:29,870 --> 05:10:36,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But what it's going to be is if it comes down to it, it's going to be decisions between potholes and feeding kids.

3451
05:10:36,316 --> 05:10:40,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really can't imagine that that's a conversation I think I want to lose.

3452
05:10:41,001 --> 05:10:44,624
[SPEAKER_44]: But is it so so Paul, obviously, this is a good.

3453
05:10:46,681 --> 05:10:47,942
[SPEAKER_44]: good thing that we want to do.

3454
05:10:48,742 --> 05:10:53,285
[SPEAKER_44]: I think it's incumbent on us to understand what the cost and impact will be.

3455
05:10:54,825 --> 05:10:55,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

3456
05:10:58,147 --> 05:11:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: As a person who was hungry my entire childhood, the cost is not relevant.

3457
05:11:05,831 --> 05:11:05,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

3458
05:11:05,991 --> 05:11:09,313
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the acceptable cost, Member Vander Kloot, to feeding kids?

3459
05:11:09,633 --> 05:11:12,895
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't think that's a fair question to Member Vander Kloot.

3460
05:11:14,316 --> 05:11:20,961
[SPEAKER_44]: So we have a, look, nobody wants to vote against this resolution.

3461
05:11:21,441 --> 05:11:22,062
[SPEAKER_44]: Nobody does.

3462
05:11:22,622 --> 05:11:27,546
[SPEAKER_44]: I certainly think it's in with my purview to ask a question about what is the financial impact.

3463
05:11:28,927 --> 05:11:29,788
[SPEAKER_44]: I need to know that.

3464
05:11:30,508 --> 05:11:31,769
[SPEAKER_44]: We need to know that.

3465
05:11:34,391 --> 05:11:40,676
[SPEAKER_44]: And so the question is if we're going to move on this, because we've done some other things in our budget, all things that we want to keep,

3466
05:11:42,681 --> 05:11:46,983
[SPEAKER_44]: You know, obviously, if there's ESSER funding for next year, that would be great.

3467
05:11:48,023 --> 05:11:52,425
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't know whether, you know, would this come under ESSER funding?

3468
05:11:53,985 --> 05:11:56,706
[SPEAKER_44]: May I ask Mr. Murphy if he would know the answer to that?

3469
05:12:01,928 --> 05:12:02,528
[SPEAKER_44]: You can say no.

3470
05:12:02,548 --> 05:12:09,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I will try to keep my answer brief, I promise.

3471
05:12:10,745 --> 05:12:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: There is separate guidance that's been issued by the state with respect to ESSER II and ESSER III.

3472
05:12:15,709 --> 05:12:18,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally speaking, it's very broad.

3473
05:12:19,132 --> 05:12:39,788
[SPEAKER_03]: The two potential challenges that I would anticipate based on how I understand the motion to read is that one, there is the sort of common thread across most of the categories within the ESSER II and ESSER III funding guidelines is some type of nexus between

3474
05:12:41,835 --> 05:12:46,097
[SPEAKER_03]: the pandemic that necessitated the funding and the investment that's being made.

3475
05:12:46,657 --> 05:12:54,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think the point could be made that our hunger challenges have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

3476
05:12:54,361 --> 05:12:55,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's definitely true.

3477
05:12:55,601 --> 05:13:05,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the challenge will be that the challenges certainly predated the pandemic, even if they brought them into sharper relief, and they will last in perpetuity beyond

3478
05:13:06,038 --> 05:13:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: the defined timeline of the ESSER funding.

3479
05:13:09,861 --> 05:13:28,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a world where we're not guaranteed and really have no basis to expect that level of supplemental funding going forward, it might be acceptable in the short term, but create the type of structural deficit that we typically associate with investing on the personnel side.

3480
05:13:29,719 --> 05:13:30,520
[SPEAKER_03]: The personnel side

3481
05:13:31,189 --> 05:13:35,534
[SPEAKER_03]: There are always ways to find efficiencies that can eventually make something sustainable.

3482
05:13:36,495 --> 05:13:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: In this instance, I think we would be looking to find efficiencies at a much more systemic level in order to truly assure sustainability.

3483
05:13:49,530 --> 05:13:58,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I'll say is I understand the motion to be that the administration has responsibility for looking at this, identifying the potential cost, and then communicating to the school committee what we found.

3484
05:13:59,195 --> 05:14:14,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Provided this is not a directive to use the ESSER funding, I really don't have any reservations about just similar to how we are looking at the transportation issue, trying to investigate this, scrutinize it, and then communicating back to the school committee what we found.

3485
05:14:15,764 --> 05:14:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be being disingenuous if I didn't add that I'm not

3486
05:14:18,626 --> 05:14:21,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm terribly optimistic about the idea of being able to go to 100%.

3487
05:14:22,168 --> 05:14:38,575
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, based on the guidance we have from the federal government, I don't think this is gonna be an issue, at least for the next school year, because I think we're gonna be in the same boat in terms of essentially having free lunch for the school year, and we just have to make sure that we're both boosting our participation at a rate where that revenue's coming in.

3488
05:14:39,615 --> 05:14:45,858
[SPEAKER_47]: And if I may, from the chair, I think that's the point that maybe this needs to be amended with,

3489
05:14:47,230 --> 05:14:52,753
[SPEAKER_47]: We make sure we have a broad communication plan so we capture anybody that may need free and reduced lunch.

3490
05:14:52,893 --> 05:14:55,154
[SPEAKER_47]: But for me, I have three children.

3491
05:14:55,194 --> 05:14:58,496
[SPEAKER_47]: If they ate school lunch every day, it'd be over $1,500.

3492
05:14:58,757 --> 05:15:09,483
[SPEAKER_47]: And those that can afford it, we should be paying it, because $1.5 million or whatever it might be to provide free lunch to those that can't afford it as well.

3493
05:15:09,503 --> 05:15:12,044
[SPEAKER_47]: We have to think about that.

3494
05:15:13,425 --> 05:15:13,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

3495
05:15:16,092 --> 05:15:19,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Wondering if the members might read our SnapGap report.

3496
05:15:20,794 --> 05:15:26,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like some of the questions suggest that we have not read the SnapGap report.

3497
05:15:27,058 --> 05:15:45,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if everybody's aware, the last four years, people who were immigrants, even people with green cards, have had the fear of deportation, even when they're here completely legally, the fear of deportation drilled into them by our former administration.

3498
05:15:47,959 --> 05:16:00,501
[SPEAKER_05]: one in four, 1,000 kids in our school system should qualify and they are not filling out the forms because appropriately they are terrified of being deported.

3499
05:16:01,761 --> 05:16:05,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Not legally, but they are absolutely terrified of it.

3500
05:16:06,002 --> 05:16:16,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And to think that we can like make the administration or the principals or the teachers push harder to get forms filled out is not a,

3501
05:16:17,185 --> 05:16:19,887
[SPEAKER_05]: rational response to the fear that they live with.

3502
05:16:22,089 --> 05:16:27,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that getting the forms filled out is absolutely important.

3503
05:16:28,614 --> 05:16:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually is a very important piece of information for DESE and for a whole host of other things that the Food Security Task Force has talked about.

3504
05:16:39,782 --> 05:16:41,783
[SPEAKER_05]: We use that data for a lot of other things.

3505
05:16:42,404 --> 05:16:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: We should continue to push to get that data and to get people to fill out these forms.

3506
05:16:47,022 --> 05:16:52,004
[SPEAKER_05]: but that is an unrelated activity in my mind to not having hungry kids at school.

3507
05:16:52,184 --> 05:16:56,867
[SPEAKER_05]: We all spent a lot of time on that proclamation just over a year ago.

3508
05:16:56,987 --> 05:17:02,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we think we were gonna have to do anything to get this to happen or did we make it so we felt good?

3509
05:17:03,970 --> 05:17:06,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no way to make Medford Hunger Free for free.

3510
05:17:07,992 --> 05:17:09,152
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't one of our choices.

3511
05:17:09,853 --> 05:17:12,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all knew that last February, right?

3512
05:17:12,854 --> 05:17:16,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we gonna spend the money to make Medford free or are we just gonna like,

3513
05:17:18,015 --> 05:17:21,778
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in the annals of the school committee's minutes.

3514
05:17:22,358 --> 05:17:26,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And 20 years from now, somebody will have a great idea to make Medford Hunger free.

3515
05:17:26,261 --> 05:17:27,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a new resolution.

3516
05:17:27,702 --> 05:17:40,131
[SPEAKER_47]: The city has been, if I may, the city has been dedicating resources through a number, especially CDBG monies to partner organizations like the Greater Boston Food Bank that does the Mystic Market.

3517
05:17:40,232 --> 05:17:47,577
[SPEAKER_47]: So we are taking steps that are realistic and we're able to afford and maintain for years to come.

3518
05:17:49,827 --> 05:17:50,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second?

3519
05:17:57,871 --> 05:17:58,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

3520
05:17:58,631 --> 05:18:00,852
[SPEAKER_44]: Yeah, did anybody say motion to approve?

3521
05:18:01,172 --> 05:18:01,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion to approve.

3522
05:18:02,353 --> 05:18:02,693
[SPEAKER_44]: Second.

3523
05:18:07,315 --> 05:18:14,878
[SPEAKER_47]: Is there an amendment to just get the funding to find out how much this would cost first?

3524
05:18:17,139 --> 05:18:18,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't accept that as a

3525
05:18:26,737 --> 05:18:33,622
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, I would like to get the funding to find out what the cost would be before I make the vote.

3526
05:18:33,822 --> 05:18:35,384
[SPEAKER_33]: Can we table this resolution?

3527
05:18:35,464 --> 05:18:36,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been seconded now, it can't be tabled.

3528
05:19:04,035 --> 05:19:04,635
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we put it?

3529
05:19:04,675 --> 05:19:06,556
[SPEAKER_48]: I mean, if it comes out of the yes or no section, then they're available.

3530
05:19:06,596 --> 05:19:10,439
[SPEAKER_38]: But we've got other things, too, that we want on the yes or nos.

3531
05:19:10,479 --> 05:19:13,501
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm just trying to figure out where they're available.

3532
05:19:13,581 --> 05:19:13,661
No.

3533
05:19:13,741 --> 05:19:21,726
[SPEAKER_48]: Obviously, we're going to want this, but we need to discuss it more before we can discuss it in the budget.

3534
05:19:22,386 --> 05:19:22,646
[SPEAKER_05]: May I?

3535
05:19:24,507 --> 05:19:26,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Roussell?

3536
05:19:26,949 --> 05:19:32,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The school meal program is not part of our budget, so it can't be in our budget.

3537
05:19:36,975 --> 05:19:42,179
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the weird and unfortunate problems about this program is we can't put it.

3538
05:19:42,340 --> 05:19:44,782
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a part of our budget, but we still have authority over it.

3539
05:19:45,002 --> 05:19:46,744
[SPEAKER_47]: We would need to put it in our budget.

3540
05:19:46,764 --> 05:19:51,108
[SPEAKER_47]: It needs to be somewhere in our budget to pay for everything.

3541
05:19:51,268 --> 05:19:51,968
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes.

3542
05:19:57,053 --> 05:20:00,136
[SPEAKER_47]: We need to know how much it will cost and how we're going to pay for it, correct?

3543
05:20:05,114 --> 05:20:06,255
[SPEAKER_61]: There's a motion and a second.

3544
05:20:08,097 --> 05:20:17,745
[SPEAKER_44]: So the question is, if we vote for this, it just says we're going to do it.

3545
05:20:17,926 --> 05:20:20,588
[SPEAKER_44]: And I'm asking, but what's the impact?

3546
05:20:25,720 --> 05:20:28,142
[SPEAKER_44]: I mean, I don't want to vote against this.

3547
05:20:28,202 --> 05:20:29,063
[SPEAKER_44]: It's the right thing to do.

3548
05:20:29,083 --> 05:20:35,288
[SPEAKER_44]: On the other hand, we do have some families who can afford it, but I understand what you're saying, Paul.

3549
05:20:35,348 --> 05:20:40,413
[SPEAKER_44]: So there's already three members listed here.

3550
05:20:40,493 --> 05:20:42,414
[SPEAKER_44]: So, you know, just call it.

3551
05:20:48,460 --> 05:20:52,143
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not used to voting on something which I don't understand how we're going to fund.

3552
05:20:59,238 --> 05:21:08,121
[SPEAKER_44]: So when we have that meeting next week on the 24th, which is a budget meeting, can we have a report back on this so we know how we're going to fund it?

3553
05:21:08,961 --> 05:21:20,125
[SPEAKER_44]: Because what I'm thinking is we've just shown that we're going to be $700,000 approximately, shorter of what we requested.

3554
05:21:20,645 --> 05:21:22,665
[SPEAKER_44]: And now this is potentially another, shall I say, $750,000.

3555
05:21:31,806 --> 05:21:38,191
[SPEAKER_47]: Mister Mister Gordon, please the microphone.

3556
05:21:38,211 --> 05:21:39,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3557
05:21:40,834 --> 05:21:52,003
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding from the federal guidance that releases that the the free lunch program that the term which is skipping at the moment is extended to the 2122 school year.

3558
05:21:54,031 --> 05:22:03,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I there's no basis that I can think of for we would bring before you a proposal which we would be using as for funding and FY 22.

3559
05:22:06,437 --> 05:22:09,218
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, on the school lunch program.

3560
05:22:10,919 --> 05:22:16,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely think that we can provide a cost estimate.

3561
05:22:16,902 --> 05:22:26,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the one, I think I heard someone throw the term out, $1.5 million, which if I'm recalling off the top of my head is about the year over year.

3562
05:22:28,683 --> 05:22:35,504
[SPEAKER_03]: total amount generated in the school lunch revolving account, which is the budget line that this would affect.

3563
05:22:36,185 --> 05:22:53,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, because of the significant decline in in-person attendance over the course of this year and the corresponding decline in participation, as you've heard me say in a number of budget updates over the last several months,

3564
05:22:53,683 --> 05:23:10,569
[SPEAKER_03]: the food services revolving account, which I believe is actually technically called the lunch program, even though it's covers more than that is what is essentially is responsible for the spending freeze that the district had to put in place in February, because we need to finish at a zero balance in the rubbing account.

3565
05:23:10,589 --> 05:23:12,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And currently, if you were to just look on the books,

3566
05:23:13,188 --> 05:23:15,730
[SPEAKER_03]: that's about a $750,000 deficit.

3567
05:23:16,151 --> 05:23:27,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cause for panic because our halting of spending has put us in a position where we're going to be able to bridge that and there's also a significant amount of revenue that's going to come in just a delayed reporting system.

3568
05:23:27,161 --> 05:23:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got several months of money that still has to come in.

3569
05:23:30,544 --> 05:23:34,588
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is also a place where it's hard to estimate with

3570
05:23:36,158 --> 05:23:47,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a reliable degree of accuracy exactly what the cost will be when we're removed from where so far removed from a regular participation cycle and knowing where we are.

3571
05:23:47,322 --> 05:23:59,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that we can, I wouldn't, I'd ask that we not have to do a report on this next week because I'd like to get more information and I'm not confident that we'll be able to provide you with the level of accuracy that you want.

3572
05:24:00,469 --> 05:24:12,975
[SPEAKER_03]: But I certainly think by the fall, we can report out about what would be the financial implications to Medford voluntarily going to a 100% free lunch program.

3573
05:24:13,315 --> 05:24:14,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's an appropriate report.

3574
05:24:14,856 --> 05:24:16,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it would be good to see the cost.

3575
05:24:17,219 --> 05:24:26,321
[SPEAKER_03]: My guess is it's north of 1.5 million because I think we want to also project out increased participation from what I understand about the historical participation rates.

3576
05:24:27,261 --> 05:24:28,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can do that.

3577
05:24:30,221 --> 05:24:33,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Just understand that there are a lot of variables involved, and I think we just need more time to do that.

3578
05:24:33,662 --> 05:24:43,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of where the federal government is saying the free lunch program will be throughout next school year, I don't anticipate any proposals with regard to the use of ESSER funding.

3579
05:24:44,704 --> 05:24:48,867
[SPEAKER_03]: next year, if the committee wants us to do that, I'd have to ask that you specifically vote for that.

3580
05:24:49,267 --> 05:24:58,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have an obligation to recommend against it based on what's available elsewhere and the number of priorities we will need to address using ESSER funding.

3581
05:24:59,714 --> 05:25:00,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

3582
05:25:00,615 --> 05:25:00,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

3583
05:25:02,556 --> 05:25:02,796
[SPEAKER_44]: Go ahead.

3584
05:25:05,918 --> 05:25:12,002
[SPEAKER_44]: So with that explanation, I think it's okay to pass this resolution.

3585
05:25:18,015 --> 05:25:20,737

3604
05:25:44,316 --> 05:25:46,037
[SPEAKER_47]: We'll just move approval looking for a

3605
05:25:47,188 --> 05:25:59,687
[SPEAKER_47]: update them sometime in the fall on the result of the air conditioning in the high school be assessed in a report cost analysis to fix it right to the school committee just from motion for approval there.

3606
05:26:00,669 --> 05:26:01,510
[SPEAKER_47]: Member mclaughlin.

3607
05:26:02,486 --> 05:26:02,886
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3608
05:26:02,906 --> 05:26:16,958
[SPEAKER_46]: I was just wondering about how we're, I want to ensure that we're addressing the heat issue around the ESY program that will be housed at the Medford High School over this summer.

3609
05:26:17,018 --> 05:26:21,442
[SPEAKER_46]: I realize that this resolution is not until the fall, but it does beg the question of how we're addressing

3610
05:26:22,102 --> 05:26:27,748
[SPEAKER_46]: for our most vulnerable students who will be in the high school over these hot summer months.

3611
05:26:30,291 --> 05:26:33,594
[SPEAKER_46]: They're staying cool during this ESY period.

3612
05:26:34,055 --> 05:26:37,138
[SPEAKER_46]: And I know Joan Bowen is still here.

3613
05:26:37,879 --> 05:26:39,581
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry, Joan, that you're still here.

3614
05:26:42,073 --> 05:26:46,716
[SPEAKER_21]: So there are a few classrooms that we are using that have air conditioner in them.

3615
05:26:46,817 --> 05:26:51,780
[SPEAKER_21]: So access programs that are housed at the high school, they have air conditioning.

3616
05:26:52,141 --> 05:26:56,124
[SPEAKER_21]: There are three other additional academic classrooms that we'll be using.

3617
05:26:56,464 --> 05:26:59,146
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the Roberts classrooms, they all have air conditioning.

3618
05:27:00,107 --> 05:27:00,487
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

3619
05:27:00,667 --> 05:27:01,067
[SPEAKER_46]: You're welcome.

3620
05:27:01,808 --> 05:27:02,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3621
05:27:04,210 --> 05:27:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

3622
05:27:05,189 --> 05:27:09,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we've all received the emails after the last couple of weeks.

3623
05:27:10,612 --> 05:27:13,733
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously it's not an argument about having air conditioning.

3624
05:27:14,293 --> 05:27:17,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I'm seeking some clarification on fix it.

3625
05:27:17,555 --> 05:27:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because much of the high school does not have air conditioning to be fixed.

3626
05:27:23,598 --> 05:27:26,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanna be clear, are you seeking- Fix the problem.

3627
05:27:27,500 --> 05:27:28,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Fix the problem.

3628
05:27:28,380 --> 05:27:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So you mean installation of air conditioning throughout the high school that doesn't have it?

3629
05:27:33,102 --> 05:27:34,103
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, just to break down on,

3630
05:27:34,983 --> 05:27:40,127
[SPEAKER_47]: where has it and how much it will cost to fix that that's broken and put it in where we need it.

3631
05:27:41,188 --> 05:27:58,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just suggest that that say that specifically because because we have previously talked in I think every year frankly about installing it in parts of the building that do not have it at all and usually John McLaughlin like has this look on his face like

3632
05:28:00,438 --> 05:28:01,519
[SPEAKER_05]: does Medford have all that?

3633
05:28:02,099 --> 05:28:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have that much money for the city to even afford that normally?

3634
05:28:06,702 --> 05:28:28,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanna make sure that the report is something you can get in a reasonable timeframe because I think if I remember correctly from buildings and grounds, insulation in the building that is a concrete structure, I mean, like that's not even been assessed, it's just assumed to be a massive investment beyond

3635
05:28:29,395 --> 05:28:35,961
[SPEAKER_05]: imagination, millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars to install air conditioning in a concrete structure like that.

3636
05:28:36,581 --> 05:28:42,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping we can, I can understand the scope of your resolution before we vote on it.

3637
05:28:42,366 --> 05:28:45,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, I mean, I agree in principle without any question.

3638
05:28:48,532 --> 05:28:55,658
[SPEAKER_47]: Yes, I think it would be a good report for the new vision committee we established in the fall as well.

3639
05:28:56,792 --> 05:28:59,775
[SPEAKER_47]: I can motion for approval as amended by Member Russo.

3640
05:28:59,795 --> 05:29:00,235
[SPEAKER_47]: Second.

3641
