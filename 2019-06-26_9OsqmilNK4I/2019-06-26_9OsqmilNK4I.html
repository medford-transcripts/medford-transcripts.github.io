    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=959.311s">I</a>  have actually two questions regarding this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=962.412s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=963.212s">on</a>  page three, towards the bottom, section six. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=967.235s">It</a>  says, any Method resident in attendance may be given permission to speak once at the school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=978.624s">It</a>  just makes it sound like a resident can only come to the mic and speak once throughout the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=984.889s">The</a>  wording of that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=986.33s">May</a>  I?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=987.631s">Yes,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=989.292s">So</a>  that is a reference only to the <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=992.605s">There's</a>  an item on the agenda and you want to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=994.709s">This</a>  isn't the regular community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=996.612s">You</a>  can come to each item if you want to speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1000.25s">five</a>  of the items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1002.492s">You'd</a>  be able to come up five times, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1004.514s">Great,</a>  just looking for clarification there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1006.596s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1007.036s">And</a>  my second question isn't on the next page, four out of 15, section eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1011.82s">Section</a>  eight, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1013.622s">Group</a>  committee members who wish to place items on the agenda will provide written notice to the chairperson by Monday noon prior to the scheduled meeting or at the discretion of the chairperson based on extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1027.717s">So</a>  I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1028.918s">Does</a>  a chairperson get to decline any item brought forward by a member to be put on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1035.56s">Because</a>  that happened to me last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1038.642s">I</a>  wanted an item added to the agenda and the chairperson executed their right not to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1045.805s">And</a>  I would like that addressed in this policy.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1048.606s">Mr.</a>  Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1049.386s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1049.927s">So</a>  this is actually, other than the date, this is current policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1055.871s">And</a>  because it also earlier states we're following Robert's rules newly revised, if that happens, and it's happened to me as well, then that can be at the next regularly scheduled meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1068.114s">Then</a>  a member can simply ask that it be put on the agenda anyways for the following meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1073.736s">And</a>  then if as long as four members say, yes, we want that on the agenda, then the chair loses the right to say no effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1082.018s">So</a>  the chair does have the right to not put it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1086.198s">but</a>  we can override at the next official meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1090.579s">So,</a>  I mean, that's sort of the way it's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1095.88s">I'm</a>  not sure we've ever done that.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1097.561s">I</a>  would like to see a change where the chairperson does not have the right to put a member's item on the agenda, only because as elected officials, we're here to voice for the community, and I think that a chairperson <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1114.349s">having</a>  that override really prevents you from doing your due diligence as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1121.972s">So</a>  I am requesting that that be added to this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1125.614s">If</a>  I may? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1126.975s">I</a>  mean, our charter says Robert's Rules newly revised, and that gives the chair that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1132.917s">I</a>  don't think we can do a policy that overrides the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1136.9s">That's,</a>  I mean, we can write anything we want here, but that doesn't mean it's enforceable, and that's sort of my issue.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1167.341s">We</a>  do have that if there is like a stated emergency that would require that that the chair refuses to recognize point of clarification But but you're not saying an item not on the agenda can be discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1178.206s">Well,</a>  in terms of an emergency situation, so we do have the authority via open meeting laws to discuss those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1185.531s">If</a>  the chair refuses to put that emergency item on the agenda, we can force that issue to be recognized under open meeting law as long as there's a super majority and we wouldn't violate any open meeting clause if it's an emergency situation.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1199.66s">I</a>  just think the word emergency <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1204.645s">I</a>  just can't foresee the chairperson not putting it on the agenda if there's an actual emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1208.847s">Nor</a>  could I. But we do have that authority as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1210.768s">The</a>  emergency can't be every person gets to decide what's an emergency, and that I'm a little concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1215.41s">Just</a>  because I think it's important and we need to talk about it doesn't make it an emergency.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1219.652s">A</a>  supermajority would have to agree that it is an emergency.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1223.66s">All</a>  right, well, I can just, I accept that that's the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1230.105s">I</a>  also feel like it's a little bit of censorship as a, that one person from our committee gets to decide whether or not something is discussed on any given week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1243.394s">So,</a>  I object to that, but I'm happy with moving forward with this at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1250.7s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1251.3s">So</a>  is there a motion to accept the report?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1253.281s">Yes,</a>  I make a motion to accept the report.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1255.161s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1256.281s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1257.221s">Mr.</a>  Ochoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1257.822s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1259.122s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1260.122s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1263.383s">And</a>  is there anybody here for community participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1267.844s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1268.284s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1270.524s">Okay,</a>  so report from superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1274.253s">As</a>  you are aware, Medford Public Schools ended classes on Thursday, June 13th.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1293.283s">On</a>  Monday, June 17th, my team and I engaged in a three-day retreat with all school administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1300.167s">The</a>  interactive retreat continued until Wednesday, June 19th, and was held at the Bistro 489. <a

mentorship of new educators, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1318.158s">events</a>  scheduling across the district, after school programming and space, technology updates in the district, and mobile communication apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1327.372s">Medford</a>  High School assistant principal, Gail Trainor, was presented with the newly inaugurated Mustang Administrator Unsung Hero Award for her outstanding work, not only as an assistant principal, but also for her work as coordinator for the Credit for Life Financial Literacy Fair, and her meticulous planning and organization of the recent Medford High School, Medford Vocational School graduation ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1356.417s">We</a>  were excited that our incoming assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing, also joined us during the retreat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1365.465s">Administrators</a>  will continue their work over the summer, the work that was started at the retreat, in preparation for the new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1373.012s">And</a>  we will have a opening of school administrative meeting in August for all administrators, again, for us to work and plan for the school year that's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1383.321s">Medford</a>  Public Schools is going to be quite busy over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1386.442s">Summer</a>  school began today, as well as our annual summer fun day camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1392.043s">Some</a>  of Medford's recreation programs are being held in the district, as well as special education and EL summer programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1399.544s">The</a>  vocational side of the house hosted their CTE camp for middle schoolers last week, and over 40 students participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1407.646s">Many</a>  athletic camps are also being hosted by the Medford High School basketball, volleyball, and soccer programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1415.871s">Mustang</a>  Girls softball team had a good run in the MIAA softball playoffs, earning a bye in the first round, beating the Woburn Tanners in the second round, and unfortunately, losing to Central Catholic in the third round. <a

the girls on a fantastic season. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1440.211s">Additionally,</a>  Coach Dempsey notified me that Captain Brenna Forbes will be named to both the Boston Globe and

was disqualified for stepping out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1484.346s">Had</a>  he stayed in bounds, he would have finished 18th in the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1488.288s">We</a>  still applaud him for a fantastic year and look forward to his senior year in the fall. <a

visitors and guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1527.644s">The</a>  students, Eric Brown, Matthew Harris, and Sarah Braverman, attended with their teacher, Eric Prylison, and were excited to be able to discuss their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1539.151s">Mr.</a>  Prylison connected with the museum last year, and the museum decided to partner with the Andrews in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1547.299s">Some</a>  of you were able to join with us as Medford High School's Gay-Straight Alliance, GSA, dedicated the pride flag along with a

school in the school library about every other week, alternating between the two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1605.296s">All</a>  middle school students were invited to sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1608.018s">The</a>  workshops provided a nice bridge between books and hands-on learning and had students see the library as a place for active learning and critical thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1618.024s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools would like to thank the Medford Public Library, the Medford Arts Council, and the Massachusetts

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2008.376s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2009.958s">We've</a>  been fortunate to have Dr. Randy Schuster here twice at our school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2015.464s">First</a>  to present some up-to-date information about <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2018.551s">adolescent</a>  marijuana use, as well as the impact on the developing brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2023.415s">And</a>  second, to provide information about the research study that she's conducting on marijuana abstinence. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2029.579s">Dr.</a>  Schuster has partnered with several Massachusetts school districts, and her data is demonstrating many positive outcomes from marijuana abstinence. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2041.232s">As</a>  a district, we've used the SBIRT model to open conversations about substance use, to identify students who are engaging in risky behaviors, provide education and support, and make appropriate referrals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2053.083s">And</a>  Dr. Schuster's study will expand upon this support and assist Councilors, nurses, and parents in providing assistance to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2063.564s">We</a>  plan to use SBIRT screening as the model, which mandates that we ask students about their marijuana use. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2070.609s">A</a>  brief voluntary survey will be conducted with all high school students to determine who would be interested in participating in the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2080.137s">At</a>  that time, enrollment in the study will require student and parent consent through the Mass General Hospital Institutional Review Board process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2090.546s">Confidentiality</a>  will be maintained throughout the duration of the study unless the interviewer deems that the student is harmful to himself or others. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2100.434s">So</a>  it's my recommendation and supported by the high school administrative staff that we approve Dr. Schuster's study at Medford High School beginning the fall of 2019.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2109.701s">I</a>  make a motion to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2111.803s">I</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2112.223s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2112.764s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for acceptance of this and a second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2116.687s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2117.027s">Mr.</a>  Russo has a question.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2118.328s">Yes,</a>  so I know when this was presented, we were considering going to middle school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2124.25s">I'm</a>  curious why we're not including middle schoolers.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2127.471s">Dr.</a>  Seuss, I think I'll have to defer to you on that one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2133.18s">The</a>  short answer is I will go wherever you say it's OK for me to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2138.744s">I</a>  spoke with one of the principals on the way out today, and he said the doors were open. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2143.628s">We</a>  have the staff to work in middle schools and high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2148.611s">We</a>  are going to be in multiple middle schools across the state in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2158.138s">It</a>  is my belief that the younger we can start this conversation, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2164.261s">So</a>  I would be wholeheartedly in favor of rolling out in both middle schools and high schools, in the middle schools and the high school in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2174.425s">But</a>  if it's the preference of the committee to start in year one in the high school and then reevaluate in year two, I'm open to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2183.248s">But</a>  as I said in the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2185.269s">Shall</a>  I just make an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2188.086s">Actually,</a>  I just first want to ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2189.408s">Ray</a>  if she has any reservations or any reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2192.813s">Okay,</a>  well then I would like to amend this to include the middle school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2196.755s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2197.575s">Motion</a>  to amend as seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2200.576s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2202.237s">On</a>  the main motion as amended, Mr. Ruggiero.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2204.478s">Two</a>  questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2205.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2206.278s">The</a>  first question I have was your mix of the opt-in versus the opt-out model that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2212.461s">So</a>  the original screening, students are just going to have the survey if they want to fill it out or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2217.663s">Is</a>  that an option? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2218.943s">But</a>  if they get included in the study, it requires both consent of the student and the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2223.467s">Is</a>  that still the model that we're using?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2224.809s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2225.429s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2226.85s">And</a>  the second question I had is, you mentioned before that it would be possible to include other questions, a couple of other questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2234.518s">It</a>  would be great if we could have a question also on vaping and a question on maybe activity levels, including like diabetes and like sugary drink consumption.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2243.846s">So</a>  our survey, as it stands right now, and I believe it was in some of the materials that I gave you a few weeks ago, we have a lot of questions on vaping in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2252.052s">I</a>  think that's something that we really need to be thinking about in tandem with marijuana use. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2255.895s">So</a>  we are capturing that extensively at a school-wide level. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2259.258s">And</a>  I'm happy to add an additional question about activity level.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2262.0s">Yeah,</a>  it would be nice if we could have a question about sugary drink consumption as well, because that is a really rising health cost, as you noted.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2268.765s">Yep,</a>  and that is information that we collect at detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2273.177s">when</a>  students are enrolled in the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2275.498s">So</a>  that's certainly information that already I know that we can deliver back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2280.0s">But</a>  the screener, the school-wide screener is certainly amenable.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2284.122s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know if this requires an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2286.703s">And</a>  I also don't want to jeopardize the scientific value by including every single question under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2291.905s">But</a>  if it doesn't actually jeopardize the scientific value of your study, I would prefer questions about obesity and sugary drink consumption and activity levels to also be included <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2302.077s">Perhaps</a>  Ms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2302.457s">Ray</a>  could work on them.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2304.098s">We</a>  can definitely work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2305.74s">I</a>  think we'd have to discuss how that would link together in terms of this study and whether it's, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2313.304s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2313.925s">But</a>  I don't want to invalidate any work that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.487s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.927s">That's</a>  the most important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2317.687s">I</a>  mean, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2318.448s">I</a>  don't want you to jeopardize the scientific value of what you're doing by expanding out the scope.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2323.091s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2323.931s">And</a>  what I can say is I'm certainly open to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2326.473s">I</a>  don't think it would jeopardize the scientific scope of the study whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2330.073s">The</a>  potential rate-limiting step on my part will be the MGH and Harvard Medical School IRB. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2337.337s">They</a>  need to see that all questions are directly related to the scientific goals of the study, and they don't want us taking advantage of that opt-out process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2345.56s">So</a>  barring that they say no to that, I'm perfectly open to it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2349.662s">I</a>  mean, I don't think this requires an amendment, but if you could look into that for us, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2354.004s">May</a>  I just ask the question, though? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2355.305s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2356.165s">What</a>  would you see as the link <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2358.918s">between</a>  those questions and this study?</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2361.201s">Well,</a>  I would imagine, I mean, I'm speculating, I don't have the scientific data in front of me, but I would imagine that children that tend to be less active and also have a poorer dietary environment <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2373.596s">also</a>  have a higher likelihood to use marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2376.318s">I</a>  don't know if I have any evidence of that, but it would seem at least sort of, you know, you imagine sort of the person smoking pot, watching TV, eating Doritos. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2385.326s">I</a>  mean, that could be a cliche, or perhaps there's some scientific truth to that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2388.849s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2389.129s">So</a>  one of the things that we're collecting that you'll be interested in that is a <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2394.453s">important</a>  outcome of the part of the project where we require parental consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2400.498s">So</a>  once they actually enroll in the study, as we look at when an adolescent stops using marijuana, what happens to their activity level, and <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2410.745s">So</a>  those are things that we're directly linking to changes in marijuana use and can certainly look into adding in at the school level.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2416.789s">Yeah,</a>  the reason why I mention it is I've had a couple of parents now talk to me about, you know, their child was involved in middle school sports and they were very athletic and then the vaping and the drug use came into their lives and all of that stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2431.118s">So,</a>  I mean, I would be curious to see whether that correlation actually is valid or if it's just sort of like word on the street what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2439.509s">Thank</a>  you, Doctor.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2440.469s">There</a>  is a motion on the floor to approve Dr. Randy Schuster's marijuana abstinence study at Medford High School and Medford Middle Schools for the 19-20 year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2451.271s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2452.111s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2547.307s">I'd</a>  like to start by saying I don't always deliver bad news with this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2552.908s">The</a>  last meeting of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2555.829s">So,</a>  again, thanks to this committee and some crunch time research. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2563.45s">The</a>  Food Service Department, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2564.77s">Jewel</a>  Bradley, and myself and other entities worked very diligently to pull together information to look at the feasibility and possibility of Provision 2, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2575.672s">free</a>  breakfast for all schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2578.073s">Currently,</a>  breakfast is being served at three mandated breakfast sites, which are the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2587.696s">Utilizing</a>  the guidelines from the Food Research and Action Center, FRAC, communications with state departments, and engaging with outside resources in a short time frame, we were able to offer the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2600.171s">We</a>  reached out to the Massachusetts School Nutrition Association Board and their member, Mr. Robert Shaheen, and conducted a site visit for the purpose of identifying streamlined breakfast delivery methods that would encourage participation for breakfast at all locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2615.605s">Mr.</a>  Shaheen has been in school food service many years, and he is an advocate for school meals at the Beacon Hill and Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2623.432s">serving</a>  on many boards within his SNA role. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2627.315s">Mr.</a>  Shaheen observed the breakfast program at the Roberts, and he offered ideas, potential costs, and recommended food items that could assist Medford in considering a free breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2637.381s">Upon</a>  his visit, he complimented the kitchen on its cleanliness and based his assessment at the end of his visit by suggesting a pilot program to confirm if free breakfast could pay for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2649.974s">The</a>  conference call on June 20th was also conducted with Education Specialist at the Department of Ed, Kevin Dawson, along with myself and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2657.737s">Jewel</a>  Bradley. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2658.957s">He</a>  indicated that the program is a four-year commitment, with year one being the base year to determine participation levels district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2666.86s">The</a>  enrollment can be included <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2670.026s">as</a>  part of the annual food service application and the process through the DESE portal is very simplistic in regard to accessing this Provision 2 breakfast for all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2681.05s">Mr.</a>  Dawson also stated that the best option would be to conduct a short-term pilot program to determine if participation levels were there to keep the program running. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2690.394s">And</a>  if costs were excessive and or participation rates did not justify the expenses, that we could opt out with the notification to the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2699.298s">Further</a>  calculation scenarios were explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2701.84s">However,</a>  there are so many variables with food costs, labor rates to address a large-scale breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2708.045s">Honing</a>  in on that profit and loss scenario was very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2712.089s">So</a>  the expected level of staffing at each building that's not currently serving the mandated breakfast would be two to three more daily food service members in the morning to prepare and serve the meals at roughly $600 per week per building just for the labor costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2727.625s">But</a>  given our enthusiasm to feed the children of Medford and with the recommendation of experts in the field, partnership with Jewel Bradley, our food service director, I offer the following recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2737.993s">That</a>  we adopt provision two under a full-scale free breakfast pilot program during the first quarter of the school year, the months of September, October, November of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2746.279s">And</a>  upon the third month, we review the participation reimbursement expense levels to conclude if the program is viable to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2755.826s">report</a>  will be provided at the first school committee in December of 2019 and if this was your vote we would do a full-scale Advertisement informing all of the families in Medford that come day one of the new school year All students would be able to have free breakfast hot and cold options at every school building Mr. Benedetto, then Mr. Russo, then Mr. Legere</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2781.663s">Thank</a>  you for your work on this is this the same program as breakfast after the bell or is that a different program?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2787.849s">So</a>  breakfast is breakfast So there are many different ways to deliver breakfast and again all breakfast has been being served in all of our school buildings this is just a mechanism to provide more participation and say I <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2803.503s">It's</a>  free under provision two. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2806.224s">So</a>  the district is committing to free breakfast for all, which in turn is hopeful that all the students would take advantage of that and participate in a free breakfast knowing that sometimes it's a busy schedule in the morning, sometimes children don't have a hot breakfast meal, and it is the most important meal of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2825.472s">And</a>  if we can provide that in a provision two free category, we would be serving so many families.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2831.815s">Do</a>  we look into the Breakfast After the Bell and the grant opportunity of $10,000 per school that signs up for the Breakfast After the Bell program?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2840.342s">So</a>  that's a different component that's not part of this, and that's something specific.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2844.745s">I</a>  know, I'm asking if you looked at both programs and made an informed decision between the two.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2849.208s">We</a>  wouldn't be able to participate if we waited for that grant opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2853.512s">So</a>  this is an option to be able to utilize and run a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2859.628s">without</a>  having to wait and really see what that would entail. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2863.07s">So</a>  a $10,000 investment may not be enough and that's what we will really find out by running this pilot program for the first three months, which are usually the most active months of a school year.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2874.476s">No,</a>  I'm happy that you're presenting us with an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2877.658s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that we were taking <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2880.699s">Every</a>  opportunity given to us when a private group approached a committee member with an opportunity to write the grants for us, for us to receive $10,000 per school to do a startup. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2893.384s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure we looked at that as well as this program and picked the right program that we can sustain long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2900.047s">And</a>  if we're just picking one and not looking at all options, I want to make sure that all students are fed for indefinitely, not just a pilot program.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2910.071s">So</a>  this is really a public item. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2913.312s">We're</a>  not engaging private sectors for this particular.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2917.094s">It's</a>  a non-profit programming that helps many school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide at no cost to them, and they don't gain anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2929.978s">It's</a>  a public service that they provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2933.119s">And</a>  they do it in the most needy of areas throughout the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2938.222s">And</a>  they graciously offered to help MedFed write the grant, actually write them for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2945.466s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that we're looking at every option available to us so that we have the correct program that we can sustain throughout the whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2954.554s">The</a>  future of Medford Public Schools, I just want to feed hungry kids, but I want to do it in a way that it doesn't have to stop in December because it's costing us too much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2963.738s">I</a>  just want to make sure we do our due diligence and do it once, do it right, and make sure we did our homework.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2971.582s">$10,000</a>  would be the start-up cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2977.947s">Could</a>  I make a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2980.208s">Mr.</a>  Russo's next.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2982.548s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2983.409s">It's</a>  nice that you're not delivering bad news or that we have to argue about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2989.19s">I</a>  would just like to make a, well, let me back up a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2997.893s">So</a>  I think that the committee should have to vote for the opt out to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3003.474s">It</a>  should not be an administrative decision.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3006.596s">It</a>  really needs to be programmatic, because the food service program has to be in the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3012.218s">It</a>  cannot operate in a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3015.279s">That's</a>  by not only state law, but that's federal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3018.22s">We</a>  will lose our funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3019.74s">So</a>  we cannot just function in a deficit in that regard.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3024.322s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3025.002s">I</a>  can accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3026.802s">But</a>  the McGlynn Elementary has about a 22% participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3030.684s">They</a>  have free breakfast now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3032.504s">And</a>  the Columbus has a 93% participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3035.425s">And</a>  it's my understanding of revision to the name of the game here is participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3041.43s">And</a>  the only reason that there's a 71% difference in participation is because at Columbus it's after the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3048.376s">So</a>  I'm not really even comfortable wasting three months of time if we're not making it after the bell at the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3054.3s">Because</a>  there's no reason to believe that the McGlynn students are suddenly going to start eating when they've been able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3063.067s">So</a>  I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3065.785s">I</a>  know it's a lot of work to go to After the Bell breakfast, but we're not doing this just to feel good like we checked a box.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3076.005s">No,</a>  and the plan with food service is that this would be a full on real process to encourage students to come in and eat a hot breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3089.593s">So</a>  that's the real push. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3091.154s">We</a>  are going to make it, because again, the numbers aren't there to warrant additional staffing, there isn't additional staffing at some of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3099.799s">So</a>  if we commit to doing a full breakfast, a full hot meal, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3105.962s">additional</a>  options and really roll out the red carpet, if you will, on the breakfast program and get that excitement from day one, that's our hope that we would gather that participation level in a new scope and a new scale that hasn't been done so before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3125.733s">And</a>  really, again, reach out to the parents in early communications throughout the summer indicating your child will eat free. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3133.226s">beginning</a>  the first day of school under this provision, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3136.287s">And</a>  in terms of after the bill, that is a much more challenging program to implement because we're talking about schedules, we're talking about classroom areas and getting the particulars in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3152.054s">Obviously,</a>  the Columbus has been doing it for many, many years, so their building is <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3160.812s">Working</a>  seamlessly.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3162.153s">But</a>  if I may, free breakfast that requires that you're actually there before school starts, which is what we're talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3172.157s">I</a>  mean, you can go to any elementary school and watch the kids being dropped off one minute before the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3178.419s">Not</a>  two kids, dozens of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3182.141s">And</a>  also, what about when the bus just shows up just at the last minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3186.643s">None</a>  of these scenarios will enable a kid to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3191.229s">if</a>  they're not after the bell.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3194.252s">I</a>  think the partnership would have to be with principals, that if a bus is late, that they would offer 5 minutes, 5-10 minutes additional for students to go through the line in a breakfast format, just like they do for additional lunch time if there was something that occurred during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3208.785s">They</a>  offer additional bell service to account and adjust for <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3214.324s">something</a>  that might take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3216.004s">If</a>  there's an extended fire drill or something of sorts during the day that cuts into their lunchtime, they are given additional time through the principal's scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3225.687s">So,</a>  that would be the hope that we would be communicating with principals and be able to put that in place before the start of school this coming fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3236.569s">But</a>  it's not just the elementary so again like I think that that's important to recognize that the high schoolers are not Eating a breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3243.953s">So</a>  this is a big push to get high schoolers to eat a meal and I we know for certain that high schoolers are here well before the bell and and have that opportunity to <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3255.818s">you</a>  know, not only is it a socializing event, but if they can go get a free meal and they know it's a hot meal, and they like what they're eating, the whole hope is that they will come in and be encouraged to eat that breakfast meal every day.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3268.883s">So</a>  I just have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3271.444s">So</a>  if we, at the end of the three months, opt out because it is fiscally totally impossible, does this opt out prevent us from next year saying we're going to do after the ballot and we're going to try again? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3284.744s">We</a>  can do it all over again next year if it doesn't work.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3287.145s">That's</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3287.765s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3290.467s">Mr.</a>  Aguero.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3291.527s">So</a>  thank you very much for rushing out this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3294.228s">I</a>  know that we all asked you to expedite it and with all the other budgetary work that you had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3299.951s">I</a>  really appreciate it because as I mentioned before as a former educator, I know what it's like when kids show up hungry and I've seen the effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3307.834s">I've</a>  taught at both kinds of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3309.795s">But</a>  I do share Member Ruseau's reservations about not doing an after the bell program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3316.922s">When</a>  kids have the opportunity, if mom and dad are running late, that kid doesn't eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3321.966s">And</a>  one of the issues that we talked about at the superintendent review was making sure we have a consistent program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3328.292s">throughout</a>  the entire system. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3330.295s">I</a>  guess the way I feel about it is that, you know, if you're a child in poverty, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Columbus or the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3336.662s">I</a>  just want to make sure that kid's fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3338.544s">So</a>  I would like to suggest under this pilot, since we're running a pilot, I would like to have a consistent after the bail program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3346.692s">That</a>  would be what we test, not sort of we try this, we try this, we try this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3350.694s">I</a>  want to see what happens when the entire district has an after the bell program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3355.137s">And</a>  if we have something like 90% participation, then we would know that we have an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3361.286s">seeking</a>  a second on that or has anyone else had a motion?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3367.172s">So</a>  we have time and learning that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3369.754s">This</a>  is mandated by federal and state law that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3374.199s">With</a>  the Columbus Elementary School, they have been doing this for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3378.126s">And</a>  I'm the first one to say I want every child to have breakfast.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3381.207s">I</a>  really do.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3383.147s">There</a>  was a point in time that we had a huge rodent problem at the McGlynn Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3390.249s">And</a>  Michael, I don't even know if you were on the school committee at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3395.011s">It</a>  cost us thousands and thousands of dollars to replace the books and the materials that the teachers lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3401.992s">The</a>  time and learning that was lost with the kids having to go to the auditorium because they couldn't be in their rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3408.228s">So</a>  it wasn't that the McGlynn Elementary School didn't want the kids to have breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3413.131s">It</a>  was a rodent problem that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3416.273s">I</a>  think we need buy-in from our principals as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3418.754s">I</a>  think we need to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3420.215s">I</a>  think every principal wants their child to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3423.317s">And</a>  if you have them come in, whether it's before or after the bell, then I think that as long as the kids have the opportunity, I think we should move forward with what Christine is suggesting.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3433.023s">Okay,</a>  there's a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3437.496s">I</a>  guess it comes to a question of what we are capable as a community.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3455.581s">And</a>  I believe, and I understand, it's like one more thing that member Ruggiero has thrown at the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3462.166s">But</a>  on this particular issue, I do believe it has a significant impact on educational standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3468.531s">And</a>  it will be seen throughout the entire school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3471.013s">So</a>  I would, if none of my, no one wishes to second this motion, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3474.816s">But</a>  I would like to make a motion that we do a universal after the bell program for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3481.341s">That's</a>  the one we pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3482.382s">And</a>  if it doesn't work, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3483.783s">If</a>  we can't get it to work by November, then we can regroup and say, you know, it just didn't happen at the McGlynn because of rodents.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3490.367s">So</a>  if I can offer some feedback from the food service side. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3494.59s">As</a>  much as that would be ideal in all the greater scheme. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3501.65s">In</a>  the context of being able to do a pilot program, again, a pilot program is something you try for a brief amount of time and you put everything into it that you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3512.018s">Our</a>  food service department is not prepared to do an after the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3517.182s">There's</a>  different components. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3518.563s">There</a>  are travel items that are needed to carry the breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3523.106s">It's</a>  not a hot meal necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3525.988s">It's</a>  varying items of what can be provided in an after the bell scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3531.292s">We</a>  are trying to do a full-scale, broad-based breakfast program, really having hot meal options, really having additional components for all of the different fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh milk and cereal that's part of the daily components anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3551.247s">but</a>  in order to do that we also have to train our food service folks at these various buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3555.733s">Now</a>  they're used to and understand the meaning of morning prep and delivery of a meal and clean up from that to prepare for the lunch service. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3565.625s">In</a>  terms of a <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3567.427s">model</a>  that is breakfast after the bell, that's a significant different model that would require more training. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3575.993s">And</a>  now that the school is out, we won't have any opportunity to engage with our food service staff in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3582.877s">So</a>  this was the hope, to be able to pilot a program that would really engage and get the interest of not only our food service department, whose main <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3595.805s">goal</a>  is to feed the children of Medford, but also to really offer varying items for the breakfast menu selection to engage the students and get their own buy-in for breakfast and why they would want to come to school and eat breakfast.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3613.956s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3615.016s">Yes,</a>  so I guess <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3622.921s">My</a>  issue is with a pilot, and I understand the need to stay in the black, but the idea that one day we're serving all of the kids free breakfast, and then the next day, which I realize will happen over a break, but the next day kids will come to school who will not have heard that starting on January 3rd or whatever, you no longer get breakfast for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3645.066s">That</a>  doesn't even sound like something that we could <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3647.532s">implement</a>  short of doing exactly the lunch shaming policy that we adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3653.534s">No,</a>  you can't have that, because you don't have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3655.434s">I</a>  mean, so I just worry that doing a pilot, I get it, why we want to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3662.576s">But</a>  if there's a chance that we would actually turn it off, I can't wrap my head around that, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3672.219s">So</a>  I really do think the committee should have to approve turning it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3677.379s">And</a>  if you come to us and say we need to turn it off because we're running a deficit of $10,000 a week or whatever, I think the committee should be the folks to say we can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3691.424s">We</a>  aren't going to make up the money from somewhere else or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3694.385s">I</a>  just don't think it should be an administrative decision that suddenly kids that were getting free breakfast and we're going to advertise the heck out of it so everybody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3704.181s">And</a>  then suddenly they come to school and they don't get free breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3707.062s">That's</a>  just, you know, I grew up without breakfast every single day in my childhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3712.403s">And</a>  the entire idea of that, I mean, I can't even imagine what that would be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3718.724s">And</a>  sure, many kids are going to eat free breakfast, have breakfast at home too, but not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3724.246s">So</a>  I'm not okay with approving this if we don't approve the termination of the</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3730.962s">So</a>  in this proposal, there was no indication that it was an administrative review, and that's why I specified you would be presented with the findings in early December. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3740.108s">So</a>  it would be a vote of the committee, but I would hope that there would be recognition if there's the levels that don't speak to continuing a program.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3752.623s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3754.869s">I</a>  believe that there's someone in the community that would like to speak on this issue.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin 2]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3763.667s">Hi,</a>  I'm Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3767.39s">As</a>  a community member, that was the first time that I heard the statistic that you mentioned, Paul, around the Columbus school program getting, what did you say, 70% participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3776.476s">93%</a>  and the McGlynn was 22? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3777.177s">I</a>  believe it's 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3783.671s">And</a>  so as we're thinking, and that was just, I gasped out loud because I was really shocked by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3788.715s">And</a>  also as a child who went hungry as a little girl as well, I really empathize with that in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3794.76s">And</a>  as we're thinking about equity in our district, I really want us to think about why that is happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3800.384s">So</a>  why is the Columbus Elementary School having 90-something percent participation and the McGlynn is having whatever percent, 22% participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3808.35s">And</a>  how are we feeding all of Medford students? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3810.591s">And</a>  I know that it's not an easy answer and I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3813.151s">You</a>  know, Christine's done a lot of work, and you folks have done a lot of work as well, but there's got to be some kind of a compromise around making sure that all of our children are being fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3820.994s">And</a>  in a way that, you know, whether it's after the bell or before the bell or however it is, but we have to increase that participation at all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3827.556s">And</a>  also, I didn't know about the rodent issue at the McGlynn's, which is really concerning, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3834.438s">So</a>  how do we embrace all of our elementary schools to make sure that all of our children are fed? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3838.28s">Because</a>  as we all know, you can't concentrate on your school <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3841.781s">if</a>  you're not fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3843.022s">And</a>  so I just wanted to put that forward as a community member.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3846.063s">Thank</a>  you several years ago, it doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3848.905s">Um,</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3857.629s">So,</a>  I would think that it seems to me that there is a leap of faith here, to some extent, by going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3866.679s">Because</a>  we have the statistics between two of our schools, and someone answered about a bus being late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3874.668s">Well,</a>  I'm sure hoping that the principal who's meeting that bus that is late is the caring individual who we know that they are and who will usher that it's not a, you know, all of a sudden breakfast is going to close and the door is closed and there's no chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3891.176s">When</a>  I was a guidance Councilor over in Everett, there was a child who consistently came late to school and we knew had no food. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3901.101s">And</a>  I want to tell you, we always managed to get that child food by going down to the kitchen, by getting help, and we had no breakfast program at that time set up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3910.326s">But</a>  there are caring individuals in our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3913.127s">I</a>  am sure that there are other people in our buildings who want to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3917.549s">And</a>  I'm betting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3919.15s">So</a>  I'm going to bet on that and vote for approval of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3923.332s">And</a>  then see, we might have kinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3926.013s">We</a>  might have to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3927.454s">We</a>  might have to revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3928.995s">But</a>  I'm at least willing to try it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3930.676s">So</a>  that's where I'll come down tonight.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3932.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3934.124s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3935.205s">There</a>  is a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3936.946s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3937.146s">Mostow,</a>  did you want to speak?</p>
