Yep.

00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:04,175
Here it is.

5
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,935

[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

20
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a motion to approve.

21
00:07:59,237 --> 00:07:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

22
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:01,398

29
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:12,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a question?

30
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:13,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

31
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:13,983
[SPEAKER_12]: A question?

32
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Mr. Benedetto.

33
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

34
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:16,884
[SPEAKER_02]: As usual.

35
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:22,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So, on page 2 of 15.

36
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,101
[SPEAKER_02]: About almost halfway down, Erzner, first name Eric, $107.82.

37
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:36,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It says pending classification.

38
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:40,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is a special fund program.

39
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:48,125
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is not a classification for that particular fund, but it is for school-wide expenditures.

40
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:53,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I can get you what specifically was reimbursed for that particular item.

41
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,166
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

42
00:08:56,127 --> 00:09:07,889
[SPEAKER_14]: In my next question that was actually I'm sorry that that was for Eric Eisen that was reimbursement for the ethics bowl that he had chaperoned Okay on a particular funding

43
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:14,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just don't usually see that pending classification notice.

44
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,580
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the next one is on page 8 of 15.

45
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:25,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be the second grouping of second packet.

46
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It says legal services for $3,000 more than halfway down.

00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Judith Impatori?

00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's under the IDEA grant.

49
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:53,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And we couldn't use in-house legal services?

50
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's specific for special education.

51
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:55,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

52
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:02,976

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

78
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a Special Education Subcommittee meeting on May 28 of 2019.

79
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:03,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked further about the two issues, two items that we have been working on throughout the school year.

80
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,646
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is disability awareness program.

81
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second is out of school time programming for all students.

82
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:33,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in it, we had many people in attendance, committee members, Paulette Vander Kloot, Paul Rousseau, we had the CPAC coordinators, co-chairs rather, and we talked a little bit about the new PD program that was given to district teachers where disability awareness was infused with the existing curriculum.

83
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:39,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And Teachers Wrote Inclusive Curriculum in an Impactful Presentation was given by Melanie McLaughlin.

84
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:47,079
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first of these six classes, approximately 45 teachers attended this programming.

85
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It went extremely well and was very well received by

86
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:55,008
[SPEAKER_02]: the professionals in our district.

87
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:01,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We went further on to talk about our OST, which is something I call it, is out of school time programming.

88
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:07,322
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be before and after school programming, summer programming, and camps that happen.

89
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:15,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Inclusive and welcoming wording was added to the summer fun camp and before and after school handbooks.

90
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:23,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The summer fun camp staff are hired and ready to go and inclusive training will occur prior to the first week of camp.

91
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Before and after school programs were not fully staffed at the end of this year.

92
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:39,897
[SPEAKER_02]: They reached out to returning college students coming back home and tried to fill the gaps with those students.

93
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:44,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Enrollment for next year, for the after school,

94
00:12:45,279 --> 00:13:06,749

95
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:18,731
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been a wonderful director of student services, and we've been very lucky to have her serving our students in our community for all these years.

96
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:22,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's sitting here this evening, so again, I want to thank her.

97
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:26,997
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the report.

98
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:27,998
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:28,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to accept.

100
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have a second?

101
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

102
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:32,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

103
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, absolutely.

104
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:42,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and so I have a report from the Rules Subcommittee.

105
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,496
[SPEAKER_12]: We had two meetings.

106
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:48,018
[SPEAKER_12]: One was on June 13th and the other one was on June 19th.

107
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:52,380
[SPEAKER_12]: The purpose of our meetings was to update the rules and regulations of the Medford School Committee.

108
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone has in their packets a copy of the old document

109
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,603
[SPEAKER_12]: It was either from 2004 or older.

110
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,844
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really not sure about the historical date.

111
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,965
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have a copy of the updated 2019 document.

112
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:09,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And we went through and we updated chapters 1 through 10.

113
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,728
[SPEAKER_12]: So we broke it up into two separate meetings.

114
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,609
[SPEAKER_12]: On the June 13th, we discussed chapters 1 to 6.

115
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:23,254
[SPEAKER_12]: In June 19, we discussed chapters 7 to 10, and we made a motion to accept the changes that were put ahead in the documents.

116
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:30,660
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll see throughout the entire document, we removed words such as chairman, replaced it with chairperson, and words

117
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,783
[SPEAKER_12]: him, his, or her were replaced with gender-free words.

118
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:44,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, you will see a new section at the bottom of the documents, and thank you to Mr. Russo for coming up with this great idea.

119
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:57,523
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the policy information, such as first adopted date, last amended date, last renewed date, renewed frequency, next renewal, and version number, so that we can easily identify what

120
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:06,473
[SPEAKER_12]: the age of the document and determine like when is it going to need to be updated the next date.

121
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to just thank all the committee members for coming to the meetings.

122
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,788
[SPEAKER_12]: We did spend several hours in the meetings going through the very old language and updating it to

123
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,829
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, 2019 language.

124
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it was very old.

125
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:26,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also reached out to several different administrators.

126
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:29,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Diane Caldwell assisted.

127
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Christine Patterson assisted.

128
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:43,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, Headmaster DeLever, Principal Fallon, Supervisor of Nurses Tony Ray, and, you know, emailing, just going back and forth.

129
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to Dr. Edward Vincent.

130
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:49,148

00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:52,109
[SPEAKER_12]: And my colleagues, thank you as well.

132
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for your hard work and efforts.

133
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope everybody had a chance to review the documents.

134
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And Erin, did you have a question?

135
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually two questions regarding this document.

136
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:02,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

137
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,315
[SPEAKER_02]: on page three, towards the bottom, section six.

138
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:17,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, any Method resident in attendance may be given permission to speak once at the school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.

139
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:24,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes it sound like a resident can only come to the mic and speak once throughout the whole meeting.

140
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The wording of that.

141
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,630
[SPEAKER_08]: May I?

142
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:29,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, go ahead.

143
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a reference only to the

144
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,669
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an item on the agenda and you want to say something.

145
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,572
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the regular community participation.

146
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You can come to each item if you want to speak on.

147
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,831
[SPEAKER_08]: five of the items on the agenda.

148
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,454
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be able to come up five times, yeah.

149
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, just looking for clarification there.

150
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:46,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

151
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:50,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And my second question isn't on the next page, four out of 15, section eight.

152
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Section eight, okay.

153
00:16:53,622 --> 00:17:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Group committee members who wish to place items on the agenda will provide written notice to the chairperson by Monday noon prior to the scheduled meeting or at the discretion of the chairperson based on extenuating circumstances.

154
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:08,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question.

155
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:15,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Does a chairperson get to decline any item brought forward by a member to be put on the agenda?

156
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that happened to me last year.

157
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:25,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted an item added to the agenda and the chairperson executed their right not to put it on the agenda.

158
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:28,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like that addressed in this policy.

159
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:29,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Russo?

160
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:29,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

161
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:34,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is actually, other than the date, this is current policy.

162
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:47,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And because it also earlier states we're following Robert's rules newly revised, if that happens, and it's happened to me as well, then that can be at the next regularly scheduled meeting.

163
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:53,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Then a member can simply ask that it be put on the agenda anyways for the following meeting.

164
00:17:53,736 --> 00:18:01,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if as long as four members say, yes, we want that on the agenda, then the chair loses the right to say no effectively.

165
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So the chair does have the right to not put it on.

166
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,099
[SPEAKER_08]: but we can override at the next official meeting.

167
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:15,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, that's sort of the way it's been.

168
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure we've ever done that.

169
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see a change where the chairperson does not have the right to put a member's item on the agenda, only because as elected officials, we're here to voice for the community, and I think that a chairperson

170
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: having that override really prevents you from doing your due diligence as a school committee member.

171
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:44,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am requesting that that be added to this.

172
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:45,934
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may?

173
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:52,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, our charter says Robert's Rules newly revised, and that gives the chair that authority.

174
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:55,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we can do a policy that overrides the charter.

175
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,723
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, I mean, we can write anything we want here, but that doesn't mean it's enforceable, and that's sort of my issue.

176
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:37,553
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have that if there is like a stated emergency that would require that that the chair refuses to recognize point of clarification But but you're not saying an item not on the agenda can be discussed

177
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:45,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in terms of an emergency situation, so we do have the authority via open meeting laws to discuss those issues.

178
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:59,580
[SPEAKER_10]: If the chair refuses to put that emergency item on the agenda, we can force that issue to be recognized under open meeting law as long as there's a super majority and we wouldn't violate any open meeting clause if it's an emergency situation.

179
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think the word emergency

180
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:08,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't foresee the chairperson not putting it on the agenda if there's an actual emergency.

181
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:10,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Nor could I. But we do have that authority as a body.

182
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:15,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The emergency can't be every person gets to decide what's an emergency, and that I'm a little concerned about.

183
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because I think it's important and we need to talk about it doesn't make it an emergency.

184
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,893
[SPEAKER_10]: A supermajority would have to agree that it is an emergency.

185
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,384
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I can just, I accept that that's the rule.

186
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:42,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel like it's a little bit of censorship as a, that one person from our committee gets to decide whether or not something is discussed on any given week.

187
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:49,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I object to that, but I'm happy with moving forward with this at this point.

188
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:50,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

189
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,121
[SPEAKER_12]: So is there a motion to accept the report?

190
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I make a motion to accept the report.

191
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:55,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

192
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:56,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

193
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:57,762

[SPEAKER_12]: And is there anybody here for community participation?

198
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:08,044
[SPEAKER_12]: No?

199
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:10,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:44,665

208
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:52,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Administrators will continue their work over the summer, the work that was started at the retreat, in preparation for the new school year.

209
00:22:53,012 --> 00:23:02,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will have a opening of school administrative meeting in August for all administrators, again, for us to work and plan for the school year that's coming.

210
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Public Schools is going to be quite busy over the summer.

211
00:23:06,442 --> 00:23:11,443

224
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:47,728

[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Prylison connected with the museum last year, and the museum decided to partner with the Andrews in this way.

00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: The MPS Middle School Libraries and Medford Public Library successfully partnered to offer a series of STEAM workshops to middle school students during the year.

238
00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:44,496
[SPEAKER_01]: All workshops were held after school in the school library about every other week, alternating between the two schools.

239
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:47,498
[SPEAKER_01]: All middle school students were invited to sign up.

240
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:57,564
[SPEAKER_01]: The workshops provided a nice bridge between books and hands-on learning and had students see the library as a place for active learning and critical thinking.

241
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:09,210
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Public Schools would like to thank the Medford Public Library, the Medford Arts Council, and the Massachusetts Cultural Council for their support of this wonderful project.

[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, this isn't just a literacy project.

248
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:46,291
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to welcome our Kiwanians that are here this evening.

00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:08,659
[SPEAKER_13]: This report is in recognition of the incredible year-long support to all of the students and to the staff of Medford.

251
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:17,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Throughout the year, the Kiwanis Club worked with our staff and students about becoming better citizens and making positive contributions to their community.

252
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:24,926
[SPEAKER_13]: The list below provides you with some of the many activities the Kiwanis Club is involved with in our schools.

253
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:34,349
[SPEAKER_13]: The Builders Club at both the Andrews and the McGlynn Middle Schools help our kids with fundraising so that they can give back to the less fortunate.

254
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:38,010
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the fundraisers helped to support the Medford Food Bank.

255
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,874
[SPEAKER_13]: The Key Club is the oldest service program for high school students.

256
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:49,079
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a student-led organization whose goal is to encourage leadership through serving others.

257
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:57,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Under the leadership of Mrs. Melissa Solomon this year, students had the opportunity to earn community service hours for their participation.

258
00:28:58,346 --> 00:29:21,619
[SPEAKER_13]: students forged strong friendships with each other the key club enriched students lives through a greater sense of social concerns and Improved the community of Medford as a whole But the Kiwanis Club does more it supports our center for citizenship and social responsibility otherwise known as CCSR as well as Medford high school athletics

259
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,143
[SPEAKER_13]: football, band, hockey, and the culinary arts program.

260
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:35,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, the Kiwanis Club supports the Medford High School Alumni Association and has sponsored the MHS Up All Night Junior Prom.

261
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:41,971
[SPEAKER_13]: The Literacy Project is something that's very, very close to my heart, as you all know.

262
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:47,216
[SPEAKER_13]: It provides summer reading books to our first and third grade students.

263
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:52,322
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been doing this for a long time, and I consider myself an adopted Kiwanian.

264
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:53,903
[SPEAKER_13]: You are, you are.

265
00:29:54,964 --> 00:30:04,330
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was an idea that was brought to us in Medford Public Schools many, many years ago for some of our kiddos who don't have books to read during the summer.

266
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:11,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Kiwanis orders books for grade 1 and books for grade 3 in every single one of our elementary schools.

267
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:14,656
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as our private parochial schools as well.

268
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:24,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you see these kids open up their bags and pull out these books, the smile on their faces is just incredible.

269
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:31,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And they already want to start reading, and then they look at their books and say, oh, wait a minute, I read, this is a girl's book, maybe I should give this to my friend.

270
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,104
[SPEAKER_13]: And they want to swap right away.

271
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,085
[SPEAKER_13]: But we tell them they have to wait until they get back to their classroom.

272
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:46,835
[SPEAKER_13]: So, our thanks to all of the Kiwanis members and what they do for the City of Medford, but most importantly, what they do for our children.

273
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,677
So, Ms.

274
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:56,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Kelly Catalo is now the President of the Kiwanis Club.

275
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,022

278
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, chairman, it says.

279
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,175
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to change that.

280
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:17,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Chairperson.

00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Chairperson.

282
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,639
[SPEAKER_13]: We just did all our rules changes.

283
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,399
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I know.

284
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:25,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't make it to the certificate.

285
00:31:25,062 --> 00:31:26,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Kathy Kritz, vice chairperson.

286
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: We got that one right.

287
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:31,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Erin DiBenedetto, Mia Mustone, secretary.

288
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:34,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent, superintendent.

289
00:31:34,449 --> 00:31:37,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Michael Ruggiero, Paul Russo, and Paulette van der Kloof.

290
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:38,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

291
00:31:46,462 --> 00:32:13,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Privilege at being at some of your book giveaways and the kids faces are just like they're so excited and so elated and all that you do for our community from your road races to Everything that you do is just outstanding and we so adore having you in our community and everything you bring to it So thank you all the Kwanians that again tonight I know councillor Caraviello would have been here if he could have he's in a budget hearing at City Hall But I know he would not have missed this for the world.

292
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations

293
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:32,128
[SPEAKER_00]: So on behalf of our Kiwanis family, we want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to partner with you on all these great things for our children, because it creates one great community in Medford.

294
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:37,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of how much our club has grown in numbers.

295
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:42,017
[SPEAKER_00]: and in spirit this year, and the many things that we've been able to do.

296
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:45,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a night that needed to be shared with the whole family.

297
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope that we didn't bring too many.

298
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:47,462
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

299
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:48,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

300
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:49,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

301
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:54,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to acknowledge Representative Paul Donato, member of the Kiwanis, who's also here tonight.

302
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for joining.

303
00:32:55,629 --> 00:32:56,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Paul.

304
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:56,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

305
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

306
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation to approve mass general cannabis study to miss Ray

307
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:28,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

308
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:34,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been fortunate to have Dr. Randy Schuster here twice at our school committee meetings.

309
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,847
[SPEAKER_11]: First to present some up-to-date information about

310
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:42,914
[SPEAKER_11]: adolescent marijuana use, as well as the impact on the developing brain.

311
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:48,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And second, to provide information about the research study that she's conducting on marijuana abstinence.

312
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:59,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Schuster has partnered with several Massachusetts school districts, and her data is demonstrating many positive outcomes from marijuana abstinence.

313
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:12,563
[SPEAKER_11]: As a district, we've used the SBIRT model to open conversations about substance use, to identify students who are engaging in risky behaviors, provide education and support, and make appropriate referrals.

314
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:22,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dr. Schuster's study will expand upon this support and assist counselors, nurses, and parents in providing assistance to our students.

315
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:30,109
[SPEAKER_11]: We plan to use SBIRT screening as the model, which mandates that we ask students about their marijuana use.

316
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:39,596
[SPEAKER_11]: A brief voluntary survey will be conducted with all high school students to determine who would be interested in participating in the study.

317
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:49,364
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time, enrollment in the study will require student and parent consent through the Mass General Hospital Institutional Review Board process.

318
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:59,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the duration of the study unless the interviewer deems that the student is harmful to himself or others.

319
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:09,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's my recommendation and supported by the high school administrative staff that we approve Dr. Schuster's study at Medford High School beginning the fall of 2019.

320
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:11,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I make a motion to accept.

321
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:12,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I second.

322
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.

323
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:16,647
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor for acceptance of this and a second by Ms.

324
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:16,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratz.

325
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo has a question.

326
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:24,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I know when this was presented, we were considering going to middle school as well.

327
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious why we're not including middle schoolers.

328
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:30,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Seuss, I think I'll have to defer to you on that one.

329
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,303
[SPEAKER_07]: The short answer is I will go wherever you say it's OK for me to go.

330
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:43,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I spoke with one of the principals on the way out today, and he said the doors were open.

331
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:48,211
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the staff to work in middle schools and high schools.

332
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:51,713
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to be in multiple middle schools across the state in the fall.

333
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:03,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It is my belief that the younger we can start this conversation, the better.

334
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:13,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would be wholeheartedly in favor of rolling out in both middle schools and high schools, in the middle schools and the high school in the fall.

335
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:23,188
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's the preference of the committee to start in year one in the high school and then reevaluate in year two, I'm open to that as well.

336
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: But as I said in the book.

337
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Shall I just make an amendment?

338
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I just first want to ask Ms.

339
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:32,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Ray if she has any reservations or any reason.

340
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:36,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well then I would like to amend this to include the middle school.

341
00:36:36,755 --> 00:36:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

342
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to amend as seconded by Ms.

343
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,436
[SPEAKER_03]: DiBenedetto.

344
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:44,457
[SPEAKER_03]: On the main motion as amended, Mr. Ruggiero.

345
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:45,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Two questions as well.

346
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:46,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

347
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:52,401
[SPEAKER_10]: The first question I have was your mix of the opt-in versus the opt-out model that you have.

348
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:57,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So the original screening, students are just going to have the survey if they want to fill it out or not.

349
00:36:57,663 --> 00:36:58,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that an option?

350
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:03,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they get included in the study, it requires both consent of the student and the parent.

351
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:04,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that still the model that we're using?

352
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:05,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

353
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:06,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

354
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:13,957
[SPEAKER_10]: And the second question I had is, you mentioned before that it would be possible to include other questions, a couple of other questions.

355
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:23,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be great if we could have a question also on vaping and a question on maybe activity levels, including like diabetes and like sugary drink consumption.

356
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:31,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So our survey, as it stands right now, and I believe it was in some of the materials that I gave you a few weeks ago, we have a lot of questions on vaping in there.

357
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:35,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's something that we really need to be thinking about in tandem with marijuana use.

358
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:38,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are capturing that extensively at a school-wide level.

359
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm happy to add an additional question about activity level.

360
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it would be nice if we could have a question about sugary drink consumption as well, because that is a really rising health cost, as you noted.

361
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:51,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, and that is information that we collect at detail.

362
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:54,938
[SPEAKER_07]: when students are enrolled in the study.

363
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:59,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's certainly information that already I know that we can deliver back.

364
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But the screener, the school-wide screener is certainly amenable.

365
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know if this requires an amendment.

366
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:11,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also don't want to jeopardize the scientific value by including every single question under the sun.

367
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:21,549
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it doesn't actually jeopardize the scientific value of your study, I would prefer questions about obesity and sugary drink consumption and activity levels to also be included

368
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:22,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps Ms.

369
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:23,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray could work on them.

370
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:25,719
[SPEAKER_11]: We can definitely work together.

371
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:33,284
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we'd have to discuss how that would link together in terms of this study and whether it's, you know.

372
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:33,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

373
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,286
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't want to invalidate any work that.

374
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:36,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

375
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:37,647
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the most important.

376
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:38,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I understand.

377
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:42,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want you to jeopardize the scientific value of what you're doing by expanding out the scope.

378
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:43,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

379
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I can say is I'm certainly open to it.

380
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:49,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it would jeopardize the scientific scope of the study whatsoever.

381
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:56,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The potential rate-limiting step on my part will be the MGH and Harvard Medical School IRB.

382
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:05,340
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to see that all questions are directly related to the scientific goals of the study, and they don't want us taking advantage of that opt-out process.

383
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So barring that they say no to that, I'm perfectly open to it.

384
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:13,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't think this requires an amendment, but if you could look into that for us, I'd really appreciate it.

385
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,285
[SPEAKER_11]: May I just ask the question, though?

386
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:15,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

387
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:17,306
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you see as the link

388
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:21,181
[SPEAKER_11]: between those questions and this study?

389
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:32,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I would imagine, I mean, I'm speculating, I don't have the scientific data in front of me, but I would imagine that children that tend to be less active and also have a poorer dietary environment

390
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,898
[SPEAKER_10]: also have a higher likelihood to use marijuana.

391
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:45,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I have any evidence of that, but it would seem at least sort of, you know, you imagine sort of the person smoking pot, watching TV, eating Doritos.

392
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:48,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that could be a cliche, or perhaps there's some scientific truth to that fact.

393
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:49,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

394
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:52,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that we're collecting that you'll be interested in that is a

395
00:39:54,453 --> 00:40:00,478
[SPEAKER_07]: important outcome of the part of the project where we require parental consent.

396
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:07,643
[SPEAKER_07]: So once they actually enroll in the study, as we look at when an adolescent stops using marijuana, what happens to their activity level, and

397
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:16,769
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are things that we're directly linking to changes in marijuana use and can certainly look into adding in at the school level.

398
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:31,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the reason why I mention it is I've had a couple of parents now talk to me about, you know, their child was involved in middle school sports and they were very athletic and then the vaping and the drug use came into their lives and all of that stopped.

399
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:37,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, I would be curious to see whether that correlation actually is valid or if it's just sort of like word on the street what I hear.

400
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:40,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Doctor.

401
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:50,831
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a motion on the floor to approve Dr. Randy Schuster's marijuana abstinence study at Medford High School and Medford Middle Schools for the 19-20 year.

402
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:52,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

403

[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

407
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something traditionally we have chosen not to?

408
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:17,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Midford is.

409
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need a report?

410
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:19,936
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

411
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion?

412
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:22,218

[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke.

451
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:54,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

452
00:41:55,006 --> 00:41:56,587
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

453
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:03,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we also just put a note to advertise the budget hearing somewhere in our calendar so it's on our front and center in our minds.

454
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:03,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

455
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:06,693
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we have.

456
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Free breakfast, lunch feasibility.

457
00:42:09,815 --> 00:42:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go back to your?

458
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:19,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee of the whole superintendents evaluation earlier this evening Wait a minute.

459
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:26,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more item before we go back report on feasibility of universal free breakfast using provision to miss Patterson Thank you

460
00:42:27,307 --> 00:42:31,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to start by saying I don't always deliver bad news with this report.

461
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:34,668
[SPEAKER_14]: The last meeting of the school year.

462
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:42,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, thanks to this committee and some crunch time research.

463
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,750
[SPEAKER_14]: The Food Service Department, Ms.

464
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:55,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Jewel Bradley, and myself and other entities worked very diligently to pull together information to look at the feasibility and possibility of Provision 2, which is

465
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,373
[SPEAKER_14]: free breakfast for all schools.

466
00:42:58,073 --> 00:43:06,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, breakfast is being served at three mandated breakfast sites, which are the Columbus, the McGlynn Elementary, and the McGlynn Middle School.

467
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:19,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Utilizing the guidelines from the Food Research and Action Center, FRAC, communications with state departments, and engaging with outside resources in a short time frame, we were able to offer the following information.

468
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:34,945
[SPEAKER_14]: We reached out to the Massachusetts School Nutrition Association Board and their member, Mr. Robert Shaheen, and conducted a site visit for the purpose of identifying streamlined breakfast delivery methods that would encourage participation for breakfast at all locations.

469
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:42,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Shaheen has been in school food service many years, and he is an advocate for school meals at the Beacon Hill and Washington, D.C.

470
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:46,654
[SPEAKER_14]: serving on many boards within his SNA role.

471
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:56,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Shaheen observed the breakfast program at the Roberts, and he offered ideas, potential costs, and recommended food items that could assist Medford in considering a free breakfast program.

472
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:08,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon his visit, he complimented the kitchen on its cleanliness and based his assessment at the end of his visit by suggesting a pilot program to confirm if free breakfast could pay for itself.

473
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:17,717
[SPEAKER_14]: The conference call on June 20th was also conducted with Education Specialist at the Department of Ed, Kevin Dawson, along with myself and Ms.

474
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:18,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Jewel Bradley.

475
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:26,260
[SPEAKER_14]: He indicated that the program is a four-year commitment, with year one being the base year to determine participation levels district-wide.

476
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,261
[SPEAKER_14]: The enrollment can be included

477
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:40,190
[SPEAKER_14]: as part of the annual food service application and the process through the DESE portal is very simplistic in regard to accessing this Provision 2 breakfast for all the schools.

478
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:49,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Dawson also stated that the best option would be to conduct a short-term pilot program to determine if participation levels were there to keep the program running.

479
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:58,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And if costs were excessive and or participation rates did not justify the expenses, that we could opt out with the notification to the Department of Ed.

480
00:44:59,298 --> 00:45:01,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Further calculation scenarios were explored.

481
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,125
[SPEAKER_14]: However, there are so many variables with food costs, labor rates to address a large-scale breakfast program.

482
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Honing in on that profit and loss scenario was very difficult.

483
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:26,441
[SPEAKER_14]: So the expected level of staffing at each building that's not currently serving the mandated breakfast would be two to three more daily food service members in the morning to prepare and serve the meals at roughly $600 per week per building just for the labor costs.

484
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:37,352
[SPEAKER_14]: But given our enthusiasm to feed the children of Medford and with the recommendation of experts in the field, partnership with Jewel Bradley, our food service director, I offer the following recommendation.

485
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:46,079
[SPEAKER_14]: That we adopt provision two under a full-scale free breakfast pilot program during the first quarter of the school year, the months of September, October, November of 2019.

486
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:54,845
[SPEAKER_14]: And upon the third month, we review the participation reimbursement expense levels to conclude if the program is viable to continue.

487
00:45:55,826 --> 00:46:20,189
[SPEAKER_14]: report will be provided at the first school committee in December of 2019 and if this was your vote we would do a full-scale Advertisement informing all of the families in Medford that come day one of the new school year All students would be able to have free breakfast hot and cold options at every school building Mr. Benedetto, then Mr. Russo, then Mr. Legere

488
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:27,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your work on this is this the same program as breakfast after the bell or is that a different program?

489
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:42,963
[SPEAKER_14]: So breakfast is breakfast So there are many different ways to deliver breakfast and again all breakfast has been being served in all of our school buildings this is just a mechanism to provide more participation and say I

490
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:45,884
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free under provision two.

491
00:46:46,224 --> 00:47:05,052
[SPEAKER_14]: So the district is committing to free breakfast for all, which in turn is hopeful that all the students would take advantage of that and participate in a free breakfast knowing that sometimes it's a busy schedule in the morning, sometimes children don't have a hot breakfast meal, and it is the most important meal of the day.

492
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:11,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can provide that in a provision two free category, we would be serving so many families.

493
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:20,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we look into the Breakfast After the Bell and the grant opportunity of $10,000 per school that signs up for the Breakfast After the Bell program?

494
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:24,725
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a different component that's not part of this, and that's something specific.

495
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:29,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm asking if you looked at both programs and made an informed decision between the two.

496
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:33,432
[SPEAKER_14]: We wouldn't be able to participate if we waited for that grant opportunity.

497
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:38,856
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is an option to be able to utilize and run a pilot program.

498
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:42,810
[SPEAKER_14]: without having to wait and really see what that would entail.

499
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:53,996
[SPEAKER_14]: So a $10,000 investment may not be enough and that's what we will really find out by running this pilot program for the first three months, which are usually the most active months of a school year.

500
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:57,638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm happy that you're presenting us with an option.

501
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:59,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure that we were taking

502
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Every opportunity given to us when a private group approached a committee member with an opportunity to write the grants for us, for us to receive $10,000 per school to do a startup.

503
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:19,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure we looked at that as well as this program and picked the right program that we can sustain long-term.

504
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:29,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're just picking one and not looking at all options, I want to make sure that all students are fed for indefinitely, not just a pilot program.

505
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is really a public item.

506
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:36,673
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not engaging private sectors for this particular.

507
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:49,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a non-profit programming that helps many school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide at no cost to them, and they don't gain anything.

508
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:51,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a public service that they provide.

509
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do it in the most needy of areas throughout the state of Massachusetts.

510
00:48:58,222 --> 00:49:04,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And they graciously offered to help MedFed write the grant, actually write them for us.

511
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make sure that we're looking at every option available to us so that we have the correct program that we can sustain throughout the whole state.

512
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of Medford Public Schools, I just want to feed hungry kids, but I want to do it in a way that it doesn't have to stop in December because it's costing us too much money.

513
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:31,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure we do our due diligence and do it once, do it right, and make sure we did our homework.

514
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:34,123
[SPEAKER_03]: $10,000 would be the start-up cost.

515
00:49:37,947 --> 00:49:40,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I make a motion?

516
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:40,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo's next.

517
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:42,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

518
00:49:43,409 --> 00:49:48,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice that you're not delivering bad news or that we have to argue about this.

519
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:56,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just like to make a, well, let me back up a second.

520
00:49:57,893 --> 00:50:03,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that the committee should have to vote for the opt out to take place.

521
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:05,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It should not be an administrative decision.

522
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:12,118
[SPEAKER_14]: It really needs to be programmatic, because the food service program has to be in the black.

523
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,899
[SPEAKER_14]: It cannot operate in a deficit.

524
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:18,180
[SPEAKER_14]: That's by not only state law, but that's federal.

525
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,240
[SPEAKER_14]: We will lose our funding.

526
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So we cannot just function in a deficit in that regard.

527
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:24,562
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

528
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:25,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I can accept that.

529
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:30,644
[SPEAKER_08]: But the McGlynn Elementary has about a 22% participation.

530
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:31,764
[SPEAKER_08]: They have free breakfast now.

531
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:33,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Columbus has a 93% participation.

532
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:39,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's my understanding of revision to the name of the game here is participation.

533
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:47,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only reason that there's a 71% difference in participation is because at Columbus it's after the bell.

534
00:50:48,376 --> 00:50:54,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not really even comfortable wasting three months of time if we're not making it after the bell at the elementary schools.

535
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:01,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no reason to believe that the McGlynn students are suddenly going to start eating when they've been able to.

536
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:03,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean.

537
00:51:05,785 --> 00:51:15,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a lot of work to go to After the Bell breakfast, but we're not doing this just to feel good like we checked a box.

538
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:29,193
[SPEAKER_14]: No, and the plan with food service is that this would be a full on real process to encourage students to come in and eat a hot breakfast.

539
00:51:29,593 --> 00:51:30,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the real push.

540
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:39,418
[SPEAKER_14]: We are going to make it, because again, the numbers aren't there to warrant additional staffing, there isn't additional staffing at some of the buildings.

541
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:44,882
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we commit to doing a full breakfast, a full hot meal,

542
00:51:45,962 --> 00:52:05,333
[SPEAKER_14]: additional options and really roll out the red carpet, if you will, on the breakfast program and get that excitement from day one, that's our hope that we would gather that participation level in a new scope and a new scale that hasn't been done so before.

543
00:52:05,733 --> 00:52:12,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And really, again, reach out to the parents in early communications throughout the summer indicating your child will eat free.

544
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:16,047
[SPEAKER_14]: beginning the first day of school under this provision, too.

545
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:31,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And in terms of after the bill, that is a much more challenging program to implement because we're talking about schedules, we're talking about classroom areas and getting the particulars in place.

546
00:52:32,054 --> 00:52:37,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, the Columbus has been doing it for many, many years, so their building is

547
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:41,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Working seamlessly.

548
00:52:42,153 --> 00:52:50,836
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I may, free breakfast that requires that you're actually there before school starts, which is what we're talking about, right?

549
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:57,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can go to any elementary school and watch the kids being dropped off one minute before the bell.

550
00:52:58,419 --> 00:53:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Not two kids, dozens of them.

551
00:53:02,141 --> 00:53:05,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, what about when the bus just shows up just at the last minute?

552
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:09,704
[SPEAKER_08]: None of these scenarios will enable a kid to eat.

553
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,370
[SPEAKER_08]: if they're not after the bell.

554
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:28,404
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the partnership would have to be with principals, that if a bus is late, that they would offer 5 minutes, 5-10 minutes additional for students to go through the line in a breakfast format, just like they do for additional lunch time if there was something that occurred during the day.

555
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:33,409
[SPEAKER_14]: They offer additional bell service to account and adjust for

556
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: something that might take place.

557
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:45,347
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's an extended fire drill or something of sorts during the day that cuts into their lunchtime, they are given additional time through the principal's scheduling.

558
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:55,309
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that would be the hope that we would be communicating with principals and be able to put that in place before the start of school this coming fall.

559
00:53:56,569 --> 00:54:03,893
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not just the elementary so again like I think that that's important to recognize that the high schoolers are not Eating a breakfast.

560
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:15,198
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a big push to get high schoolers to eat a meal and I we know for certain that high schoolers are here well before the bell and and have that opportunity to

561
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:28,863
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, not only is it a socializing event, but if they can go get a free meal and they know it's a hot meal, and they like what they're eating, the whole hope is that they will come in and be encouraged to eat that breakfast meal every day.

562
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:30,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just have one more question.

563
00:54:31,444 --> 00:54:44,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we, at the end of the three months, opt out because it is fiscally totally impossible, does this opt out prevent us from next year saying we're going to do after the ballot and we're going to try again?

564
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,765
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do it all over again next year if it doesn't work.

565
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:47,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

566
00:54:47,765 --> 00:54:49,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

567
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Aguero.

568
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:54,068
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much for rushing out this report.

569
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:59,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we all asked you to expedite it and with all the other budgetary work that you had.

570
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:07,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate it because as I mentioned before as a former educator, I know what it's like when kids show up hungry and I've seen the effects.

571
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:09,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I've taught at both kinds of schools.

572
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:16,742
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do share Member Ruseau's reservations about not doing an after the bell program.

573
00:55:16,922 --> 00:55:21,326
[SPEAKER_10]: When kids have the opportunity, if mom and dad are running late, that kid doesn't eat.

574
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:27,672
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the issues that we talked about at the superintendent review was making sure we have a consistent program.

575
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,734
[SPEAKER_10]: throughout the entire system.

576
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:36,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the way I feel about it is that, you know, if you're a child in poverty, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Columbus or the McGlynn.

577
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:38,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure that kid's fed.

578
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:45,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to suggest under this pilot, since we're running a pilot, I would like to have a consistent after the bail program.

579
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:50,614
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be what we test, not sort of we try this, we try this, we try this.

580
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:54,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see what happens when the entire district has an after the bell program.

581
00:55:55,137 --> 00:55:59,239
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we have something like 90% participation, then we would know that we have an issue.

582
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:06,491
[SPEAKER_10]: seeking a second on that or has anyone else had a motion?

583
00:56:07,172 --> 00:56:09,734
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have time and learning that we have to do.

584
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:13,198
[SPEAKER_13]: This is mandated by federal and state law that we have to do.

585
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:17,342
[SPEAKER_13]: With the Columbus Elementary School, they have been doing this for a very long time.

586
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:21,007
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm the first one to say I want every child to have breakfast.

587
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:21,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

588
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:30,129
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a point in time that we had a huge rodent problem at the McGlynn Elementary School.

589
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:33,910
[SPEAKER_13]: And Michael, I don't even know if you were on the school committee at that time.

590
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:41,412
[SPEAKER_13]: It cost us thousands and thousands of dollars to replace the books and the materials that the teachers lost.

591
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:47,514
[SPEAKER_13]: The time and learning that was lost with the kids having to go to the auditorium because they couldn't be in their rooms.

592
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:52,951
[SPEAKER_13]: So it wasn't that the McGlynn Elementary School didn't want the kids to have breakfast.

593
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:55,392
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a rodent problem that we had.

594
00:56:56,273 --> 00:56:58,694
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need buy-in from our principals as well.

595
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:00,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we need to talk about this.

596
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I think every principal wants their child to eat.

597
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:13,003
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you have them come in, whether it's before or after the bell, then I think that as long as the kids have the opportunity, I think we should move forward with what Christine is suggesting.

598
00:57:13,023 --> 00:57:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's a motion for approval.

599
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:20,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it comes to a question of what we are capable as a community.

600
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:41,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe, and I understand, it's like one more thing that member Ruggiero has thrown at the principals.

601
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:48,091
[SPEAKER_10]: But on this particular issue, I do believe it has a significant impact on educational standards.

602
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will be seen throughout the entire school system.

603
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:54,796
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would, if none of my, no one wishes to second this motion, that's fine.

604
00:57:54,816 --> 00:58:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to make a motion that we do a universal after the bell program for breakfast.

605
00:58:01,341 --> 00:58:02,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one we pilot.

606
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:03,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it doesn't work,

607
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:09,727
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can't get it to work by November, then we can regroup and say, you know, it just didn't happen at the McGlynn because of rodents.

608
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,929
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I can offer some feedback from the food service side.

609
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:20,093
[SPEAKER_14]: As much as that would be ideal in all the greater scheme.

610
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:31,618
[SPEAKER_14]: In the context of being able to do a pilot program, again, a pilot program is something you try for a brief amount of time and you put everything into it that you can.

611
00:58:32,018 --> 00:58:36,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Our food service department is not prepared to do an after the bell.

612
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:38,463
[SPEAKER_14]: There's different components.

613
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:42,786
[SPEAKER_14]: There are travel items that are needed to carry the breakfast.

614
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,868
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a hot meal necessarily.

615
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:50,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It's varying items of what can be provided in an after the bell scenario.

616
00:58:51,292 --> 00:59:10,767
[SPEAKER_14]: We are trying to do a full-scale, broad-based breakfast program, really having hot meal options, really having additional components for all of the different fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh milk and cereal that's part of the daily components anyway.

617
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:15,633
[SPEAKER_14]: but in order to do that we also have to train our food service folks at these various buildings.

618
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:24,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Now they're used to and understand the meaning of morning prep and delivery of a meal and clean up from that to prepare for the lunch service.

619
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,246
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of a

620
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:35,793
[SPEAKER_14]: model that is breakfast after the bell, that's a significant different model that would require more training.

621
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:42,497
[SPEAKER_14]: And now that the school is out, we won't have any opportunity to engage with our food service staff in order to do that.

622
00:59:42,877 --> 00:59:54,745
[SPEAKER_14]: So this was the hope, to be able to pilot a program that would really engage and get the interest of not only our food service department, whose main

623
00:59:55,805 --> 01:00:13,315
[SPEAKER_14]: goal is to feed the children of Medford, but also to really offer varying items for the breakfast menu selection to engage the students and get their own buy-in for breakfast and why they would want to come to school and eat breakfast.

624
01:00:13,956 --> 01:00:14,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo.

625
01:00:15,016 --> 01:00:19,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I guess

626
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:44,205
[SPEAKER_08]: My issue is with a pilot, and I understand the need to stay in the black, but the idea that one day we're serving all of the kids free breakfast, and then the next day, which I realize will happen over a break, but the next day kids will come to school who will not have heard that starting on January 3rd or whatever, you no longer get breakfast for free.

627
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:46,786
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't even sound like something that we could

628
01:00:47,532 --> 01:00:53,114
[SPEAKER_08]: implement short of doing exactly the lunch shaming policy that we adopted.

629
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:55,254
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't have that, because you don't have any money.

630
01:00:55,434 --> 01:01:01,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so I just worry that doing a pilot, I get it, why we want to do this.

631
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:11,419
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there's a chance that we would actually turn it off, I can't wrap my head around that, frankly.

632
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:16,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really do think the committee should have to approve turning it off.

633
01:01:17,379 --> 01:01:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you come to us and say we need to turn it off because we're running a deficit of $10,000 a week or whatever, I think the committee should be the folks to say we can't afford it.

634
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:34,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We aren't going to make up the money from somewhere else or whatever.

635
01:01:34,385 --> 01:01:42,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think it should be an administrative decision that suddenly kids that were getting free breakfast and we're going to advertise the heck out of it so everybody knows.

636
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And then suddenly they come to school and they don't get free breakfast.

637
01:01:47,062 --> 01:01:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just, you know, I grew up without breakfast every single day in my childhood.

638
01:01:52,403 --> 01:01:58,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And the entire idea of that, I mean, I can't even imagine what that would be like.

639
01:01:58,724 --> 01:02:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure, many kids are going to eat free breakfast, have breakfast at home too, but not all of them.

640
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not okay with approving this if we don't approve the termination of the

641
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:19,548
[SPEAKER_14]: So in this proposal, there was no indication that it was an administrative review, and that's why I specified you would be presented with the findings in early December.

642
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:30,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be a vote of the committee, but I would hope that there would be recognition if there's the levels that don't speak to continuing a program.

643
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,849
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor for approval.

644
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:38,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that there's someone in the community that would like to speak on this issue.

645
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:46,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street, Medford Mass.

646
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:56,336
[SPEAKER_06]: As a community member, that was the first time that I heard the statistic that you mentioned, Paul, around the Columbus school program getting, what did you say, 70% participation?

647
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:56,336
93%.

648
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:57,117
[SPEAKER_06]: 93% and the McGlynn was 22?

649
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:58,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's 22.

650
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:08,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as we're thinking, and that was just, I gasped out loud because I was really shocked by that.

651
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:14,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And also as a child who went hungry as a little girl as well, I really empathize with that in our community.

652
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:20,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we're thinking about equity in our district, I really want us to think about why that is happening, right?

653
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:28,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So why is the Columbus Elementary School having 90-something percent participation and the McGlynn is having whatever percent, 22% participation?

654
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And how are we feeding all of Medford students?

655
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:32,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that it's not an easy answer and I know that

656
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:40,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Christine's done a lot of work, and you folks have done a lot of work as well, but there's got to be some kind of a compromise around making sure that all of our children are being fed.

657
01:03:40,994 --> 01:03:47,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And in a way that, you know, whether it's after the bell or before the bell or however it is, but we have to increase that participation at all the schools.

658
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:54,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I didn't know about the rodent issue at the McGlynn's, which is really concerning, to say the least.

659
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:58,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we embrace all of our elementary schools to make sure that all of our children are fed?

660
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as we all know, you can't concentrate on your school

661
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:02,622
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're not fed.

662
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:06,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just wanted to put that forward as a community member.

663
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:08,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you several years ago, it doesn't happen.

664
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:08,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

665
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:26,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I would think that it seems to me that there is a leap of faith here, to some extent, by going with this.

666
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:34,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we have the statistics between two of our schools, and someone answered about a bus being late.

667
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:50,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm sure hoping that the principal who's meeting that bus that is late is the caring individual who we know that they are and who will usher that it's not a, you know, all of a sudden breakfast is going to close and the door is closed and there's no chance.

668
01:04:51,176 --> 01:05:00,301
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was a guidance counselor over in Everett, there was a child who consistently came late to school and we knew had no food.

669
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:09,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to tell you, we always managed to get that child food by going down to the kitchen, by getting help, and we had no breakfast program at that time set up for that.

670
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:12,447
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are caring individuals in our buildings.

671
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:16,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I am sure that there are other people in our buildings who want to make this work.

672
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:18,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm betting on that.

673
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to bet on that and vote for approval of this.

674
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:25,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And then see, we might have kinks.

675
01:05:26,013 --> 01:05:27,174
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to work it out.

676
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:28,635
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to revisit.

677
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm at least willing to try it.

678
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where I'll come down tonight.

679
01:05:32,517 --> 01:05:32,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

680
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:34,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

681
01:05:35,205 --> 01:05:36,786
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a motion on the floor.

682
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:37,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

683
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:38,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostow, did you want to speak?

684
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Just shortly.

685
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:40,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Ms.

686
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:55,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Patterson and the superintendent, because we have been talking about breakfast in the schools for three and a half years, and this is the first time that a compromise, it's not what our wish list is, but it's a beginning, and it can expand, and we can grow it, and the word is getting out there.

687
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I truly appreciate your compromise right here.

688
01:05:58,063 --> 01:06:01,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So I vote also to approve this report of universal free breakfast.

727
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:59,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Some, there were different pieces to this thing, some were over-proficient, some were at-proficient, there was nothing less than proficient.

728
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the school committee just wants to state for the record how extremely pleased we are

729
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:12,380
[SPEAKER_03]: with you at the helm, how the public and the students have responded to you at the helm.

731
01:08:14,701 --> 01:08:16,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to it even getting better and better.

732
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:30,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some items popped up that we feel the first year really, you can't even evaluate someone on this, but what you do with the data you obtain, how you make changes, and how you get buy-in, because we know you're such a positive voice and force.

733
01:08:31,284 --> 01:08:34,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes time, it takes time for everything to settle out.

734
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:45,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just really thrilled we will be filing with Desi I believe tomorrow morning after our vote once it's solidified to file our proficient status in all four disciplines.

737
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:09,342

738
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:17,630
[SPEAKER_09]: It's truly been a great year to be able to work with her and be able to, for all of us to recognize this tonight.
