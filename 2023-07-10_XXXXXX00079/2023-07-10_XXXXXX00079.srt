[SPEAKER_05]: Matt Leming, he, him, his.

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:56,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved to Medford in 2020.

13
00:00:56,396 --> 00:01:01,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a member of the Community Preservation Committee, and until recently the

00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:21,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a, uh, reserve naval officer, uh, commissioned last year, and I'm a candidate for Medford City Council.

17
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Matt.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last part is what we mainly want to talk about today, your candidacy for City Council.

19
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:34,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get to that, if you could just share with us your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

20
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Oasis CafÃ©.

21
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Coffee and Balina de Echuva, I am there almost.

22
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:44,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Every morning I was actually just there before I came here.

23
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:49,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a nice little place on Harvard and Maine.

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I just go there to read a magazine.

25
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,163
[SPEAKER_05]: They have amazing coffee.

26
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:57,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I also need to give shout outs to

27
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Bob's, May's cafe.

28
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I always get Chinese takeout from there and Alexander's.

29
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:09,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say that those four places probably make up like 70% of my diet these days.

30
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:11,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real South Medford feel.

31
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:12,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

32
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:16,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, so Oasis comes up a lot with like all ages.

33
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I interviewed a seven year old who also is their favorite place was Oasis.

34
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:24,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, Chili Garden comes up a lot and I finally tried them this weekend and it was like,

35
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,011
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the most incredible Chinese food I've ever had.

36
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:27,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plans.

37
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

38
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe let's jump in.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could tell us, Matt, a little bit about

40
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:39,880
[SPEAKER_02]: your sort of path to local politics and the pieces that brought you to this moment.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved to Medford during COVID.

43
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:48,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just after I finished my PhD.

44
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a job here and I immediately fell in love with the place.

45
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:54,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It was

46
00:02:55,589 --> 00:03:18,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just really like the vibe, I really like the people, and I started looking around thinking, okay, you know, I'm a postdoc, we don't really make a whole lot of money as really career scientists, I was renting with two roommates, and I started looking around on Zillow, like, okay, if I want to buy a med for, like, what are my options?

47
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:34,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't really find anything below like $600,000, which for my salary would require, like, it would require, the down payment for that loan would require more than one year salary for me, 6% mortgage rates.

48
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was kind of thinking, okay, what is happening here?

49
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I got involved in a lot of affordable housing activism.

50
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:58,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up joining a local Unitarian church and with the folks there just started getting involved in groups like Housing Medford, Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, and eventually getting to positions where we were

51
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:24,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Just constantly annoying and talking with city Councilors about passing different ordinances like the Affordable Housing Trust Getting involved in state-level advocacy that would discourage Speculation housing speculation by big real estate companies, you know just through through you you I put on and well me and

52
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:37,241
[SPEAKER_05]: As other members of the Church of Social Justice Committee, we put on a forum about affordable housing, just trying to educate people on these issues.

53
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:39,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very complex topic.

54
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It spans just like, you know, it sort of, there's this weird intersection, affordable housing, between like

55
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:55,288
[SPEAKER_05]: just the global economy, the demand side of it, as well as just the very local city council level stuff, so building affordable housing.

56
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the goal of that was really to educate people.

57
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the day after the 2022 elections, a couple of the city councilors approached me.

58
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:09,075
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, look, we see that you're really involved in this.

59
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that you're really passionate about these issues.

60
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be interested in potentially

61
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:21,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Running for City Council and my initial reaction was like, oh, okay.

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:28,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I'm not totally sure but you know, I talked with I talked with a lot of people about it.

63
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the prop just the very

64
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:38,113
[SPEAKER_05]: weird back-end process of like campaigning, getting like door-knocking, getting the technical infrastructure up.

65
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, okay, you know, I'm a young person.

66
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I have generally a lot of energy.

67
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:48,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the ability to sit in committee meetings for several hours at a time.

68
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:51,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, okay, yeah, let's do this.

69
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:58,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is, yeah, that is how I decided to get involved.

70
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:58,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

71
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:06,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love that affordable housing is absolutely a priority insofar as the work that hopefully will come.

72
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:11,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak to sort of additional change priorities if you were elected?

73
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

74
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So the three, okay.

75
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So the three parts of my platform that have been really trying to push.

76
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:24,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been studying a lot more than this, but the three parts of it is affordable housing, which I just talked about.

77
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford needs to build more.

78
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:32,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make it so that people can live here without putting 70% of their income towards rent.

79
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:36,499
[SPEAKER_05]: We also need a way to pay for that.

80
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:44,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of Medford's biggest problems right now is that there's not enough money coming into the city.

81
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:49,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you look around the city, there's just a lot of storefronts that are sitting empty.

82
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:56,015
[SPEAKER_05]: A part of my platform is a commercial vacancy tax to discourage that kind of speculative squatting.

83
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:04,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally trying to make Medford a place where people want to go in the evenings, people want to spend time.

84
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:09,399
[SPEAKER_05]: The third part of that is inclusivity.

85
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:19,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to make local politics in Medford generally a place that more people around the city feel like they can easily enter into.

86
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:22,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I first moved here,

87
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:28,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I'm a person that really likes to be involved in wherever I'm at.

88
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:38,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just a student government nerd just all throughout school in my very, um, it's probably overly extended educational period.

89
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just involved in committees all throughout that.

90
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:47,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, okay, well I want to get involved in real government now, you know, like local stuff.

91
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:57,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and my experience with that was I submitted, like, you know, the city put out a couple of advertisements about, you know, apply to the city board or whatever.

92
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:00,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I can't even remember which city board it was at the time.

93
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I very carefully prepared a resume.

94
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I submitted it to them and nothing happened.

95
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:11,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like putting a piece of paper into a black hole, no response, nothing.

96
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: From the city's perspective, an experience like that is really not that important.

97
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:31,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just, it's barely a blip on their radar, but to somebody who wants to get involved, who's not necessarily, doesn't necessarily know what's going on, that experience just is, what that says to them is, okay, there is a very high barrier to entry.

98
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to know people.

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to like network around the right circles.

100
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really should not be the experience of people who want to get involved.

101
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:50,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the people on city boards are generally, you know, I work with them a lot, they're wonderful people, but they're generally all like sort of know each other, come from like the same groups.

102
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And my goal is to try to reach out to pockets of people or engage people who

103
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:03,858
[SPEAKER_05]: know those pockets of people and say, okay, you know, we don't want you to just feel welcome.

104
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:20,610
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to actively reach out and say, okay, you know, can you get this person who doesn't really know a whole lot about the city and just have them apply to a board, have them apply to a committee, have them engaged in events that gives them a voice in local politics.

105
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is a hugely important topic.

106
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It affects our lives.

107
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:32,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Much more than I think a lot of people realize so that's One of my goals as a city councilor.

108
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:39,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I know We were on the Charter study committee together till recently and that I think you described that process perfectly.

109
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:39,528
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like I

110
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, well, I must not have gotten into this.

111
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was notified like, oh yeah, you have like two days to decide if you want to do this.

112
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like noticing like the other people on the board, like, you're right.

113
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,355
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people that are like on lots of other things.

114
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're known to the city.

115
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,657
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all kind of like known entities.

116
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:58,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And my, my, um, understanding is that they're just kind of appointed by the mayor.

117
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, definitely like some kind of different, more inclusive process.

118
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think every one of us was white in that meeting too.

119
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:05,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So like,

120
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like very smart people motivated for that type of work, but also like we could use some other, right.

121
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:21,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I mean, there's, I mean, there's, um, sort of a lot, a lot of areas just where there's work to be done there.

122
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I, I consider myself to be a progressive.

123
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I'm also like.

124
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:36,279
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my goals really in doing this is to try to build bridges between people in the city.

125
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:52,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing that I hear a lot, you know, as a relatively recent transplant to the city, my method for getting to know more about Medford history, Medford politics, is just to go up to people who've lived here for a lot longer than me and say, Oh, hey, just,

126
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:59,733
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, tell me about this or I'll say something that's like, just my working theory of how something works.

127
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:03,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of the older residents will say, Oh, that, that doesn't work.

128
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,298
[SPEAKER_05]: They try that 20 years and I'm like, I'll just listen.

129
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so my, my really my way of sort of knowing what's going on is just to kind of like listen to people, get them talking.

130
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:24,601
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some listening workshops that we had in grad school and they've been incredibly helpful just for communication for me in general.

131
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:34,105
[SPEAKER_05]: What, like the stories that I kind of hear around Medford is that there's sort of like, there's what people call old Medford.

132
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:41,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm friends here with people whose families have been around since like the 1600s, um, like multi-generational or like lifelong residents.

133
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:46,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm friends here with people who they moved here relatively recently.

134
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:49,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford is one of the fastest growing cities in America.

135
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a recent article about that.

136
00:11:52,208 --> 00:12:06,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And sort of what people are like what people tell me is that in terms of politics There's like these two groups tend to clash what I really want to want to do is to reach out to

137
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:16,363
[SPEAKER_05]: the is reach out to residents that have been here a while and residents that, you know, are more recent because that's just the reality that we live in.

138
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:22,247
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of younger people do tend to live in multiple cities, I think, you know, but they're still stakeholders.

139
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:27,672
[SPEAKER_05]: They still need to be involved and say, you know, let's try to make this work for everybody.

140
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I,

141
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:46,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Unitarian, so I very much care about making sure that anybody from any race, religion, gender identity, sexuality feels engaged, needed, in the process, supported.

142
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:49,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a military officer.

143
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:57,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's very important to me to make sure that veterans, first responders, et cetera, know that they're appreciated and know that

144
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,331
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I really want to have them in the fold.

145
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:19,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's, and I'm very aware that there's been sort of conflicts going on there in the past, but like, I really just want to try to fix, like, heal that, naive as I may sound, and say, okay, um,

146
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,808
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we need change in Medford.

147
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:23,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to build things.

148
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been in gridlock for a while.

149
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:26,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a whole lot has been built.

150
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:31,638
[SPEAKER_05]: What can we do to make that work for everybody?

151
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:33,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

152
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:44,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And like these issues like affordable housing, I feel like if we're looking at it as like two sides of the city that I could see both having a perspective of supporting that, right?

153
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:50,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the people that have lived here forever being priced out of it, or the new generation is not being able to live here, right?

154
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And younger folks like yourself, like wanting to

155
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,263
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to own property in this city.

156
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those groups are being excluded.

157
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Affordable housing does tend to be one of those.

158
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:09,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very polarizing topic and it's something that needs to be approached.

159
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:14,098
[SPEAKER_05]: handle carefully.

160
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:20,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, young people, we don't want to be paying like 70 plus percent of our salaries and rent.

161
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:22,284
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be able to invest and buy.

162
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I went to the senior center the other day for one of their events.

163
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I started talking to people and they were saying, you know, we don't want our, like, we don't want our home prices to be completely devalued.

164
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you're talking about affordable housing.

165
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is our entire

166
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:40,838
[SPEAKER_05]: life's income and that.

167
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their nest egg.

168
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a matter of balance.

169
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:56,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I think something that everybody can sort of get behind in terms of affordable housing is we do need to build more.

170
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Rezoning in the city is incredibly important.

171
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:05,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's affordable housing that can be built on top of, for instance, storefronts in Medford Square and South Medford.

172
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:16,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the rezoning process is critical in making sure that there is money in Medford to actually pay for those affordable housing projects when they come around.

173
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:32,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So, recently the City Council, with a lot of lobbying from Housing Medford, passed the Affordable Housing Trust, and this is basically a pile of money that can be used to build affordable housing.

174
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,668
[SPEAKER_05]: like a lot of other municipalities had that.

175
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It took us a while to get there, but now we're there.

176
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:46,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the idea, what needs to be done is to come up with revenue streams to sort of build up that pile.

177
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:50,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once rezoning is done, once, you know,

178
00:15:51,635 --> 00:16:14,781
[SPEAKER_05]: that process happens and there are people really trying to push that through, then we are actually able to build housing in more places that residents need it without necessarily devaluing the properties of seniors who've invested their entire life's income into their property.

179
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:18,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are ways to make this work for everybody.

180
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:24,999
[SPEAKER_05]: that city, that city councils can affect.

181
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:25,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

182
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,501
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so interesting.

183
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:35,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it sounds like you're, you've been involved in a lot of, um, committees and other groups in the city.

184
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any, any work that you want to amplify that you're involved in right now?

185
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, so, I mean, you're involved.

186
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:49,571
[SPEAKER_05]: You're involved in this as well.

187
00:16:50,512 --> 00:17:00,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And I resigned when I began the campaign, but I would say that the Medford Charter Study Committee is hugely important.

188
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,798
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also probably one of the more

189
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:28,211
[SPEAKER_05]: boring I want to say tasks most misunderstood things but part of my platform and It's not it's not front and center because I'm aware that most people don't really aren't really too aware of like what the charter is Or it's important, but the time I did spend on the Medford Charter Study Committee I realized how critical it is to really, you know changing things in the city So

190
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:41,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically taking a step back, Medford has a charter, which is sort of like its governing document, you know, the constitution for the city.

191
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And so far what we've kind of, what we did on the Medford Charter Study Committee was we realized that Medford's charter, you know, it's

192
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:54,454
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, just not a very well written document.

193
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's very incomplete.

194
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: If you read the whole document, you don't really know how the city government in Medford works.

195
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,161
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it defaults to state law in many places.

196
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:09,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it needs to be, uh, reviewed.

197
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be, um, uh,

198
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:25,137
[SPEAKER_05]: changed potentially and as a city councilor I've kind of glued myself to supporting the work of the Charter Study Committee just because you know what

199
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,260
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a committee that is taking expert feedback.

200
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:39,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a committee that's taking public feedback to understand, you know, just review all these issues like do we need at-large award-based representation?

201
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:43,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we, like, should there be term limits?

202
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:44,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we have

203
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,650
[SPEAKER_05]: a strong mayoral system.

204
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,753
[SPEAKER_05]: What should the relationship between the city council and the mayor look like?

205
00:18:55,273 --> 00:19:02,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And these issues are very critical for sort of forming the political landscape within Medford.

206
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:10,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a piece of work that I would really like to emphasize and really like to point out the importance of it.

207
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Just

208
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:21,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally speaking, the work that's being done by the Community Preservation Committee is also very important there.

209
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:36,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're overseeing the state-funded affordable housing projects, which is Walkling Court, and really trying to get more units into that and collecting public feedback for doing that.

210
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:46,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the Community Preservation Committee, so that is a project that is hugely important as well.

211
00:19:47,500 --> 00:20:03,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, any affordable housing projects that do come up in Medford, because they only come along once every few years, and when they do hit, it's very important to have the city be ready to support that as well as they can.

212
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:04,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

213
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:07,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And Charter Study Committee, we're having an event on June 8th.

214
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:12,702
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode might come out after that, but we will have one also in the fall, I believe, too.

215
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to look out for.

216
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:21,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you were saying before, the importance of entry into city government by applying and working on some of those boards.

217
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:22,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.

218
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:38,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the charter has a lot to do with lots of people's complaints about the city, and they have no idea that the way that our charter is written or not written, whether the case may be that it has a lot to do with what people maybe have.

219
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,916
[SPEAKER_01]: observations about their dissatisfaction with some of the way that our city government works.

220
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've learned a lot from it.

221
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I encourage people to.

222
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:47,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

223
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,360
[SPEAKER_05]: The meetings are public.

224
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can attend.

225
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:51,862
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very educational.

226
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:52,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

227
00:20:52,503 --> 00:21:05,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we're not, I don't think it, everybody should be expected to be an expert on, uh, municipal charters, but just attending one or two meetings, it becomes pretty, uh, pretty eyeopening.

228
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:06,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

229
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:18,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, as a city councilor, I really want to, I will support the work of the Charter Study Committee that they're doing in the future.

230
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, like,

231
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:31,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes, and if people can't make it to our event there is an episode from last year with Melvin McDonald Who's the chair of our study committee?

232
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,891
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a brain for this stuff that I don't so really important.

233
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was amazing.

234
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just I appreciate you noting that that I

235
00:21:42,570 --> 00:22:10,212
[SPEAKER_05]: document is incomplete and possibly poorly written because I think when a lot of folks look at legalese it's really easy to think like well I probably just don't get it and the capital necessary to say this is this is a mess it needs to be rewritten is helpful yeah no it uh I mean when people say like when people say you know charter review they think oh you want to change everything about the city and it's like okay so you know we the charter should be changed but

236
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:37,622
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not even like we're not even necessarily suggesting like like substantial political changes it should just be better written you know the document should be in a state where if somebody reads the entire thing and they're not an expert in state law they should be able to know how metford operates and it's not currently in that state i think our charter is like what like a couple pages of that and most charters are like

237
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:45,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no mention of like women in the charter or even the school committee.

238
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:49,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so just like lots of stuff Yeah, well we could talk about this forever, but um, thank you for sharing so

239
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:00,891
[SPEAKER_01]: just have a couple kind of more personal questions about you.

240
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:12,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do seem like a community oriented guy, like you've shared a couple of just like, sounds like you kind of immediately attached yourself to some like community building groups in the city and, and the Unitarian Church.

241
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:16,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder kind of what you most appreciate about the Medford community.

242
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:17,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it's

243
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:26,062
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that are willing to dedicate so much of their free time to making this place run.

244
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, y'all are a great example of that.

245
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:33,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You're running a podcast just about Medford topics.

246
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:45,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to be taken for granted like the you know, their local journalism has been decimated in recent years and just having Outlets that people know what's going on.

247
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually important.

248
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:52,909
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the former chair of the Medford Charter Study Committee Laurel she

249
00:23:53,929 --> 00:24:00,574
[SPEAKER_05]: recently resigned to take a job in City Hall, she spent so much of her time making a community arts center happen.

250
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:08,479
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just different groups like Safe Medford, Housing Medford, there's all those city boards we were talking about earlier.

251
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:18,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are by and large, a few of them have minor stipends, but by and large, it's people dedicating their free time just to make the city run.

252
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: that is some like, I'd say like, that's what attracted me most about it.

253
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:31,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the amount of people who really want to just dedicate a huge portion of their lives to making this place happen.

254
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is what I appreciate about it.

255
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:39,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and could you share with us something about you that might surprise us?

256
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

257
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:47,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we got a little teaser before we started.

258
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:51,602
[SPEAKER_05]: This was something that we were sort of, that I was like, kind of, that I was kind of like kind of like, I was like, okay.

259
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:57,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I, you know, I'm a product of an military family.

260
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:02,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to 13 different schools across five States before I turned 18.

261
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've kind of been, I, you know, there's a lot of moving around there in high school.

262
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I.

263
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:19,574
[SPEAKER_05]: was voted my, my superlative was most unique, which was something, it was something that I really, that I was really proud of.

264
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:29,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like, you know, I, I tend to dress like in a very like standard nonchalant way, but I was always hanging out with art students in high school.

265
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:33,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I got the most unique superlative, like my best friend was just kind of jealous.

266
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:37,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you don't even dress weird.

267
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:39,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, yeah.

268
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a point of pride for me.

269
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:47,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

270
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Begs the question, what does unique mean?

271
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:54,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

272
00:25:54,054 --> 00:26:07,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So the full story with that one was in high school, my first involvement in student politics, I'm kind of hesitant to even share this story, but basically there was

273
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:29,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran for student body president on a joke campaign speech and it was a speech that was like broadcast four times across classroom TVs and I ended up like just memorizing a speech staring straight at the camera and just like saying and just saying like okay

274
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:36,481
[SPEAKER_05]: my platform is to make, if you vote for me, Matt Leming, we will have puppies and kittens rain from the sky.

275
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,983
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have three-day weekends every week.

276
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:47,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was such a unique experience because I think everybody talked about, everybody was talking about it for weeks afterwards.

277
00:26:47,912 --> 00:26:48,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I won the election and

278
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:56,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just such an interesting experience for me because before that I was kind of like this quiet kid in the class.

279
00:26:56,578 --> 00:27:03,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I was in honors courses, but like I was saying, I was hanging out with art students, so I didn't really, like, know them too well.

280
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:07,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not, like, kind of nonchalant.

281
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:12,849
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, after that, it was, like, suddenly, like, everybody was, like, wanting to get to know me.

282
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:15,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I was, like, the head of student government, so it was just, like, this

283
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:18,407
[SPEAKER_05]: such a weird 180.

284
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:36,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that was my, no, just, and I did, I worked my teeth out in that role, even though it was a Joe campaign speech, I spent a lot of time, um, as a student body president in my high school.

285
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:37,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

286
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:43,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, speaking of campaigns, do you have,

287
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:50,441
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts to share with folks around your upcoming work and potential ways to get involved, jump in, contribute?

288
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:50,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

289
00:27:51,741 --> 00:28:03,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if you want to get involved, volunteer, then, you know, mattLeming.com, there is a volunteer signup form if you would like.

290
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that's very important to mention about local campaigns is that, you know, the people running these things, we're

291
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,608
[SPEAKER_05]: most of us are not personally wealthy people.

292
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:18,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, I'm a, I'm a postdoc.

293
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:26,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually, I'm actually doing some work in union organizing down at Mass General, um, because we're not paid a whole lot at all.

294
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:30,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and we're not personally wealthy people.

295
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:36,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if you, if anything in this sounded appealing to the listeners and please

296
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:46,160
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, donate if you don't think you have the time to volunteer, um, or just, just donate to whatever your favorite local candidates are.

297
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hugely important, um, to us.

298
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:54,046
[SPEAKER_05]: These things cost $25,000 to run a local campaign.

299
00:28:54,766 --> 00:29:03,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you know, if neither of those things, and please vote November 7th, um, that is the general election date.

300
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:05,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's,

301
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,556
[SPEAKER_05]: local politics, hugely important, affects a lot.

302
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally speaking, the odd-numbered election years don't see quite as much turnout.

303
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,359
[SPEAKER_05]: We would really like to see more, as many people as possible.

304
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:25,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that is my kind of plug, ways for people to get involved.

305
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a primary for the municipal election?

306
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:28,262
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

307
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:29,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's September 12th.

308
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:29,882
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

309
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the primary is a little bit weird because I believe, so the way it works is that if there are, there are seven city council seats, if there are, um, less than 14, if there are 14 or fewer declared candidates, then they don't have a primary and go to the elections office to like, but I believe this is how it works.

310
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,881
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are more than there are like, you know,

311
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:01,689
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 16 or so declared candidates, then they will have a primary on September 12th.

312
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The top 14 of those then go on to the generals.

313
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:09,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So in election years where like

314
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:14,107
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's like a state rep level thing.

315
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,827
[SPEAKER_05]: The primary is like the most important election.

316
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:22,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but in you in municipal elections, it's the general election on the 7th.

317
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:24,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the most important one.

318
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:26,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, vote on the primary as well though.

319
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be very much appreciated.

320
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,271
[SPEAKER_05]: September 12th and then November 7th.

321
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:32,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks Matt.

322
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:33,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

323
