[SPEAKER_01]: final agenda item and that zoning overhaul updates that the city was going to give an update on.

81
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:18,551
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, Danielle, we've agreed that you're going to send us some materials to review first and perhaps put it on the next meeting.

82
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:25,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it looks like Director Hunt

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,641
[SPEAKER_02]: just emailed out the memo.

84
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:36,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should have it now, not to discuss tonight, but just so you know that this is the one that came through that you can review.

85
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:46,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, she included the slides to the presentation to the city council subcommittee meeting that was held on Wednesday.

86
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are an alternating Wednesdays from you all's meeting.

87
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:54,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and his associates gave that presentation to

88
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: The new subcommittee is called it's the permit and it's permitting and planning maybe zoning subcommittee.

89
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:09,745
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all been renamed and that one is not rolling off the tongue.

90
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:17,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were unable to watch that, you don't have to.

91
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you wanted to see the presentation, you could go on to the medfordtv.org.

92
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:41,593
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever the Medford Community Media website is, those recordings where all the board, city board meetings are, folks can review that or watch that to see the questions and the conversations that occurred then.

93
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it was going through

94
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:57,274
[SPEAKER_02]: the timeline and what issues will be tackled first this fiscal year, and which will be started next fiscal year, starting in July.

95
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:05,419
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more like the low-hanging fruit, urgent things that don't need further study.

96
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll get into the real meaty stuff in FY25.

97
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:18,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

98
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:30,964
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I go to adjournment, do you want, is there anything from Miscellaneous that the board or city staff will want to discuss outside of the zoning overhaul updates?

99
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:35,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything else.

100
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,731
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I will ask for a motion to adjourn.

101
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:47,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I move.

102
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,173
