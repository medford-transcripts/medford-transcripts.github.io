34
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:17,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro, if you could give a quick update and let us know if we should move this forward.

35
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:25,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, well, we discussed the wildlife feeding ordinance offered by Vice President Collins.

36
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:30,378
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something that was brought to her by constituents interested in

37
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:31,918
[SPEAKER_10]: to move it out of committee at this time.

38
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,940
[SPEAKER_10]: We are protecting public health and community safety.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It's appropriate for the committee, and we did not vote to move it out of committee at this time.

40
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:48,929
[SPEAKER_10]: The two motions that came out of this meeting were to refer this version of the ordinance to keep the law for legal review prior to our next meeting on the

41
00:01:56,234 --> 00:02:08,236
[SPEAKER_10]: re-circulate the document to relevant city staff, which it's been passed on now to the animal control officer, and we're going to keep this paper in committee for the time being.

42
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:10,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

43
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:15,107
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to approve the report, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

44
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:15,847
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

45
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:16,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

46
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

47
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

48
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,230
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-033, offered by Vice President Collins, Planning and Permitting Committee report.

49
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:32,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We met last week on Wednesday, March 13th to kick off our zoning reforms with the Innis Associates and Barbroski Silverstein team.

50
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: So super exciting times ahead of us for

51
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:43,388
[SPEAKER_02]: probably like 20 to 24 public meetings in this council on zoning reform over the next 18 months, which should be very exciting.

52
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

53
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

54
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:49,313
[SPEAKER_08]: public should know too.

55
00:02:49,353 --> 00:03:02,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this council, I think way back a few years ago, when we started with Mr. Borbowski and changing our zoning codification and moving this forward, I think this is a big piece that we haven't seen in Medford in a long time.

56
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:08,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I like is that this process really allows the community to get involved

57
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:16,225
[SPEAKER_08]: and neighborhood to neighborhood to make sure that everybody is part of the solution of what you want your method to look like.

58
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that council bears did a lot of hard work.

59
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:25,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we made sure that was in the budget to make sure that that funding was there.

60
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be cheap, but I think it's something that we haven't seen in how many years now?

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the first half, that was the first time in 60 years.

62
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,642
[SPEAKER_08]: 60 years, right.

63
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,924
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a good message to the community.

64
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:40,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

65
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

66
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:49,248
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callaghan to approve the committee report.

67
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:50,633
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

68
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

69
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

70
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:52,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

71
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:59,360
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-015, offered by Councilor Lemingng, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee report, March 13th.

72
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemingng.

73
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:01,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

74
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:07,046
[SPEAKER_06]: We discussed Councilor Tseng's paper to develop a

75
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,828
[SPEAKER_06]: more comprehensive communication strategy for City Council.

76
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:21,614
[SPEAKER_06]: In particular, we decided to adopt a monthly newsletter and that motion, we passed a motion to do so.

77
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way that that is going to

78
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:46,865
[SPEAKER_06]: work is councillors will be on an alternating schedule, taking turns drafting the newsletter, after which it will be approved at the monthly Resident Services and Public Engagement meeting, and we will then meet to approve it, amend it as necessary, and then send it out to

79
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:54,547
[SPEAKER_06]: the appropriate avenues as well.

80
00:04:54,767 --> 00:05:03,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Smearty was there, so we talked with him as well about developing this newsletter and general communication strategy.

81
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:09,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro also agreed to develop some social media, to draft some social media

82
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:17,239
[SPEAKER_06]: to bring to the next to the public engagement meeting next month as well.

83
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So I sent out a request to my colleagues to develop the calendar that we will then be relying on to

84
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: to rotate responsibilities for drafting the newsletter.

85
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I decided to draft the first one to provide an example of the formatting, which will then be discussed at next month's meeting.

86
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:43,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to thank my colleagues who have responded thus far that they are willing and able to draft newsletters in the coming term.

87
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also encourage those who have not found time to

88
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:53,168
[SPEAKER_06]: do so to, if they're willing and able to, to do that as well.

89
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, that's the report.

90
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

91
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,173
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion of Councilor Lemingng.

92
00:05:59,193 --> 00:05:59,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

93
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

94
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:03,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I think that I had some opposition.

95
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:05,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the idea is sound.

96
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:13,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we still, I haven't heard at least that we have put together a plan on how we're going to get this letter out

97
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:15,345
[SPEAKER_08]: to everyone.

98
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:25,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I think drafting a newsletter that can only be reached by a few and not all, I think it's, I just think it's a slippery slope like I told you.

99
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that if it's not reaching our most

100
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: needy community members and without having a plan in place because I don't think we've invited anybody from communications to work with us.

101
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:50,459
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're moving things forward and we still haven't got any answers, at least for me, as we're going forward with this and how we're going to move this newsletter forward, where is it going to go to?

102
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:56,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to go to people that are already in the know for the most part.

103
00:06:58,032 --> 00:06:59,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

104
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:00,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

105
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:07,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want this to be bogged down in discussions about the idea in particular, because this is just the approved meeting minutes.

106
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would respectfully disagree.

107
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we can't be setting up too high of a standard that we can't meet.

108
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't let perfect be the enemy of good.

109
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:20,987
[SPEAKER_03]: and we need to be reaching out to residents with all channels necessarily.

110
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the motions that came out of that meeting was to have a continuous discussion in that committee about ways to improve outreach.

111
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: We are actually working very closely with our communications director on this, and he's very, very supportive of this project.

112
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:41,287
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants us to do it and to see it succeed, and he wants to help us promote it as well.

113
00:07:42,027 --> 00:08:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about at that meeting a number of different avenues to disseminate this information from the Medford Community Media, Senior Center Newsletter, social media, as Councilor Lemingng and Councilor Lazzaro talked about, and through building an email list and texting WhatsApp groups.

114
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:10,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've talked about a number of options that we're exploring, many of which are options that we already have as a council.

115
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor say on the motion of Council.

116
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me to approve the committee report seconded by Councilor Callahan.

117
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:17,012
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

118
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

119
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes 24 to 0458 Cambridge Health Alliance 1 Cabot Road special permit for medical office use public hearing notice.

120
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,481

[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford City Council shall conduct a public hearing on March 19th 2024 at 7 PM in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall.

122
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,390
[SPEAKER_02]: 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and via Zoom.

123
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,113
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zoom link to the public hearing will be posted no later than 48 hours prior to the meeting.

124
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:55,420
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant, Cambridge Health Alliance, is seeking a special permit subject to site plan review to establish a medical office used within an existing building at 1 Cabot Road, located in the Office O Zoning District.

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Plans for this project may be viewed in the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, City Hall Room 308, or on the city's website at https://www.medfordma.org

126
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:11,831
[SPEAKER_02]: community-development-board by clicking on current CD board filings.

127
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a reasonable accommodation to attend or participate in this meeting, please contact Francis Nwaje, 781-393-2439 at Nwaje at medford-ma.gov.

128
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:34,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we will do is we will hear from a presentation by the proponent Cambridge Health Alliance, and then it will open the public hearing for us to hear from members of the public in favor or against, or who have questions about the project.

129
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Come to the podium.

130
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: You might need to press the button just once.

131
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,391
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

132
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to give you a really great read.

133
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again.

134
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:08,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have the green light now.

135
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:11,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a child of the 20th century, so my apologies.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,621
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the system of the 19th.

137
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:20,554
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is a fantastically beautiful city hall.

138
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my editorial comment.

139
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:26,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the city of Method should be very proud to have such a city hall in all sincerity.

140
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,781
[SPEAKER_02]: A New Deal WPA project.

141
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

142
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

143
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get marble anymore.

144
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:34,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, to start anew, I'm Andrew Fuqua.

145
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,508
[SPEAKER_07]: That's F as in Frank, U as in...

146
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:42,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Unicorn, Q as in quick, U as in unicorn, A as in apple, for the record.

147
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the general counsel at Cambridge Health Alliance.

148
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:54,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I am here also joined via Zoom by our zoning counsel, Paul Feldman of Davis Mom.

149
00:10:55,126 --> 00:11:01,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Paul will be pulling up the presentation, but if he is not, I will be doing so.

150
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we're giving Paul access now.

151
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say, feel free to give

152
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:11,779
[SPEAKER_02]: a presentation summary, and then we can go to the Councilors for questions, and they may refer to some of your slides.

153
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:22,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, while Paul's pulling up the slide, the relief we're seeking is, again, for a special permit for medical office use.

154
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:28,349
[SPEAKER_07]: This is under E3 of the Table of Use and Parking Regulations.

155
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:39,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're also seeking approval of site plan review for a major project pursuant to section 94-11-7.2, because this is a medical office use of 10,000 square feet or more.

156
00:11:47,857 --> 00:12:07,444
[SPEAKER_07]: As you read in the preamble, the Community Development Board has recommended approval of both the special permit and the site plan review with conditions following a hearing held before that board last Wednesday on March 13th, 2024.

157
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:08,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, Paul.

158
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:26,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So for those of you who aren't familiar about what Cambridge Health Alliance is, or who we are, Cambridge Health Alliance is a public health care system that was created by the Massachusetts legislature in 1996.

159
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:27,494
[SPEAKER_07]: We were created when

160
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:41,075
[SPEAKER_07]: The Cambridge City Hospital was spun off and joined with the Somerville Hospital into a new independent public instrumentality.

161
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:51,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Later in 2001, we added the then Witten Hospital before Hallmark Health was to close it.

162
00:12:53,129 --> 00:13:01,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The mission of Cambridge Health Alliance as a safety net organization is to improve the health of the communities that we serve in our primary area.

163
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:09,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Those being Malden, sorry, Medford, Malden, Chelsea, Revere, Somerville, and Cambridge.

164
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:15,960
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a safety net, we specialize in the care of underserved populations.

165
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:20,803
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one of the highest Medicaid mixes in the state.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,981
[SPEAKER_07]: if not the highest.

167
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,123
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we, what do we do?

168
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:34,132
[SPEAKER_07]: We operate two inpatient hospital campuses, full acute care hospitals in Cambridge and in Everett.

169
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:44,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also operate an inpatient child psychiatry hospital at the former Somerville Hospital campus on Highland Avenue.

170
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:57,611
[SPEAKER_07]: But even though the hospital is what people think of us when they think of healthcare organizations, what we really are at our core is an ambulatory network.

171
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:06,937
[SPEAKER_07]: We operate 15 clinics in the communities I listed, including four school-based health centers.

172
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:19,544
[SPEAKER_07]: and we serve a primary care panel of approximately, give or take, hopefully it's going up, 128,000 primary care patients on our active panel.

173
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:32,891
[SPEAKER_07]: So our primary mission is to reach out and ensure that members of the community can receive the care they need, obviously before they need to go into the hospital.

174
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:59,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So by way of background for this application, CHA currently operates a primary care and orthopedics and rehab center at Assembly Square in Somerville in an office building just across the parking lot from the Home Depot, if any of you are familiar with that area.

175
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:07,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, the owner of that property has determined that a better use for that would be as a lab building.

176
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:19,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be required to exit that building by September 2025 so that it can be torn down for lab space.

177
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: This caused us to look around where is an alternative in the area that can meet the needs of the communities we served.

178
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we looked about, there were several criteria that we considered.

179
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:44,335
[SPEAKER_07]: The two major criteria were, one, is this a location that's accessible for patients that we serve?

180
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And then second,

181
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:55,848
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's accessible when they come, will they have parking or will they be able to use public transportation?

182
00:15:56,728 --> 00:16:01,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And we allude upon one cabinet as meeting those criteria.

183
00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:11,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Significantly for us also is that this location is in Medford.

184
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Cambridge Health Alliance up to this date, we serve members of the Medford community, but we serve members of the Medford community in sites that are very adjacent to the Medford community.

185
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:36,561
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's something important about actually being in that community and investing in a community and being invested in the community.

186
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:44,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've located one cabot, which as I mentioned, is accessible to public transportation.

187
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul's moving one step ahead of me, but that's good for him.

188
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:57,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And we signed up a 15 year lease with the Davis companies for space on the second floor.

189
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:09,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's approximately a 56,000 square foot space and approximately 42,000 of which we'll be able to actually use for clinical space.

190
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:16,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And this project will entail only interior renovations.

191
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:25,203
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping to have renovations completed by sometime in the summer of 2025 so that we can move in at that time.

192
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:31,414
[SPEAKER_07]: kick off operations by September, by Labor Day.

193
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:41,017
[SPEAKER_07]: The one cabin roads building itself, again, in this building will not be, there won't be any exterior renovations.

194
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:53,742
[SPEAKER_07]: As mentioned in the preamble, it's located in an office zoning district, and the current property complies, fully complies with all zoning dimensional requirements.

195
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:54,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 300,

196
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,232
[SPEAKER_07]: 308,000 square feet.

197
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:03,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And the building coverage is less than 24% of the lot.

198
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It has 941 parking spaces available.

199
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:18,867
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I mentioned before, all the improvements will be interior improvements, subject of course, to putting like new air handling systems on the roof.

200
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:23,657
[SPEAKER_07]: The service to be offered will be all outpatient.

201
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:26,200
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be no inpatient services provided.

202
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:30,145
[SPEAKER_07]: The largest service that we'll be providing is primary care.

203
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We will also be providing orthopedics and rehab services at the clinic.

204
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:39,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the patients who are presenting at the clinic, we will also offer

205
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:47,225
[SPEAKER_07]: onsite laboratory services for blood draws and the like so that they don't have to go to another location.

206
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:51,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And also an onsite pharmacy to serve our patients.

207
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:59,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, so that they're able to pick up their scripts when they leave their visit.

208
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:04,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have an integrated pharmacy through our electronic medical record.

209
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,629
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, as I mentioned,

210
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:15,257
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have a rehab space for doing physical therapy and rehab.

211
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:20,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have some procedure suites for non-surgical ambulatory procedures.

212
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:27,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing that requires hospitalization, but little things that can be done in an ambulatory site.

213
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:43,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also, finally, we have our own employee health service for our own employees, but we also serve as an employee health service for other employers, and that's our occupational health service, which will be located there.

214
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, please.

215
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,248
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's okay.

216
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're done, I think.

217
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:56,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's a broad picture up on the screen of the overall layout of the second floor.

218
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of little, it's impossible to read, so why don't we move to the next slide.

219
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:13,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And if Paul's able to swirl his cursor, he's, we'll have up at the top in that rounded area will be our central registration area.

220
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:23,682
[SPEAKER_07]: To the left of that with those pink rooms will be our procedure suite, various prep rooms, recovery rooms, and then the actual procedure rooms.

221
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:32,479
[SPEAKER_07]: To the right of the semicircular arrow is where we will have our outpatient lab drawing stations.

222
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:41,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the bottom of the picture is where we will have our pharmacy for patients and also the occupational health clinic rooms.

223
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:45,068
[SPEAKER_07]: On the next slide, thank you, Paul.

224
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,272
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where the meat of the clinic is at the top.

225
00:20:50,816 --> 00:21:01,105
[SPEAKER_07]: is where we'll have our 24, it's currently anticipated to be 24 primary care exam rooms and related office space.

226
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll have approximately 21

227
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:16,174
[SPEAKER_07]: rooms that we use for our orthopedics, our podiatry, and related services that we can actually flex a little bit with our primary care.

228
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:23,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we decide to bring in another medical specialty, we can flex in and out of those rooms.

229
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at the very bottom is the space for our rehab area.

230
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:32,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide, Paul.

231
00:21:36,525 --> 00:22:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as I believe you mentioned in the preamble, the Community Development Board did recommend approval of both the site plan review and the special permit with conditions, and CHA finds all of those conditions that have been suggested or recommended by the Community Development Board to be acceptable.

232
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

233
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:08,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

234
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:09,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpellilli.

235
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

236
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:20,578
[SPEAKER_08]: First, working in Somerville, I think that our community, especially when I was coaching, we saw the benefits that CHA provided for our students.

237
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:30,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And being there and having an on-site office at Somerville High School paid huge dividends for our kids, especially our kids with need.

238
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:41,564
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest question that we'll hear whenever you hear of an ambulatory center or hospital setting that's coming into your community, what are people thinking?

239
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:44,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Loss, tax base, right?

240
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:53,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is, you said a lot of great things that you do in Somerville, Revere, Cambridge, right?

241
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:54,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Everett.

242
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:58,026
[SPEAKER_08]: What is CHA going to come for Medford?

243
00:22:58,066 --> 00:22:59,747
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to see from Medford?

244
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: You're coming over the line, right over the line.

245
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:06,973
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that with public transportation, you're still going to get the sum of residents is still going to benefit.

246
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Your residents coming from that are still going to benefit from that area.

247
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,998
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, what is CHA?

248
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,802
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to do to really become part of our community?

249
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:28,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they actively trying to pursue some sort of outreach, maybe to set up a site at Medford High School, like we have at Summerville High or Cambridge High School, where we can benefit?

250
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:31,455
[SPEAKER_08]: from having CHA in our community.

251
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:44,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I think being on the outskirts sounds great because Somerville still benefits from it, but they now have another area where they can now have a huge tax base where the

252
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:46,589
[SPEAKER_08]: facility is.

253
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:53,435
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could share anything that can help constituents that have been reaching out to me and saying, Well, here we go.

254
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:58,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Another loss of tax base, and it's still in some of it.

255
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, so well, I've got some very good news for the city of Method.

256
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:04,686
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so good for Cambridge Health Alliance.

257
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:09,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Shia, please.

258
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:16,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, Cambridge Health Alliance is not purchasing this property, so it will not be taxed.

259
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:16,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

260
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be no diminution in tax revenue.

261
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:26,256
[SPEAKER_07]: To your other point, and I think this is the most important point.

262
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:36,651
[SPEAKER_07]: It's essential that we outreach to members of the community, and especially to members of the community that need services.

263
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we look, that ranges the full spectrum.

264
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:47,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That ranges from youth all the way to the senior members of our community.

265
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we try to do so in a couple ways.

266
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:55,158
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned the school-based health center.

267
00:24:55,198 --> 00:25:09,201
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something certainly we could look into and we could try to see what we can just engage in discussions with the Department of Public Health and with the Medford schools because it is important to outreach to the community.

268
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:17,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned the description of Cambridge Health Alliance being having hospitals and having outpatient clinics.

269
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:27,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one thing that makes us very, very different is we also have an extraordinarily extensive community health improvement department.

270
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from your time in Somerville, did you work with Doug Press?

271
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was a great asset.

272
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:37,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug is now our, heads up our community health improvement department.

273
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:38,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Great asset, great.

274
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:48,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And we try to work with the public health departments and other private entities and organizations

275
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:56,538
[SPEAKER_07]: within our communities to identify need and partner with them to address those needs.

276
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:57,759
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

277
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think that I know it's a public meeting, so we have to open it, but

278
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's, especially if we have the access to tap into a CHA to help our neediest members of our community, I think this would be a win-win, especially if the naysayers that are afraid of taxes won't be affected.

279
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would support it once we move through the process.

280
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:25,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

281
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:27,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

282
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro.

283
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:34,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you able to explain the conditions that were offered by the Community Development Board?

284
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have them.

285
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, we do have them, but I can recognize them.

286
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:48,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle, if you could just share the conditions or if there are any highlights from the conditions that we're CD board recommended.

287
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:50,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

288
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

289
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:55,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Danielle Evans, senior planner and office of planning development sustainability.

290
00:26:56,057 --> 00:27:02,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yes, the, you should have, um, the,

291
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:13,601
[SPEAKER_11]: PDS memo, which goes through the process and the findings of the CD board.

292
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:18,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me open up the, just give me one second.

293
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:20,485
[SPEAKER_11]: How did it open?

294
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I could share my screen, Danielle, if you want.

295
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,069
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be helpful.

296
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,311
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want me to share my screen, I could.

297
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:42,046
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have it up on my screen.

298
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I can read them.

299
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think I don't think we need to read all of them.

300
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if there's just highlights of any senior planner, Evans thinks we should be aware.

301
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:53,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

302
00:27:54,016 --> 00:28:01,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So there were three conditions that were that they're recommending approval and

303
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: essentially the traffic impact assessment does show that there'd be, you know, increased trips generated from this use versus existing Amazon offices.

304
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:29,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So to try to convert some of those trips to, you know, pedestrian and cyclists and cycling and to also encourage EV users, we have these three conditions.

305
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,509
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is

306
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:39,674
[SPEAKER_11]: The applicant shall work with the property owner slash management to add an EV charging station in the designated CHA visitor parking area if reasonably feasible.

307
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:55,004
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, the applicant shall work with the property owner slash management to provide wayfinding signage to direct visitors to the existing EV charging stations located on the site and clearly indicate that these existing stations are available for use by visitors to the CHA facility.

308
00:28:56,489 --> 00:29:02,394
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one is the applicant shall work with the property owner to add bicycle racks for visitors near the building entrances.

309
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:12,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, the applicant shall work with the property owner slash management to provide wayfinding signage on the property to direct pedestrians arriving by a public transit to the entrance of the building.

310
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:23,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And we felt, staff and the city board felt that with these conditions, it would meet the criteria for issuance of a special permit and approval of a site plan.

311
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Senior Planner Evans.

312
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions by members of the Council?

313
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:33,242
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

314
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:41,324
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, I'm going to open the public hearing to anyone who wants to speak in favor, against, or otherwise about this project.

315
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:44,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in favor of the project?

316
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing it's a yes.

317
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:51,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

318
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:52,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

319
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:59,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could just give folks, if anyone wants to come to the podium to speak regarding this project, they're welcome to do so or raise your hand on Zoom.

320
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:06,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give it a second.

321
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, the public hearing is closed.

322
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any motions on the floor?

323
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:22,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

324
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:26,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve with the conditions attached to the CD board.

325
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:27,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

326
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:27,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

327
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:34,150
[SPEAKER_02]: With the conditions of the Community Development Board by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

328
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,750

[SPEAKER_02]: 16 affirmatives, none of the negative one absent.

343
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:00,129
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes and the special permit is approved.

344
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:11,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So Cambridge Health Alliance thanks the city council and we look forward to increased business within the city of Method and helping improve its health.

345
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:12,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

346
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:14,132
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be in for our physicals next week.

347
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:15,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

348
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:20,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

349
00:31:20,153 --> 00:31:20,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

350
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:33,654
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can, can I suspend the rules to move paper 24053 to the head of the line there, Mr. President, if we can?

351
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:37,356
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, to suspend the rules to take paper 24-053, seconded by?

352
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:40,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

353
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,088
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

354
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

355
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:43,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

356
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

357
00:31:45,870 --> 00:32:00,657
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-053, be it resolved, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council invite the leadership team from the Medford Fire Department to discuss the well-being of our fire personnel during a difficult few weeks of major fires and other outside distractions.

358
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

359
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:02,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

360
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,851
[SPEAKER_08]: This was something that was put forth weeks ago.

361
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:16,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that President Buckley was here patiently, and I appreciate you allowing us to move this to the front.

362
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:19,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that to go back a little bit

363
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:34,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We had, at the time, something that I have a resolution later that we could bring up, but I know that the mayor asked to make some drastic changes for our leadership team in the fire department, which caused a lot of uneasiness.

364
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:39,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of that stemmed from accusations of

365
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,288
[SPEAKER_08]: sick leave, sick time taken.

366
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:56,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And while this was going on, Medford had one huge fire, I believe a three alarm here in Medford, and then assisted and I believe a five alarm in Chelsea.

367
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:03,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with that, I know that I've talked to many firefighters and, and they

368
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:14,767
[SPEAKER_08]: to their words, feeling very unstable and very nervous, in a sense, in their working conditions.

369
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:27,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted Mr. Buckley, if you could, come up and just give us just a quick update on how our men and women are doing and how the process is so far with Chief Evans.

370
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:27,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can.

371
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

372
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to, really quickly, do we know if the interim chief is expected?

373
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:34,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, no.

374
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:35,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

375
00:33:35,834 --> 00:33:39,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions or discussion by councillors before we go to members of the public?

376
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:43,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, name and address for the record, please.

377
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:57,021
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

378
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought you're gonna ask some questions.

379
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:00,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I can't.

380
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:07,814
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor appointed Deputy Chief Evans to the position of chief.

381
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:12,539
[SPEAKER_15]: He's opened up lines of communication with the union so far.

382
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,981
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's

383
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:25,402
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the good things that's happened so far, she's also promoted a deputy captain and lieutenant that were due to be promoted in January, early January.

384
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:33,271
[SPEAKER_15]: We are waiting on a few promotions that the mayor has decided to do interviews for.

385
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:48,488
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll be, it's an issue with the union because it's a change in working conditions and how promotions are being made, but we'll handle that through the grievance process and the Department of Labor Relations charges.

386
00:34:52,551 --> 00:35:03,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spoken with Chief Evans once or twice so far, just talking about headquarters, progress with headquarters, promotions,

387
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:17,745
[SPEAKER_15]: But the one thing that our members are worried about right now, and I'm personally worried about, is we have members that are now coming to work sick, not feeling great.

388
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:20,647
[SPEAKER_15]: In our profession, we can't come to work if we're not 100%.

389
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:25,029
[SPEAKER_15]: If we have a stomachache, or my shoulder hurts, or my back hurts.

390
00:35:26,648 --> 00:35:38,776
[SPEAKER_15]: or the sniffles, whatever, we need to be 100% in order to do this job, because if we're not given 100%, we put our lives in danger, the people we work for, with, and the citizens of Medford.

391
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:45,060
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't just get up and go to the bathroom whenever we want, you know, sometimes we're on a roof or on the highway.

392
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:55,303
[SPEAKER_15]: So I feel that members are being discouraged from using their sick time now in fear of retaliation from the administration.

393
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:57,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the bad thing.

394
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Headquarters is moving forward, apparently, without the union.

395
00:36:04,026 --> 00:36:08,367
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's it.

396
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,888
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the questions that came about.

397
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:13,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked to a few firefighters that

398
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:17,584
[SPEAKER_08]: that are afraid to come up and mention that they were, I believe.

399
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:26,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe one of them told me one of the stations had a terrible case of the stomach virus.

400
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:32,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were a lot of identified dehydrated firefighters at one time.

401
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, I just don't understand.

402
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:36,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Just take your time off.

403
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:49,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that this is what this is where the dialogues that's the plan when you bring politics and why you need to bring politics into the situation.

404
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:49,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Because

405
00:36:50,976 --> 00:37:01,085
[SPEAKER_08]: of discussion from the beginning of these issues we've had here is that we want to keep politics out of the firefighters purview and, you know, stop being there.

406
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:07,411
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one member told me that not being that being their voice, you know, having being part of that process.

407
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:16,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that what I'm hearing from them and the reason why I asked you to come up is the fact that we have firefighters that are sick.

408
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:17,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And

409
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:26,274
[SPEAKER_08]: they're afraid to come to this podium, and they're afraid to who they can speak to for the fact of retaliation.

410
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a huge problem for public safety.

411
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that, I don't know, I don't know if there's an answer.

412
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:49,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's an avenue that I can propose that whether I know that the mayor was contemplating some sort of investigation, I think it was- As far as I know, we're still under investigation, so.

413
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:50,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Still under investigation, okay.

414
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:59,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think these are the questions that will go to my, I don't wanna bring this up now, but go to my resolution later that

415
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:14,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we want to get to a resolve as quickly as possible and have our method firefighters move forward to do the job that they've been paid to do and what they've been doing honorably even through this this fiasco.

416
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:15,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um.

417
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:24,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, other than that, I know that there are still issues with some facilities and what I'm going to ask is, we've done this a few years, we did this a few years ago.

418
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:29,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to, with the clerk, I know we did like a walking tour.

419
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:40,888
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a Saturday morning and we just visited, we picked maybe three houses and, you know, it could be random, you guys could tell us where to go, but we visit the actual fire houses.

420
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:44,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can all see what's been said.

421
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:54,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And until you see it, and that's why I think I have a little more fire because I walked that walk and I saw some of the conditions that our fire men and women have to live through.

422
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:07,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And they never bring this up, but I think that it would behoove us that we actually, you know, maybe set up a walking tour on a Saturday to some of our stations and visit.

423
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:14,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I can have our secretary reach out to all the council members and set up any kind of tour you guys want to do.

424
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:18,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, if we can do that through the clerk as a motion that we can just maybe go visit.

425
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be all of us.

426
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, you know, if we can't make it, maybe two or three of us just go and just report back.

427
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:30,845
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done it a few times with the whole council, not this council, prior councils.

428
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:35,088
[SPEAKER_15]: And we make up a list of stuff.

429
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:38,270
[SPEAKER_15]: They make up a list of stuff that needs to be fixed.

430
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very rare that work actually does get fixed.

431
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:42,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

432
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:51,375
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think especially as we go into the budget season, we look at the capital plan and follow the mayor's capital plan to see if we can go with that, I think is important.

433
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I don't want to take your night, Mr. Buckley.

434
00:39:55,137 --> 00:40:01,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I know maybe my fellow council have something to say, but I just, I really wanted you to come up and really just, these are the issues that I heard.

435
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:07,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the other thing was that was being spun as part of the dialogue of wasted money.

436
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,201
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we talked about the chief now being in place and,

437
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:22,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we rectify that cost that was going around that she promoted two deputies, correct, or two lieutenants?

438
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:36,014
[SPEAKER_15]: She promoted one deputy, one captain, one lieutenant, and then just the other day she did promote two temporary lieutenants that were for members that got injured in December and January.

439
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the big question we had was,

440
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:44,512
[SPEAKER_08]: We were losing money up to about close to $60,000 for overtime.

441
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:45,954
[SPEAKER_15]: More towards $80,000.

442
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:48,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Has that been rectified?

443
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we still backfilling any positions?

444
00:40:52,732 --> 00:41:14,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, we are on 100% because the deputy Evans got made chief, so his job opened, which opens a position for deputy chief that fills in for any vacation or sick days that the current deputies use, which then makes another captain and another lieutenant, but that also takes another firefighter out of the ranks.

445
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:17,554
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now, I believe we're at 106 members, including the chief,

446
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,996
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the lowest in the history that I'm aware of.

447
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:30,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember it's 125, the number that's at least workable.

448
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:32,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're budgeted for 124.

449
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,140
124.

450
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I got on in 2007, we had 126.

451
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,482
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, 10 years before that, we're at like 150.

452
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:46,223
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 years before that, we're at 165.

453
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:48,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we're at 105 with twice as many calls, if not more.

454
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:52,808
[SPEAKER_15]: We're at 13, a little over 13,000 calls a year now.

455
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:55,069
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in, you know, 1998, we had 165 fighters and we were at 6,500 calls.

456
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:13,839
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so that okay, so we need we need more firefighters.

457
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:17,001
[SPEAKER_08]: This was really made just to get the how everybody's doing.

458
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:18,402
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that all plays into it.

459
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:21,564
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that, again, I really wanted to hear what happened.

460
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:24,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the time was really about what was going on with the chief's issue.

461
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:37,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And those two fires and that just lend our support to the to the men and women on the fire department that especially that week, that the city of method appreciates, you know, everything you guys have done, because mom,

462
00:42:38,116 --> 00:42:41,792
[SPEAKER_08]: that the fire was streamed everywhere, the one on Riverside Ave.

463
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, what was great to see is everybody worked.

464
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:52,202
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, even though there was no acting chief at the time, the team looked amazing.

465
00:42:52,222 --> 00:42:56,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, that's why I wanted to bring it up the next week, just to, sometimes people just need a pat on the back.

466
00:42:57,025 --> 00:43:08,953
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that, you know, if I'm gonna, as many times I've called and we went at it over some disagreements, but at the same time, when you deserve a pat on the back, you should get it.

467
00:43:08,993 --> 00:43:10,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so thank you.

468
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,076
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate it.

469
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:12,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

470
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

471
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:14,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leming.

472
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:21,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a question of accident, kind of wondering this, and I would like to know the answer.

473
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been wondering it for a while.

474
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:31,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a firefighter is sick, why could, is it an option to get like a doctor's note, some form of documentation?

475
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Could that be?

476
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,262
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all negotiated.

477
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:42,507
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was to go out sick during the day and you would tell me I need to get a doctor, is the city paying for the doctor?

478
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,049
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the negotiation comes into play.

479
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:51,791
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think the city wants to send us to a doctor every time we're all sick because they're going to have a doctor bill every time we go out sick.

480
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:56,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions?

481
00:43:58,974 --> 00:43:59,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

482
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:01,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

483
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:07,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to ask you about civil service law and whether we are currently following civil service law.

484
00:44:08,172 --> 00:44:11,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So the appointment of the active chief, was that done appropriately?

485
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:16,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Was was the are we gearing up for the required testing?

486
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:22,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if we're currently like on schedule to follow through with civil service law as we are supposed to right now?

487
00:44:22,962 --> 00:44:29,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, in the union opinion and our legal team, no, we didn't follow civil service law by hiring the chief the way it was.

488
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:30,307
[SPEAKER_15]: He was hired.

489
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:43,753
[SPEAKER_15]: We did have a civil service hearing last Tuesday about this, and they recommended the city call for a test, which is the next chief's test is in October.

490
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:50,056
[SPEAKER_15]: But as far as I'm aware right now, no test has been called for, but that was just last Tuesday, so.

491
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say this was informative and helpful.

492
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:00,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for putting this on the agenda.

493
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:09,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have a motion on the floor for us to work with you all and the clerk to reset our next paper on the matter.

494
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,211
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not for this paper.

495
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:15,653
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can just I think that we could set up a working group.

496
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:16,453
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be all of us.

497
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:18,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, just work with the secretary.

498
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:21,197
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll reach out to everybody and whoever wants to go can go.

499
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:25,182
[SPEAKER_08]: this is an amendment, right?

500
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:36,837
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't with the member just to see if we can put together just a walking meeting to the sites just to walk to the fire stations and so we can actually see what, you know,

501
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:43,972
[SPEAKER_08]: what we hear and, you know, put, once we put the sight on, eyes on it, I think it'll make a difference for everybody.

502
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:45,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it made a huge difference for me.

503
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:49,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And people ask me, George, did they save your life?

504
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:52,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you really, really going overboard sometimes at the fight?

505
00:45:52,694 --> 00:45:56,075
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say, you must have saved me during my first heart attack.

506
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:56,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, not yet.

507
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:59,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, but I'm staying in good grace a sec.

508
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:02,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But what the question was that,

509
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:14,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you go through that tour and you see, you know, there was one station that you had the fitness apparatus right next to the exhaust and it was like- Still there.

510
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,023
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still, that hasn't been fixed.

511
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:26,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I mean, these are the things when you look at, you're gonna be like, you know, with the carcinogens and you're hearing about all these serious issues, health issues.

512
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:28,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think these are the things that once,

513
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:46,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I think once people go and you actually walk a fire station, not to get one of those funny little helmets, but actually see what's going on and see where our female firefighters have to change and where their bathrooms are and understand the windows that can't open.

514
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:51,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope those have been corrected, but these are the things once you see it,

515
00:46:55,595 --> 00:47:00,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what you see it, I think that it'll, it'll put everybody's, it'll put things in a different light for everybody here.

516
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:06,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, I think that's why I'm a little, a little more motivated when it comes to our firefighters.

517
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, nothing against our police, but you guys live the life.

518
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:13,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have a spot at the police.

519
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:16,624
[SPEAKER_08]: You have massage in the new, new stage.

520
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:17,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

521
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:25,897
[SPEAKER_08]: But all right, if we can, that's, you know, I appreciate it.

522
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:37,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the civil service, I know that there was also brought to my attention that even this process right now, that the mayor is going forward looking for either the deputies or lieutenants moving forward.

523
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:39,307
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a civil service process.

524
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,189
[SPEAKER_08]: That is it true that the mayor isn't following that either?

525
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,611
[SPEAKER_15]: She's decided to hold

526
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:52,814
[SPEAKER_15]: meetings or conversations and decide from there who she promotes, which is, again, against our past practice in civil service, so.

527
00:47:53,214 --> 00:47:54,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

528
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:56,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

529
00:47:56,796 --> 00:47:58,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a motion?

530
00:47:58,156 --> 00:48:00,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need any clarification on it?

531
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:00,397
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

532
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:03,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just have a question and a, you know,

533
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:09,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when we do the tours, are you going to coordinate with or inform the interim chief?

534
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, absolutely.

535
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:11,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

536
00:48:11,824 --> 00:48:14,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure I was going to do that.

537
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,752
[SPEAKER_15]: The former chief went on the tours also.

538
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I know.

539
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:18,275
[SPEAKER_15]: He got lost.

540
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to say again, we met on the budget earlier.

541
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:40,574
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had multiple DPW commissioners in here, police chiefs, heads of every department talking about just the systemic decline in staffing and resources for every department and school system since Proposition 2.5 went into effect in 1980.

542
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:46,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're well aware of the systemic underfunding of all parts of city government due to the

543
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:53,272
[SPEAKER_02]: a hard limit of 2.5% on the total city tax levy, and we know that it impacts every department.

544
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:59,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we've seen that and you've seen that firsthand as well, and it really

545
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:14,121
[SPEAKER_02]: just hurts the ability of city government to provide effective basic services like fire prevention, or effective planning, or public health, or enforcing basic code enforcement, never mind public education, public safety.

546
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:18,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So appreciate you bringing that information as well.

547
00:49:18,243 --> 00:49:22,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's helpful for us to just see what the impact has been going from 160 down to 125 is huge.

548
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And DPWs in a similar place, and they've gone from 150 in the late 70s down to,

549
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:30,912
[SPEAKER_02]: only about 50 people a day.

550
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:44,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's when people, when you look around and you see a crumbling fire station or a crumbling sidewalk or just not having enough staff to keep up, it really is because of Proposition 2.5 and the fact that the city doesn't have enough revenue to meet basic needs.

551
00:49:45,244 --> 00:49:48,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll question that.

552
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:51,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the data.

553
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:51,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

554
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

555
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a motion on the floor by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, as seconded by Councilor Tseng.

556
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:06,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll open it up to members of the public if you'd like to speak.

557
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

558
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:08,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Diesso, name and address for the record, please.

559
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:10,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Bears.

560
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:12,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Sharon Diesso, I've been to the podium before.

561
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:16,682
[SPEAKER_16]: 130 Circuit in Mass Ave in Medford.

562
00:50:17,823 --> 00:50:21,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to thank the gentlemen for coming here this evening.

563
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:30,355
[SPEAKER_16]: I happened to see firefighters on the agenda that was promoted by, I think, Councilor Scarpelli because they

564
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:43,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Took my father out of, very late in life, he developed diabetes and we called the fire department and they actually saved his life twice.

565
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:47,030
[SPEAKER_16]: So, they're a little bit more vital.

566
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:54,356
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, I almost made, I have semester break this week and I said, I know, I miss my kids, I'm gonna have to have a pop quiz at the council tonight.

567
00:50:55,758 --> 00:51:03,303
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not saying this as a criticism, I'll make a bet, because I didn't know it at the time myself, all the duties that firefighters do.

568
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:16,091
[SPEAKER_16]: We always think that they come around with the truck and we have all kinds of exposure in a day, meeting a firefighter, and you get to see the helmets and all the apparatus, et cetera.

569
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:18,052
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes far beyond that.

570
00:51:18,132 --> 00:51:21,014
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll refresh you a little bit of what happens.

571
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:24,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I have just a brief note regarding civil service.

572
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:46,506
[SPEAKER_16]: that basically as a firefighter, they swear on their oath, this is abbreviated, that you will be a public servant and you will be reserved for and respected for not only fires, but other emergency situations that occur within your community.

573
00:51:48,817 --> 00:52:02,104
[SPEAKER_16]: You also will be responsible for odd hours, working around the clock sometimes, that require physical, emotional, and medical durability from yourselves.

574
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:17,413
[SPEAKER_16]: You must respond not only to occurring everyday, lively situations, including auto accidents, for example, that respond to emergencies.

575
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:36,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, you are responsible for the learning, the operation, the engineering of special equipment, which regards to hose pressure, gauge pressure, water pressure, carrying victims.

576
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:43,273
[SPEAKER_16]: in treating the sick, also injured people during these emergencies.

577
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:52,499
[SPEAKER_16]: You also are responsible for clear, effective writing skills so that your reports are absolutely exact.

578
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:56,401
[SPEAKER_16]: They could be, like in the military, life-threatening.

579
00:52:58,061 --> 00:53:06,512
[SPEAKER_16]: So my other question now, I hope that this was a little bit of a learning thing for the public, for anyone that was on Zoom tonight or anyone who's sitting here this evening.

580
00:53:06,912 --> 00:53:13,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, firefighters, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for paying attention to this vital issue in our community.

581
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:23,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, because some people aren't aware of the recent motion by I think it was the mayor regarding civil service requirements.

582
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:30,243
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to tell you a little bit about civil service in its importance in about two sentences.

583
00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:35,748
[SPEAKER_16]: And then maybe you can tell the public, sir, just where that stands right now.

584
00:53:35,788 --> 00:53:40,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that mean just promotions or anyone who wants to become a firefighter?

585
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:41,814
[SPEAKER_16]: What are the requirements?

586
00:53:42,414 --> 00:53:46,898
[SPEAKER_16]: That test is designed not only for intelligence and IQ,

587
00:53:47,999 --> 00:54:02,288
[SPEAKER_16]: It is designed, like some of the federal exams that I have taken, for specific skills, profiles, and personalities, and excellence and proficiency in different areas that would pertain to your job requirements.

588
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:04,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for this time.

589
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:10,093
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was important for all the community and young people, too, who are thinking about public service.

590
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

591
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:12,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

592
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:13,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Diaz.

593
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

594
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:32,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to what Mr. Buckley had to say, but more importantly, I was listening to the Chonam's voice and I feel that level of disparity to some degree coming from him.

595
00:54:33,183 --> 00:54:36,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to just step back for a second and just

596
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:41,368
[SPEAKER_04]: point out one thing that George had pointed out earlier, which is fear of retribution.

597
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:48,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone anywhere in any job should ever be in fear of retribution, regardless of what is going on.

598
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:53,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's an investigation whether you believe it is valid or not valid.

599
00:54:53,935 --> 00:55:00,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It is completely irrelevant to those folks getting up every single day to do their job and do the job the best they possibly can.

600
00:55:00,918 --> 00:55:05,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to let them know there should be a free

601
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,804
[SPEAKER_04]: fear of retribution in any way, shape or form.

602
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot have these folks going into a burning building, and then coming out in the next day, not feeling well at all, and asking for the day off, and then having to worry about possibly having to go to the doctors to get a note to come back the next day.

603
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:27,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear of retribution is human resource 101.

604
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has to be clear from everyone here in the administration as well.

605
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:35,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

606
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:41,554
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

607
00:55:41,574 --> 00:55:42,475
[SPEAKER_19]: The rest of the record, please.

608
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:45,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Nicole Branley, 54 Norwich Circle.

609
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:49,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just wondering if I could request that the school committee be invited on that tour.

610
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:54,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I think for 14 elected officials in this city that we can all work together to support our first responders.

611
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:55,943
[SPEAKER_13]: That's possible.

612
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:56,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

613
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's fine.

614
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we can amend that, but you may need to ask your colleagues as well.

615
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I mean, it's just an invitation.

616
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:09,885
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they don't have to come, but if they could be invited, we could be invited, that would be great.

617
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:11,866
[SPEAKER_02]: We can invite all elected officials in the city.

618
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:12,527
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be good.

619
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

620
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

621
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:16,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

622
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:24,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Move the question, Mr. President.

623
00:56:24,836 --> 00:56:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comment by members of the council, members of the public?

624
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

625
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:33,572
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Gerald Burns, 44 South Porter Road, Medford.

626
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:37,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I was on my phone trying to look up.

627
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:39,593
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a tour done.

628
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:42,634
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's a report on the City of Medford website.

629
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:45,075
[SPEAKER_18]: They toured every firehouse.

630
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:47,836
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a whole list of things that were written up.

631
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:50,651
[SPEAKER_08]: We did that, I think, six years ago.

632
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:52,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that a couple years ago or a few years ago?

633
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:52,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Six years ago, maybe.

634
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:54,372
[SPEAKER_18]: And nothing's been done since?

635
00:56:54,392 --> 00:56:56,052
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a 2018 effort by the council.

636
00:56:56,072 --> 00:57:02,493
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a fire task force led by Paul Holian in 2021 that had a report on this new website.

637
00:57:02,513 --> 00:57:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.

638
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that might be it.

639
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:10,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Just saying, I know you guys are doing the tour again, but it'd be good to review that before you go.

640
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:10,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

641
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:13,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been several projects funded by the CPA.

642
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:16,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got a question for the gentleman over there.

643
00:57:16,576 --> 00:57:17,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a grievable offense?

644
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,581
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor appointing someone?

645
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been told that Mr. Buck was communicated that they're using DLR.

646
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:27,707
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, that's all I got.

647
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:28,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

648
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:28,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

649
00:57:29,288 --> 00:57:38,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I will note that there have been a number of projects funded for fire stations by the CPA, and they're currently working on the Salem Street Fire Station as well.

650
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

651
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:44,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Angela Murphy 16 Carding Street.

652
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:47,875
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to address the fact about being sick.

653
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:49,797
[SPEAKER_17]: I work in a school movement.

654
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:56,000
[SPEAKER_17]: And one week, we had 15 teachers out because something went rampant through schools.

655
00:57:56,601 --> 00:58:00,904
[SPEAKER_17]: We had more than 25 kids in and out all week.

656
00:58:01,824 --> 00:58:06,869
[SPEAKER_17]: If everybody had to bring in a doctor's note to say they were out, that's ridiculous.

657
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:12,033
[SPEAKER_17]: How about you bring in a doctor's note when you're not able to attend a city council meeting?

658
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:20,281
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, nobody wakes up in the morning expecting to be sick and throwing up or have fever when they went to bed healthy.

659
00:58:21,282 --> 00:58:22,122
[SPEAKER_17]: People get sick.

660
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:27,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you live in close quarters in deplorable buildings, you are bound to get sick.

661
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:34,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to give these firefighters the hand for not coming in when they're not able to do their job.

662
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:39,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So being retaliated against being sick is ridiculous.

663
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,462
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel that if I'm sick, I'm going to stay home.

664
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:46,406
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, my colleagues would tell me to stay home, even though I wouldn't want to.

665
00:58:47,836 --> 00:58:48,977
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's all I gotta say.

666
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:56,761
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, these firefighters came to my mother's house in the middle of the night numerous times when she rolled out of bed and pressed the lifeline.

667
00:58:57,082 --> 00:58:58,142
[SPEAKER_17]: They are lifesavers.

668
00:58:58,522 --> 00:59:02,365
[SPEAKER_17]: We ought to applaud them, not reprimand them for being sick.

669
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:10,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

670
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:17,266
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, and seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favour?

671
00:59:17,746 --> 00:59:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

672
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:18,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

673
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:19,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

674
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:28,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think, I don't know, while we're in here, do we want to just go through the 240541, just to, it's in the same breath.

675
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:28,713
454?

676
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:30,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 24054.

677
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:35,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Schedule, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, to suspend the rule to take 24054, seconded by?

678
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:41,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

679
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:42,074
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

680
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:43,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

681
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

682
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:47,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

683
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second.

684
00:59:48,038 --> 00:59:48,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to read it.

685
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:48,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

686
00:59:55,384 --> 01:00:01,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council move to schedule a committee of the whole meeting dealing with the civil service process for the Medford Fire Chief position.

687
01:00:01,428 --> 01:00:07,573
[SPEAKER_02]: We have requested that meeting and the Mayor has requested a time delay on that meeting.

688
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:09,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

689
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:10,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

690
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:15,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I think that a lot of people are here because of this situation.

691
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:18,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to move the night along, I think it's important that

692
01:00:21,354 --> 01:00:38,188
[SPEAKER_08]: that this was a resolution that was brought forward with the concerns and the issues of the fact that the mayor had asked the city council to vote on eliminating the position of chief process through civil service.

693
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:44,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And that morning of our meeting, she already had somebody in the office.

694
01:00:44,694 --> 01:00:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: She was interviewing someone already in the office.

695
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:49,137
[SPEAKER_08]: without this council even approving that.

696
01:00:49,658 --> 01:00:59,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So this council heard questions from the firefighters and the administration, and we asked to try to come to a vote.

697
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:14,353
[SPEAKER_08]: The council needed another meeting with the mayor, and you would think for the sense of morale, I think right now, and something I think we've all identified, that one thing has nothing to do with the other thing.

698
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:18,354
[SPEAKER_08]: civil service doesn't have anything to do with this so-called investigation.

699
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:35,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So to hold this off for two more months, to leave these firefighters in a certain feeling of being unsure of what's going on and leaving this, it really puts it back on us.

700
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:42,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I would recommend, Mr. President, if you allow me to make a motion

701
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:44,586
[SPEAKER_08]: that we do.

702
01:01:46,158 --> 01:01:49,321
[SPEAKER_08]: few things is that this situation with the mayor is a mess.

703
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:55,966
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor created a through this on the city council's lap, and it was irresponsible.

704
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:59,789
[SPEAKER_08]: It caused outrage among our community and has put us all at risk.

705
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,933
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor was gung ho when she filed this paper, but now she needs more time.

706
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:09,157
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clear that this matter was not properly vetted, and it was retaliatory in nature.

707
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:14,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing more than a knee jerk reaction to an unrelated and substantial allegation.

708
01:02:15,643 --> 01:02:18,164
[SPEAKER_08]: The record of this body reflects the agreement.

709
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:21,685
[SPEAKER_08]: This action was both irresponsible and not well thought out.

710
01:02:22,265 --> 01:02:25,807
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no place for politics when it comes to public safety.

711
01:02:26,627 --> 01:02:29,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So the mayor can refile this paper.

712
01:02:30,068 --> 01:02:37,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I would make the motion that the mayor can refile this paper when she gets her ducks in a row.

713
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:39,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And this issue is a mess.

714
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:46,761
[SPEAKER_08]: that she's created, and the council should not be left holding the bag while concerned residents lay in wait.

715
01:02:47,422 --> 01:02:53,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I move that this paper be received and placed on file, and the mayor can come back in future time and put this through.

716
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:56,095
[SPEAKER_08]: And I ask my council to vote in favor of this for one big reason.

717
01:02:56,656 --> 01:03:03,043
[SPEAKER_08]: is to really calm the community down and say, listen, we understand after time, we've all had time to think about it.

718
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:04,444
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had a lot of questions.

719
01:03:04,464 --> 01:03:12,792
[SPEAKER_08]: The questions that I've talked to some of my fellow councils about, maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong, really stems from understanding the policy of the sick time.

720
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:16,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It had nothing really to do with the civil service issue.

721
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:20,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the civil service issue isn't that important to the mayor because she doesn't want to meet for two months.

722
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,481
[SPEAKER_08]: She's already responded to us.

723
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:30,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So my my hope is that we can see that let's put everybody at ease that's been directly affected and put this to rest if we can.

724
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:35,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And then she could bring this up when she's ready and take it off our plate, Mr. President.

725
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:37,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I make that a formal motion if we can.

726
01:03:37,394 --> 01:03:37,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

727
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: The clerk has noted to me that that paper has already been disposed of into committee, so we can't take action on it tonight since it's already in committee.

728
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:48,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

729
01:03:48,561 --> 01:03:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to dispose of this paper.

730
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:01,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else on this paper?

731
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:04,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think like, I think that it's a clarification.

732
01:04:04,357 --> 01:04:05,878
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody, everybody knows out there.

733
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:15,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So our, our city council rules state that if we move this, we cannot dispose of it until it's heard in the committee.

734
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:15,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

735
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And so

736
01:04:17,824 --> 01:04:24,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we should revisit the mayor and ask her to really move up that timeline.

737
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:32,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And I recommend that the constituents that have reached out to me about this issue, that there's only one person that we can reach out to, send the mayor an email.

738
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:42,682
[SPEAKER_08]: send them email saying, dispose of this or meet right away to get this off the plate of our of our fighter fighters minds and let them be at ease.

739
01:04:43,242 --> 01:04:50,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, because this is something that whatever might be minuscule to most people, but if any, just an ounce of negativity,

740
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:54,087
[SPEAKER_08]: that our firefighters can take off their shoulders, why would we do that?

741
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:59,671
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would make that recommendation to all that's listening to send the mayor a message.

742
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:15,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'll try, it'll fall on deaf ears, but I would recommend that as our leadership, if we can revisit that and send a message to the mayor to have an immediate meeting and not wait two months, because the optics doesn't look good either.

743
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,942
[SPEAKER_08]: People have asked me, he's like, why two months?

744
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:19,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we have no control of that.

745
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:20,925
[SPEAKER_08]: The council president has no control of that.

746
01:05:21,926 --> 01:05:24,848
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor has said she wants to wait two months, so.

747
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll send this resolution to the mayor.

748
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:28,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

749
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:33,016
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favour?

750
01:05:33,856 --> 01:05:34,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

751
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

752
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:42,584
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-2, that was the only other paper under suspension.

753
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, revert back to regular business.

754
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:45,167
[SPEAKER_02]: We're back.

755
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:48,598
[SPEAKER_02]: 22-494 Budget Ordinance.

756
01:05:48,618 --> 01:05:57,724
[SPEAKER_02]: The latest draft of the Budget Ordinance was reported out of the Administration of the Finance Committee on February 27, 2024, for consideration by the full Council, and a copy is attached to this packet.

757
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: This was tabled from last week's meeting, and this is the Budget Ordinance that we've been working on for over a year now.

758
01:06:08,251 --> 01:06:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: 22-494 came in at the end of 2022.

759
01:06:12,793 --> 01:06:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had extensive negotiations with the administration to define by ordinance requirements for a transparent, collaborative, and accountable budgeting process for the city.

760
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And this budget ordinance would establish a new chapter in the city ordinances, finance.

761
01:06:27,959 --> 01:06:34,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It would move a couple of items from Division 5 of Chapter 2 administration to the new chapter, but would not make any changes to them.

762
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the new Article 5 outlines the annual budget process.

763
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first piece of that is quarterly financial reports and meetings.

764
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:57,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The finance director will provide a written report regarding the city's finance to the city council on a quarterly basis, no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter of the fiscal year, containing the accounts payable warrant, year-to-date budget to actuals report unaudited.

765
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:04,087
[SPEAKER_02]: and where available updates on state certifications, revenue forecasts, spending forecasts, and other information deemed relevant.

766
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:22,982
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council will hold subcommittee meetings no later than 60 days after the end of the second and third quarters, so that would be the end of September or the end of December, to review these documents, to ask questions, and the finance director would be there to attend and present the report and answer questions.

767
01:07:25,529 --> 01:07:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're getting into the budget process, which we've already started this year.

768
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:40,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally, we've been very lucky to get a budget at the end of May, usually the beginning of June, sometimes the middle of June, once without a full binder in the past four years.

769
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's no joke.

770
01:07:45,265 --> 01:08:05,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, through this negotiation, we are starting the process March 1, so we just had, over the past two weeks, two meetings for this Council to discuss budget recommendations, which we will be sending to the Mayor this week by a deadline of March 22 of each year, and then the Mayor will review those and respond in writing prior to presenting her budget.

771
01:08:06,769 --> 01:08:11,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start holding preliminary budget meetings with city departments April 15th to May 15th.

772
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:16,376
[SPEAKER_02]: These will include the mayor or designee, finance director or designee, and the relevant department heads.

773
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:20,379
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll provide the estimated budget allocation for Medford Public Schools as well.

774
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: No later than 72 hours prior to the first preliminary budget meeting.

775
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:31,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mayor, Finance Director, designees will provide the total preliminary expected general fund revenue for the upcoming fiscal year to the City Council.

776
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:36,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So that includes our property tax levy, local receipts, state aid, which we were discussing earlier.

777
01:08:37,507 --> 01:08:40,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have that no later than 72 hours prior to the first budget meeting.

778
01:08:42,669 --> 01:08:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: No later than 72 hours prior to any budget meeting.

779
01:08:45,737 --> 01:09:05,748
[SPEAKER_02]: for the specific departments, we will get the annual operating budget for the previous year, the annual operating budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, requested new staff programs and services for the upcoming fiscal year, and we will have that now by department in advance of the final presentation by the mayor of her comprehensive budget proposal, which she will send in

780
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:09,790
[SPEAKER_02]: to the city council no later than May 31st of each year.

781
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:14,552
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll make a comprehensive presentation of that proposal at the meeting, which is first considered.

782
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:18,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city council can request additional budget meetings after that.

783
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor may also, finance director or department heads may also request budget meetings after that point.

784
01:09:24,596 --> 01:09:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we want to come back to a budget where we had a discussion in April or May.

785
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:30,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has now looking very different in June.

786
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the authority to do that.

787
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:36,045
[SPEAKER_02]: They can also, if they want to bring someone back that we haven't asked for, they can do that.

788
01:09:37,227 --> 01:09:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And the comprehensive budget proposal will include what we're generally used to with the general fund, the expected property tax revenue, state net state aid, local receipts, and the operating budget for each department.

789
01:09:50,101 --> 01:09:56,026
[SPEAKER_02]: One new thing that we're going to be getting is that the total proposed expenses for each department are going to be split.

790
01:09:56,267 --> 01:10:09,458
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be split, but we're going to be able to see what is increasing due to fixed costs, such as union contracts, inflation, etc., and then what's actually something new in the budget.

791
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a new staff member, a new program, or a new expense.

792
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be helpful.

793
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:14,466
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.

794
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:20,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, the inclusion of all the enterprise funds, capital improvement plans, revolving funds, and grant funds.

795
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:31,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, this ordinance requires an annual report by the mayor, finance director, or designee, and a meeting no later than November 30th on their progress to including these in the budget proposals.

796
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:46,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's one other section which goes into a little bit more detail on the annual budget needs assessment, something that was really desired by this council and has been, is understanding what our long-term operating and capital expense needs are.

797
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:52,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have a list, for example, what would it cost to bring all of the city buildings into a state of good repair.

798
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:57,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some stuff on that on roads and sidewalks, but that's becoming out of date, hasn't been updated in three years.

799
01:10:58,601 --> 01:11:04,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So the administration said that they just were not able at the current resource level to create those documents.

800
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:18,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have required that they provide an annual report on how they plan to get us to a resource level where we can have that information so that we can make informed decisions about the city's operating and capital budget needs.

801
01:11:19,602 --> 01:11:30,714
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much, I didn't read word by word, I can go back, but the first article goes into effect upon passage, and then the annual budget needs assessments goes into effect January 1 of 2025.

802
01:11:34,485 --> 01:11:35,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Sen.

803
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

804
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:42,892
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I want to thank you, President Bears, for leading this project.

805
01:11:42,972 --> 01:11:46,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the administration for negotiating with us and good faith about it.

806
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:53,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of these, a lot of the stuff in this ordinance is not easy for any administration to stomach.

807
01:11:53,881 --> 01:12:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It represents a massive shift in power away from the administration and towards the grassroots.

808
01:12:01,968 --> 01:12:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: The budgeting in Massachusetts and budgeting in Medford in particular has traditionally been very top down.

809
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:24,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been really, truly an honor to be able to work so closely with you, with Vice President Collins and subcommittee over many months, many long months to get us to a draft where everyone can agree that this moves our city forward and in a way that is feasible.

810
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:32,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what is most striking to me about this budget ordinance is that it's a true commitment to our values of transparency.

811
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:40,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a true testimony that our city council is working really hard to bring transparency into the things that matter the most.

812
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:48,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the budget forming the backbone of the city's operations is really truly a significant place for that to be happening.

813
01:12:48,668 --> 01:12:48,888
[SPEAKER_03]: the budget.

814
01:12:49,428 --> 01:13:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Um when we think about what this includes quarterly financial reports, um, breakdowns of fixed costs versus new expenses, um, annual budget needs assessment, um, more logical and reasonable schedule for, um, working on this budget as a city council.

815
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:10,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of these are steps that really, um, give us more time and give us

816
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:25,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And to engage department heads to see what they actually want in their departments rather than being handed a version of the budget that has already been pre negotiated for us.

817
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, in addition to that transparency.

818
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very logical.

819
01:13:31,631 --> 01:13:32,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think.

820
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to be setting higher standards for how government operates, and this ordinance does that.

821
01:13:38,616 --> 01:13:53,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It is clearer to residents, it will make the budget process clearer to residents as to what that few hundred page document actually means, what the numbers mean, and what that number, what those numbers mean

822
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:57,827
[SPEAKER_03]: in relation to their lives, to their lived experiences as residents of the city.

823
01:13:58,228 --> 01:13:59,869
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm very, very happy to support this.

824
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I urge my colleagues to do the same.

825
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is something that is truly, truly nonpartisan and really, really revolutionary.

826
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:11,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

827
01:14:12,799 --> 01:14:13,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

828
01:14:14,926 --> 01:14:15,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

829
01:14:16,127 --> 01:14:17,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the work that has been done on this.

830
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:30,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to comment a little bit about what I saw when I was campaigning and what I have also seen here in these chambers and heard people speak about, which is that when people do not trust

831
01:14:31,522 --> 01:14:42,208
[SPEAKER_01]: the way, when they don't understand how their money is being spent, and they don't trust the way that that money is being used, then they never want to give the city another penny.

832
01:14:42,628 --> 01:14:52,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you combine lack of transparency with underfunding, which I believe is what has happened to Medford over many, many years, what happens is you have a breakdown of democracy.

833
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:55,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, making sure that the public

834
01:14:56,776 --> 01:15:09,442
[SPEAKER_01]: through this budget ordinance has access to seeing and understanding how are the money that comes into the city is spent, and to know that that money is being spent on things that they are in fact seeing.

835
01:15:10,082 --> 01:15:11,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is going to help not only

836
01:15:12,603 --> 01:15:27,288
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that we move the budget forward, but it's also gonna help get people to understand that, yes, the city is or is not, you know, whatever we find, right, when we've got this transparency, using the funds wisely.

837
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:34,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we will also see that there's genuine underfunding of most city departments.

838
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

839
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

840
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:39,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

841
01:15:42,853 --> 01:15:43,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Any motions on the floor?

842
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:49,597
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve the ordinance for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

843
01:15:50,357 --> 01:15:51,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

844
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:54,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Any discussion by members of the public?

845
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,041
[SPEAKER_02]: You can raise your hand on Zoom or come to the podium here in the chamber.

846
01:16:04,866 --> 01:16:11,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Tseng, as seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to approve the ordinance for first reading, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

847
01:16:12,895 --> 01:16:13,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

848
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:13,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

849
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:13,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

850
01:16:13,496 --> 01:16:13,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

851
01:16:13,776 --> 01:16:13,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

852
01:16:22,799 --> 01:16:23,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Sands?

853
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

854
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:24,620
[SPEAKER_19]: President Farris?

855
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:25,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

856
01:16:25,141 --> 01:16:26,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

857
01:16:26,502 --> 01:16:30,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes and the ordinance is approved for first reading.

858
01:16:30,725 --> 01:16:32,146
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-047 offered by Councilor Lemingng.

859
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:35,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolution to request that Medford's linkage fees be updated.

860
01:16:36,169 --> 01:16:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Medford Municipal Code 94-10.136, 94-10.236, 94-10.336, and 94-10.436 state the formula for linkage fees for parks and recreational facilities, police and fire facilities,

861
01:16:51,141 --> 01:17:15,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Roads and traffic facilities and water and sewer facilities shall be subject to recalculation no more than three years after the effective date of this provision, and no more than every three years thereafter by the Community Development Board after public notice of the public hearing based on the methodology and analysis established as a result of reports, documentation, and information prepared by the Office of Community Development, whereas the Medford's linkage fee structure were uniquely established by a home rule petition in 1989, chapter 488,

862
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:20,443
[SPEAKER_02]: quote, an act establishing linkage exaction program in the city of Method.

863
01:17:20,863 --> 01:17:45,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The act, which states the following, the level of any exaction shall be reviewed at least every three years and reset as required based upon the recommendation of the Office of Community Development and Mayor of said city, whereas none of these fees have been updated by the Community Development Board since 1990, bringing Medford out of compliance with the act, whereas the current linkage fee schedule, having not been updated since 1990, has been devalued by the effects of inflation, whereas the studies required to calculate these exactions are often expensive,

864
01:17:46,365 --> 01:18:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: and infeasible to recalculate every three years, then automatically escalating linkage fee schedules subject to periodic review could be preferable to recalculating linkage fees every three years via a new study, whereas Medford's Office of Community Development has now merged with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, be it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council formally request that the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability and the Community Development Board update the formula for its linkage fees to an appropriate amount, and that the City Clerk send this request to members of the Community Development Board with a request for official confirmation of its receipt,

865
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:27,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We had further resolved that the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability and the Community Development Board provide a report to the Medford City Council on their willingness and ability to comply with this current request by May 2024, and if so, their expected timeline to its completion.

866
01:18:27,031 --> 01:18:35,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We had further resolved that the Medford City Council request that the study include a progressive formula for linkage fee updates such that a new study every three years is not necessarily required for the review process.

867
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a little more?

868
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:44,371
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so that's that's everything for that's that's 24 hours.

869
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:44,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

870
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:45,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

871
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to note.

872
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:56,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in terms of what's listed here, the office of planning development, sustainability is still acting as the office of community development where defined by state law or ordinance.

873
01:18:57,035 --> 01:18:57,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

874
01:18:57,415 --> 01:18:57,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

875
01:18:57,776 --> 01:18:57,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

876
01:18:59,226 --> 01:18:59,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

877
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:01,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President Bears.

878
01:19:01,607 --> 01:19:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the first of a three part series of linkage fee resolutions that I'm bringing to the table.

879
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, this is a fairly simple one.

880
01:19:13,152 --> 01:19:24,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Linkage fees are fees that developers pay to the city, um, in order so that we can benefit the police and fire department, um, parts of facilities, um,

881
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:29,781
[SPEAKER_06]: or sorry, roads and traffic facilities, parks and recreation.

882
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:33,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So Medford has four linkage fee buckets at the moment.

883
01:19:34,364 --> 01:19:40,908
[SPEAKER_06]: These were established via an act that was passed by the state in 1989 and implemented in Medford in 1990.

884
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:47,793
[SPEAKER_06]: By ordinance, we're required to update these fees every three years.

885
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:54,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in our ordinances, it requires the Community Development Board to do that every three years.

886
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:55,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that

887
01:19:56,178 --> 01:20:20,060
[SPEAKER_06]: the community development board has never done that so this is this act is really just kind of asking politely for the community development board and in conjunction with the office of planning development and sustainability which used to be the office of community development to please conduct a study to update those linkage fees so that they can be um

888
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, raised for the first time in about 34 years and potentially add a lot of new revenue to the city from developers.

889
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:43,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Strictly speaking, the Medford City Council under our own ordinances and the State Act does not have the authority to update the linkage fees ourselves.

890
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:49,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is really just a request to other boards and offices of the city to do so.

891
01:20:52,788 --> 01:21:07,758
[SPEAKER_06]: The other aspect of this is that I believe a reason that they haven't done that is because it takes the studies to actually, in order to update the linkage fees, you need to hire someone to conduct a study to do that.

892
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Those studies are oftentimes pretty expensive to do.

893
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:20,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can imagine, but that's a very small cost compared to what we would end up gaining in the long term by actually updating our linkage fees.

894
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this also requests that any new study conducted also

895
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:36,931
[SPEAKER_06]: have some kind of an escalating formula so that they can be updated every three years without having a new expensive study.

896
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:43,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Other cities like I believe Watertown have done the same thing by connecting their linkage fees to the consumer price index.

897
01:21:43,074 --> 01:21:48,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had meetings with KP Law about sort of what

898
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:51,339
[SPEAKER_06]: other municipalities have done around this.

899
01:21:51,439 --> 01:22:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I've attached a memo regarding that in this package itself, which addresses not just this resolution, but also the other two resolutions in this package as well.

900
01:22:05,647 --> 01:22:14,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my presentation of the first of the three resolutions, and I would motion to pass this.

901
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:24,794
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng, seconded by to approve, seconded by Councilor Callaghan to approve.

902
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

903
01:22:27,195 --> 01:22:29,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Scarpelli.

904
01:22:30,298 --> 01:22:33,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very grateful for my fellow Councilor for introducing this.

905
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when it comes to something that hasn't been updated since 1990, that should be updated regularly, it makes a lot of sense.

906
01:22:42,286 --> 01:22:45,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to show our residents that we're trying to find

907
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,906
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue wherever we can, and especially in ways that don't overburden folks.

908
01:22:53,106 --> 01:22:54,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is definitely one of those paths.

909
01:22:55,368 --> 01:23:06,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm very grateful that you've introduced this and started a really important conversation about linkage fees, about updating ordinances, about tying different things to it.

910
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very helpful.

911
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:10,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think your ideas are very strong here.

912
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:17,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you and I appreciate that.

913
01:23:17,766 --> 01:23:23,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I think whenever we look at something that hasn't been touched since 1990, right, there's two things that can happen.

914
01:23:23,995 --> 01:23:28,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Either it's either fraudulently overlooked or

915
01:23:29,758 --> 01:23:30,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It's working.

916
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it'll be interesting if we can get a report.

917
01:23:34,383 --> 01:23:45,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see where what we've done with that linkage, even doesn't have to go back 30 years, but even just the last four years, while the mayor has been in office, what have we done with our with the linkage?

918
01:23:46,877 --> 01:23:47,677
[SPEAKER_08]: that has been coming in.

919
01:23:47,697 --> 01:23:56,839
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be interesting to see, because that'll also help us with the data as we're moving forward, because I know that Councilor Bears mentioned a few times of the city not being funded properly, right?

920
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:57,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that.

921
01:23:58,059 --> 01:24:07,901
[SPEAKER_08]: But these are the avenues that we could possibly look at to say, well, there's a way that we can fund this, or there's a way we can fund that, other than a proposition to an F override.

922
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:16,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I can, as part of this resolution, just to maybe getting a report back from the mayor's office,

923
01:24:16,863 --> 01:24:18,244
[SPEAKER_08]: to see what we've done.

924
01:24:18,264 --> 01:24:25,010
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be extensive, but what we've used the linkage money for over the last four years, that'd be interesting.

925
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

926
01:24:33,718 --> 01:24:34,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comment?

927
01:24:36,498 --> 01:24:49,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I have been discussing this pretty extensively with the office of planning, development and sustainability and what folks there believe is that the reason I mean, the reason it hasn't been updated is because.

928
01:24:50,439 --> 01:24:58,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford what they believe in the office and I've also passed this by KP law is that Medford has a kind of a unique linkage fee structure.

929
01:24:59,204 --> 01:25:06,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And so finding a consultant who's actually who's qualified to undergo the study that's necessary in order to raise

930
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:15,680
[SPEAKER_06]: the linkage fees an appropriate amount because the issue with just raising it on our own is that a developer could say they don't like that, just challenge it.

931
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

932
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:25,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's another reason that I've also requested that the City Council make sure that we include that in

933
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:30,936
[SPEAKER_06]: That in our upcoming budget money for such a study to to take place.

934
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:39,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think it's more to do with just capacity in the office to pursue only so many different projects at once.

935
01:25:41,704 --> 01:25:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: than it is anything else.

936
01:25:45,268 --> 01:25:48,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is going to be the subject of an upcoming resolution.

937
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:52,495
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's also a bit of confusion, I think, about whose authority it actually is.

938
01:25:52,535 --> 01:26:01,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So the state act says that it's the Office of Community Development, which is now the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and the mayor to update the linkage fees.

939
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But our ordinances include the Community Development Board,

940
01:26:04,788 --> 01:26:06,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so they don't.

941
01:26:06,789 --> 01:26:14,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So the state act that's a lot that gives us the right to have linkage in the first place never mentions any community development board in there, but it's kind of split in our ordinances.

942
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:16,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But that that's that that is something that will come up in the next.

943
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:17,893
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

944
01:26:17,933 --> 01:26:18,833
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I appreciate that.

945
01:26:18,853 --> 01:26:29,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that now being the new president, Mr, uh, Mr. Beard, uh, Council President Beards, I think ultimately the council president, I think every year don't.

946
01:26:29,917 --> 01:26:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that part of your duty?

947
01:26:30,878 --> 01:26:33,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, to approve the linkage?

948
01:26:34,961 --> 01:26:35,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

949
01:26:35,962 --> 01:26:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't met yet, but we are having an interesting so I know that my my thousands of emails, I'm having a meeting at some point.

950
01:26:43,426 --> 01:26:43,806
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm sure.

951
01:26:43,826 --> 01:26:52,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But I but I'm saying maybe that that'll help to to understand, because here's the thing, even though we say one office does it, the truth of the matter is, at least

952
01:26:54,295 --> 01:27:00,359
[SPEAKER_08]: when I've been directly involved with linkage, in discussions with prior mayors, the mayor really does it.

953
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:11,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all know that, but I think that just getting an understanding of where we are and where we can go with this as another revenue source, I think is very important.

954
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:13,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate you bringing this forward.

955
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good study to see and just to investigate and then move things forward.

956
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:20,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

957
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:23,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

958
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And the latest act for, I don't know what this is.

959
01:27:30,533 --> 01:27:31,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Stopping that.

960
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to second Councilor Scarpelli's motion.

961
01:27:34,414 --> 01:27:34,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

962
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:35,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

963
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:40,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion approved by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemingng as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

964
01:27:42,777 --> 01:27:45,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the, I think I originally motioned to pass it.

965
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:46,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

966
01:27:46,718 --> 01:27:48,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't, I don't, it was seconded.

967
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan seconded as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

968
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

969
01:27:54,147 --> 01:28:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to put out there, the fiscal 2022 act for city linkage funds, 163,305 went to Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

970
01:28:00,832 --> 01:28:01,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

971
01:28:01,072 --> 01:28:02,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that again, Mr. President?

972
01:28:02,734 --> 01:28:02,714
$163,305.

973
01:28:02,814 --> 01:28:03,654
[SPEAKER_02]: For last year?

974
01:28:03,675 --> 01:28:04,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for fiscal 22.

975
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:07,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, right, okay.

976
01:28:07,277 --> 01:28:07,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

977
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:07,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's still broken.

978
01:28:08,138 --> 01:28:08,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, no, yeah.

979
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:28,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The $95,000 went for park design, forest, the Medford Square, the Salem Street Cemetery, and the adjacent recreational space.

980
01:28:29,525 --> 01:28:32,167
[SPEAKER_02]: $20,000 to update the open space and recreation plan.

981
01:28:34,068 --> 01:28:35,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem to be relatively.

982
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:38,772
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a balance of $760,000 in the linkage account.

983
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less than, sorry, go ahead, Council Member.

984
01:28:49,685 --> 01:29:01,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and from my conversations with the folks in the Office of Planning Development and Sustainability, they said that it does fund a substantial number of projects with the roads and whatnot.

985
01:29:02,728 --> 01:29:15,050
[SPEAKER_06]: What Alicia Hunt told me is that, and this is what makes her think that the linkage fees right now are too low, whenever she does talk with the developer and she presents the linkage fee to them, like how much they'll have to pay, they never give her any pushback.

986
01:29:16,496 --> 01:29:17,376
[SPEAKER_06]: You know it's a good sign.

987
01:29:19,557 --> 01:29:20,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Good sign.

988
01:29:22,697 --> 01:29:30,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So she thinks that they're compared to like a lot of other cities are probably far too low and we're missing, missing a lot of potential revenue.

989
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:31,199
Right.

990
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:35,900
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng seconded by Councilor Kelly and as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

991
01:29:36,881 --> 01:29:38,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion members of the council.

992
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:40,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Discussion by members of the public.

993
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:42,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

994
01:29:42,427 --> 01:29:44,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Method Mass.

995
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:57,119
[SPEAKER_00]: After the last election, I noticed Councilor Lemke was appointed as councilor, and I was hoping that you would be a good addition to the council.

996
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:07,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the chair, how much of an increase by you going with the state formula would this be, percentage speaking, approximate?

997
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, is that through the chair?

998
01:30:11,091 --> 01:30:13,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you have an answer to that question at this time?

999
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:15,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a precise one.

1000
01:30:16,755 --> 01:30:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've heard speculation from people who have kind of done work with linkage fees in the past, and people have said it could increase three to four times just informally, like when I was talking to KP Law.

1001
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:38,549
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that I was talking with, he worked with linkage fees and other communities.

1002
01:30:38,569 --> 01:30:41,090
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, yeah, you haven't updated this since 1990.

1003
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You go up like 10, 15 times.

1004
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:44,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

1005
01:30:45,412 --> 01:30:51,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be some kind of an order of magnitude just considering how long it's been since we've actually updated it.

1006
01:30:51,895 --> 01:30:54,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what the study is for.

1007
01:30:54,256 --> 01:30:57,398
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I will be an increase, correct?

1008
01:30:58,078 --> 01:30:58,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

1009
01:30:58,718 --> 01:30:59,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1010
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, I used to call this

1011
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,568
[SPEAKER_00]: developer extortion.

1012
01:31:05,429 --> 01:31:08,750
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, I understand the mentality by calling it linkage.

1013
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:23,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you start digging a hole or destroying a building and putting up a new building, there's definitely going to be costs, especially if it's a 40-unit or 100-unit apartment building, for example.

1014
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:28,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got the infrastructure of the storage, the drainage, et cetera.

1015
01:31:28,976 --> 01:31:29,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows what else?

1016
01:31:32,506 --> 01:31:35,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I think it's like $5,000 per apartment.

1017
01:31:36,228 --> 01:31:40,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than that.

1018
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:40,990
4,900.

1019
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:42,371
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,903.

1020
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:42,371
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000, okay.

1021
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:47,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in East Medford price or the rest of Medford?

1022
01:31:47,213 --> 01:31:51,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That is within Southeastern Medford and then outside Southeastern Medford, it's 3,851 per unit.

1023
01:31:52,075 --> 01:31:54,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Southeastern is the most expensive.

1024
01:31:55,397 --> 01:31:56,357
[SPEAKER_02]: By 50 bucks, yeah.

1025
01:31:56,897 --> 01:31:57,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1026
01:31:59,179 --> 01:31:59,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.

1027
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:08,200
[SPEAKER_00]: once the building is completed and they do the infrastructure, what happens to all that extra monies?

1028
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:14,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's generally, it's spent on the purposes outlined, which did we already read those?

1029
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:20,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's parks and recreational facilities, police and fire facilities, road and traffic facilities, and water and sewer facilities.

1030
01:32:20,422 --> 01:32:25,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the act also allows for affordable housing, but the city did not enable that in 1990.

1031
01:32:25,463 --> 01:32:27,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're adding it now?

1032
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a further resolution, yes.

1033
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:33,343
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming up, possibly?

1034
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:34,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1035
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:35,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on the agenda.

1036
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:38,047
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is in the fund, presently, you said?

1037
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 22 audited, $760,000.

1038
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:41,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Total?

1039
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:43,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Total, yeah.

1040
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:50,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much is allocated for the Christine Campbell, the Marathon Bauman Fountain, which has been out of commission for more than three or four years?

1041
01:32:51,157 --> 01:32:51,457
[SPEAKER_02]: There was $160,000.

1042
01:32:51,497 --> 01:32:55,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not enough to get that done?

1043
01:32:55,841 --> 01:32:55,601
2022.

1044
01:32:55,921 --> 01:32:57,562
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has that money been appropriated?

1045
01:32:59,634 --> 01:33:03,277
[SPEAKER_02]: not aware of the current construction timeline for the Crystal Campbell Garden.

1046
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,780
[SPEAKER_02]: You could call the facilities manager or DBW.

1047
01:33:10,984 --> 01:33:16,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a resolution just because I get an update because I know they said the piece was in just to see when that is.

1048
01:33:16,628 --> 01:33:20,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So to help Mr. Mr. Cassinetti, that's something I'll do for the next meeting.

1049
01:33:20,472 --> 01:33:21,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.

1050
01:33:21,693 --> 01:33:23,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Peller.

1051
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:23,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1052
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:25,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.

1053
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:26,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1054
01:33:31,254 --> 01:33:31,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening again.

1055
01:33:31,994 --> 01:33:33,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1056
01:33:33,175 --> 01:33:33,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Pierce.

1057
01:33:34,335 --> 01:33:37,856
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Sharon Diesso, coroner of Mass Avenue and Circuit Road in Medford.

1058
01:33:38,676 --> 01:33:45,879
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the time today to browse through some of this linkage paperwork.

1059
01:33:49,560 --> 01:34:02,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I knew that it was up for review and was a little bit unsure about the definition of linkage, and now I do know more about it because I've looked up some information on my own.

1060
01:34:03,423 --> 01:34:13,245
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a page in here, President Bears, in Councilors and listeners, that talks about the suggested increase.

1061
01:34:14,405 --> 01:34:28,578
[SPEAKER_16]: I really think it's very steep, and I'm wondering at this point, and I have another question, if this whole linkage fee will be up for public meeting or general discussion for us before the new fees are set?

1062
01:34:29,078 --> 01:34:29,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1063
01:34:30,219 --> 01:34:30,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1064
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be a public hearing and a public meeting by the Community Development Board on any proposed change to the linkage fee.

1065
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have any idea what the date might be, sir?

1066
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we are asking them to give us a timeline.

1067
01:34:41,693 --> 01:34:44,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that would be, how would we find out about that?

1068
01:34:45,036 --> 01:34:48,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Just going to the clerk's office in weeks to come or something?

1069
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:57,128
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call the city clerk, go to the city clerk's office, go on the city website, events calendar, or call the Office of Planning and Development and Sustainability or look at their website.

1070
01:34:57,788 --> 01:35:06,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they, I think they decreased, I'm just going to make an estimation of something like 40,000 square feet to 10, and then they doubled the fee.

1071
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:12,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this would be a real dissuasion for some builders and for some construction workers.

1072
01:35:13,182 --> 01:35:14,082
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll tell you why.

1073
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:20,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Since 1990, the products and materials have quadrupled in price also.

1074
01:35:20,808 --> 01:35:23,491
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we're welcoming people to come in,

1075
01:35:24,331 --> 01:35:32,177
[SPEAKER_16]: it would be highly advisable to have people in the public come to this discussion because I think it might be a little bit steep.

1076
01:35:33,238 --> 01:35:45,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, there's a mention in here that the Office of Community Development will be retitled and under the supervision of a mayor, that she will take over that responsibility.

1077
01:35:45,346 --> 01:35:45,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in?

1078
01:35:45,947 --> 01:35:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not in here.

1079
01:35:47,428 --> 01:35:53,052
[SPEAKER_02]: The office was renamed in 2021, and as it is a city department, it is

1080
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: technically under the direction of the mayor, through the director of the department.

1081
01:35:57,114 --> 01:36:00,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I thought I saw a line in here that said the title would be changed.

1082
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:00,276
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1083
01:36:00,716 --> 01:36:02,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thanks for your time.

1084
01:36:02,097 --> 01:36:04,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The title has already been changed.

1085
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,680
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinance does not reflect the updated title.

1086
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:08,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, all right, thanks.

1087
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:08,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

1088
01:36:08,842 --> 01:36:09,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1089
01:36:11,263 --> 01:36:12,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemingng.

1090
01:36:13,204 --> 01:36:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, just just to clarify some of the issues that were brought up between the between the title.

1091
01:36:18,088 --> 01:36:27,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a bit of a weird thing because the state act specifies the office of community development, which Medford used to have until they were merged.

1092
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:29,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1093
01:36:30,597 --> 01:36:35,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, in order to so there's a in the letter from KP law, which is also the agenda packet.

1094
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a recommendation that we change the, like, in order to, like, truly be in compliance with the state act, we need to request that the state act be changed to specify the office of planning development and sustainability instead of the office of community development changing.

1095
01:36:52,564 --> 01:36:55,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Changing requesting a home repetition to change a state act is.

1096
01:36:56,865 --> 01:37:10,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be necessary that we have to do that to change the wording of the state act, but I'm going to try to see if we could do that at the council level and get things done a little bit more quickly.

1097
01:37:10,609 --> 01:37:16,751
[SPEAKER_02]: As a legal entity, the Office of Community Development still exists as part of the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1098
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:20,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a name change for the purposes of public view.

1099
01:37:21,653 --> 01:37:29,176
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of enabling acts at the state level that reference Office of Community Development, including the act creating the Office of Community Development.

1100
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:36,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So wherever in the state code that is referenced, Alicia Hunt is the Director of Community Development.

1101
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:42,202
[SPEAKER_02]: and that office is the Office of Community Development pursuant to state law and local ordinance.

1102
01:37:42,242 --> 01:37:46,584
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also the question of the escalating fee aspect as well, though.

1103
01:37:46,624 --> 01:37:58,250
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have to amend the State Act in order to allow for that, which we may or may not have to do, but might as well submit other changes to the titles in the State Act as well.

1104
01:37:58,270 --> 01:38:00,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Council Member Leming.

1105
01:38:00,952 --> 01:38:03,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the Council or the public?

1106
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:11,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Lemingng, as seconded by Councilor Callahan, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, are we still there?

1107
01:38:11,983 --> 01:38:12,183
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1108
01:38:12,944 --> 01:38:13,764
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

1109
01:38:13,964 --> 01:38:14,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1110
01:38:14,725 --> 01:38:15,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

1111
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:16,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1112
01:38:16,506 --> 01:38:25,872
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-056, offered by Councilor Lemingng, a resolution to bring Medford's linkage fee ordinances in compliance with the state's act establishing the ordinance.

1113
01:38:35,307 --> 01:38:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion that I can summarize this rather than read the same details again?

1114
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:40,531
[SPEAKER_02]: That motion is summarized.

1115
01:38:40,971 --> 01:38:43,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

1116
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:46,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilors, are all those in favor?

1117
01:38:47,336 --> 01:38:47,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

1118
01:38:47,717 --> 01:38:48,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1119
01:38:49,558 --> 01:38:52,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The linkage fee structure was established by a home rule petition.

1120
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:56,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And our codes say this needs to keep happening.

1121
01:38:57,024 --> 01:39:02,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So the request is that we update the city code to change Community Development Board.

1122
01:39:03,689 --> 01:39:04,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I reading the right one here?

1123
01:39:06,671 --> 01:39:09,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me one second.

1124
01:39:09,712 --> 01:39:10,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on page 13.

1125
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,274
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bit of a mix up in the agenda.

1126
01:39:18,716 --> 01:39:20,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 13 of 27 on our current document.

1127
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:24,179
[SPEAKER_06]: The text of this resolution is under the 24-0471, so it's kind of like it's... Got it.

1128
01:39:32,472 --> 01:39:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it, okay.

1129
01:39:34,914 --> 01:39:36,675
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in compliance with the State Act.

1130
01:39:40,037 --> 01:39:41,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring Medford's linkage to compliance with the State Act.

1131
01:39:41,859 --> 01:39:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council update the Medford Municipal Code 94-10 to change the Community Development Board to the Mayor and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1132
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:57,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council update the Medford Municipal Code 94-10 to change the language from no more than every three years to at least every three years.

1133
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemmie.

1134
01:39:59,011 --> 01:40:00,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so this was, so,

1135
01:40:01,713 --> 01:40:15,345
[SPEAKER_06]: This was in response to the fact that the Community Development Board has not actually never did update the linkage fees every three years since it was established in 1990.

1136
01:40:16,025 --> 01:40:21,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that the State Act specified that these recalculations need to happen at least every three years.

1137
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:29,897
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford's municipal codes states that they need to happen no more than every three years, which is kind of like a confusing wording thing.

1138
01:40:30,818 --> 01:40:44,009
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was looking through the linkage fee, or sorry, the other part that is a little bit strange is that the state act only specifies the mayor and the office of community development.

1139
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:50,415
[SPEAKER_06]: As having the authority to update linkage fees, not the community development board.

1140
01:40:50,635 --> 01:40:53,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that the community development board probably should have some.

1141
01:40:54,638 --> 01:41:01,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Role to play in terms of public hearings, especially, but it seems to give authority to the community development board to actually do that.

1142
01:41:01,604 --> 01:41:05,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of the office of community development, I couldn't really figure out specifically.

1143
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:12,913
[SPEAKER_06]: why that was, but also just in looking over the linkage fee ordinances, there were just like a lot of other things that did need to be updated.

1144
01:41:12,953 --> 01:41:16,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a, there's a typo in there because we have four different trusts.

1145
01:41:17,256 --> 01:41:23,761
[SPEAKER_06]: They all specify, like you have like a lot of texts that sort of copied and pasted four different times in chapter 9410.

1146
01:41:24,201 --> 01:41:32,867
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns out that they all specify technically that we have to put linkage fees into the parks and recreation trust.

1147
01:41:34,372 --> 01:41:44,096
[SPEAKER_06]: All like, so that's, it's just parks and recreation is copied and pasted four times under the, you know, police and fire, water and sewer, et cetera, et cetera.

1148
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:53,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So, which I think is just, and I noticed that when I was going over the linkage fee ordinances with the fine tooth comb.

1149
01:41:53,461 --> 01:41:59,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's kind of a lot that has to be updated there to really get the specifics.

1150
01:41:59,703 --> 01:42:00,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Which section is that in?

1151
01:42:01,524 --> 01:42:17,936
[SPEAKER_06]: that I believe, it's not the one that's quoted here, but it's, I had like a Google Drive, like I had a Google Drive folder at another time that I could go to to find it.

1152
01:42:18,997 --> 01:42:20,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1153
01:42:20,919 --> 01:42:23,020
[SPEAKER_02]: MuniCode is showing that it says different things.

1154
01:42:24,121 --> 01:42:24,661
[SPEAKER_06]: One moment.

1155
01:42:26,543 --> 01:42:29,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, hold on, I'm looking for,

1156
01:42:45,953 --> 01:42:47,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries if it's not quickly accessible.

1157
01:42:47,894 --> 01:42:49,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It just was for my edification.

1158
01:42:50,515 --> 01:42:52,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was... I'm just looking.

1159
01:42:53,157 --> 01:42:55,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was repeated in... Okay.

1160
01:43:00,717 --> 01:43:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I didn't expect to have to do this in real time.

1161
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to.

1162
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come back later.

1163
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Point is I was just going through it with a fine tooth comb.

1164
01:43:10,606 --> 01:43:18,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it does need to be looked over in order to just kind of like get some of the different authorities right and get the wording right.

1165
01:43:18,554 --> 01:43:23,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would motion that this paper be sent to the admin administration and finance committee.

1166
01:43:25,222 --> 01:43:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor loving to send paper to 4056 to the Administration and Finance Committee, seconded by Council is our Oh, any further discussion by members of the Council.

1167
01:43:40,118 --> 01:43:44,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to ask if you have run this by the Community Development Board as well as the Office of Planning.

1168
01:43:45,963 --> 01:43:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ran it by the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1169
01:43:51,848 --> 01:43:59,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia told me that she, Alicia Hunt, Planning Director, told me that she would hand it to the head of the Community Development Board.

1170
01:43:59,574 --> 01:44:02,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I never heard any response from them specifically.

1171
01:44:07,145 --> 01:44:08,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Kiley.

1172
01:44:08,207 --> 01:44:09,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1173
01:44:13,153 --> 01:44:18,561
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng to refer to the Administration and Finance Committee, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1174
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:19,362
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

1175
01:44:20,143 --> 01:44:20,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

1176
01:44:20,584 --> 01:44:21,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes 24-057.

1177
01:44:26,089 --> 01:44:52,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Resolution to add affordable housing to the linkage fee structure of Medford, offered by Councilor Lemingng, whereas Medford's linkage fee structure was uniquely established by a home-run petition in 1989, chapter 0488, an act establishing linkage exaction program in the city of Method, whereas an act establishing linkage exaction program in the city of Method allows for the funding of affordable housing, quote, the linkage ordinance shall only be used, shall be used solely for the purposes of defraying the cost of capital improvements provided to the city, caused by, if you don't mind,

1178
01:44:53,843 --> 01:45:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: cost by the necessary support future development such as but not limited to the following capital improvements to school facilities, public facilities, roads, sewers, water supply lines, affordable housing, child care facilities, job training facilities, public safety service and facilities and parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities, whereas the implementation of

1179
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:26,890
[SPEAKER_02]: This in meant for municipal code 94 dash 10 only allocated linkage fees for parks and recreational facilities, police and fire facilities, roads and traffic facilities and water and sewer facilities, and not for affordable housing, whereas in 2023 pursuant to general law chapter 44 section 55 C.

1180
01:45:28,424 --> 01:45:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Method established an affordable housing trust as a tool to combat the ongoing housing shortage, and there is the need for long-term sustainable revenue streams to fund this trust, whereas on the topic of home prices, the housing production plan published in September 2022 and prepared by the Office of Planning and Urban Sustainability makes the need for affordable housing very clear.

1181
01:45:44,751 --> 01:45:48,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, Medford has seen some of the highest price increases of any community in Massachusetts.

1182
01:45:48,912 --> 01:45:55,295
[SPEAKER_02]: There's currently a $280,000 gap between what a household earning the median income could afford and the median sales price for a single family home.

1183
01:45:56,565 --> 01:46:00,146
[SPEAKER_02]: of single family homes are considered affordable to households earning Medford median income.

1184
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:08,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it therefore resolved that Medford City Council update Municipal Code 94-10 to establish a fifth linkage bus bucket for the Affordable Housing Trust.

1185
01:46:09,108 --> 01:46:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that this resolution be referred to committee for further discussion.

1186
01:46:11,988 --> 01:46:12,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemingng.

1187
01:46:13,389 --> 01:46:13,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1188
01:46:13,829 --> 01:46:18,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The third in the three-part series of linkage resolutions.

1189
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:21,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is a very straightforward one.

1190
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:24,931
[SPEAKER_06]: This was another part of my discussion with KP Law.

1191
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:25,611
[SPEAKER_06]: They said that

1192
01:46:26,052 --> 01:46:38,779
[SPEAKER_06]: based on their reading of the State Act, we are able to have a fifth linkage bucket for affordable housing, which is commonly done in many other communities in order to fund affordable housing.

1193
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:43,862
[SPEAKER_06]: We just established an affordable housing trust last year, which is currently being set up.

1194
01:46:43,942 --> 01:46:44,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a very

1195
01:46:45,203 --> 01:47:05,559
[SPEAKER_06]: straightforward resolution to add a fifth linkage bucket as well to Medford's ordinances in order to add another revenue stream for the affordable housing trust.

1196
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:08,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I would motion that this be sent as well to the

1197
01:47:09,402 --> 01:47:11,324
[SPEAKER_06]: and finance committee.

1198
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:24,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also motion to request that the, uh, study we requested the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability earlier that that study also include.

1199
01:47:25,014 --> 01:47:32,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Um uh, additional, uh, an additional study about the addition of of affordable housing to the linkage

1200
01:47:39,438 --> 01:47:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: the Administration Finance Committee and to request that the Planning and Development Sustainability Office include a linkage fee for affordable housing in their proposed study of linkage fee updates, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1201
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:53,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Any discussion by members of the Council?

1202
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Councilor Scarpelly.

1203
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:55,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1204
01:47:57,061 --> 01:48:07,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I support going to committee so we can vet this a little bit better, but we're already listening for the parts that we've already identified.

1205
01:48:08,834 --> 01:48:10,815
[SPEAKER_08]: we're already lacking support.

1206
01:48:11,415 --> 01:48:23,058
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think spreading that a little bit thinner, when we've already looked at other avenues that we can try to find a pool to help with the affordable housing, I think it's important.

1207
01:48:23,078 --> 01:48:28,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So but I think until we, I think the reason why I want to see this go to the committee, so we can understand

1208
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:49,486
[SPEAKER_08]: how that pot has been distributed and what an impact would be if we subtracted it or what kind of impact that would be if we subtracted, you know, certain percentages and how much that percentage would cost and how that would affect, you know, those other pools that already are drastically in need.

1209
01:48:52,167 --> 01:49:00,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I would support it going to committee, but that would be my reservation in that meeting, making sure we have that data.

1210
01:49:00,352 --> 01:49:01,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important, so thank you.

1211
01:49:01,933 --> 01:49:02,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1212
01:49:02,794 --> 01:49:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the good thing is, because it was never established, it would actually be an additional item.

1213
01:49:08,017 --> 01:49:13,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be splitting the existing funds and be adding another item with a specific fee for the use.

1214
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:16,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wouldn't be dividing.

1215
01:49:16,602 --> 01:49:17,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

1216
01:49:17,463 --> 01:49:18,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemmie.

1217
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:30,337
[SPEAKER_06]: The other concern there, I do respect the idea that this could potentially be taking revenue streams away from other sources.

1218
01:49:30,438 --> 01:49:48,572
[SPEAKER_06]: But if linkage fees are going to be updated for the first time in 34 years, and they could potentially be raised by an order of magnitude, I think that overall, this would be adding enough revenue not only to the affordable housing trust, but to the other four currently existing linkage buckets as well.

1219
01:49:50,113 --> 01:49:54,197
[SPEAKER_06]: pulling revenue away from these other sources in any case.

1220
01:49:55,278 --> 01:49:55,918
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you.

1221
01:49:57,019 --> 01:49:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

1222
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

1223
01:50:01,783 --> 01:50:09,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Lemingng to refer to the Administration and Finance Committee, seconded by Councilor Tseng, any discussion by members of the public?

1224
01:50:09,549 --> 01:50:12,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1225
01:50:14,471 --> 01:50:15,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

1226
01:50:18,394 --> 01:50:26,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hearing there's an affordable, there's a housing problem, or shortage of housing, and especially affordable housing.

1227
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:29,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, I can feel that pain.

1228
01:50:31,822 --> 01:50:36,025
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to me, what the so called

1229
01:50:37,307 --> 01:50:44,550
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal aliens that are coming in, it seems like that would make housing more of a problem than help.

1230
01:50:47,051 --> 01:50:55,594
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gave a solution to Councilor Kit Carson, is she here?

1231
01:50:55,954 --> 01:50:58,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kit Collins, she's not here tonight.

1232
01:50:58,515 --> 01:50:59,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thanks.

1233
01:50:59,956 --> 01:51:02,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I gave her a copy of the New York Post.

1234
01:51:02,617 --> 01:51:03,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Carson.

1235
01:51:03,717 --> 01:51:05,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought she was on Zoom.

1236
01:51:07,512 --> 01:51:14,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave her a copy of the New York Post about a month and a half ago, and it was a solution that they use in New York City.

1237
01:51:15,855 --> 01:51:26,599
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose, I hope she read the article, and I hope she shared it with you people, because it's called apartment cooperative ownership.

1238
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:27,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that before.

1239
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

1240
01:51:30,481 --> 01:51:31,361
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not chapter 59, 5C.

1241
01:51:34,892 --> 01:51:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to make housing much more affordable.

1242
01:51:37,153 --> 01:51:39,654
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it in New York City for many decades, I'm sure.

1243
01:51:40,395 --> 01:51:51,400
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, my guesstimation, the price of a million dollar condo here would cost you, if you put zero down, it would cost you a lot of money.

1244
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:58,783
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy this co-op, it would be probably a third of the million dollar price.

1245
01:51:58,863 --> 01:52:00,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be probably in the ballpark of $300,000.

1246
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:17,641
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you're paying $2,000 rent now and owning nothing but stacks of rent receipts, with the $2,000 rent, that'll allow you to pay 500, 1,000, $2,000, it would allow you to get out of the rental situation.

1247
01:52:17,661 --> 01:52:18,461
[SPEAKER_00]: You could borrow $400,000.

1248
01:52:29,943 --> 01:52:33,166
[SPEAKER_00]: with a $2,000 rent payment by giving it to the mortgager.

1249
01:52:35,808 --> 01:52:42,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have total rights to your apartment, just like a condominium, you own shares in the building.

1250
01:52:44,235 --> 01:52:55,724
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense to me, I'm not sure if they have the apartment co-op ownership around Boston, but it would be like three times less expensive.

1251
01:52:56,994 --> 01:53:00,277
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get out of paying the rent and making the landlords happy.

1252
01:53:00,297 --> 01:53:03,199
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to bring that up again.

1253
01:53:03,219 --> 01:53:04,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you investigate that.

1254
01:53:05,241 --> 01:53:06,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1255
01:53:06,101 --> 01:53:13,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you know, co-ops will be one of the forms of housing ownership that could be funded by the City's Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

1256
01:53:14,408 --> 01:53:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

1257
01:53:19,192 --> 01:53:19,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1258
01:53:19,992 --> 01:53:23,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention that I do have a friend who lives in one of these

1259
01:53:25,916 --> 01:53:30,698
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatively owned buildings in Boston, and he raves about it.

1260
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:34,839
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be excited to talk about that as an affordable housing possibility as well.

1261
01:53:35,419 --> 01:53:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1262
01:53:35,959 --> 01:53:38,480
[SPEAKER_02]: The key thing to getting up and going is, of course, capital need.

1263
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So there needs to be some funding on the front end.

1264
01:53:41,841 --> 01:53:45,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the paper by members of the Council or members of the public?

1265
01:53:45,842 --> 01:53:46,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone on Zoom.

1266
01:53:47,682 --> 01:53:53,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that person put their video up and was doing strange things with their video, and we just had a Zoom bombing incident, so I'm not going to

1267
01:53:54,645 --> 01:53:55,485
[SPEAKER_02]: let them on video.

1268
01:53:58,927 --> 01:54:00,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1269
01:54:00,228 --> 01:54:02,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Angela Murphy, 16 Calding Street.

1270
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:05,811
[SPEAKER_17]: I know everybody says affordable housing.

1271
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:12,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, a few years back, they built all those condos across the street from

1272
01:54:14,329 --> 01:54:17,610
[SPEAKER_17]: the Wellington Station, all those new big complexes.

1273
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:19,510
[SPEAKER_17]: They're million-dollar condos.

1274
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:26,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Number one, they were built cheaply, because I know people who built and were part of the construction crew.

1275
01:54:27,152 --> 01:54:33,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, they were told they could build them if they put, I think, 10% low-income people, and they did.

1276
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:36,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what, okay, they built things, they went ahead.

1277
01:54:38,215 --> 01:54:41,376
[SPEAKER_17]: The people who were low-income were given a year's lease.

1278
01:54:42,327 --> 01:54:51,855
[SPEAKER_17]: At the end of the year, it's my understanding from what I was told from people who worked there and people who were managing that those leases were canceled after a year.

1279
01:54:52,255 --> 01:54:54,277
[SPEAKER_17]: So you say all this for affordable housing.

1280
01:54:54,777 --> 01:54:58,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Before you talk about affordable housing, make sure it's really affordable.

1281
01:54:59,636 --> 01:55:03,379
[SPEAKER_17]: for the people who are gonna go into there and in a long lasting place to live.

1282
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,541
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just wrong.

1283
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:14,748
[SPEAKER_17]: What I heard that was done to those people, because those condos are a million dollars and those people were there for a purpose so that those condos could be built.

1284
01:55:15,168 --> 01:55:20,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And when their purpose was no longer needed after the year's lease was up, they were gone.

1285
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:25,664
[SPEAKER_17]: So affordable housing is, to me, it needs a definition.

1286
01:55:26,365 --> 01:55:27,987
[SPEAKER_17]: What does affordable housing mean?

1287
01:55:28,868 --> 01:55:31,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody says there's a lack of affordable housing.

1288
01:55:31,050 --> 01:55:32,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know.

1289
01:55:32,892 --> 01:55:37,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Define it more to me because I don't see the difference between

1290
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:46,264
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, you have to make, you can make a maximum of $82,000 a year to apply for affordable housing.

1291
01:55:47,284 --> 01:55:48,505
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't seem right.

1292
01:55:49,585 --> 01:55:53,587
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know, it's just to me, it's a confusing term, affordable housing.

1293
01:55:54,567 --> 01:55:56,488
[SPEAKER_17]: There was always housing affordable here.

1294
01:55:56,528 --> 01:56:02,031
[SPEAKER_17]: My father had tenants, and all the years I lived at my house, his house was affordable.

1295
01:56:02,851 --> 01:56:07,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Nowadays, affordable housing is not affordable housing for the people you claim is supposed to help.

1296
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:09,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1297
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:18,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just a if you have any information on people who are violating the deep restrictions on affordable housing, the city would certainly want to hear that.

1298
01:56:18,128 --> 01:56:25,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We do keep a registry along with the state when housing units are created in developments like the Monera development or the Lumiere development.

1299
01:56:25,768 --> 01:56:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They are legally required to have deed-restricted affordable housing.

1300
01:56:28,989 --> 01:56:30,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, there's a definition.

1301
01:56:30,669 --> 01:56:39,771
[SPEAKER_02]: The city ordinance defines it as housing units set aside exclusively for low or moderate income renters or buyers that remain affordable through long-term restrictions.

1302
01:56:40,251 --> 01:56:49,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deeds that are on file at the registry of deeds, those properties, whether it's the land or the units, are deed-restricted to a certain level of affordability.

1303
01:56:50,874 --> 01:56:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those levels, generally the highest level, is what's called 80% of AMI.

1304
01:56:55,262 --> 01:56:59,884
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 80% of the area median income, which nowadays for a household of four is about $80,000.

1305
01:57:00,824 --> 01:57:07,926
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also lower restrictions at 50% of AMI and 30% of AMI, so lower amounts than that.

1306
01:57:09,126 --> 01:57:21,891
[SPEAKER_02]: For laws, for example, like the 40B law, which the state has enabled and allows developers when a city doesn't have enough affordable housing relative to what the state requires, that requires the developers to build 25% of the units

1307
01:57:23,467 --> 01:57:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: at 80% of the area median income, so that's where that 80,000 number comes from these days.

1308
01:57:29,049 --> 01:57:42,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, what I'm trying to say is that if you would support two-family or multi-dwelling homeowners in Method, they may

1309
01:57:44,031 --> 01:57:51,334
[SPEAKER_17]: and not raise their taxes as being proposed for this new thing that you're talking about, the sellers fee and whatever.

1310
01:57:52,134 --> 01:57:55,395
[SPEAKER_17]: If you would support them, like in the past, my father was supportive.

1311
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:56,676
[SPEAKER_17]: He could keep his rent low.

1312
01:57:58,342 --> 01:58:03,567
[SPEAKER_17]: people would be more willing to keep people in the houses in their apartments and rent it.

1313
01:58:04,388 --> 01:58:15,098
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, and as far as getting information about what happened to those condos and those people that were there in those buildings, well, the people who worked there who found out this knowledge,

1314
01:58:15,999 --> 01:58:16,439
[SPEAKER_17]: are shunned.

1315
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:23,265
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they're like now pariahs, you know, don't say anything, even though you know something or you never work again.

1316
01:58:23,625 --> 01:58:26,547
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's it's an unequal circle.

1317
01:58:27,068 --> 01:58:31,992
[SPEAKER_17]: You know things, but you can't say anything because then you're they're always against you.

1318
01:58:33,379 --> 01:58:35,661
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's hard, but this is what you hear.

1319
01:58:35,721 --> 01:58:41,745
[SPEAKER_17]: People hear things, people know it to be true, to a fact, to a point, it's sad.

1320
01:58:42,185 --> 01:58:57,535
[SPEAKER_17]: So keep the homeowners with multi-dwelling houses in method, keep them supported, keep them willing to rent their apartments because nobody wanted to rent a Section 8 because they treated, when I was on Section 8, they treated my landlord like he,

1321
01:58:58,769 --> 01:59:00,669
[SPEAKER_17]: didn't deserve the money they gave him.

1322
01:59:01,289 --> 01:59:04,410
[SPEAKER_17]: They come in and they look at my apartment, because my apartment was clean.

1323
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:06,110
[SPEAKER_17]: My apartment was pristine.

1324
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:11,571
[SPEAKER_17]: My kids had good clothes, but they didn't know the clothes my kids had were hand-me-downs and everything.

1325
01:59:11,991 --> 01:59:17,832
[SPEAKER_17]: They would come in and they would see a tiny little hole on the wall, in the drywall, going down to the basement.

1326
01:59:18,232 --> 01:59:22,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that has to be fixed and everything.

1327
01:59:22,813 --> 01:59:27,254
[SPEAKER_17]: And they didn't believe I could not afford the small rent that I was paying to that landlord.

1328
01:59:29,361 --> 01:59:32,484
[SPEAKER_17]: It's sad, but yet they would go to another house.

1329
01:59:33,384 --> 01:59:34,685
[SPEAKER_17]: It was discriminatory.

1330
01:59:34,825 --> 01:59:36,427
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a broken system.

1331
01:59:37,628 --> 01:59:54,201
[SPEAKER_17]: So look into it, support it more, support the people who are willing to have low rents, and don't support the people who rent to boarders and tough students, like 15 students in a house.

1332
01:59:55,336 --> 01:59:58,557
[SPEAKER_17]: and they can afford to pay $1,000 each.

1333
01:59:58,757 --> 02:00:01,598
[SPEAKER_17]: And the guy gets 4,000 or $5,000 a month.

1334
02:00:03,018 --> 02:00:04,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's sad.

1335
02:00:04,298 --> 02:00:10,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Look into how these houses and these apartments are being utilized by the people who own them.

1336
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:14,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Support the people who are willing.

1337
02:00:14,721 --> 02:00:18,862
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to move out of the apartment because the landlord couldn't take it.

1338
02:00:20,134 --> 02:00:21,215
[SPEAKER_17]: and everything being discovered.

1339
02:00:21,235 --> 02:00:26,237
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a little dirt on my tub because the woman who inspected it could not find anything else wrong.

1340
02:00:26,577 --> 02:00:29,159
[SPEAKER_17]: She would deny me payment until that was cleaned up.

1341
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:44,247
[SPEAKER_17]: But I know for a fact she'd go to a neighbor who was renting and on section eight next to my aunt, who had broken blinds and windows with no screens on them and the washer and dryer were outside in the yard.

1342
02:00:45,188 --> 02:00:48,469
[SPEAKER_17]: and everything, and it's just not fair.

1343
02:00:48,909 --> 02:00:50,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Affordable housing is a joke.

1344
02:00:51,750 --> 02:01:01,174
[SPEAKER_17]: It tends to the people who can pay the maximum towards their rent, and then the city or the state pays the extra, or it goes to nobody.

1345
02:01:01,194 --> 02:01:11,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody, or it goes to a certain group because they don't wanna be considered inappropriate not to have that group in that place.

1346
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:13,251
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not right.

1347
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:28,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Affordable housing should be affordable, all regards, across the board, and the people who are willing to rent apartments and multi-family houses should be supported for being, oh yeah, like my neighbor next door just bought the two-family house.

1348
02:01:29,422 --> 02:01:31,783
[SPEAKER_17]: She has a little rent for her tenants.

1349
02:01:33,004 --> 02:01:40,089
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was very fortunate that it was a family who lives there, the landlord lives there and rents, because otherwise they're all going to condos.

1350
02:01:41,303 --> 02:01:49,368
[SPEAKER_17]: or they're going to apartments, like you said, which are not affordable for anybody but two or three roommates.

1351
02:01:49,468 --> 02:01:57,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how I've said it or if I said it correctly, but I think the way of affordable housing is gone wayward.

1352
02:01:57,853 --> 02:01:59,674
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gone in the wrong direction.

1353
02:02:00,995 --> 02:02:02,856
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not right sometimes.

1354
02:02:03,677 --> 02:02:04,577
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I have to say.

1355
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:10,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I said it wrong, maybe I didn't make my point across, but sometimes when I get up here, I feel that you're listening,

1356
02:02:11,561 --> 02:02:14,143
[SPEAKER_17]: but you're not hearing what I say, so maybe it doesn't matter.

1357
02:02:14,483 --> 02:02:14,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1358
02:02:15,064 --> 02:02:15,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1359
02:02:16,805 --> 02:02:21,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments by members of the public before we come back to Mr. Castagnetti?

1360
02:02:30,876 --> 02:02:34,278
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mr. Castagnetti, two more minutes.

1361
02:02:35,529 --> 02:02:36,589
[SPEAKER_00]: someone left their trash.

1362
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:44,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I kind of understand in this country, how we could have a housing shortage.

1363
02:02:45,213 --> 02:02:56,197
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was educated in the seventh grade back in the 60s, back at the Lincoln Junior High School, I believe an economics teacher that said to me, this is a democratic republic.

1364
02:02:57,297 --> 02:02:59,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a capitalistic society.

1365
02:03:02,352 --> 02:03:07,521
[SPEAKER_00]: which runs better than Russia or China, as a matter of fact, from what I understand.

1366
02:03:07,541 --> 02:03:12,008
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, I was told it's supply and demand.

1367
02:03:13,052 --> 02:03:16,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're in such a crisis, what the hell happened?

1368
02:03:16,714 --> 02:03:19,036
[SPEAKER_00]: How come the developers were not on top of this?

1369
02:03:19,456 --> 02:03:27,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the government somewhat responsible for discouraging and not encouraging development?

1370
02:03:27,622 --> 02:03:29,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe lower the linkage while you're at it.

1371
02:03:29,823 --> 02:03:34,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the answer because I didn't go to too many colleges, but it doesn't make sense to me.

1372
02:03:34,306 --> 02:03:36,207
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, you mentioned Chapter 40B.

1373
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:39,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a state law.

1374
02:03:40,031 --> 02:03:50,154
[SPEAKER_00]: The developers can come in if you don't have over 10% affordable or something to that effect, they can come in and circumvent your actually your building codes, et cetera, to a certain degree.

1375
02:03:51,614 --> 02:04:01,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true that we have one, two or three large developments of apartments that are 40 Bs that are tied up in court by the city?

1376
02:04:01,418 --> 02:04:01,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?

1377
02:04:02,827 --> 02:04:03,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not true.

1378
02:04:04,208 --> 02:04:07,151
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them on Mystic Avenue was withdrawn by the proponent.

1379
02:04:07,691 --> 02:04:09,733
[SPEAKER_02]: They then proposed a life science project.

1380
02:04:10,573 --> 02:04:14,517
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to go through the planned development district process, but now they want an overlay district.

1381
02:04:15,037 --> 02:04:18,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guess because of the life sciences market that they're probably not going to come and build that.

1382
02:04:20,322 --> 02:04:27,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mystic Valley Parkway 40B has approvals from the Zoning Board of Appeals, and I believe the 760 Felsway is also

1383
02:04:29,696 --> 02:04:32,178
[SPEAKER_02]: almost done going through the Zoning Board of Appeals process.

1384
02:04:32,638 --> 02:04:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, did that process take too long?

1385
02:04:35,159 --> 02:04:39,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably be on the side of saying yes, but that's the status of those three projects.

1386
02:04:40,182 --> 02:04:42,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are how many units approximate?

1387
02:04:43,504 --> 02:04:45,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of apartments?

1388
02:04:45,105 --> 02:04:49,848
[SPEAKER_02]: The total of all three as originally proposed was 600 or 700.

1389
02:04:50,488 --> 02:04:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less than that now because one withdrew and the other two, the number of units were negotiated down.

1390
02:04:57,551 --> 02:04:59,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something doesn't make sense.

1391
02:04:59,193 --> 02:05:00,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is rotten at Denmark.

1392
02:05:01,475 --> 02:05:03,077
[SPEAKER_00]: This shouldn't be a shortage.

1393
02:05:03,778 --> 02:05:07,302
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a shortage of cash with all this hyped up inflation.

1394
02:05:07,362 --> 02:05:08,183
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'll agree with.

1395
02:05:09,892 --> 02:05:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.

1396
02:05:10,693 --> 02:05:12,894
[SPEAKER_00]: The life sciences went down the tubes, right?

1397
02:05:13,374 --> 02:05:20,239
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they were going to put the illegals, as a matter of fact, in the building that was sold from a Boston retail, where my son worked.

1398
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's probably stuck with not just that building.

1399
02:05:23,401 --> 02:05:27,404
[SPEAKER_00]: He made two offers they couldn't refuse behind him, including Santini Iron Works.

1400
02:05:28,765 --> 02:05:32,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess musical chairs is over.

1401
02:05:32,207 --> 02:05:32,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's

1402
02:05:34,534 --> 02:05:36,175
[SPEAKER_00]: That song is done for now.

1403
02:05:36,575 --> 02:05:37,276
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sad.

1404
02:05:37,296 --> 02:05:42,179
[SPEAKER_02]: The shelters would have been open to anyone who is facing homelessness in the state.

1405
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:46,863
[SPEAKER_02]: About half of the people of the 7,500 in the shelter system are from out of state.

1406
02:05:46,903 --> 02:05:48,164
[SPEAKER_02]: About half of them are from in-state.

1407
02:05:49,244 --> 02:05:50,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're in a sad situation.

1408
02:05:51,166 --> 02:05:53,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope leaders can fix this.

1409
02:05:54,808 --> 02:05:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1410
02:05:55,929 --> 02:05:56,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

1411
02:06:01,488 --> 02:06:05,473
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor—where did we start here?

1412
02:06:05,493 --> 02:06:07,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Councilor LEMMING seconded by Councilor SANG?

1413
02:06:10,379 --> 02:06:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor LEMMING.

1414
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:21,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say that I do sympathize with a lot of the comments that were made by Ms.

1415
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:22,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Murphy.

1416
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:33,807
[SPEAKER_06]: We are working on a good landlord tax credit proposal, which would incentivize landlords who willingly keep lower rents.

1417
02:06:35,187 --> 02:06:43,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also sympathize with a lot of the issues that this country tends to see with Section 8 housing.

1418
02:06:47,492 --> 02:06:52,355
[SPEAKER_06]: The state of affordable housing is not, it's not simple.

1419
02:06:53,456 --> 02:06:57,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no one silver bullet that can be done to fix it.

1420
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:07,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of the conversation that we do have here is, you're doing one thing, why don't you do something else?

1421
02:07:08,646 --> 02:07:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: We do need to do multiple things in parallel to even make a dent in this problem.

1422
02:07:15,911 --> 02:07:21,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to do that with a few resources that we have at this level.

1423
02:07:21,696 --> 02:07:26,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Another point that was made by Mr. Castagnetti about the supply and demand problem.

1424
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:36,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Another issue with that is that real estate is one issue where the supply can be uniquely constrained just because you can't make

1425
02:07:38,976 --> 02:07:40,577
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't manufacture more land.

1426
02:07:40,617 --> 02:07:46,260
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are demand for iPhones, for instance, you just be able to make more iPhones and just create as much of them as you want.

1427
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:57,466
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only a very limited supply of land and given a lot of things like zoning, different regulations, there's only so much you can build on that land, whereas

1428
02:08:00,427 --> 02:08:04,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the supply is constrained, whereas demand can just keep going up and up and up.

1429
02:08:04,748 --> 02:08:13,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a lot of what we're seeing these days, especially with different changes in the economy and an increasing population.

1430
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:22,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also recommend looking at the Boston Globe's spotlight series on the rising costs of development of housing.

1431
02:08:22,473 --> 02:08:27,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, they said it costs between $500,000 and $600,000 to build one unit of housing in Greater Boston these days.

1432
02:08:28,595 --> 02:08:31,259
[SPEAKER_06]: The reasons are, again, not simple.

1433
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:41,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it's local, some of it has to do with the state of the global economy, but this is just one small part of the many issues that people have brought up tonight.

1434
02:08:43,527 --> 02:08:54,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng, and I do appreciate you bringing up the proposed option for the landlord tax exemption that was enabled by the state just last fall.

1435
02:08:54,691 --> 02:08:56,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We're one of the first cities considering implementing that.

1436
02:08:58,353 --> 02:09:08,336
[SPEAKER_02]: As we've noted many times when we're looking at this issue of housing, it's complicated, and we're trying to use every tool available to us under local authority from the state to address it.

1437
02:09:09,997 --> 02:09:12,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them is looking at linkage,

1438
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:14,399
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about the transfer fee.

1439
02:09:14,419 --> 02:09:18,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about the good, low, and lower tax credit.

1440
02:09:19,202 --> 02:09:22,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just to the point made of supply and demand, how did we get here?

1441
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:23,924
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really two things.

1442
02:09:24,565 --> 02:09:31,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what you were just talking about, which is the demand is higher than the supply that's allowed to be built.

1443
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:35,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, the price of an individual unit's going up.

1444
02:09:36,235 --> 02:09:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I've learned from you and others about that commodification and financialization of housing as a financial asset and not as a

1445
02:09:46,107 --> 02:09:46,727
[SPEAKER_02]: public good.

1446
02:09:47,868 --> 02:09:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have not only is the demand of people who want to live in a place affecting the price of housing, the demand of the investors who want to make money off of a housing unit is affecting the demand on housing.

1447
02:09:59,777 --> 02:10:15,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have both of those pushing on a string and you have a massive supply restrictions due to exclusionary zoning, you end up with a housing crisis, which is what we're living in in this region and in most major urban regions in this country.

1448
02:10:16,664 --> 02:10:16,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1449
02:10:18,049 --> 02:10:19,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1450
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:21,931
[SPEAKER_14]: William Navarre, 208 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1451
02:10:22,351 --> 02:10:26,074
[SPEAKER_14]: You two both said a lot of the things I wanted to say, so I'm going to make this a little shorter.

1452
02:10:26,394 --> 02:10:28,895
[SPEAKER_14]: More to the point, and maybe that'll make the point a little stronger.

1453
02:10:29,836 --> 02:10:32,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one thing about buying up housing as an investment.

1454
02:10:33,018 --> 02:10:38,041
[SPEAKER_14]: There's only one thing that's a better investment than housing in this country, and that's land where you could build housing.

1455
02:10:38,321 --> 02:10:40,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't even have any depreciation costs.

1456
02:10:41,302 --> 02:10:46,806
[SPEAKER_14]: And so sometimes people associate developers and development with the speculation.

1457
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:55,313
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not necessarily what it looks like, because while that does happen, it's actually cheaper to just have the lot with the pile of dirt, the overturned wheelbarrow.

1458
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:59,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's usually what I usually think of with speculation.

1459
02:10:59,555 --> 02:11:03,016
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little less visible, because it's sort of just in between our neighborhoods.

1460
02:11:03,836 --> 02:11:10,678
[SPEAKER_14]: You can call those the dogs in the manger are holding on to that land and not letting anyone else use it.

1461
02:11:11,478 --> 02:11:12,899
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an Aesop tale.

1462
02:11:15,677 --> 02:11:26,013
[SPEAKER_14]: And now one of my main points I just wanted to emphasize is, Mr. President, you said that the city negotiated down the number of units.

1463
02:11:26,734 --> 02:11:30,701
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we talk about constraints on supply and everything.

1464
02:11:31,343 --> 02:11:33,846
[SPEAKER_14]: That shouldn't be a phrase that just rolls off the tongue.

1465
02:11:33,866 --> 02:11:35,027
[SPEAKER_14]: We should say negotiate.

1466
02:11:35,047 --> 02:11:36,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought my tone was negative.

1467
02:11:37,029 --> 02:11:37,990
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.

1468
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not.

1469
02:11:39,011 --> 02:11:41,053
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't a criticism against against.

1470
02:11:41,654 --> 02:11:43,996
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a this is a phrase that we just take for granted.

1471
02:11:44,477 --> 02:11:45,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the city negotiated it down.

1472
02:11:45,938 --> 02:11:46,839
[SPEAKER_08]: One information on that.

1473
02:11:47,179 --> 02:11:47,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1474
02:11:48,461 --> 02:11:51,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Those those projects were in land court.

1475
02:11:52,196 --> 02:11:53,718
[SPEAKER_08]: were stalled for two years.

1476
02:11:54,458 --> 02:12:00,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Now remember 99% of those projects go to go to court, the city loses, right.

1477
02:12:00,725 --> 02:12:07,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So what in essence, what happened was, they might have gone, but they left because they were losing a lot of money.

1478
02:12:07,893 --> 02:12:13,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And think about it 600 units, having 60 affordable housing units, that would have done a huge

1479
02:12:13,519 --> 02:12:14,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been a benefit.

1480
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:14,640
[SPEAKER_02]: 150, not 60.

1481
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,381
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

1482
02:12:15,942 --> 02:12:17,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1483
02:12:17,604 --> 02:12:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: What about 150?

1484
02:12:18,104 --> 02:12:18,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1485
02:12:19,005 --> 02:12:20,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because we because it was 40.

1486
02:12:20,727 --> 02:12:21,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1487
02:12:21,548 --> 02:12:22,830
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1488
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:22,830
25%.

1489
02:12:24,091 --> 02:12:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's a huge, huge loss.

1490
02:12:26,494 --> 02:12:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Fells Way is still happening, but the Mystic Valley Parkway one is not in good shape.

1491
02:12:30,118 --> 02:12:30,879
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our leader.

1492
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, the big planters now.

1493
02:12:35,353 --> 02:12:39,657
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli that that's not good.

1494
02:12:39,677 --> 02:12:41,399
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to underscore that point.

1495
02:12:41,619 --> 02:12:48,286
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when we can have a housing development proposal come in here, especially when it's going to have certain percentage affordable.

1496
02:12:48,306 --> 02:12:52,750
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're noticing the supply isn't meeting demand.

1497
02:12:53,854 --> 02:13:05,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, when people come in here to the chambers for a community development board meeting, I guess those aren't in chambers, but for a city council meeting, they want less housing, lower density, less housing.

1498
02:13:05,837 --> 02:13:07,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's where the supply isn't meeting demand.

1499
02:13:07,557 --> 02:13:08,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's one place.

1500
02:13:08,857 --> 02:13:14,479
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's obviously what happened with these 40 Bs, despite the state program that's supposed to get this mixed income housing bill.

1501
02:13:14,539 --> 02:13:20,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't happen because of these appeals and because we have this ridiculous concept of negotiating down.

1502
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:23,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would we negotiate down?

1503
02:13:23,081 --> 02:13:29,145
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like, would we negotiate down with the fire department how much water they're going to have when there's a fire?

1504
02:13:29,165 --> 02:13:35,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going to negotiate down with how much food when people are hungry?

1505
02:13:36,923 --> 02:13:40,546
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, maybe you could sell fewer tomatoes grocery store, please.

1506
02:13:40,626 --> 02:13:46,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you please sell, you know, negotiate it down with the CHA earlier?

1507
02:13:46,411 --> 02:13:51,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we'd love a thing, but we're not against clinics, but can we negotiate down?

1508
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,217
[SPEAKER_14]: This is ridiculous.

1509
02:13:53,257 --> 02:13:56,699
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not a good demand when somebody comes and wants to build housing.

1510
02:13:56,719 --> 02:14:00,361
[SPEAKER_14]: When we're in a housing crisis, negotiate it down.

1511
02:14:01,102 --> 02:14:03,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Build less of this thing we desperately need.

1512
02:14:03,723 --> 02:14:14,190
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm in agreement with the council that I thank you for taking up zoning and the various reforms that could allow us to build more because we gotta go in the other direction.

1513
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:15,551
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't keep negotiating down.

1514
02:14:16,731 --> 02:14:17,452
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a problem.

1515
02:14:18,172 --> 02:14:18,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1516
02:14:19,253 --> 02:14:20,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Barr.

1517
02:14:24,266 --> 02:14:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have 60 seconds.

1518
02:14:27,007 --> 02:14:27,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, you're cheap.

1519
02:14:29,608 --> 02:14:30,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be cheaper.

1520
02:14:30,408 --> 02:14:31,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I noticed.

1521
02:14:31,988 --> 02:14:34,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I off then?

1522
02:14:34,869 --> 02:14:35,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.

1523
02:14:35,529 --> 02:14:36,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.

1524
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:39,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting, I'm being criticized.

1525
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,441
[SPEAKER_00]: The Councilor made a good point.

1526
02:14:44,561 --> 02:14:47,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Land is scarce in 02155.

1527
02:14:47,402 --> 02:14:49,363
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of land.

1528
02:14:49,663 --> 02:14:52,405
[SPEAKER_00]: A third of Medford is woods.

1529
02:14:53,185 --> 02:14:58,147
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called Middlesex Falls Reservation by Saltwater Road towards Stoneham and Winchester.

1530
02:14:58,808 --> 02:15:03,070
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over a third of this land mass that's protected.

1531
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:06,972
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I remember on Mystic Avenue, I lived there.

1532
02:15:08,049 --> 02:15:12,215
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to those big trucks going to Boston, because that was the highway to Boston, Route 38.

1533
02:15:12,375 --> 02:15:16,380
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still called Route 38, it's still called Mystic Ave.

1534
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:24,291
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they built Route 93 in 1960, I remember the eminent domain, these houses over here,

1535
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:29,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember making a raft out of telephone poles, about eight of them with two by fours.

1536
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:33,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sailed like Tom Sawyers down the Mystic River.

1537
02:15:33,441 --> 02:15:39,443
[SPEAKER_00]: When the ocean came up to Medford Square, the Chronic Bridge, my blowtide was not pleasant.

1538
02:15:40,604 --> 02:15:51,027
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when they built 93, they never developed Mystic Ave to its full potential, especially on

1539
02:15:53,416 --> 02:16:02,825
[SPEAKER_00]: The 93 side, they have huge parcels of land that have buildings mostly, and it goes back, the lots of land go back like 300 feet.

1540
02:16:03,706 --> 02:16:06,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 300 feet frontage, it's huge.

1541
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:11,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I remember my real estate business, there are air rights.

1542
02:16:13,504 --> 02:16:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: at Wellington, yes.

1543
02:16:14,344 --> 02:16:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a very generous 60 seconds.

1544
02:16:16,725 --> 02:16:17,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we get your point.

1545
02:16:18,345 --> 02:16:18,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Air rights.

1546
02:16:19,085 --> 02:16:23,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Air rights at Wellington, air rights at the development of Mystic Ave needs to be improved.

1547
02:16:24,787 --> 02:16:25,967
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30, 40, 50 stories.

1548
02:16:25,987 --> 02:16:26,367
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 stories.

1549
02:16:27,047 --> 02:16:28,668
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call this Boston.

1550
02:16:30,788 --> 02:16:35,069
[SPEAKER_00]: You have air rights and if you need a variance, so be it.

1551
02:16:35,089 --> 02:16:38,130
[SPEAKER_02]: You should find 14 other people and put that on the agenda, please.

1552
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:39,830
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 stories.

1553
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:41,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I'm just saying.

1554
02:16:42,745 --> 02:16:44,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We need public support.

1555
02:16:45,226 --> 02:16:46,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Cassinetti.

1556
02:16:47,107 --> 02:16:48,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the motion?

1557
02:16:51,528 --> 02:16:52,229
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favour?

1558
02:16:53,149 --> 02:16:53,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

1559
02:16:53,749 --> 02:16:54,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

1560
02:16:54,690 --> 02:16:54,710
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-052.

1561
02:16:58,491 --> 02:17:00,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get it out.

1562
02:17:00,112 --> 02:17:00,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the last one.

1563
02:17:00,752 --> 02:17:01,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

1564
02:17:14,827 --> 02:17:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: be resolved that the city council invite the superintendent of schools and the acting finance director from the school district to inform the council on budget shortfalls for fiscal 2024.

1565
02:17:23,373 --> 02:17:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an update posted by member Reinfeld that last week's school committee budget meeting, the $2.5 million potential projected shortfall has been reduced to $216K.

1566
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: The contributing factors include an allocation for contracted payments across fiscal years, state funding reimbursements, the projected ESSER balance, correcting an error in the projection formula, and redistribution of expenses from general to revolving accounts.

1567
02:17:50,287 --> 02:17:50,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1568
02:17:52,008 --> 02:17:52,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1569
02:17:52,788 --> 02:17:55,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the input, but again, this is where

1570
02:17:57,119 --> 02:18:11,307
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the piece that scares me when we're talking about all these different funds that we're looking into and understanding when somebody has a shortfall on a Monday of $2.5 million, and then Friday they find it.

1571
02:18:12,207 --> 02:18:14,209
[SPEAKER_08]: In the real world, somebody gets fired.

1572
02:18:15,293 --> 02:18:34,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that that's what our colleague mentioned, but I've talked to other school members that said, when she asked for more clarity, they couldn't give clarity to exactly where the mistakes came from.

1573
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:36,972
[SPEAKER_08]: They said there were mistakes and they were corrected.

1574
02:18:37,813 --> 02:18:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Now,

1575
02:18:39,224 --> 02:18:41,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they, that was the question, are they corrected?

1576
02:18:41,567 --> 02:18:48,794
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you show the public, and I love this word, because I hate it if he is, but it keeps ringing true, is transparency.

1577
02:18:49,314 --> 02:19:02,408
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we honestly look at our constituents, and when, especially during budget time, when the biggest department that we fund in the city lose $2.5 million and then find it in a week?

1578
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:07,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So that to me is bothersome.

1579
02:19:07,632 --> 02:19:15,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping someone from the school committee would come, the superintendent would be here, but obviously that doesn't happen.

1580
02:19:16,476 --> 02:19:17,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And again,

1581
02:19:18,462 --> 02:19:32,489
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, even bringing up last evening, bringing up the dialogue that on the agenda last night in the school committee meeting was the rainy day account.

1582
02:19:32,509 --> 02:19:34,931
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is why I was fighting it so hard the other night.

1583
02:19:35,711 --> 02:19:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: The rainy day account that the school committee has brought to the attention for the support to the city council.

1584
02:19:44,278 --> 02:19:47,801
[SPEAKER_08]: The rainy day account that we mentioned here, if a roof falls in, right?

1585
02:19:48,322 --> 02:19:51,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if there's some kind of natural disaster, we have that funding for us.

1586
02:19:52,986 --> 02:19:53,707
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

1587
02:19:55,388 --> 02:20:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: By putting this resolution out there through the school committee, and from what I gathered in the meeting last night was,

1588
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:18,653
[SPEAKER_08]: a million dollar shortfall, would that constitute an emergency that the mayor could then tap into that fund to bail her out?

1589
02:20:20,994 --> 02:20:22,355
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not where that funds in there.

1590
02:20:23,955 --> 02:20:28,276
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're seeing is a gross mismanagement of our finances in this community.

1591
02:20:29,277 --> 02:20:31,657
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I've talked to council bears about this.

1592
02:20:32,177 --> 02:20:33,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say it till I'm blue in the face.

1593
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:55,087
[SPEAKER_08]: all of these taxes, all of these overrides, everything we're talking about, until we truly get a control of our fiscal responsibilities and management until we understand that we can trust that person, or the organization, all we keep doing is keep pumping more money to a black hole.

1594
02:20:58,069 --> 02:21:00,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this isn't the other side of rhetoric.

1595
02:21:00,071 --> 02:21:01,612
[SPEAKER_08]: This is it's black and white.

1596
02:21:01,632 --> 02:21:02,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right in front of you.

1597
02:21:03,809 --> 02:21:04,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Monday, 2.5.

1598
02:21:04,169 --> 02:21:07,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, 216,000.

1599
02:21:08,191 --> 02:21:09,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1600
02:21:11,373 --> 02:21:12,133
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some errors.

1601
02:21:15,334 --> 02:21:16,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Define those errors.

1602
02:21:17,455 --> 02:21:22,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a report just spoken by this council president, it's not good enough for me.

1603
02:21:24,979 --> 02:21:30,061
[SPEAKER_08]: For the sake of transparency, for the sake of moving forward with some initiatives that we might need.

1604
02:21:30,101 --> 02:21:31,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I've told people a thousand times,

1605
02:21:32,887 --> 02:21:35,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we do have to look at process of taxing.

1606
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:45,658
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could show the data and you could show the people that are overseeing our finances are responsible and shown that to us, then we could visit it.

1607
02:21:46,699 --> 02:21:50,803
[SPEAKER_08]: But until we see that, how can we even entertain it?

1608
02:21:51,303 --> 02:21:52,765
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I keep saying to my colleagues.

1609
02:21:53,145 --> 02:21:54,987
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it is very simple common sense.

1610
02:21:56,834 --> 02:22:08,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it, in all of your businesses, where you work today, you go in tomorrow and you sit with your team and they say, okay, everybody, we have a $2.5 million deficit.

1611
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:11,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to start looking into cuts, we have to figure things out.

1612
02:22:12,779 --> 02:22:16,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we come in Friday morning, everybody come sit down, we get donuts and coffee, guess what?

1613
02:22:17,024 --> 02:22:18,545
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all set, we found the mistake.

1614
02:22:19,446 --> 02:22:20,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, everybody go back to work.

1615
02:22:21,289 --> 02:22:21,869
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1616
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:24,252
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies.

1617
02:22:24,933 --> 02:22:33,022
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't give me the confidence that says, hey, let's put in multimillion dollar override and say, hey, go ahead, run with that now.

1618
02:22:35,751 --> 02:22:58,866
[SPEAKER_08]: until we see that until until we actually have control, or we have an office that gives us the confidence that we say, okay, the numbers now show after everything is calculated, after it's done responsibly, and then transparently put out there and say, well, okay, then this gives us an action that would say this is what we need.

1619
02:23:01,328 --> 02:23:03,089
[SPEAKER_08]: But why we're not more offended

1620
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:06,631
[SPEAKER_08]: as a council that has to approve a budget.

1621
02:23:07,871 --> 02:23:09,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Our number one priority was what tonight?

1622
02:23:09,851 --> 02:23:11,011
[SPEAKER_08]: For the budget, we had a meeting.

1623
02:23:11,752 --> 02:23:14,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Making sure our schools are level funded.

1624
02:23:15,012 --> 02:23:15,993
[SPEAKER_08]: What is level funded?

1625
02:23:17,353 --> 02:23:17,933
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know.

1626
02:23:20,514 --> 02:23:24,974
[SPEAKER_08]: The school system and the mayor, the president of the school committee has already shown us.

1627
02:23:26,995 --> 02:23:31,676
[SPEAKER_08]: There are issues, serious funding issues of checks and balances.

1628
02:23:34,212 --> 02:23:45,117
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just asked my council colleagues, in the good faith of common sense, sit back tonight and think about what I said realistically.

1629
02:23:45,797 --> 02:23:46,457
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very simple.

1630
02:23:46,637 --> 02:23:47,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't make it up.

1631
02:23:47,878 --> 02:23:49,158
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't one side over the other.

1632
02:23:49,478 --> 02:23:50,839
[SPEAKER_08]: This is right in front of you.

1633
02:23:51,579 --> 02:23:53,360
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a deficit of 2.5 million.

1634
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:57,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of a sudden some words came out and saying, this is where it happened.

1635
02:23:57,262 --> 02:23:57,922
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true.

1636
02:23:59,583 --> 02:24:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true because here's the best thing about Medford, people like to talk.

1637
02:24:04,158 --> 02:24:05,459
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know where it came from yet.

1638
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:08,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not defined yet.

1639
02:24:09,161 --> 02:24:10,062
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that it's found.

1640
02:24:11,943 --> 02:24:12,844
[SPEAKER_08]: That's irresponsible.

1641
02:24:14,245 --> 02:24:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't appreciate the representatives of the school department not being here when a councilor asks, especially when this council is one vote for that budget, that's either gonna support or deny what's going on there, because here's what I want everybody to understand.

1642
02:24:29,915 --> 02:24:31,056
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to the budget time,

1643
02:24:32,199 --> 02:24:51,709
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're gonna come together and say, hey, we're gonna find a way, we're gonna cut all this, but we're gonna raise the school budget by 10%, and I don't vote for it, I don't want it to be the dialogue to go around that George Scarpelli, the teacher of 15 years, whose family teaches, who dedicated his life for children in education,

1644
02:24:52,734 --> 02:24:55,655
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't want to balance the budget because he doesn't like schools.

1645
02:24:56,176 --> 02:24:59,137
[SPEAKER_08]: No, what I don't like is irresponsibility.

1646
02:24:59,537 --> 02:25:11,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like the lack of transparency, and I don't like the lack of respect for this council, for the person across the hall that chairs their committee, and the people that run that department.

1647
02:25:13,284 --> 02:25:19,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know it's a rant, but it makes me feel good because it's out there.

1648
02:25:20,691 --> 02:25:23,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, thank you, I love my claps.

1649
02:25:23,833 --> 02:25:24,554
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm here.

1650
02:25:27,877 --> 02:25:42,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Truly, that's, I'm being facetious, but this is how I feel, and I think that, really, sit back and think about it as we move forward to the, probably the most, I do feel for the sympathy for my fellow council that are new to this, it's not gonna be easy.

1651
02:25:43,369 --> 02:25:46,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all gonna be torn 15 different ways.

1652
02:25:46,931 --> 02:25:48,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Because no matter where you stand on it,

1653
02:25:49,844 --> 02:26:01,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Telling you right now, the common sense of this right now is we're not being respected or educated in their shortfalls, and we're gonna be blindsided, and guess who they're gonna turn to?

1654
02:26:01,707 --> 02:26:03,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the school committee has done in the past.

1655
02:26:04,668 --> 02:26:05,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask Mr. Rousseau.

1656
02:26:06,769 --> 02:26:09,890
[SPEAKER_08]: They publicly blame this council, publicly.

1657
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:16,772
[SPEAKER_08]: So be careful, because this council's gonna be the one that's gonna have to make these decisions.

1658
02:26:17,645 --> 02:26:19,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's not celebrate what we're hearing.

1659
02:26:20,067 --> 02:26:21,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the bottom, bottom of it.

1660
02:26:22,048 --> 02:26:25,671
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have, we can make responsible decisions come budget time.

1661
02:26:26,411 --> 02:26:26,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1662
02:26:26,871 --> 02:26:27,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1663
02:26:28,352 --> 02:26:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I for one, don't recall member Rousseau blaming the council for lack of funding.

1664
02:26:33,336 --> 02:26:41,221
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that the school has extensively put forward resolutions requests that the mayor appropriate funding in a different way.

1665
02:26:41,922 --> 02:26:43,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will say, I do agree with you.

1666
02:26:44,215 --> 02:26:47,836
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you don't know an answer, you probably shouldn't say it out loud.

1667
02:26:48,856 --> 02:26:51,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And they clearly didn't know what their deficit was.

1668
02:26:51,937 --> 02:27:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they had said $2.5 million, and then they actually do the research and the work, and they find that the number is not that, that is a mistake that someone should be held accountable for, because you have released inaccurate and incomplete information.

1669
02:27:05,121 --> 02:27:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: $2.5 million, big number.

1670
02:27:08,402 --> 02:27:11,062
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 3.5% of the school department budget.

1671
02:27:11,402 --> 02:27:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the general fund allocation is $70 million.

1672
02:27:14,335 --> 02:27:27,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I work on smaller budgets, but to say that there couldn't be double counting or a misallocation of two, three, 4% that you then do the research into and discover and find and eliminate, that's pretty standard.

1673
02:27:28,243 --> 02:27:37,808
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wouldn't have done is go and tell my boss that it was a 4% deficit before I knew it was a 4% deficit and freak everyone out about it before I actually knew the facts.

1674
02:27:39,229 --> 02:27:39,809
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the below.

1675
02:27:39,949 --> 02:27:40,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make it right.

1676
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:44,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion by members of the council on the resolution?

1677
02:27:44,612 --> 02:27:45,273
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible.

1678
02:27:47,114 --> 02:27:49,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, members of the public, name and address for the record, please.

1679
02:27:51,417 --> 02:27:54,299
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Juanita Waldrop and I live on Samson Road.

1680
02:27:54,519 --> 02:28:03,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I was here last week and I just want to first say thanks to Matt because you did answer my email and answered some questions that I never got to present.

1681
02:28:04,836 --> 02:28:11,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I had one more minute and after staying here until 11 o'clock, I would have hoped there would have been some graciousness.

1682
02:28:12,038 --> 02:28:19,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I did all send you a copy of that question and considerations, but only Matt answered, but maybe you're the chair of that committee.

1683
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:19,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

1684
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he was the proponent of the resolution.

1685
02:28:23,701 --> 02:28:24,601
[SPEAKER_12]: He was the proponent.

1686
02:28:24,641 --> 02:28:25,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Matt.

1687
02:28:25,901 --> 02:28:31,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just have to tell you what you said, uh, Councilor Callahan was spot on.

1688
02:28:32,515 --> 02:28:40,397
[SPEAKER_12]: about the transparency that you have to have in order to have the community feel confident in the decisions that you make.

1689
02:28:41,218 --> 02:28:44,979
[SPEAKER_12]: For us, you represent us, but we don't feel that.

1690
02:28:45,659 --> 02:28:47,380
[SPEAKER_12]: We feel disenfranchised from you.

1691
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:56,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason is not because you haven't added in more funds, what was the word you used?

1692
02:28:56,982 --> 02:28:58,443
[SPEAKER_12]: You used a word that was mis...

1693
02:28:59,542 --> 02:29:04,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Underfunding, it's not underfunding, it's blaring us in the face.

1694
02:29:04,569 --> 02:29:08,655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's right out there, 2.5 shortfall, million.

1695
02:29:09,096 --> 02:29:11,660
[SPEAKER_12]: People have homes, families, businesses.

1696
02:29:12,220 --> 02:29:13,422
[SPEAKER_12]: We operate on budgets.

1697
02:29:13,783 --> 02:29:15,946
[SPEAKER_12]: We know where our money comes in and where it goes out.

1698
02:29:17,341 --> 02:29:18,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I'm astonished.

1699
02:29:19,302 --> 02:29:21,463
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I speak for the community too.

1700
02:29:21,983 --> 02:29:23,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a big problem.

1701
02:29:23,804 --> 02:29:31,607
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a serious problem if you're going to be asking us to fund more tax money into these trusts or whatever it is.

1702
02:29:33,668 --> 02:29:35,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do we, do we feel confident?

1703
02:29:35,609 --> 02:29:36,309
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we don't.

1704
02:29:37,469 --> 02:29:38,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's huge.

1705
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:46,153
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to ask you, President Bears, when it says the acting finance director, what does this mean?

1706
02:29:47,543 --> 02:29:48,403
[SPEAKER_02]: for the school department?

1707
02:29:48,443 --> 02:29:49,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, acting.

1708
02:29:49,703 --> 02:29:56,025
[SPEAKER_02]: There's currently an interim or acting finance director, the assistant superintendent for finance and operations left.

1709
02:29:56,405 --> 02:29:57,025
[SPEAKER_12]: They left?

1710
02:29:57,285 --> 02:29:57,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1711
02:29:58,325 --> 02:29:59,226
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there a reason?

1712
02:29:59,586 --> 02:30:02,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they got a promotion to a job in Cambridge.

1713
02:30:02,646 --> 02:30:06,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they have an exit interview, I'm wondering, to find out what happened?

1714
02:30:06,407 --> 02:30:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not do any governance over the school system.

1715
02:30:08,528 --> 02:30:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee does that.

1716
02:30:09,848 --> 02:30:10,908
[SPEAKER_12]: They do, but you know what?

1717
02:30:10,968 --> 02:30:14,049
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's another thing, looking for transparency.

1718
02:30:15,333 --> 02:30:17,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Did anyone from the school department come?

1719
02:30:18,555 --> 02:30:23,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I came here and I waited all night for this particular issue to hear someone speak to this.

1720
02:30:26,859 --> 02:30:27,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's nobody here.

1721
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,321
[SPEAKER_12]: From the school department, there's nobody.

1722
02:30:31,781 --> 02:30:34,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even the acting finance director who's accountable.

1723
02:30:36,083 --> 02:30:36,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you not agree?

1724
02:30:36,763 --> 02:30:37,624
[SPEAKER_12]: You're an accountant.

1725
02:30:38,888 --> 02:30:39,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you not?

1726
02:30:40,509 --> 02:30:41,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an accountant.

1727
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:43,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I do finance and operations work, but I'm not a CPA.

1728
02:30:43,472 --> 02:30:49,077
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, you have the knowledge, and I have to give you credit, and I must say thank you for your budget ordinance.

1729
02:30:49,557 --> 02:30:54,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I heard you explaining it so quickly, I could hardly wrap my ears around it.

1730
02:30:55,782 --> 02:30:57,604
[SPEAKER_12]: But there were so many things.

1731
02:30:57,764 --> 02:31:04,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I to believe that none of those things you're proposing to put in a budget ordinance are in place presently?

1732
02:31:05,896 --> 02:31:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have happened on an ad hoc basis, but there's never been a formal schedule in the city ordinance to mandate that they happen at a specific time.

1733
02:31:14,101 --> 02:31:16,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there you go.

1734
02:31:18,024 --> 02:31:23,608
[SPEAKER_12]: That explains why there are no quarterly reports.

1735
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:26,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this public knowledge that we should have?

1736
02:31:27,710 --> 02:31:27,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1737
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:33,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to file a request, it is accessible information.

1738
02:31:33,754 --> 02:31:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have to give it to you.

1739
02:31:35,684 --> 02:31:39,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But it should be a more established schedule than that.

1740
02:31:39,266 --> 02:31:41,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in terms of the trust, I agree.

1741
02:31:41,308 --> 02:31:54,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I know last time, I think you mentioned last meeting, that there was no timely documentation available to find out.

1742
02:31:54,298 --> 02:31:55,539
[SPEAKER_12]: It took so much time.

1743
02:31:55,599 --> 02:31:58,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't it take like six months or something?

1744
02:31:58,101 --> 02:31:58,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what you mean?

1745
02:31:59,022 --> 02:32:01,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a few months behind now on the Warren articles.

1746
02:32:01,464 --> 02:32:04,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we're September or October.

1747
02:32:04,975 --> 02:32:28,876
[SPEAKER_02]: um does that seem does that seem an important amount of time to you um i mean we requested that they come in every month the explanation that we've received is that there were other obligations that the staff member who was going to do that had to take on and i'm not going to question that that may well be true but to me that's in a statement that there's not enough staff to do the job and i would hope that that would be addressed and the council has been really insistent

1748
02:32:30,788 --> 02:32:38,823
[SPEAKER_02]: about needing more staff and logistical infrastructure support for the finance department because we need them to do more for us to be able to plan effectively.

1749
02:32:39,123 --> 02:32:40,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, bravo to that.

1750
02:32:40,706 --> 02:32:42,048
[SPEAKER_12]: And might I make a suggestion?

1751
02:32:43,223 --> 02:32:56,452
[SPEAKER_12]: that this might be your top priority before anything else, that you have to get this in place, the house has to be cleaned up, and you have to let the community know before you move forward on underfunding, what was the word you used again?

1752
02:32:57,273 --> 02:33:03,718
[SPEAKER_12]: The underfunding of trusts and where you can ask people to be on board with anything you ask.

1753
02:33:04,278 --> 02:33:07,540
[SPEAKER_12]: You understand that you have to have this as a priority.

1754
02:33:07,961 --> 02:33:12,784
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to clean this up and present it that you got on board with it, it has to take top

1755
02:33:13,911 --> 02:33:16,292
[SPEAKER_12]: a top, a position, and anything else.

1756
02:33:16,732 --> 02:33:19,912
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to give you credit for actually working on that ordinance.

1757
02:33:20,052 --> 02:33:23,053
[SPEAKER_12]: All those things you mentioned so swiftly, I couldn't even hear them.

1758
02:33:23,133 --> 02:33:26,374
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to get something written and hear what your ordinance says.

1759
02:33:27,514 --> 02:33:29,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you email me or give me a copy of that?

1760
02:33:29,914 --> 02:33:31,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Larry, do you have a copy of the packet over there?

1761
02:33:32,015 --> 02:33:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give you mine.

1762
02:33:32,795 --> 02:33:33,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one right here.

1763
02:33:38,316 --> 02:33:40,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's in the agenda that went around on Friday.

1764
02:33:40,377 --> 02:33:42,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a copy here.

1765
02:33:43,462 --> 02:33:45,284
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have one available, thank you.

1766
02:33:45,304 --> 02:33:50,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's the full text of the ordinance.

1767
02:33:50,809 --> 02:33:53,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I will just say in terms of priorities.

1768
02:33:55,017 --> 02:34:09,584
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the ordinance we've met on most in committee the past year to get the administration to agree with whether not everyone on this council last June agreed with it, but the former president and I did work with the administration to get them to commit to passing that ordinance.

1769
02:34:10,424 --> 02:34:16,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And to, we did, George, and it took nine months, but here we are.

1770
02:34:16,607 --> 02:34:18,788
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I remembered from last week.

1771
02:34:19,448 --> 02:34:21,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Nine months, and it took nine months.

1772
02:34:21,869 --> 02:34:22,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're in the budget.

1773
02:34:23,922 --> 02:34:25,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got them in the budget.

1774
02:34:25,765 --> 02:34:27,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I can't hire anybody.

1775
02:34:27,347 --> 02:34:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hire someone, but it's not in my current authority.

1776
02:34:34,537 --> 02:34:38,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make or hire someone, but it's in the budget.

1777
02:34:40,635 --> 02:34:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a major priority.

1778
02:34:42,216 --> 02:34:46,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before this meeting, we had a meeting at six o'clock on what our top three priorities are for this upcoming budget.

1779
02:34:47,421 --> 02:34:58,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those three was that the administration tell us how they're going to get more finance staff or update the finance software so that we have more information than we have before.

1780
02:34:59,931 --> 02:35:01,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hopeful that this budget ordinance

1781
02:35:02,657 --> 02:35:28,168
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's really a budget ordinance with also a regular financial reporting component to it, will create a regular schedule where we can say, hey, you said you'd pre-promise us it's in the law, the law of the city is you have to get us this by the state, and that that will break any sort of log jam, or at least maybe adjust and reshuffle the priorities where they may be prioritizing some other work for them to prioritize this because it is in the

1782
02:35:28,638 --> 02:35:29,339
[SPEAKER_02]: city ordinance.

1783
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:32,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get your email, I just haven't had a chance to respond.

1784
02:35:32,381 --> 02:35:35,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you said you had a thousand, so I'm a little sympathetic there.

1785
02:35:35,723 --> 02:35:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cutting it down.

1786
02:35:37,204 --> 02:35:44,469
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, it is important you keep the community involved and also informed.

1787
02:35:45,189 --> 02:35:46,210
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so important.

1788
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:49,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't emphasize that enough.

1789
02:35:50,613 --> 02:35:54,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the reason I stayed so late was for this last issue.

1790
02:35:54,095 --> 02:35:58,058
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank you all for your time and your consideration.

1791
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:02,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, Councilor Tseng, sorry.

1792
02:36:03,551 --> 02:36:21,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And on your note of informing the public, something that I've been working really hard on over the last month that we passed in the Resident Services Committee is a litany of different proposals that reach out to the public and provide input surveys and forms and let people know about important meetings that are upcoming and big debates.

1793
02:36:21,917 --> 02:36:22,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And how did they get that?

1794
02:36:23,957 --> 02:36:27,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to develop an email list on the city side for the city council.

1795
02:36:28,941 --> 02:36:31,222
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to develop our city website as well.

1796
02:36:31,783 --> 02:36:40,729
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this is in early days, but if you reach out to us, we can make sure that you're put on that list when it's developed.

1797
02:36:41,149 --> 02:36:45,613
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also on the Medford public schools you YouTube channel.

1798
02:36:46,975 --> 02:37:00,127
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a recording of the, their budget committee of the whole meeting from last week, where they did the law probably got into the details a little bit more than on the school budget side, generally how the process works is for the city.

1799
02:37:00,649 --> 02:37:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: budget city departments that are not meant for public schools.

1800
02:37:03,890 --> 02:37:17,376
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor makes a proposal, the department heads meet, and we're changing this a little bit, but essentially we as the council meet with the department heads, the mayor makes an allocation, we discuss that and make recommendations, and all that we can do is say yes, say no, or cut.

1801
02:37:18,457 --> 02:37:23,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we say no without making a specific cut, it actually goes into effect after 45 days anyway.

1802
02:37:24,399 --> 02:37:26,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mayor has a lot of authority there.

1803
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:32,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee side of things is a little more involved, and that's because of how it works under state law.

1804
02:37:32,643 --> 02:37:38,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But under that, the school committee actually makes a proposal as a body.

1805
02:37:39,246 --> 02:37:40,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So they discuss all the details.

1806
02:37:40,706 --> 02:37:43,287
[SPEAKER_02]: They approve the specific line items of the specific departments.

1807
02:37:44,428 --> 02:37:46,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that recommendation goes to the mayor.

1808
02:37:46,689 --> 02:37:50,771
[SPEAKER_02]: She then proposes a number that may be different from what the school committee has recommended.

1809
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our role is only to approve, cut, or reject the total amount.

1810
02:37:56,632 --> 02:37:59,312
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot go into the school budget in any way.

1811
02:37:59,332 --> 02:38:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, we couldn't say we want 100,000 less for Spanish class.

1812
02:38:03,213 --> 02:38:06,454
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of that authority is with the school committee.

1813
02:38:06,514 --> 02:38:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a little bit less of a role in terms of the specifics of the school budget.

1814
02:38:11,494 --> 02:38:17,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Our main role is just whether to approve or cut the mayor's recommendation.

1815
02:38:17,035 --> 02:38:18,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Approve or cut her recommendation.

1816
02:38:18,076 --> 02:38:19,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, yes.

1817
02:38:19,456 --> 02:38:20,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Approve or cut.

1818
02:38:20,649 --> 02:38:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can say no, but again, after 45 days, the State Division of Local Services.

1819
02:38:24,552 --> 02:38:27,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And after 45 days, it would be, it's kind of like it goes into effect.

1820
02:38:27,714 --> 02:38:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes into effect anyway, yeah.

1821
02:38:28,855 --> 02:38:31,817
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very complicated, but in the end, it's very simple, isn't it?

1822
02:38:32,397 --> 02:38:37,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's, it's, she's in charge of the budget.

1823
02:38:37,501 --> 02:38:38,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can say, yeah.

1824
02:38:38,322 --> 02:38:40,403
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor, the office of the mayor, yeah.

1825
02:38:41,024 --> 02:38:43,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, talk to teachers like myself, okay?

1826
02:38:43,465 --> 02:38:45,026
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm retired, but I still teach.

1827
02:38:45,367 --> 02:38:45,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1828
02:38:46,232 --> 02:38:50,173
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we pay for a lot of things on our own, because I don't know where the money is.

1829
02:38:50,353 --> 02:38:54,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to look yesterday in the cabinet for paperclips, and they weren't even there.

1830
02:38:54,994 --> 02:38:57,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So something just as silly as that.

1831
02:38:57,615 --> 02:38:59,396
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't even have paperclips in the school.

1832
02:39:00,576 --> 02:39:05,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I said enough, and I'll say thank you, and I'm ready to go home.

1833
02:39:05,597 --> 02:39:06,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all.

1834
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:06,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1835
02:39:06,778 --> 02:39:07,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1836
02:39:07,038 --> 02:39:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming back.

1837
02:39:09,178 --> 02:39:10,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion on the motion?

1838
02:39:12,939 --> 02:39:14,640
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Lemingng.

1839
02:39:15,846 --> 02:39:21,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to offer my general sympathies on people trying to stay informed on city council and city government just in general.

1840
02:39:33,473 --> 02:39:45,442
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Tseng said, we are working on several initiatives at the moment to keep people informed a bit more of a comprehensive manner, but I think a lot of people also discover that to really.

1841
02:39:46,263 --> 02:39:52,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the state of things is that without any local news to really understand what's going on, it kind of has to become like a hobby or part of your.

1842
02:39:53,528 --> 02:40:04,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Social life so you have to like know, you know Which subreddits which Facebook groups to go to which YouTube channels to look on to find which pieces of information and a lot and I

1843
02:40:07,467 --> 02:40:08,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it.

1844
02:40:08,967 --> 02:40:10,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of like the state of affairs.

1845
02:40:10,988 --> 02:40:22,210
[SPEAKER_06]: But realistically, a lot of people that are super involved in the city do have a number of these different sources and people they talk to to sort of figure out how these things work.

1846
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

1847
02:40:22,430 --> 02:40:22,490
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1848
02:40:22,510 --> 02:40:22,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1849
02:40:38,467 --> 02:40:42,628
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemingng.

1850
02:40:42,848 --> 02:40:43,628
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favour?

02:40:44,148 --> 02:40:44,549

[SPEAKER_02]: on the motion of Councilor Tseng to adjourn seconded by Councilor Kelly and all those in favour.
