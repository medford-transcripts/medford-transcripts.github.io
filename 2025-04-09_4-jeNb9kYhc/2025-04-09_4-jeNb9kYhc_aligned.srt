96
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,644
Chairman Warren.

97
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,085
Good evening, Council.

98
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:38,545
We're trying to run.

99
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:39,686
It's a little too late.

100
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:45,027
We should have get that to you by last month, but you know, the timing was off.

101
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,088
So we make sure we get it done before.

102
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,449
It's a little too late.

103
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:51,189
There's a lot to do.

104
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:53,358
Right.

105
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:55,640
Do we have any question from the council on the date?

106
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:08,108
Because apparently, technically, we verbally, we share with you, with the council, that we were going to help, if necessary, the preliminary on September 9th.

107
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:12,111
But we run into a legal issue with the state.

108
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:16,694
And on it, we had to push it from the 9th to the 16th.

109
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:21,157
So if there will be a primary, a preliminary, hopefully no.

110
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:21,737
OK.

111
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:24,456
That's the only change.

112
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,676
Everything else is the same.

113
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:36,200
One of the key thing we tried to do this year because we had previous issues, the fact we give the city a full week of early voting.

114
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:42,103
We're trying to make everybody happy so that there's no excuse not to vote in this cycle.

115
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:46,244
All right.

116
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:52,307
Any questions by members of the council on the proposed election calendar?

117
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:52,907
Is there a motion?

118
00:30:54,842 --> 00:31:00,165
On the motion to approve by Councilor Lemming seconded by seconded by Councillor saying Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

119
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:05,708
That's a call him.

120
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:06,268
Yes.

121
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,491
Vice President Collins.

122
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:11,151
Yes.

123
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,032
That's a lemon.

124
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:14,813
That's a scrub Kelly.

125
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:20,697
That's a saying President bears yes 70 affirmative no negative emotion passes.

126
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:21,097
Thank you.

127
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:21,977
Thank you.

128
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:22,337
Good luck.

129
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:34,563
25-050 submitted by Mayor Brianna Longo Kern, loan order 25,775,000 school HVAC infrastructure and roof bonds supplemental.

130
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:45,245
Dear President Behrs and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the loan order below, which is in addition to the 5 million loan order that appeared before the council at its December 17th, 2024 meeting.

131
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:45,706
Be it ordered that 25,775,000

132
00:31:52,129 --> 00:32:10,775
$1,000 is appropriated for the purposes of replacing boilers and cooling systems with new condensing boilers and heat pumps including associated automated controlled structural and architectural work, electrical work, and weatherization at the McGlynn School and Andrews School

133
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:22,380
and the acquisition and installation of solar panels and a new roof or roof repairs at the McGlynn school, including the cost of planning, design, architectural and engineering services and all incidental other costs incidental and related there too.

134
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:29,505
And I'll leave it at that and I will go to our climate planner Brenda Pike and the assistant superintendent Peter Cushing.

135
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:31,845
Good evening.

136
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:36,907
Thank you very much for having us here this evening to give you an update on the project.

137
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:44,289
This evening, as Council President mentioned, here with Brenda Pike, also Tom Ellis, Josh Doolittle.

138
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,530
Tom is from JLL, our owner's project manager.

139
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:56,013
Josh is from our designer B2Q, and Alicia Hunt from the city's Office of Sustainability is also here with us this evening.

140
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,063
As we've previously presented.

141
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:16,208
This is a comprehensive project to replace and update the HVAC and heating ventilation air conditioning systems at the McGlynn in the Andrews with modern systems the buildings as mentioned previously are approaching 25 years old.

142
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:20,030
The building systems have expended their useful life.

143
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:30,961
At present, we have previously been here for $5 million for pre purchase of equipment that pre purchase of equipment actually went through this past Friday.

144
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:40,011
There was Herculean effort done by all parties involved including the city's procurement office, mayor's office, and vice chair of the school committee.

145
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:44,074
So really appreciate everybody who has really made this project happen.

146
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:52,561
It's definitely a sprint to make sure that we get these systems installed prior to students arriving as best as possible at the end of August.

147
00:33:54,522 --> 00:34:00,186
So phase one pre-construction involved $5 million and we appreciate that bond.

148
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:08,613
Of that was equipment pre-purchase of $3.3 million and numerous other costs that you can see on the screen.

149
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,648
construction for this project as we enter phase two is estimated to be $22,945,000 with

150
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:30,349
contingency costs of $687,273 for owner contingency.

151
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,630
Designer through construction to finish the project for B2Q is $1.3 million.

152
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,770
Our owner's project manager, $484,000.

153
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,811
And other contingencies not considered in the GMP.

154
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:45,592
GMP stands for gross maximum price.

155
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:52,413
That means that our costs will not exceed the gross maximum price when we're using construction management at risk.

156
00:34:52,973 --> 00:35:06,423
The construction manager, Consigli, has been brought on early in the design process so that they can be involved in making sure that we have a complete package ready to be installed, ordered and installed for our schools.

157
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:15,871
Yeah, I just wanted to talk a little bit about some of these other costs that we have on here, which include $500,000 for

158
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,348
commissioning the systems once they're installed.

159
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:28,957
We have in here 619,000 for ADA upgrades that were triggered by a project of this size.

160
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:39,348
I want to note here that there's an additional 2.3 million in ADA upgrades that were identified through this process.

161
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:56,271
Because of changes in ADA requirements from when the building was built to now, based on the consultant's experience, they expect that we can get variances for those because while the $619,000 that we have here is for things that are

162
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:23,201
are that are considered we consider very beneficial, or not too costly beneficial like fixing the entrance to the McGlynn so that there's no lip there that that wheelchairs can't get over for instance, the that additional 2.3 million are for things that are changes that are have very

163
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:28,068
relatively small benefits, but relatively high costs.

164
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:36,431
So for instance, moving a sink up one inch and all the associated plumbing and tiling and other costs along with that.

165
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:40,332
So we're going through that variance process in April and May.

166
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:49,036
I'll note here the IT rooms, we now have just the IT rooms for the Anders and McGlynn listed here.

167
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:52,857
The other three schools IT room equipment

168
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:56,387
will be done through the school budget.

169
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:06,554
We have the McGlynn roof refurbishment at $1.5 million instead of a $3 million replacement there.

170
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:13,719
The warranty is roughly the same and would still allow for moving forward with solar if we decide that we want to do that.

171
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:24,543
And then I also want to point out that we are expecting about $2.2 million in mass save incentives for this project but those are reimbursable.

172
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:31,448
So, we've, we have to authorize the spending and buy the equipment and install them.

173
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:35,882
before getting those rebates back some months later.

174
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:49,494
So that amount is not included in the 25 or that amount is not subtracted from that $25 million bond because we do need to have that to spend that up front.

175
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:55,680
But we do expect that long term, we won't be paying that off for a long period of time.

176
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:01,548
And then I would add that we have solar on here as an add alternate.

177
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,290
That's not included in the above cost.

178
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:12,436
We had just been considering it if we were able to do it cheaper through this process than we otherwise would be able to.

179
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:20,062
And it's still a possibility if the project comes in under the expected cost, but it's not included right now.

180
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:31,996
project could very well come in under the this expected cost here, because we do have some very healthy contingencies built in, not just that owner contingency and the construction contingencies.

181
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:40,603
But we also have over $2 million in contingencies for possible tariffs and possible second shift work if the project is delayed.

182
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:44,226
And so we need to do a lot of second shift work in order to make up the schedule.

183
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:48,650
So we're hoping that that won't need to be dug into too much.

184
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:48,870
But

185
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,972
it's there so that we don't have to come back to you a third time.

186
00:38:55,535 --> 00:39:00,339
We are being very proactive, though, in making sure that this project is being well managed, well run.

187
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:09,347
Our OPM is being really on the ball with us and the construction management designer as well to make sure that we are well prepared

188
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:11,589
when we hit the summer.

189
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:18,475
We've already worked internally as a school to make sure that all summer programming has been redistributed throughout the district to other buildings.

190
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:28,682
And we are making efforts to make sure that if any office staff need to be moved as well, they'll be able to be moved during the summer as well.

191
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,384
Just one more slide for the final.

192
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:34,227
So you can see the total costs

193
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:53,328
brought in and our hopes that $30,111,000 number does include healthy contingencies that we plan to be very hawkish on and preserve as much of that as possible for the City of Medford.

194
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,484
Thank you.

195
00:39:58,724 --> 00:40:01,226
And this is our third time I think seeing this project.

196
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:08,893
If you could, could you just discuss any thing that's changed since the first two presentations that we received and then I can go.

197
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:10,415
I'm sure a lot of small things have changed.

198
00:40:10,435 --> 00:40:11,616
You can keep it to the bigger things.

199
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:14,098
And then I'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarfelli.

200
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:17,334
I would say the two most significant changes.

201
00:40:18,495 --> 00:40:31,746
We were planning to do some mechanical installations in the building for cost savings and preventing workers from being in the buildings we've moved a lot of the equipment to rooftop rooftop units.

202
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,427
I'm just turning to my team to confirm.

203
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:37,188
I have a lot of other things besides the HVAC.

204
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:41,610
So as the assistant superintendent, but this is definitely the biggest project right now.

205
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,211
So that's a major piece.

206
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:49,413
I would say the second major piece is the ADA upgrades.

207
00:40:49,973 --> 00:41:01,989
If I'm going to be honest, we, these buildings were built in 2001, and open to students in 2001, that is well after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, but codes have changed over the years.

208
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:02,730
All right.

209
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,796
So, I would say that and just so everyone is clear, when a project.

210
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:18,620
exceeds 30% of the assessed value of the buildings and the assessed value of these buildings in the city of Medford is approximately $69, $70 million.

211
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:26,602
So once you exceed 30%, it requires a full review of the entire structure for ADA compliance.

212
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:31,644
So I'd say those are the two biggest things in my book that have changed.

213
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:40,593
Yeah, and then I would say in terms of the budget the base, the difference would be that the tariff contingency and the second shift premium contingency.

214
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:42,633
I think the budget is.

215
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:48,929
about a million dollars higher than what we had anticipated it would be the last time that we came here.

216
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:54,355
And that's entirely because the additional contingencies that we built in there.

217
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:56,077
There is Council President.

218
00:41:56,758 --> 00:42:03,025
One more thing to when I had entered this project I had fully expected for us to go for a new roof, a soup to nuts new roof.

219
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:13,989
because the added R value insulation of a new roof following the 2011 building codes of Massachusetts, I expected to have considerable savings.

220
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:25,292
The new roof would cost approximately $3 million all in new roofing materials, EPDM, and the insulation plus the labor.

221
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:29,673
The reality is, okay, that we get the same

222
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:39,023
Warranty as a fluid applied solution that was done to the Andrews roof so we get a 20 year life expectancy.

223
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:48,690
we would only see approximately $300,000 of savings from the new installation.

224
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:56,336
So we would be spending $1.2 million to get essentially the same outcome.

225
00:42:56,897 --> 00:43:04,983
So a restoration is not only the most fiscally responsible, but it achieves the same end as a new roof.

226
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:07,385
Thank you.

227
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:09,327
Go to Vice President Collins.

228
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:11,943
Thank you.

229
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:16,124
I wanted to thank you again for coming before us to again, describe this project.

230
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:37,168
For folks who weren't at the previous presentations that the city council received on this, just to quickly paraphrase the overview that you gave, my understanding is this is to support the urgent and necessary HVAC repairs and roof repairs so that when kids go back to school in the fall, they'll have functioning air conditioning.

231
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:41,189
and non-leaky roofs to enjoy at the start of the new school year.

232
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:42,730
Very glad that we can support that.

233
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,350
I'm so glad to hear.

234
00:43:45,671 --> 00:43:58,054
Obviously, taking on a major capital expense is not something that any of us take lightly, but I'm glad that this project is one whose scale enables us to do those ADA upgrades that I know people in the community have been asking for a long time.

235
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,935
Thank you for your diligence around that as well.

236
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:06,657
I appreciate all of the documentation for continuing to keep the council abreast of this and I would motion to approve.

237
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:10,184
Thanks.

238
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:12,833
We have a motion to approve from Vice President Collins, seconded by.

239
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,154
seconded by Councillor Singh and we'll go to Councillor Scarpelli.

240
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:17,455
Thank you, Council President.

241
00:44:18,415 --> 00:44:22,355
I know that it's not not you two but Mr. Dickinson's here.

242
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:41,979
Did we entertain by any chance using any of the 28 million dollars in free cash now that we see is that that number came out a few weeks ago that we have in excess of 28 million and in the past we've shown that we've actively actively worked by moving that money into capital projects to possibly

243
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:52,472
speed things up and then take some future costs to our citizens away, if that helps.

244
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:56,854
I'm not qualified to speak to that.

245
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,796
We will be looking at all different ways to finance this project.

246
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:06,660
Obviously, there's a lot of it that absolutely... Okay, once again.

247
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:12,670
Obviously this has to be done.

248
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:16,260
When I'm looking at it, I'm looking at

249
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:26,651
how much the interest in principal cost will affect the budget going forward right now, five, six years.

250
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:43,880
It does put, if we borrow this full sum of money, it would put a big damper on the budget in 2028 and 2029 given the increase we would get through Prop 2.5 and new growth and what debt is actually coming off

251
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,583
of our debt schedule, our waterfall schedule.

252
00:45:49,164 --> 00:46:05,798
So yes, we will probably be looking hard at not only using free cash to fund some of this to see how we can fit everything into the budget, but also the timing of the borrowings and when we will actually have to start paying principal and interest on the full general obligation bond.

253
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,026
So that's good to know.

254
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:12,728
Like I said, I didn't expect to use all $28 million and get this project done.

255
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:20,913
But I know that since we have $20 million and we need to move quickly with this project, I appreciate the fact that we're looking into it.

256
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:21,434
So thank you.

257
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:23,595
No, we're looking at this very carefully.

258
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:24,616
Thank you.

259
00:46:26,477 --> 00:46:26,817
Thank you.

260
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,919
Any further discussion by members of the council?

261
00:46:31,908 --> 00:46:36,989
Seeing none, we have a motion from Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang to approve for first reading.

262
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:40,589
Is there any discussion by members of the public either in person or on Zoom?

263
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:45,010
If you're here in person, you can step up to the podium or you can raise your hand on Zoom.

264
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:52,892
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

265
00:46:57,092 --> 00:46:57,772
Councilor Callahan?

266
00:46:58,152 --> 00:46:58,392
Yes.

267
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:01,273
Vice President Collins?

268
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:03,044
Yes.

269
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:03,124
Yes.

270
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:03,224
Yes.

271
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:03,304
Yes.

272
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:03,424
Yes.

273
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:03,585
Yes.

274
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:03,725
Yes.

275
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:04,345
Yes.

276
00:47:24,568 --> 00:47:43,721
Dear President bears and members of the Council on behalf of the CPC I respect the request and recommend your Honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee $11,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the Winthrop Street Garden Commission for pergola installation at the Winthrop Street Gardens and it will go to manager to.

277
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:46,903
Everyone.

278
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:48,725
I'm Teresa DuPont.

279
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:52,134
I'm the CPA manager, Community Preservation Act manager here for the city.

280
00:47:52,555 --> 00:47:55,624
I'm joined by Georgiana Chevre, who is the Winthrop Street Garden

281
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:56,777
coordinator.

282
00:47:57,158 --> 00:47:57,438
Nailed it.

283
00:47:58,098 --> 00:48:07,784
Um we are before you tonight asking for an appropriation of $11, 000 from our Open Space Recreation Reserve to fund a shade structure or pergola project at Winthrop Street.

284
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:17,170
It's something that has been environmentally reviewed and approved from all the various city bodies and we look for your support in this project.

285
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:19,132
Happy to answer any questions.

286
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:19,992
Thank you.

287
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,713
Anything you want to add, Georgiana?

288
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:21,773
No.

289
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:23,654
Alright, cool.

290
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:24,715
Um any

291
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,519
Seeing none, do we have any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

292
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:40,724
Also seeing none, is there a motion on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by?

293
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:42,705
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

294
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:44,806

Could we, we do have clear channel here, could we take it quickly and then go?

309
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,171
All right.

310
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:18,837
I'm gonna go to paper 25036, hearings, petition to amend the special permit.

311

00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:46,544
Petitioner is seeking an amendment to the previously granted special permit.

314
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:55,408
The petitioner is seeking the amendment to upgrade and replace two digital screens on the signboard located at the property and to ask for a review and potential adjustment slash reduction in the permit fee.

315
00:49:56,281 --> 00:50:01,925
Copy of the full text of the requested amendment can be viewed in the office of the city clerk room one or three Medford City Hall.

316
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:11,612
Please call the Medford city clerk's office at 781-393-2425 for any aids and accommodations by order of the many Medford City Council signed Adam I'll her to be a city clerk.

317
00:50:11,973 --> 00:50:13,414
So I'm going to open the public hearing.

318
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:17,617
And I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then we can hear from the petitioner.

319
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:19,979
Thank you, Mr. President.

320
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:22,599
And is the petitioner here?

321
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,081
I think that we do have the petitioner present.

322
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:35,830
I think it's important that we can hear from him, but I know that there are some questions we have that we might have legally that we can't answer tonight, but I'd like to hear from the petitioner if we can.

323
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,773
Mr. President, you should be able to turn on your video now if you so choose.

324
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:41,314
Good evening.

325
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:41,854
Could you hear me?

326
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:43,556
We can hear you.

327
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:45,437
Could we have your name and address for the record, please?

328
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:50,021
Mike Morello, Clare Channel Outdoor, 89 Maple Street, Stone O'Mass.

329
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:58,146
Great, so we'd like to hear a bit more about the petition, what you're requesting, and then we will discuss it.

330
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:20,341
Yeah, so as you may know, back in 2013, we installed a back-to-back digital billboard, 282 Mystic Ave, and at such time, the digital screens have outlived their useful life, and they're antiquated, so we're simply asking to amend the existing special permit just to simply replace the existing digital screens.

331
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:23,975
All right.

332
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:27,338
It also says that there's a request to reduce the fee.

333
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,080
Do you have any comment on that?

334
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:30,341
Yes.

335
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:36,366
So a couple of years ago, I believe at 262, Mr. Gaff, we replaced the digital screens on that unit.

336
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:39,048
And I believe the permit fee was approximately $5,400.

337
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:47,196
And I'm not sure if anything's changed with the current bylaws when it comes to the price on permitting.

338
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:50,522
this permit is a little over $24,000.

339
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:54,504
So I'm not sure what the huge difference was there.

340
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:56,344
So I have a question on that.

341
00:51:57,985 --> 00:51:58,225
Sure.

342
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:03,027
Um, I can't say that we have been a lot of the city's fees have not been updated in a very long time.

343
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:07,569
It's very likely that the building department may have updated them to reflect the times.

344
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:09,269
But I'm going to Councilor Scarpelli.

345
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:16,112
If I could, Mr President, I think that, uh, the first issue with changing of the signs, I understand it gets

346
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:27,279
The systems are antiquated we need to move forward as long as there aren't any huge changes that would disrupt our residents, I don't think it's a problem but again.

347
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,283
both with this and with the adjusting the fee.

348
00:52:32,763 --> 00:52:41,629
I think if we could probably table this to the next meeting and get some updates, and then I don't see that the changeover will be a big issue.

349
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:49,834
And if we can look into seeing what the qualifications or the protocol for the fee structure, and then maybe you can go from there.

350
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:53,997
But right now, I don't think we're equipped to vote on that this evening, Mr. President.

351
00:52:55,021 --> 00:53:03,508
I appreciate the petitioner being here, petitioner speaking on behalf, but if we could table this to the next meeting, that'd be super important, Mr. President.

352
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:15,058
And Councillor Stroud, just to clarify the motion, if the petitioner wanted to move forward tonight without changing the fee, would you be comfortable with that or do you think

353
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,351
I would feel comfortable.

354
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:21,836
I just like I said, I don't see the any of the particulars in front of me.

355
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:22,236
Right.

356
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:24,979
All I'm hearing is a petitioner saying that just changing it.

357
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:25,339
Okay.

358
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,725
And I, we, unfortunately, I don't have anything in front that might cause some problems legally for us.

359
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:33,907
All right, so there's a motion to table.

360
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:52,901
to the next regular meeting, actually motion to continue the public hearing to the next regular meeting and request an update on the application and the fee from the building department and also to request legal to give us an opinion on whether or not we can reduce the fee.

361
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,424
When you have that, Mr. Clerk, let me know.

362
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:07,054
All right, so there's a motion to continue the public hearing to the April 29 meeting by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang.

363
00:54:07,634 --> 00:54:08,534
Any further discussion?

364
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:12,377
Seeing none.

365
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:13,678
On Zoom.

366
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:15,899
Oh, sorry, Councillor Callahan.

367
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:21,766
Yeah, I just want to make sure that we're not sending stuff to legal that we don't need to send to legal.

368
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:37,210
My understanding from the building commissioner is that on that we are the appropriate body to make appeals and final decisions when it has already gone through the building department on things like signs.

369
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:38,050
So.

370
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:47,315
I'm not positive it doesn't need to go to legal, but I think we should not just send everything to legal just to send things to legal.

371
00:54:49,637 --> 00:54:50,637
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

372
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:51,638
Councilor Scarpelli.

373
00:54:53,119 --> 00:55:04,226
Out of all due respect, this is the fourth time I've asked something that I feel important that might put our committee in question legally.

374
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:30,470
to go to legal and this councilor has refused a question to every single one and i find this to be a problem this is very easy if we had a city solicitor i'm the i'm the eldest uh i'm i've sat in a seat longer than anybody here i've been here when we've had an active city solicitor that i could call any time to answer any questions so we can move an issue forward unfortunately this is year four without a city solicitor

375
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:37,709
So if one member of this council, out of due respect, if it was my fellow council, the same question, I wouldn't stop that.

376
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:47,297
So this is an issue that if we move something forward and legally comes back on us, I'd rather not pay the consequences with a higher fee or a lawsuit.

377
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:48,899
Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,261
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

379
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:53,263
Any further comment by members of the council?

380
00:55:58,867 --> 00:56:07,029
Seeing none, there's a motion to continue to April 29th and request those answers from the building department and the legal department.

381
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:12,310
Any discussion by members of the public?

382
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:20,911
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

383
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:29,607
Yes.

384
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:31,569
Yes.

385
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,669
Yes.

386
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:31,809
Yes.

387
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:31,929
Yes.

388
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:34,592
Thank you.

389
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:39,796
I was approached by a few members of the charter review committee that have spent

390
00:56:50,613 --> 00:56:53,094
many, many years and a lot of effort.

391
00:56:53,834 --> 00:57:08,781
I will not say what they said because they're going to get really tired soon, but they asked if we could please hear Resolution 24468 submitted by the Mayor, draft City Charter, returned to City Council.

392
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:12,443
On the motion, Mr. President, Councillor Sang.

393
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:17,321
You should be good.

394
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:18,322
Oh, okay.

395
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:32,832
I'm happy to take that out of order but I do know a lot of people here for 25 dash 053 the gender affirming care reproductive health care ordinance 25 dash 055 the resolution to support the release of remains.

396
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:40,590
And 25-057, the resolution to create and distribute Know Your Rights information.

397
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:53,214
As those items came first in the agenda and are shorter, what I presume are shorter items to discuss, would you entertain taking those first before the City Charter conversation?

398
00:57:56,118 --> 00:57:56,898
Councilor Scarpello.

399
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:59,779
No, I owe the respect to my fellow councilor.

400
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:06,121
We've started resolutions that thought would be quick and lasted 45 to one hour.

401
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:16,165
As I said, residents that are on the charter committee that said that, unfortunately, they can't stay later.

402
00:58:16,685 --> 00:58:20,706
These are people that have worked in this community on this project for many, many years.

403
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:25,628
I would hope we give them the respect to move them to the front so we could hear them, so they could

404
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:34,508
be off and whatever the resolution ends up to be, that they can be heard and then move on to their evening.

405
00:58:34,948 --> 00:58:37,270
And from what I hear, most of them to sleep.

406
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:37,911
So thank you.

407
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:43,475
I think you can make the same arguments the other way, given that this ordinance has also been- So don't vote for it.

408
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:44,216
That's my motion.

409
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:44,896
Don't vote for it.

410
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:50,381
There's a motion on the floor by Councillor Scarapelli to suspend the rules to take paper 24468.

411
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:53,163
Does that motion have a second?

412
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,832
Is there another motion on the floor?

413
00:59:08,472 --> 00:59:10,693
I would motion to take 25-053, 25-055, 25-057, and then 24-468.

414
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:13,976
On the motion of councilor saying to take papers 25053, 25055, 25057, and 24468.

415
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,377
Is there a second?

416
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:17,538
On the second by Vice President Collins.

417
00:59:17,678 --> 00:59:18,839
Is there any further discussion?

418
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:40,369
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

419
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:06,837
Councilor Callahan.

420
01:00:07,657 --> 01:00:07,817
Yes.

421
01:00:09,515 --> 01:00:10,296
Vice President Collins?

422
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:10,376
Yes.

423
01:00:11,497 --> 01:00:12,377
Councilor Lazaro?

424
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:13,078
Yes.

425
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:14,699
Councilor Lemming?

426
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,760
Yes.

427
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,501
Councilor Scarpelli?

428
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:16,901
Yes.

429
01:00:18,062 --> 01:00:18,582
Councilor Sang?

430
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:18,963
Yes.

431
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:19,863
President Pears?

432
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:20,364
Yes.

433
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:21,645
I have the affirmative, none the negative.

434
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:22,486
The motion passes.

435
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:28,010
25053 offered by Councilor Sang, gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.

436
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:35,096
I could read the full ordinance, but is there a motion to waive the reading in lieu of a summary by the petitioner?

437
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:35,636
So moved.

438
01:00:36,077 --> 01:00:38,258
On the motion by Councilor Sang, seconded by?

439
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:58,117
Seconded by Councillor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

440
01:00:58,597 --> 01:00:58,918
Yes.

441
01:01:00,018 --> 01:01:00,839
Vice President Collins.

442
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:04,633
That's a lemon.

443
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:07,656
Yeah, that's just compelling.

444
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:08,697
Yes.

445
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:23,649
Yes, I'm the affirmative, negative, the motion passes, counselor say, Thank you, Mr President, um, as we, as, as we know from watching the news and from paying attention to, you know, our neighbors concerns over the last few years.

446
01:01:24,896 --> 01:01:41,976
The access to gender affirming care and reproductive health care has become an incredibly contentious issue in our country, despite these being basic forms of medical care and basic rights that individuals have, or should have in this country, and has have historically had in this country until recently.

447
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:53,138
A lot of our residents are fairly asking us how we can best protect our own neighbors best protect our own residents and provide the security that they need and need for.

448
01:01:56,265 --> 01:01:58,447
for enjoying their lives here in Medford.

449
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:18,927
This ordinance would protect medical providers and people who seek that care from out-of-state arrest warrants and prosecutions, from out-of-state attempts to apply laws that aren't Massachusetts laws, laws that aren't Massachusetts values to Medford.

450
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:30,210
We've heard early on in the process years ago that if we didn't pass something like this, it was very likely, if not mandatory, that we would have to carry out those warrants.

451
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:49,116
Now the situation at the state level has changed, but it is important for us to reaffirm this and to acknowledge that just because state law says something doesn't mean that we can't back that up as well, and that we need that additional layer of protection for our residents.

452
01:02:49,856 --> 01:03:09,264
During the process, Councilor Lazar and I worked hard to invite stakeholders, including medical providers in the community, including residents with experience, including city staff across the health police departments and the administration to work on this.

453
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:14,774
We know that Medford faces limited resources.

454
01:03:14,954 --> 01:03:16,595
We've talked about that over and over again.

455
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:28,664
We want to make sure that those resources aren't expended to the end of denying any individual's right to their bodily autonomy or to criminalize any person's effort to live as their full and authentic self.

456
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:43,380
This ordinance, if you walk through it, essentially protects the information, the health information of people who come to Medford to use our care.

457
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,822
It protects health information from medical providers as well.

458
01:03:47,568 --> 01:04:01,773
It affirms our city's policy and enshrines into law that we won't treat any individual differently based on their gender identity or gender expression.

459
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:10,039
It follows state laws language with regards to definitions with regards to how we're going to do what I just described.

460
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:19,988
It also empowers our city to to provide fair access to reproductive health and gender affirming healthcare information.

461
01:04:20,531 --> 01:04:29,761
Because we know that there are predatory sources out there that are putting limited or fake information out into the community.

462
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:36,568
This empowers our administration to post proper guidelines, to post

463
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:41,049
a full comprehensive picture as to that information on the website.

464
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:42,789
I know there are residents who want to speak.

465
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:45,990
I know there are councilors who've worked hard on this.

466
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:56,592
I do also want to thank councilors Collins, Behrs, and former councilor Morrell for introducing parts of this ordinance as well, or a resolution language to support this ordinance.

467
01:04:56,972 --> 01:04:57,292
Thank you.

468
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,132
Thank you, councilor Sagan.

469
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:01,253
Is there a further discussion by members of the council?

470
01:05:01,993 --> 01:05:02,833
Council Vice President Tom.

471
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,476
Thank you, President bears.

472
01:05:07,498 --> 01:05:17,553
I just want to share my gratitude for this counselors for the sponsors for shepherding through this draft which strongly and boldly defines protections for seekers of gender affirming and reproductive health care in Medford.

473
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:27,146
This draft has gone through a careful legal review, and its sponsors, Councilors Sang and Lozaro, made sure it was in alignment with other communities and with state law.

474
01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:38,074
And I want to highlight that this is protective of the whole city because it guarantees that if the federal government decides to pick a fight over cities allowing unfettered access to health care, then we won't be fighting that battle alone.

475
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:41,256
We'll be going in as part of a regional and statewide cavalry.

476
01:05:42,513 --> 01:05:57,179
We are in a moment where the federal government is attacking women's access to health care and trans and non-binary people's access to health care in a deliberate attempt to punish political enemies and create a distraction from this administration's catastrophic economic agenda.

477
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,801
They're making a goal of actively making Americans' lives worse.

478
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:05,543
And I'm very grateful for this leadership to do what we can on the city level to say that won't happen here.

479
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:12,754
So I want to extend my gratitude to the sponsors and also to the residents who held this council to account for making this ordinance happen.

480
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:14,976
Thank you.

481
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:15,596
Councilor Lazaro.

482
01:06:17,717 --> 01:06:18,138
Thank you.

483
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:33,088
I just wanted to also extend my gratitude to Councilor Sang, Councilor Morrell, President Behrs, and the city's legal team, KP Law, for helping us

484
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:38,711
review the ordinance and align it with state law.

485
01:06:39,531 --> 01:06:43,554
And this draft, I think, is the strongest we can make it.

486
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:48,336
So I think we're really in a position to protect our residents to the best of our ability.

487
01:06:49,117 --> 01:06:52,559
And I'm proud of how far we've taken it.

488
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:53,580
So thank you.

489
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:56,501
Thank you.

490
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:58,502
Any further discussions by members of the council?

491
01:07:00,944 --> 01:07:02,925
Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

492
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:05,964
either in person or on Zoom.

493
01:07:05,984 --> 01:07:13,167
I'm gonna go to Mike Denton on Zoom.

494
01:07:13,227 --> 01:07:14,948
Mike, you have three minutes.

495
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:23,891
And I just wanna remind everyone, you can provide your name and address when you speak, or you can provide that information.

496
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:27,553
You don't have to provide your name, but you can provide your address privately to the clerk if you'd like to do that.

497
01:07:28,782 --> 01:07:32,865
by email at ahertabaseatmedfordma.org.

498
01:07:33,065 --> 01:07:36,107
Mike, give me one second to get the timer going.

499
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:45,795
All right, Mike, go ahead.

500
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:49,457
All right, thank you.

501
01:07:50,968 --> 01:07:58,210
Thank you to Councillor Collins for saying everything that I was coming here to say.

502
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:13,994
So I'd just like to reiterate that as a business owner who serves a wide swath of the community that would be directly impacted by this ordinance, thank you, thank you, thank you.

503
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:14,074
And

504
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:36,079
I think the only other thing that I wanted to say is that this is the kind of ordinance that will go a long way to making sure that people who live in Medford know that Medford cares about them and that there's a degree of safety that they're going to work towards for on their behalf.

505
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:39,699
So thank you for this.

506
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,580
Medford sees you and appreciates you and that, well,

507
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:47,931
the slice of Medford that I'm exposed to sees you and appreciate it too.

508
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:49,672
So that's all.

509
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:52,674
Thank you, Mike.

510
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,357
We'll go to the podium.

511
01:08:57,037 --> 01:08:57,737
Name and address.

512
01:08:58,018 --> 01:08:59,238
For the record, you have three minutes.

513
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,680
Good evening.

514
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,381
Nick Troleo, 40 Robinson Road.

515
01:09:04,042 --> 01:09:12,027
I was originally going to comment on the substance of this motion and just express some opinions about why I think it's overbroad and doesn't really do anything.

516
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:22,255
I'm very frustrated with what procedurally happened leading up to this taking of this motion or this resolution, sorry, discussion of the ordinance out of order.

517
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:34,502
I think it's really, really shameful that this Council would not second Councillor Scarpelli's motion to take the city charter resolution out of order and discuss that first.

518
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,103
We're prioritizing here

519
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:49,377
an ordinance on gender identity over our city charter, our constitutional foundational government, the changes in the city charter are going to significantly impact how elected officials are elected in Medford.

520
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:56,660
So the fact that we would just not even second the motion and not even be courageous enough to vote no on it really is shameful.

521
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,321
So I think everyone in this council who did that should be ashamed of themselves.

522
01:10:00,581 --> 01:10:00,921
Thank you.

523
01:10:03,402 --> 01:10:03,722
Thank you.

524
01:10:05,813 --> 01:10:07,435
Any further discussion on the ordinance?

525
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:14,742
Seeing none.

526
01:10:21,448 --> 01:10:22,269
Is there a motion on the floor?

527
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,911
Motion to approve.

528
01:10:24,931 --> 01:10:27,614
Motion to approve for first reading by Councilor Sang, seconded by?

529
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:29,836
Seconded by Vice President Collins.

530
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:30,957
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

531
01:10:36,418 --> 01:10:37,078
Council Callahan.

532
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:37,819
Yes.

533
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,781
Vice President Collins.

534
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:43,122
That's a little Zorro.

535
01:10:43,682 --> 01:10:43,982
Yes.

536
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,884
That's a lemon.

537
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:47,745
I'll just go Kelly.

538
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:51,567
I was just saying, President bears.

539
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:54,188
Yes, 77 affirmative.

540
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:54,449
Yes.

541
01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:58,191
None of the negative motion passes for first reading.

542
01:11:01,535 --> 01:11:23,703
25055 resolution to support the release of Ramesa Ozturk council is our own president bears whereas Ramesa Ozturk was an international student with a legal student visa at Tufts University in Medford and whereas Ramesa Ozturk student visa was canceled because she co-wrote an op-ed in 2024 and the Tufts University student newspaper that was critical of the Tufts administration's refusal to acknowledge and stand against the ongoing genocide in Gaza and

543
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:35,477
whereas the Constitution protects everyone in the United States regardless of immigration status, and whereas the First Amendment of the Constitution protects the rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government, and where it's clear that Ms.

544
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:40,162
Öztürk's visa was canceled because of political speech, which is a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution.

545
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:50,482
and where it is the obligation of our local, state, and federal government to uphold and protect the rights of our residents, permanent and temporary, all of whom are protected by the United States Constitution.

546
01:11:50,502 --> 01:11:58,952
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council condemns the abduction of Hermesa Ozturk by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as unlawful punishment for political speech,

547
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:12,670
and acknowledges and condemns that Ramesa Osterk is a political prisoner, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council calls for the release of Ramesa Osterk immediately, so that she may resume her studies of child development at Tufts University and her peaceful residence in Somerville.

548
01:12:13,315 --> 01:12:26,980
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests an update from Tufts University on the specific policies to protect their students, faculty, and staff from similar abductions by ICE in the future, and to protect their community's right to exercise freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government.

549
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:40,205
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that our partners in local government and our state and federal delegations speak out publicly against the unlawful arrest of a student in our community in violation of her due process rights and in violation of the United States Constitution.

550
01:12:40,585 --> 01:12:41,185
Council Dizaro.

551
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:43,350
Thank you.

552
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:50,073
I found myself very upset when I saw the video of Ms.

553
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:55,816
Ozturk being taken by ICE officers from her home in Somerville.

554
01:12:56,796 --> 01:12:59,397
I'm very familiar with where she lives.

555
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:02,399
A close friend of mine lives on that street.

556
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:05,440
And I've been there many times.

557
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,360
It's a safe neighborhood.

558
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:09,662
It makes me feel, it made me feel very afraid.

559
01:13:10,431 --> 01:13:34,669
And as a local elected official, I felt that there wasn't much that I could do except for craft a resolution stating publicly the things that I felt were most egregious about what happened, which were that the Constitution was violated and the rule of law was ignored by our federal government.

560
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:59,160
I wanted to point that out, I wanted to do it here, and I wanted to make sure that we had a forum where our residents can understand that their city government feels strongly that that's not okay, it's not what we believe in, and we do not think that this is something that we can let continue to happen.

561
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,440
in any capacity.

562
01:14:04,322 --> 01:14:12,285
This is what we have access to as city councillors, this is what we're able, this is our forum to be able to say something, so I thought it was appropriate to say something here.

563
01:14:13,805 --> 01:14:23,449
I did reach out to Tufts University, our contact at Tufts as city councillors is Rocco DiRico, he is the Government Affairs

564
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:31,372
connector, person, he is a great person to speak with in times like this.

565
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:33,914
And he did give me a couple of statements.

566
01:14:34,014 --> 01:14:53,523
He sent me an email, I'd like to read just about what they, I mean, we spoke on the phone, he sent me a statement, and then he also updated me with the Tufts president's statement that also, it was posted online, so some people may have seen it, but I would also like to read that here because I feel that it does respond

567
01:14:54,183 --> 01:14:57,386
It is kind of the response that I call for in the resolution.

568
01:14:58,807 --> 01:15:07,456
So I feel that even beyond what I'm going to read, I think that Tufts has been really active in responding to this.

569
01:15:08,056 --> 01:15:13,061
They've done things that you can't really talk about publicly because they've really tried to

570
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:18,324
do everything in their power to have Remesa released.

571
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:34,450
And the administration at the federal level really doesn't always listen, even though people in power are really doing what they can to try to access humanity.

572
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,391
anybody's humanity.

573
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:53,744
So Rocco's response to me was the university recognizes how frightening the situation is for her, her family and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events.

574
01:15:54,525 --> 01:16:01,547
We are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa has provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights.

575
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:10,931
The university is actively working to support the Tufts community as it mobilizes its collective resources and contacts to ensure our students' safety and well-being.

576
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:14,732
The university has sent emails to all our students, faculty, and staff

577
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:21,534
to outline our protocol for engaging with government officials, recommendations for documentation, and support resources.

578
01:16:22,155 --> 01:16:27,076
We encourage our students, faculty, and staff to contact the International Center for additional support and resources."

579
01:16:28,077 --> 01:16:31,798
And then he added in a later email, we're also working with Rameses' attorneys.

580
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:38,501
And there was also, I will also read,

581
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:45,139
The Declaration of Tufts University from President Sunil Kumar.

582
01:16:47,422 --> 01:16:56,584
Tufts University, an entity legally known as the Trustees of Tufts College and henceforth referred to as Tufts University, the university or Tufts declares as follows.

583
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:09,688
One, on Tuesday, March 25, 2025, the university learned that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral student from Turkey, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts.

584
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:18,794
The university understands that she was leaving her home that evening for an iftar dinner hosted at the Tufts Interfaith Center, where she would break her Ramadan fast for the day.

585
01:17:19,554 --> 01:17:32,042
Two, at around 6.30pm that evening, the Tufts University Police Department received courtesy notification from the Somerville Police Department that an individual had been detained by federal authorities and that the person in custody might be a Tufts student.

586
01:17:32,563 --> 01:17:35,625
We confirmed through our records that the person in question was Ramesa Ozturk.

587
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:38,546
Three, at 7.32 p.m., Ms.

588
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:46,689
Ozturk's record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, was updated to note that her visa was terminated.

589
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:49,410
Prior to that, and at the time of her detention, Ms.

590
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:54,792
Ozturk was in, quote, good immigration standing, according to her record in SEVIS, and both Ms.

591
01:17:54,872 --> 01:18:00,534
Ozturk and Tufts had followed the governing regulations for students on visas.

592
01:18:01,535 --> 01:18:04,035
The university then received a notice dated March 25, 2025,

593
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:29,101
and received via email on March 26, 2025, at 10.31 a.m., stating that Rameza's visa was canceled because she was a non-immigrant status violator, citing 237A1CI of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and or that the United States believes that her presence in the country would result in, quote, potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.

594
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:32,643
With her consent, the university can confirm that Ms.

595
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,124
Ozturk is a third-year doctoral student in good academic and administrative standing.

596
01:18:36,724 --> 01:18:45,888
Her research focuses on how young adults can use social media in positive, pro-social ways, and she is described by her faculty as a hard-working student dedicated to her studies,

597
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:47,789
and the Tufts community.

598
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:53,854
The university has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.

599
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,937
The university has seen an outpouring of support from Ms.

600
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:59,979
Ozturk over the last week from Tufts students, faculty, and staff.

601
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,021
These individuals have described Ms.

602
01:19:02,081 --> 01:19:06,665
Ozturk as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits, and committed to her colleagues.

603
01:19:08,346 --> 01:19:10,007
Five, the university can confirm that Ms.

604
01:19:10,047 --> 01:19:23,232
Ozturk was one of several authors of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, the Tufts Daily, published on March 26, 2024, entitled, Try Again, President Kumar, Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate Resolutions.

605
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:28,274
The university declares that this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies.

606
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:34,377
Further, no complaints were filed with the university or to our knowledge outside of the university about this op-ed.

607
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:42,542
The university maintains that the op-ed was consistent with speech permitted by the Declaration on Freedom of Expression adopted by our trustees on November 7, 2009.

608
01:19:44,504 --> 01:19:51,149
For the record, a search on the Tufts Daily will reveal op-eds on multiple sides of the issue with opinions that were shared just as strongly as the op-ed Ms.

609
01:19:51,209 --> 01:19:52,129
Oster co-authored.

610
01:19:52,630 --> 01:20:00,996
The university has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the university's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.

611
01:20:02,116 --> 01:20:09,339
Six, our international students, faculty, and staff are vital to deliver on the education, teaching, research, and public service mission of Tufts University.

612
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:22,405
University sponsors 1,818 continuing international students on F-1 visas alongside 569 alumni who are pursuing post-completion work authorization in the United States.

613
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,706
24 degree and non-degree students on J-1 visas.

614
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:30,229
This is in addition to the broader community of students, faculty, and staff that hold various immigrant and non-immigrant statuses.

615
01:20:31,474 --> 01:20:37,223
Seven, the free movement of our international community members is therefore essential to the functioning of the university and serving our mission.

616
01:20:37,783 --> 01:20:45,354
The university has heard from students, faculty and staff who are foregoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel.

617
01:20:46,576 --> 01:20:51,523
In the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus.

618
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:51,523
8.

619
01:20:52,745 --> 01:21:00,356
The university declares that many of these students will go on to make significant economic and intellectual contributions to the United States and in countries around the world.

620
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:01,317
They will do so,

621
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:10,042
by working in or building new companies through teaching and research and universities and other academic and healthcare institutions and through public service in the United States and across the globe.

622
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:18,587
The university is confident in its exploration because thousands of Tufts University alumni have received their education while on F-1 visas and have gone on to make a positive impact.

623
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:23,071
to the economic prosperity and intellectual success of the United States and in other countries.

624
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:23,071
9.

625
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:27,916
The undersigned submits this declaration on behalf of Tufts University in support of Ms.

626
01:21:27,956 --> 01:21:31,700
Azterk and asks that she receive the due process rights to which she is entitled.

627
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,563
Based on everything we know and have shared here, the university seeks relief so that Ms.

628
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:41,069
Azterk is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree at Tufts University.

629
01:21:43,075 --> 01:21:43,875
And then it is signed.

630
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:53,658
On behalf of the university, I understand declares under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on April 1 2025 at Tufts University Sunil Kumar president.

631
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:58,260
I, I'm sorry that was so long.

632
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,502
I just felt that it was important to articulate everything that was shared with me from Tufts.

633
01:22:06,302 --> 01:22:12,747
The important thing I think is that Tufts did give like a very, very thorough response.

634
01:22:13,747 --> 01:22:26,276
And I just feel very strongly that we declare that the Constitution was not followed.

635
01:22:27,797 --> 01:22:33,140
We still, Ramesa is still in Louisiana, and it's not right.

636
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:34,882
And that's all.

637
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:35,342
Thank you.

638
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,982
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

639
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:43,066
Thank you, President Behrs.

640
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:47,971
I want to thank yourself and Councilor Lozano for putting this together for this meeting's agenda.

641
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:53,436
I just think this is a moment in which it's really, really important for city leaders and leaders at all levels to be vocal.

642
01:22:54,557 --> 01:22:59,162
We're in a really scary era where the federal government is using all sorts of strategies

643
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:06,425
to try and actively make people more scared, more vulnerable, more unsafe.

644
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:18,210
The goal of detentions like Ramesa's is to intimidate activists into hiding, to intimidate organizers into silence, to make non-citizens feel endangered, to make everyone afraid to speak up.

645
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:27,175
And I would hate to see the city of Medford perpetuate that because it's not going to help us withstand this very insidious culture.

646
01:23:27,955 --> 01:23:31,137
So I'm very grateful to your leadership and putting this language forward.

647
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:31,998
Thank you.

648
01:23:32,898 --> 01:23:33,919
Thank you, Vice President Cohns.

649
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:34,619
Councilor Lemming.

650
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:39,982
I'd like to thank you as well for putting this forward.

651
01:23:42,353 --> 01:24:02,981
Scary and disgraceful that we're having federal authorities pick up students from the street, plainclothes officers, deporting them out of state so that they don't have access to legal representation.

652
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:08,963
And in many other cases, even just putting them out of the country and ignoring court orders.

653
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:12,338
just because they can.

654
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:18,880
Elections have consequences, and this is what we're seeing because of the election.

655
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:27,122
I mean, in other parts of the country, it's not... Ramesa Ozturk was a case that received a lot of publicity.

656
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,304
I worked for five years as a postdoc at Mass General.

657
01:24:32,324 --> 01:24:34,965
I attempted

658
01:24:36,047 --> 01:24:45,749
Keyword attempted, didn't succeed to unionize over there, but ended up creating some groups that had a lot of postdocs on them.

659
01:24:45,769 --> 01:24:47,870
And a lot of them are international.

660
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:49,490
And so they're coming up with a report.

661
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:59,913
And so they're sharing reports of people they know, their friends just being randomly abducted, detained in places like Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett.

662
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,290
Maldon.

663
01:25:02,071 --> 01:25:27,610
Last night, the Democratic City Committee met and decided to put some of the committee's own funding into purchasing 8,000 red cards, which are cards that you can give out to immigrants who may be at risk of being detained in order for them to understand their legal rights and understand how they

664
01:25:30,553 --> 01:25:36,600
can interact when federal authorities try to illegally detain them.

665
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:43,048
In many cases, there have also been reports of just US citizens being detained because they're brown.

666
01:25:43,068 --> 01:25:46,532
And then ICE will only figure that out later.

667
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:53,776
when they go through their wallet and figure out that they were just randomly abducted.

668
01:25:53,796 --> 01:26:11,191
And what's going on here is that ICE is basically just taking in anybody that they can, trying to figure out if there was ever any lapse in Visa or anything that they might have done technically wrong on a piece of paper, and then using that as an excuse to deport them all while ignoring court orders

669
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:26,582
to the contrary, and then publicizing the few cases where they actually do manage to deport a violent criminal, and then using those few cases as justification for this policy.

670
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:43,416
So, it is important, I agree for city leaders to speak up vocally because intimidation is a big part of this intimidation is the name of the game here that is a huge reason why this is happening.

671
01:26:46,501 --> 01:27:02,414
Independence at different levels of government can help to stop this, but understand that being vocal and vocally saying this isn't right is the best tool that we have to stop an authoritarian regime.

672
01:27:03,455 --> 01:27:09,159
So again, I would just like to thank my colleague for putting this forward.

673
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:18,033
and I look forward to voting in favor of it and hearing whatever public comment we have.

674
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:20,494
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

675
01:27:20,654 --> 01:27:21,415
Councilor Tsang.

676
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:22,255
Thank you.

677
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:26,117
I'll be brief because I think councilors have been very thorough with their comments.

678
01:27:27,278 --> 01:27:31,180
Thank you, President Behrs and Councilor Lozaro for introducing this resolution.

679
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:35,802
I know a lot of residents have been clamoring for us to say something about it.

680
01:27:37,097 --> 01:27:49,325
and the timing of the regular meetings didn't allow us to make a statement earlier, but this is, it's helpful that we're doing it at the earliest possible opportunity for us.

681
01:27:50,332 --> 01:28:07,401
All I'll say is that this is a fearful time, and the freedom that we have to free speech and to our due process rights, which means not being deprived of our life, liberty, or property without a due process.

682
01:28:09,162 --> 01:28:12,084
These rights are sacred to who we are as Americans.

683
01:28:12,724 --> 01:28:19,308
They're sacred to democracy, and they form the bedrock of a strong society.

684
01:28:20,115 --> 01:28:28,262
And I think this really exemplifies what I've been saying for a very long time, which is that oftentimes the national can be local.

685
01:28:28,843 --> 01:28:43,535
And as the federal government seeks to interfere in people's everyday lives, seeks to interfere and retaliate against individuals for publishing their thoughts in an op-ed, be it something you agree with or disagree with,

686
01:28:44,890 --> 01:29:05,083
As the federal government tries to commandeer state and local governments into following its policies when federalism exists, and when we have powers delegated to us, to the voters, to hold local and state officials accountable for, this all matters to the rule of law.

687
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:08,745
It all matters to who we are as Americans and our identity as well.

688
01:29:11,757 --> 01:29:21,020
I think passing a resolution like this tonight, you know, I wish we could do more, but this solidifies our intent as a city council to stand by our residents.

689
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:21,940
Thank you.

690
01:29:23,481 --> 01:29:24,401
Thank you, Councilor Sagan.

691
01:29:25,642 --> 01:29:27,402
Any further discussion by members of the council?

692
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:32,584
Seeing none, we'll go to members of the public.

693
01:29:32,904 --> 01:29:39,206
I have two hands on Zoom or one hand just went down and we have someone in the chambers.

694
01:29:41,283 --> 01:29:45,105
We'll go to the podium first.

695
01:29:46,346 --> 01:29:47,287
Name and address for the record.

696
01:29:47,307 --> 01:29:48,067
You have three minutes.

697
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:51,690
Hello again, Nick Traleo, Forty Robinson Road.

698
01:29:53,051 --> 01:30:02,036
Um I'd like to first just reiterate what I said in the earlier discussion about, you know, taking this resolution over resolution of the city charter.

699
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:04,178
Again, concerning to me.

700
01:30:05,107 --> 01:30:12,997
But in terms of what happened to miss us Turk, I just like to offer a legal perspective given the lawyer and this is what I do for a living is think about legal problems.

701
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:20,787
I think the issue is very narrow, to be honest with you, you know, because I think the legal questions really does a visa recipient.

702
01:30:21,287 --> 01:30:24,949
have that same right to freedom of speech as a citizen of the United States.

703
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:32,052
And I'm not here to answer that question I mean it would require a great deal of research to try to understand what the law says on that subject.

704
01:30:32,732 --> 01:30:38,215
Ultimately, I think it's a question that judges have to decide and that's what's happening right it's being litigated in the federal court.

705
01:30:40,354 --> 01:30:44,337
So I think when we use inflammatory language, really on either side, right?

706
01:30:45,177 --> 01:30:53,824
Screaming about deportation or screaming about political imprisonment, it really doesn't help address this problem, which is to try to resolve a legal question.

707
01:30:55,005 --> 01:31:02,730
Another thing I'd like to just point out is I think this is a little bit beyond the scope of what the city council is tasked with doing, right?

708
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,652
We're talking about federal immigration law here.

709
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,334
I think every one of you would admit you don't have any jurisdiction.

710
01:31:07,714 --> 01:31:08,295
to handle that.

711
01:31:08,956 --> 01:31:14,802
Um so, you know, ultimately, if you're not happy with what happened with miss Oster, you do have a right to be upset about that.

712
01:31:14,822 --> 01:31:18,245
You do have a right to petition your elected representatives in Congress.

713
01:31:18,966 --> 01:31:24,372
Um but you know, let's try to respect what authority this city council has to actually do things.

714
01:31:24,952 --> 01:31:25,233
Thank you.

715
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:35,563
Just a quick correction.

716
01:31:36,164 --> 01:31:43,729
The Constitution protects freedom of speech for everybody in America, regardless of immigration status.

717
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:47,032
Thank you.

718
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:49,393
We'll go to Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom.

719
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:52,216
You'll have three minutes.

720
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,117
Name and address for the record, please.

721
01:31:54,695 --> 01:31:57,978
Yes, I'm Matthew Page-Liverman, 15 Canal Street.

722
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:02,923
First, I very much appreciate Councillor Zaroff for bringing this forward.

723
01:32:03,303 --> 01:32:12,312
I also appreciate Councillor Collins' editorial in Commonwealth Beacon, which I've not heard praised yet.

724
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:12,952
It's very important.

725
01:32:12,972 --> 01:32:14,053
I hope everybody should read this.

726
01:32:14,474 --> 01:32:15,935
There are four items I want to hit on.

727
01:32:15,955 --> 01:32:16,676
One is that

728
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:29,489
And I think we should really address this and absolutely kind of embarrassing misunderstanding about the role of the courts and interpretations at this moment in history.

729
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:35,914
It's extremely outdated and kind of really dense misunderstanding about the current situation.

730
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:43,540
You know, the first amendment about the right to freedom of speech is regarding what Congress may do.

731
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,461
that Congress may not bridge this.

732
01:32:45,501 --> 01:32:51,125
Now that has been gone to be interpreted that the government, the federal government and the state governments may not do that.

733
01:32:51,405 --> 01:33:05,455
What we're dealing with right now is we know that the executive branch is carrying out things that even people in the legislature, including Republicans are saying, he's taken away, he's ignoring the whole first article of the constitution.

734
01:33:05,995 --> 01:33:07,076
That's what we're dealing with.

735
01:33:07,096 --> 01:33:07,756
And we're dealing with

736
01:33:09,438 --> 01:33:09,818
courts.

737
01:33:10,559 --> 01:33:12,581
We're saying, well, the courts will reside.

738
01:33:12,601 --> 01:33:19,187
Well, first off, the executive branch is saying we will ignore the courts and they're trying to discredit the courts.

739
01:33:19,807 --> 01:33:28,375
And we have a Supreme Court that just the other day or today said that they will temporarily permit Trump to do the Alien Enemies Act.

740
01:33:29,107 --> 01:33:33,009
That's the situation we're dealing with in this kind of, well, we'll let the courts decide.

741
01:33:33,049 --> 01:33:36,331
The courts are quite possibly not going to decide.

742
01:33:36,471 --> 01:33:39,652
And if they do, they can very quite possibly be ignored.

743
01:33:39,672 --> 01:33:42,814
Okay, so it's not a question of what will the courts decide?

744
01:33:42,854 --> 01:33:44,274
Let me tell you about the law.

745
01:33:44,855 --> 01:33:51,498
Okay, a second component I really want to bring up is that Honan, or you know, the whatever czar,

746
01:33:52,179 --> 01:33:57,123
you know, he actually changed his mind as much as he threatens Boston.

747
01:33:58,104 --> 01:34:06,071
He changed his mind just the other day in that, you know, ICE went to, they said there are people doing child sex trafficking, etc.

748
01:34:06,492 --> 01:34:14,899
And they have to go get some, well, they also round up three people, there are three children, and they transfer them to Texas, they're undocumented, but they figure we'll round them up as well.

749
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,802
Well, people protested outside Honan's home.

750
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:20,344
And then he changed his mind.

751
01:34:20,464 --> 01:34:25,406
And those people are being those three children being flown back from Texas to I forget the state.

752
01:34:25,586 --> 01:34:26,686
But that's what happens.

753
01:34:26,826 --> 01:34:27,447
That's what happens.

754
01:34:27,807 --> 01:34:28,587
30 seconds.

755
01:34:30,128 --> 01:34:31,488
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

756
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:32,609
At a moment like this.

757
01:34:33,609 --> 01:34:35,910
At a moment like this, there was only one answer.

758
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:38,231
And that's when the people rise up.

759
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:43,633
And don't just say this is not acceptable, but make it a living hell for the new authoritarians.

760
01:34:44,013 --> 01:34:48,055
And then the third thing is about the canary mission, that there are people that

761
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:55,767
like a Stasi government, they destroyed, they decided to retaliate against somebody for an article.

762
01:34:56,367 --> 01:34:57,968
And they are doing that.

763
01:34:58,148 --> 01:35:00,950
They are tattling on people in the community, trying to get them deported.

764
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:04,592
And those are the people that we should be saying are not welcome in our communities.

765
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:13,258
Those people that are ratting up people in the federal government, trying to get them expelled, the people in the Canary Mission, and those people- MJ, your time's up.

766
01:35:14,178 --> 01:35:16,540
Well, those are the people we should also name.

767
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:18,641
Thank you.

768
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:25,772
Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

769
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:26,272
You have three minutes.

770
01:35:27,653 --> 01:35:27,833
Sure.

771
01:35:27,913 --> 01:35:33,337
My name is Micah Shalom Hesselman, and I live at 499 Main Street in Medford.

772
01:35:34,918 --> 01:35:41,703
Thank you, councillors, and councillors of our own in particular, because I've had a lot of back and forth, too, for bringing forth this resolution.

773
01:35:42,424 --> 01:35:46,387
And to the people who are, whatever, I have a little bit of time.

774
01:35:46,827 --> 01:35:49,029
But this is an important resolution.

775
01:35:49,969 --> 01:35:50,710
We are a community.

776
01:35:52,202 --> 01:35:57,223
Rumeysa, she did not live in Medford.

777
01:35:57,743 --> 01:35:59,443
However, that's at our doorstep.

778
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:03,964
We've been railing against this since Mahmoud Khalil was illegally abducted.

779
01:36:04,664 --> 01:36:06,745
And we have people that are literally being blocked out.

780
01:36:07,945 --> 01:36:19,587
To the previous speaker's point, most of this is due to basically lists given to these people by Canary Mission and Beitar and these doxing groups.

781
01:36:20,707 --> 01:36:23,489
Now, I am also a lawyer, by the way.

782
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:27,853
So I also have some legal opinions on what is going on here.

783
01:36:28,413 --> 01:36:29,214
This is unlawful.

784
01:36:29,474 --> 01:36:31,015
If you could just address the chair.

785
01:36:31,055 --> 01:36:31,455
Thank you.

786
01:36:32,896 --> 01:36:35,078
This is clearly unlawful behavior.

787
01:36:36,339 --> 01:36:46,427
Before even getting to the freedom of speech and the basic freedoms, you cannot arrest people without having cause, without giving them cause and showing them.

788
01:36:47,076 --> 01:36:53,943
You cannot have masked individuals show up and black bag someone and then post hoc justify it.

789
01:36:54,384 --> 01:36:57,207
That is not how a lawful society can be run.

790
01:36:57,787 --> 01:36:59,730
That's how you get people shooting each other.

791
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:03,213
So yeah, it's a big deal, actually.

792
01:37:03,834 --> 01:37:07,077
Arguably more important than the charter issue, which is also very important.

793
01:37:07,258 --> 01:37:08,459
But this is an important issue too.

794
01:37:10,603 --> 01:37:19,551
Further, this is important to me as a resident of Medford, because all of this is being done under this veneer of fighting back against anti-Semitism.

795
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:20,872
I am a Jew.

796
01:37:21,692 --> 01:37:22,433
I am a Semite.

797
01:37:23,554 --> 01:37:38,587
This is using actually laws that were expressly anti-Semitic in form, purpose, and function to deport people for expressing opinions about a foreign government and their conduct

798
01:37:40,073 --> 01:37:42,373
against people in that region.

799
01:37:43,074 --> 01:37:44,874
It has nothing to do with anti-Semitism.

800
01:37:45,314 --> 01:37:46,834
This is crazy.

801
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:50,075
And we should be pushing back on this as a community.

802
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:57,877
Last thing I want to say is that I understand that no one's sure what they can do right now when it comes to these things.

803
01:37:59,197 --> 01:38:03,538
And to Councilor Sang's point, yes, this is a start.

804
01:38:03,838 --> 01:38:04,798
We are doing something.

805
01:38:04,898 --> 01:38:06,398
It's small, but at least it's something.

806
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:09,439
I urge the committee or the council

807
01:38:10,296 --> 01:38:27,379
to look at ways you can set up a committee or working group to proactively guard Medford, our community, against federal overreach and increasing lawlessness, which is only going to continue to get worse as things go forward.

808
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:30,640
There is no indication that they're going to be any better about this.

809
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,280
So I don't know.

810
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,261
Something needs to happen, something real.

811
01:38:35,801 --> 01:38:36,081
Thank you.

812
01:38:36,101 --> 01:38:36,721
I appreciate it.

813
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:37,041
Thank you.

814
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:37,461
Thank you.

815
01:38:40,965 --> 01:38:43,327
We'll go to Ken Garrow on Zoom.

816
01:38:43,588 --> 01:38:44,168
We alternate.

817
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:48,173
Ken, you have three minutes.

818
01:38:48,253 --> 01:38:48,593
All right.

819
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,053
Thank you.

820
01:38:49,774 --> 01:38:51,356
Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

821
01:38:53,212 --> 01:38:54,073
I am not a lawyer.

822
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:58,496
However, I do have several friends who are immigration lawyers over the past several years.

823
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:02,120
I have worked in biotech for my entire career.

824
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,821
I have many immigrant friends.

825
01:39:04,942 --> 01:39:12,448
My friends who are immigrant lawyers have shared some interesting stories about ICE at the best of times.

826
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:17,873
And what's happening right now is far, far, far from that.

827
01:39:19,534 --> 01:39:20,115
Normally, I

828
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:31,864
fall under the category of trying to keep more things local, I think to counter the Collins point earlier, of the fact that now is the time to speak up.

829
01:39:32,404 --> 01:39:40,788
I didn't get in for the trans care, which thank you, Emily, again, for doing that, because it's the same problem.

830
01:39:41,788 --> 01:39:48,771
They are trying to instill fear on those who they view as susceptible.

831
01:39:49,932 --> 01:39:50,792
That's not acceptable.

832
01:39:51,724 --> 01:39:55,026
The First Amendment applies to everyone.

833
01:39:56,467 --> 01:39:57,968
You are allowed to revoke a visa.

834
01:39:57,988 --> 01:40:11,477
If you want to say that that op-ed was out of bounds for whatever reason, you aren't allowed to revoke a visa and then with moments of it being revoked, take someone and deport them.

835
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:17,160
I have a friend not here in Massachusetts, down in Florida.

836
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:18,721
He is a veteran.

837
01:40:19,021 --> 01:40:20,142
He is a naturalized citizen.

838
01:40:22,018 --> 01:40:24,319
he was absolutely shaken up by this.

839
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:45,129
It is unconscionable to think there are people who just think that, typically because they're white, straight, safe, Christian, that things like this aren't going to impact them.

840
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,411
And right now they're probably right.

841
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:50,192
It's not going to impact them right now.

842
01:40:52,727 --> 01:41:10,275
As much as I know that in some ways this is a little bit of virtue signaling, a little bit of calling in people for support, I would love more actionable things to be done.

843
01:41:11,536 --> 01:41:21,340
But in the meantime, I think we do deserve and should stand with our friends and family, chosen biological

844
01:41:22,519 --> 01:41:30,410
adopted and protect those who are more vulnerable than us.

845
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:31,191
Thank you.

846
01:41:32,353 --> 01:41:32,713
Thank you.

847
01:41:36,198 --> 01:41:38,000
We'll go back to the podium name and address for the record.

848
01:41:40,765 --> 01:41:42,526
Hi everybody, my name is Michael Prentke.

849
01:41:42,646 --> 01:41:44,707
I live at 340 High Street.

850
01:41:46,588 --> 01:41:48,749
I don't have a lot extra to share.

851
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:52,391
I just want to kind of amplify what my friend Micah had to say earlier.

852
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:59,594
I appreciate his sentiments and I appreciate Councilman Lazaro's introduction of the motion.

853
01:42:01,075 --> 01:42:05,818
I too am Jewish and want to sort of further this

854
01:42:07,275 --> 01:42:13,199
dialogue that these actions by ICE is not making Jews safer.

855
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:15,200
I want to be very clear about that.

856
01:42:16,341 --> 01:42:20,704
I, as a Jew, do not feel any safer with this, these deportations.

857
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:27,728
In fact, I would say it's actually offensive that they're saying this is in the name of anti-Semitism, that we're deporting these people.

858
01:42:27,748 --> 01:42:29,530
That actually makes me feel less safe.

859
01:42:31,731 --> 01:42:32,031
That's all.

860
01:42:32,932 --> 01:42:33,132
Thanks.

861
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:34,453
Thank you.

862
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:39,419
No one else on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium.

863
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:42,060
Name and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.

864
01:42:45,461 --> 01:42:48,103
Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

865
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:53,525
I want to thank the council for putting forth this resolution.

866
01:42:54,947 --> 01:42:57,988
It's true that it's just a resolution.

867
01:42:58,468 --> 01:43:02,730
But I think that we might underestimate the power of speaking up.

868
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:11,653
And I feel really proud and safer to be in a community that's willing to say no, not on our watch.

869
01:43:12,253 --> 01:43:14,974
Because this is not happening only in our neighborhood.

870
01:43:15,034 --> 01:43:15,735
And let's face it.

871
01:43:16,855 --> 01:43:19,638
where Rumesa was picked up is right across the border.

872
01:43:20,198 --> 01:43:21,439
It may as well be in Medford.

873
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,561
But this is happening all over the country.

874
01:43:24,022 --> 01:43:29,366
I grew up in Western Washington State, and people are being rounded up there in large numbers.

875
01:43:32,769 --> 01:43:35,131
And so I think it's really important that we do speak up.

876
01:43:35,231 --> 01:43:40,136
And I just want to thank you and say, yes, it's so important to speak up.

877
01:43:41,157 --> 01:43:41,477
Thanks.

878
01:43:42,037 --> 01:43:42,438
Thank you.

879
01:43:45,154 --> 01:43:45,995
We do have a hand on Zoom.

880
01:43:46,035 --> 01:43:48,256
I'm going to go to Katie on Zoom.

881
01:43:51,619 --> 01:43:52,800
Katie, name and address for the record.

882
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,540
You have three minutes.

883
01:43:55,001 --> 01:43:56,483
Hi, I'm Katie Dick.

884
01:43:56,563 --> 01:43:58,844
I'm at 129 Traincraft Northwest.

885
01:43:59,705 --> 01:44:03,988
I just want to thank Councilor Lazaro for bringing this resolution forward.

886
01:44:04,008 --> 01:44:06,250
I think what happened to Ms.

887
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:10,253
Ozturk is an unconscionable act by ICE.

888
01:44:11,465 --> 01:44:13,907
And so I agree with all of the speakers ahead.

889
01:44:14,487 --> 01:44:16,448
I just think it's so important that we speak out.

890
01:44:16,928 --> 01:44:18,249
This is right in our backyard.

891
01:44:19,329 --> 01:44:39,740
And, you know, as someone who sort of won the citizenship lottery, enjoys all the privileges of being a US citizen, I think it's important that people in our own community who don't sort of enjoy the benefits of this lottery ticket know that a lot of us are

892
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:51,088
Looking out for them, I'm terrified of what might happen to friends and neighbors here in Medford under these circumstances.

893
01:44:51,268 --> 01:45:01,196
And so I'm strongly in support of this resolution and grateful to the council for speaking out and for anything that we can do here in Medford to support the immigrant community.

894
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,096
Thank you.

895
01:45:03,878 --> 01:45:04,358
Thank you.

896
01:45:04,378 --> 01:45:08,641
Go back to the podium, name and address for the record.

897
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:09,262
You have three minutes.

898
01:45:11,442 --> 01:45:15,385
Ezekiel Silverstein, 71 Kenmia Road, Medford.

899
01:45:17,507 --> 01:45:20,830
I understand the councilors bringing this resolution.

900
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:34,282
Rumeysa was, even though apparently not a resident of Medford, was part of the Medford community, and it is your purview to try and defend your constituents or members of the community.

901
01:45:35,312 --> 01:45:43,982
And even if it comes out that all she did was write an op-ed that I personally disagree with wholeheartedly, I think it's offensive.

902
01:45:44,322 --> 01:45:52,131
But freedom of speech is incredibly important, and due process needs to be obeyed and abided by.

903
01:45:52,151 --> 01:45:54,294
So I think that

904
01:45:55,843 --> 01:46:02,008
she should be afforded all those rights of due process and her moment in court.

905
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:08,734
But someone else brought up others like Mahmoud Khadil or others like Mahmoud Uttal.

906
01:46:09,635 --> 01:46:11,397
There are other people who are being

907
01:46:12,578 --> 01:46:29,951
apprehended and in court for deportation, who have provided material support for terrorist organizations, who have offended the rights of other students on other campuses, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard, etc.

908
01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:34,834
And if someone here is taking action that

909
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:43,378
offends the rights, the civil rights of citizens, then their visas can and, in my opinion, should be revoked.

910
01:46:43,798 --> 01:46:51,784
But Ramesa Ozturk, from my understanding, has only committed speech, and that is fine.

911
01:46:53,065 --> 01:46:54,707
So if it does come out that

912
01:46:57,538 --> 01:47:01,580
She has provided other support for terrorist organizations like Hamas.

913
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:05,881
We wouldn't want people who support ISIS coming into this country on a visa.

914
01:47:06,401 --> 01:47:10,203
If people who support Hamas come in, then that's a different story.

915
01:47:11,753 --> 01:47:19,935
But as it stands, her freedom of speech has been bridged, and I think that due process needs to be abided by.

916
01:47:20,195 --> 01:47:31,939
I hate the as a Jew statement, but I do feel safer when people who support terrorist organizations that call for the genocide of Jews are removed from this country.

917
01:47:33,939 --> 01:47:37,920
She has freedom of speech, but it's limited as a non-citizen.

918
01:47:39,081 --> 01:47:39,381
That's all.

919
01:47:39,561 --> 01:47:39,801
Thank you.

920
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,664
Any further comment by members of the public.

921
01:47:47,488 --> 01:47:47,768
All right.

922
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:53,280
I'll just be brief as a co sponsor, but also as the chair I didn't want to say anything until everyone had had their say.

923
01:47:55,437 --> 01:48:07,587
One thing I think that's important to note is when what councilors are read on the previous or earlier on this item, Tufts made it very clear that I slide about when the visa was revoked.

924
01:48:08,588 --> 01:48:13,933
So it's another post-hoc attempt to justify this abhorrent act.

925
01:48:15,013 --> 01:48:22,500
The Supreme Court ruled yesterday, yes, that some of these folks are gonna have to refile in different courts of jurisdiction, but they were very clear

926
01:48:23,303 --> 01:48:37,691
I believe it was 9 to 0, that there is no justification for this venue shopping and trying to move people from Boston to Louisiana before their lawyers have the ability to file a habeas petition.

927
01:48:38,992 --> 01:48:41,653
The government's blatantly violating basic due process rights.

928
01:48:41,713 --> 01:48:42,154
Never mind.

929
01:48:42,194 --> 01:48:46,056
That's before we get to the question of First Amendment rights.

930
01:48:46,876 --> 01:48:50,839
Just to say, oh, we're going to get you out of the country faster than your lawyer can file a habeas petition

931
01:48:51,879 --> 01:49:02,746
one of the most egregious violations of due process that I think we've seen since the internment of Japanese people in the 1940s during World War II.

932
01:49:02,906 --> 01:49:09,651
And again, to note that the Alien Enemies Act was what Franklin Roosevelt used to justify that.

933
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:10,311
It's a 1798 law.

934
01:49:11,191 --> 01:49:16,135
I think our values have changed a little bit since 1798, maybe at least only for some of us.

935
01:49:18,536 --> 01:49:20,197
And just on the point of acting locally,

936
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:38,222
I can't really think of a greater danger to our residents and masked agents of the state abducting people off the street and beyond a resolution I would like to see the city seriously consider not just this item like the know your rights information but.

937
01:49:40,865 --> 01:50:00,598
Joining up with Community members and potentially using city employees to warn residents when ice is present in the Community, I think it's essential that residents are informed that there are dangerous people here who might try to take them for no reason against their basic human rights, and I say that to say that.

938
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:08,783
When we passed the welcoming city ordinance a couple months ago, there was a.

939
01:50:10,292 --> 01:50:18,617
you know, some statements and questions went around, well, it's not going to happen to US citizens, or it's not going to happen to naturalized citizens, or it's not going to happen to green card holders.

940
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:32,767
Well, it's not just, there's not just, you know, I think it's this mythical idea that there's this group of violent immigrants who have no documentation, and that's who is going to be attacked, and no one else is.

941
01:50:32,807 --> 01:50:34,968
Well, it's visa holders who've done nothing wrong.

942
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:36,669
It's green card holders.

943
01:50:38,438 --> 01:50:45,721
And we've heard stories from the border of Canadian citizens, of naturalized U.S.

944
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:48,202
citizens, of natural born, native born U.S.

945
01:50:48,242 --> 01:50:57,066
citizens being detained by ICE because they refuse to turn over their phone so that ICE can search whether they've put out statements against the president.

946
01:50:58,946 --> 01:50:59,887
So it's everybody.

947
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,408
It's moving up the scale every day.

948
01:51:03,352 --> 01:51:05,753
Um, and that's why we passed that ordinance.

949
01:51:05,773 --> 01:51:06,934
We said, we're not going to cooperate.

950
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:23,663
And now I think it's up to us to convene, uh, and to push the mayor to take action, to actively warn residents that there are dangerous agents of this Trump regime who are coming to this community who, um, may well pose them grave danger.

951
01:51:24,924 --> 01:51:25,984
I think that's reasonable.

952
01:51:26,264 --> 01:51:28,305
That's what local government should do.

953
01:51:28,325 --> 01:51:31,167
It should try to keep residents safe, safe by making sure they know

954
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:37,345
When dangerous people are around, especially because, as was noted, we don't have the ability to tell them not to come here.

955
01:51:38,225 --> 01:51:46,352
You know, when dangerous people, when danger happens, local government, you know, stands up and says, we're going to try to stop this danger.

956
01:51:47,353 --> 01:51:51,776
And the sad part of what's happening right now is we can't tell the federal government not to come here.

957
01:51:51,816 --> 01:51:53,958
All we can do is say they're here, please stay away.

958
01:51:54,938 --> 01:51:56,940
So that's something I would like to see happen personally.

959
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:00,663
And I thank you for your indulgence in me making that statement.

960
01:52:02,457 --> 01:52:06,658
Is there any further discussion by members of the public or members of the council on this resolution?

961
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:13,181
Name and address for the record, please.

962
01:52:13,261 --> 01:52:15,401
Milton McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

963
01:52:17,082 --> 01:52:21,203
I understand that this resolution is symbolic, but I think it's an important statement.

964
01:52:21,304 --> 01:52:27,005
So I thank you on a somewhat separate topic, but I believe it's related.

965
01:52:27,446 --> 01:52:28,186
There's also been

966
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:33,121
an attack on DEI in this country.

967
01:52:33,401 --> 01:52:40,724
And I know that I personally have reached out to our DEI director to offer my support.

968
01:52:40,984 --> 01:52:53,728
And I don't know if the council has, and I don't, I'm not aware that any public statement has been made, but I would like you to consider offering support to our DEI director at this time as well.

969
01:52:53,948 --> 01:52:54,288
Thank you.

970
01:52:55,043 --> 01:53:04,170
Thank you, yes, we have offered support including the prior ordinance on the transgender rights and reproductive healthcare inclusion.

971
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:09,214
But if someone would wanna make an amendment to add that to the resolution, Councilor Sang.

972
01:53:12,617 --> 01:53:14,098
I'd be happy to add that amendment.

973
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:20,683
Should we do it as a B paper since the main paper is about Ramesa?

974
01:53:22,402 --> 01:53:23,745
Is there a preference on this council?

975
01:53:23,765 --> 01:53:25,248
Do you have a preference, Councilor Zaro?

976
01:53:29,977 --> 01:53:32,121
A B paper would be my preference.

977
01:53:33,345 --> 01:53:47,010
And I also want to, to that point, draw attention to the work that we're doing in our resident services, resident services committee on a human rights commission ordinance.

978
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:51,212
So essentially we are reforming that ordinance.

979
01:53:51,272 --> 01:53:58,575
So the HRC has a lot more power to advise city governments about

980
01:53:59,636 --> 01:54:05,157
how to protect our residents, how to inform residents of their rights on DEI measures as well.

981
01:54:05,557 --> 01:54:09,718
So defending diversity, equity, and inclusion, and having more voices there.

982
01:54:11,059 --> 01:54:14,480
And I hope that residents will support that measure as well.

983
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,360
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

984
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:23,502
We do have one hand raised again.

985
01:54:23,522 --> 01:54:25,182
Matthew Page-Lieberman.

986
01:54:25,222 --> 01:54:28,863
Matthew, I can go to you for one more minute since you've already spoken once.

987
01:54:34,256 --> 01:54:35,718
Sorry, I had some difficulty.

988
01:54:35,738 --> 01:54:42,905
I just, just to speak again to be, I just want to provide some clarity, because of my tone, sometimes things can be misunderstood.

989
01:54:43,485 --> 01:54:57,079
I just want to say that my derisive tone about people saying that it's a court issue, and we'll let the courts decide it's out of the purview of this council is what I deride.

990
01:54:57,739 --> 01:55:09,604
And I think that when people are rising up against injustice in our own communities, for anybody to try to shut down anybody using any kind of rationale for why people should not speak up against injustice, that is despicable.

991
01:55:09,904 --> 01:55:15,306
As for the counselors and the Tufts that are trying to approach things legally, I support that.

992
01:55:15,386 --> 01:55:24,109
And I think everybody's trying to do anything they can to help everybody that is a victim and a target of this authoritarian regime.

993
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,549
Thank you.

994
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:26,030
Thank you.

995
01:55:27,619 --> 01:55:34,562
On the B paper by Councillor saying seconded by seconded by Councilor let me Mr please follow up.

996
01:55:34,582 --> 01:55:39,664
That's a cow him.

997
01:55:41,684 --> 01:55:41,924
Yes.

998
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:44,465
Vice President Collins.

999
01:55:45,626 --> 01:55:46,586
Council little is our own.

1000
01:55:47,567 --> 01:55:47,787
Yes.

1001
01:55:54,253 --> 01:56:06,175
Yes, having the affirmative, one of the none of the negative the motion passes on the a paper by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor saying, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1002
01:56:10,356 --> 01:56:11,016
Councilor Callahan.

1003
01:56:11,496 --> 01:56:11,696
Yes.

1004
01:56:13,777 --> 01:56:14,817
Vice President Collins.

1005
01:56:15,757 --> 01:56:16,617
Council Lazaro.

1006
01:56:17,697 --> 01:56:17,977
Yes.

1007
01:56:19,098 --> 01:56:19,578
Councilor Lemming.

1008
01:56:22,865 --> 01:56:31,855
I'm just saying, President bears yes 70 affirmative none the negative the motion passes 25057 resolution to create and distribute know your rights information.

1009
01:56:33,377 --> 01:56:42,386
We basically just had this discussion so I'm just going to say that the resolution is to be resolved that the city of Medford create know your rights informational pamphlets or flyers and distribute them.

1010
01:56:43,107 --> 01:57:06,840
and promote this information via the city's online communication and social media platforms in our community centers, such as Medford City Hall, Medford Senior Center, Medford Public Schools, Medford Police Department Headquarters, and the Medford Public Library, and be it further resolved that this Know Your Rights information cover common questions and concerns and information on basic rights under the law, and be it further resolved that this be available in English, Arabic, Creole, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese.

1011
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:10,242
Councilor Collins and then Councilor Seng.

1012
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:14,611
Thank you, President Behrs.

1013
01:57:15,411 --> 01:57:26,217
I do wanna take this opportunity just to read into the record some of the basic rights and resources that I think we need to be making every effort to communicate and distribute via city communication channels.

1014
01:57:26,357 --> 01:57:28,999
They include, you have the right to remain silent.

1015
01:57:29,819 --> 01:57:33,661
You have the right to not answer questions, including questions about your immigration status.

1016
01:57:33,721 --> 01:57:35,062
You have the right to call your attorney.

1017
01:57:35,722 --> 01:57:36,983
You have the right to see your warrant.

1018
01:57:37,203 --> 01:57:40,285
I must have a warrant signed by a judge to arrest or detain you.

1019
01:57:41,019 --> 01:57:44,460
You have the right to not sign any documents, even if ICE instructs you to.

1020
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,061
If ICE comes to your home, you have the right to not open the door.

1021
01:57:48,321 --> 01:57:52,023
If ICE claims to have a warrant, you have the right to ask them to slide it under the door.

1022
01:57:52,043 --> 01:57:58,045
If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, they cannot enter a home without permission from an adult.

1023
01:57:58,885 --> 01:58:03,947
If ICE comes to your business, you have the right to not answer questions about specific employees.

1024
01:58:04,007 --> 01:58:07,828
You have the right to not introduce ICE agents to employees that they request to see.

1025
01:58:08,768 --> 01:58:12,910
If ICE comes to your business, you have the right to not allow them into private areas of your business.

1026
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:19,973
If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, they cannot enter private areas of your business without your permission.

1027
01:58:22,255 --> 01:58:36,326
So I think the least that we can do as a city, and we should go further than this, but the least we can do is make sure that all of our residents and business owners and community members unambiguously know their rights in this scary and uncertain time.

1028
01:58:36,386 --> 01:58:41,970
I've had a number of residents reach out to me stating, I actually don't know what a person's rights are.

1029
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:49,736
Maybe I know what I can do if ICE comes to my home or to my business, but what if they just approached me on the street, like Ramesa was approached on the street?

1030
01:58:51,377 --> 01:58:56,219
We have the resources to, I mean, this information exists everywhere.

1031
01:58:56,259 --> 01:58:59,801
There are tons of nonprofits that are doing really good work at sharing this information.

1032
01:58:59,841 --> 01:59:06,244
It would be an extremely light lift for the city to put together really basic immigration, know your rights documents.

1033
01:59:07,044 --> 01:59:15,288
We could work with our community liaisons team and other resources that the city already has to make sure this is translated to every language that is spoken in the city of Medford.

1034
01:59:16,509 --> 01:59:24,739
and then use all of our official and informal communication channels in the community to try and make sure that everybody is empowered with this information.

1035
01:59:24,799 --> 01:59:27,883
It's not all that we should do, but we have to start there.

1036
01:59:29,064 --> 01:59:29,385
Thank you.

1037
01:59:30,626 --> 01:59:31,828
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1038
01:59:32,609 --> 01:59:32,969
Thank you.

1039
01:59:35,158 --> 01:59:41,323
I think it's always good for a government to inform their residents of their rights.

1040
01:59:42,624 --> 01:59:44,446
We have these rights for a reason.

1041
01:59:44,706 --> 01:59:48,669
We have these rights to protect our freedoms and to protect our way of life.

1042
01:59:50,591 --> 02:00:04,662
And, you know, I've heard a lot recently, I acknowledged this earlier, but I've heard a lot recently from residents about what we can do as politicians, as elected officials to protect our residents, to help our residents,

1043
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:10,393
And we talked about how some measures might be symbolic.

1044
02:00:10,454 --> 02:00:14,116
It's important to do those, because if you can't do the symbolic, you can't do the substantive.

1045
02:00:14,936 --> 02:00:27,625
But likewise, we have to be creative, and we have to be smart in trying to figure out the little ways that we can help affect this issue.

1046
02:00:28,425 --> 02:00:32,068
Because sometimes, even the little ways can have great effects.

1047
02:00:33,514 --> 02:00:38,476
And for our residents to know their rights is one of those really great effects.

1048
02:00:40,617 --> 02:00:45,979
This is, you know, I spoke about how this is a fearful moment earlier as well.

1049
02:00:46,199 --> 02:00:49,480
And, you know, I want to underscore that from my perspective.

1050
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:59,844
I'm the son of immigrants, my parents are green card holders, and even my presence on this council today makes me fearful for their own safety.

1051
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:05,437
you know, not to say anything about the cases of U.S.

1052
02:01:05,477 --> 02:01:27,348
citizens that have been, you know, put at danger because of this administration's actions, but, you know, the lived reality of being afraid going out, being afraid for my parents, you know, to see their, to go travel abroad to see their family, their really old family, you know, for them to,

1053
02:01:28,585 --> 02:01:55,112
For people like my parents and so many residents in Medford to be afraid to go out to the grocery store, to go out to run their errands, for so many Medford students to be afraid to go to school, I think it's a real problem that we face in the city that we have to learn how to address, be it through the government doing something or be it through mutual aid.

1054
02:01:55,965 --> 02:02:04,712
I think knowing your rights is the first basic and maybe one of the most important steps you can know.

1055
02:02:04,732 --> 02:02:08,354
I feel privileged in that I've studied this stuff.

1056
02:02:12,808 --> 02:02:23,096
I've gotten this knowledge before, but I also know that when I was walking through these rights with my parents, even just last week or two weeks ago, I guess, they didn't know half of this stuff.

1057
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:36,827
And I think it's really important for us to get this information out there ASAP, for us to translate this information into other languages as well, and for us to be creative in how we get this message across.

1058
02:02:37,147 --> 02:02:37,467
Thank you.

1059
02:02:38,608 --> 02:02:39,449
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1060
02:02:40,581 --> 02:02:43,984
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sanz to approve.

1061
02:02:47,486 --> 02:02:49,468
And is this referring to anywhere or just going right to the Mayor?

1062
02:02:51,909 --> 02:02:53,010
Great.

1063
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:54,832
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1064
02:02:55,672 --> 02:02:56,333
Councilor Zaro.

1065
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:01,381
Thank you.

1066
02:03:01,461 --> 02:03:07,126
I just wanted to thank Councilor Sang and Vice President Collins for bringing this forward.

1067
02:03:07,166 --> 02:03:14,112
It's a very actionable, simple, and concrete way to help our residents.

1068
02:03:14,672 --> 02:03:16,173
Very straightforward and I appreciate it.

1069
02:03:16,273 --> 02:03:16,574
Thank you.

1070
02:03:19,116 --> 02:03:19,836
Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

1071
02:03:19,876 --> 02:03:23,739
Is there any discussion on this resolution by members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

1072
02:03:29,404 --> 02:03:30,164
Name and address for the record.

1073
02:03:30,185 --> 02:03:30,785
You have three minutes.

1074
02:03:32,691 --> 02:03:34,752
Nick Trillio again, Forty Robinson Road.

1075
02:03:35,233 --> 02:03:38,295
So, you know, the premise of this is actually great, right?

1076
02:03:39,055 --> 02:03:40,256
Informing people of their rights.

1077
02:03:40,336 --> 02:03:44,899
I mean, when I do my job of defending people accused of crimes, I mean, that's something I encourage, right?

1078
02:03:44,939 --> 02:03:45,459
Know your rights.

1079
02:03:45,559 --> 02:03:46,400
It's important.

1080
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,841
Everybody wants that.

1081
02:03:47,981 --> 02:03:54,425
You know, it's just the issue with supporting a lot of these resolutions is hard just because of a lot of like the inflammatory language that gets put into them.

1082
02:03:54,808 --> 02:04:06,963
that kind of politicizes the issue right like the issue at core here is like we should inform people of their rights, which is great, but then you have things like making blanket statements that, you know, federal law enforcement are like.

1083
02:04:07,602 --> 02:04:20,526
disproportionately targeting non-white people, you know, when that's not really supported by any evidence that I've seen, you know, to me, that just unnecessarily politicizes these decent ideas behind the resolutions and makes it hard to support them.

1084
02:04:20,726 --> 02:04:28,388
So I think if we can just get proposals out there that just get to the issues and avoid all the political fluff, we're going to actually accomplish more.

1085
02:04:28,408 --> 02:04:31,289
And we're going to realize we actually agree on more than we think we do.

1086
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:32,050
Thank you.

1087
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:32,890
Thank you.

1088
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,841
I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

1089
02:04:37,901 --> 02:04:39,301
Eileen, name and address for the record.

1090
02:04:39,321 --> 02:04:40,082
You have three minutes.

1091
02:04:44,444 --> 02:04:49,306
My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1092
02:04:50,866 --> 02:04:54,128
And this was a political act.

1093
02:04:54,981 --> 02:04:57,223
by the present administration.

1094
02:04:57,963 --> 02:05:01,205
All this disappearing of people is definitely political.

1095
02:05:01,866 --> 02:05:08,350
It happened because they took a stance that was in opposition to the president and his crew.

1096
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:14,975
And so to criticize the council for being political

1097
02:05:16,415 --> 02:05:24,741
when we've had a political act that's so destructive going on in our communities all over the country doesn't make any sense to me at all.

1098
02:05:25,442 --> 02:05:43,015
And also, I just wanted to say about the Alien Enemies Act that that was an act that followed the Dred Scott decision, which said that any self-emancipated slave had no rights and could be returned to their masters.

1099
02:05:43,896 --> 02:05:45,698
The Alien Enemies Act

1100
02:05:46,743 --> 02:05:53,027
went further and targeted any people who aided emancipated slaves.

1101
02:05:53,848 --> 02:05:58,891
So it was a furtherance of depriving people of their rights.

1102
02:05:59,471 --> 02:06:06,876
Now we have a situation where international students and other workers are being targeted and disappeared.

1103
02:06:07,603 --> 02:06:10,865
and do not think they will not come after other people.

1104
02:06:10,925 --> 02:06:11,986
They already are.

1105
02:06:12,626 --> 02:06:15,348
It will continue unless people stand up.

1106
02:06:16,088 --> 02:06:25,774
I really wanna thank Councilor Lazaro and all the councilors that have voted, that have indicated sympathy with people who are being disappeared.

1107
02:06:27,515 --> 02:06:36,321
As a Jew, I echo the statement of other Jews here that to use us to justify

1108
02:06:36,892 --> 02:06:51,765
What's going on is absolutely horrendous and appalling and standing up right now, as you all are doing, as we all are doing, is so very important.

1109
02:06:52,326 --> 02:07:01,113
We cannot remain silent or the situation that's going on is gonna escalate and who knows who will be next.

1110
02:07:01,854 --> 02:07:03,896
So thank you for letting me speak.

1111
02:07:05,405 --> 02:07:06,045
Thank you, Eileen.

1112
02:07:06,726 --> 02:07:09,487
We'll go to the podium name and address for the record please you have three minutes.

1113
02:07:12,068 --> 02:07:14,309
Ellen Epstein 15 growth street.

1114
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:30,095
I want to say that as a representative of safe Medford we're totally behind this initiative of distributing know your rights cards, it's kind of a no brainer and we're happy to help with this in any way we can.

1115
02:07:31,376 --> 02:07:31,496
And

1116
02:07:33,797 --> 02:07:48,364
Personally, I'm just going to say it's not only appropriate, but it's imperative that you guys as city counselors as our government representatives speak out about what is happening now.

1117
02:07:48,965 --> 02:07:53,827
And I thank you and I appreciate you, and I am in full support.

1118
02:07:55,188 --> 02:07:55,548
Thanks.

1119
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,549
Thank you.

1120
02:07:58,888 --> 02:08:00,869
I'm gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom.

1121
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:03,731
Jess, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1122
02:08:06,353 --> 02:08:08,174
Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road.

1123
02:08:09,695 --> 02:08:18,820
I just want to know, can we get any citations for every, you know, different information that has been stated here tonight?

1124
02:08:19,981 --> 02:08:25,924
I know one of the counselors stated that people are getting,

1125
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:29,411
detained just for being brown.

1126
02:08:30,051 --> 02:08:33,053
Is there any like where I haven't seen this information.

1127
02:08:33,553 --> 02:08:40,797
So I just want to know if anyone can release the information where they're getting it from.

1128
02:08:40,817 --> 02:08:42,077
That would be great.

1129
02:08:44,899 --> 02:08:55,144
Also, with having a task force to let people know ICE is either in Medford or around Medford,

1130
02:08:56,187 --> 02:09:05,449
Um, I just want to know, is this for like residents that you're warning or is it for people that came to this country illegally?

1131
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:08,910
Because coming illegally is breaking the law.

1132
02:09:09,731 --> 02:09:10,611
I'm just not sure.

1133
02:09:10,731 --> 02:09:20,173
Are you saying you want to warn residents that are here legally or people that came into this country not legally?

1134
02:09:20,413 --> 02:09:22,974
That's what I'd like clarification on.

1135
02:09:26,898 --> 02:09:27,338
Thank you.

1136
02:09:27,358 --> 02:09:31,979
I can, if you want to use the rest of your time, I can answer questions at the end.

1137
02:09:32,119 --> 02:09:33,200
Oh, okay.

1138
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:33,960
Thank you.

1139
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:35,100
Yeah.

1140
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:38,721
So that was basically what I'm looking for is just the citations.

1141
02:09:39,901 --> 02:09:42,222
Cause we don't want any misinformation getting out there.

1142
02:09:42,262 --> 02:09:46,343
So just citations of where the counselors have found this information would be great.

1143
02:09:46,883 --> 02:09:54,025
And also with notifying people, you know, that have, there's a lot of people waiting to come to the country legally.

1144
02:09:54,085 --> 02:09:54,825
So I just want to know,

1145
02:09:55,454 --> 02:09:57,676
who you are looking to warn.

1146
02:10:00,598 --> 02:10:01,019
Thank you.

1147
02:10:01,539 --> 02:10:11,728
In terms of what counselors or members of the public have said for counselors, you can certainly email counselors if you have a specific citation for a specific piece of information.

1148
02:10:13,409 --> 02:10:19,615
You know, for the information I cited, I believe I read a New York Times article I could look for and provide.

1149
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:37,515
And when I mentioned a task force or a warning about the presence of ICE, I was talking about all Medford residents, regardless of their documentation status, because as we've seen, the administration is politicizing documentation status at this point.

1150
02:10:39,116 --> 02:10:42,537
But it is against the federal law to be here illegally, correct?

1151
02:10:44,077 --> 02:10:46,338
If that's not a political thing, I mean, it's the law.

1152
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:49,042
I'm not going to get into a back and forth.

1153
02:10:49,062 --> 02:10:55,747
There are civil violations, but there are also people who are here legally and are now having their legal status revoked for political reasons.

1154
02:10:55,867 --> 02:10:58,129
So it's unclear.

1155
02:10:58,490 --> 02:10:58,870
Thank you.

1156
02:10:59,010 --> 02:10:59,410
Thank you.

1157
02:11:01,272 --> 02:11:02,053
Go back to the podium.

1158
02:11:02,073 --> 02:11:03,013
Name and address for the record.

1159
02:11:03,033 --> 02:11:03,674
You have three minutes.

1160
02:11:03,994 --> 02:11:04,234
Yeah.

1161
02:11:04,294 --> 02:11:05,535
Hi, my name is Michael Tesselman.

1162
02:11:05,575 --> 02:11:06,756
I'm at 499 Main Street.

1163
02:11:06,776 --> 02:11:08,718
So there's a lot to unpack here.

1164
02:11:08,918 --> 02:11:13,322
One, for the disproportionate targeting of brown people,

1165
02:11:14,195 --> 02:11:15,995
Reports are coming out from all over the country about this.

1166
02:11:16,156 --> 02:11:19,816
I mean, my recommendation is just search Google.

1167
02:11:20,317 --> 02:11:23,157
It's ubiquitous.

1168
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:36,901
Off the top of my head, Chicago, guy got literally pulled over by ICE, wasn't actually an, quote unquote, illegal immigrant, but he was Mexican looking.

1169
02:11:36,981 --> 02:11:41,082
So that was enough to temporarily detain him, which again,

1170
02:11:42,376 --> 02:11:44,377
very much an unlawful detention.

1171
02:11:46,278 --> 02:11:58,924
So the idea that, oh, we don't know that brown people are being disproportionately targeted, you have to have your head so far in the sand that you're on the season finale of Barry.

1172
02:11:59,444 --> 02:12:00,124
This is wild.

1173
02:12:01,085 --> 02:12:01,225
Two.

1174
02:12:02,752 --> 02:12:05,614
It is a civil violation.

1175
02:12:05,634 --> 02:12:08,377
It is not like a felony.

1176
02:12:09,037 --> 02:12:11,539
You commit a civil crime when you jaywalk.

1177
02:12:11,899 --> 02:12:14,521
And I know you jaywalk because you live in Massachusetts.

1178
02:12:15,282 --> 02:12:24,649
So it is insane to say that someone should have their life upended because they've committed a civil infraction.

1179
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:26,331
That's bonkers.

1180
02:12:28,392 --> 02:12:28,793
Finally,

1181
02:12:34,092 --> 02:12:44,496
Yes, like distribute, oh, and then as far as the inflammatory language goes, our current body politic is a flame.

1182
02:12:45,216 --> 02:12:50,899
You cannot do anything political without it being in some way inflammatory right now.

1183
02:12:51,639 --> 02:12:58,802
If it is inflammatory to say that we respect the basic rights and dignities of human beings, regardless of where they happen to be from,

1184
02:13:00,687 --> 02:13:05,489
then I don't know, man, like catch on fire with me because that's bonkers that you're against that.

1185
02:13:06,210 --> 02:13:12,452
So like, just some of the pushback on this is just absolutely crazy.

1186
02:13:12,673 --> 02:13:28,300
And at the end of the day, I want to remind people whether or not they have documentation, whether or not they've overstayed a visa, by the way, that is the largest source of illegal immigration is visa overstays and now people crossing the border, whether or not,

1187
02:13:30,235 --> 02:13:36,298
any of this other nonsense that people are trying to use to justify a slow goose step into authoritarianism.

1188
02:13:37,459 --> 02:13:38,399
These are your neighbors.

1189
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:42,121
These are the people who live next door to you that we are trying to protect.

1190
02:13:43,122 --> 02:13:50,626
They are the people that you go grocery shopping with and let your kids hang out with because you like them and you talk to them.

1191
02:13:50,706 --> 02:13:51,606
This is your community.

1192
02:13:53,711 --> 02:14:07,254
Like this, this like wild attempt to other people at the behest of authoritarianism is distressing, disgusting, and just wildly depressing.

1193
02:14:07,274 --> 02:14:12,315
And both for like what it means about our society, but also what it means about the people doing it.

1194
02:14:12,976 --> 02:14:15,636
Like, it just makes me sad for everyone involved.

1195
02:14:16,276 --> 02:14:16,796
That's my time.

1196
02:14:16,836 --> 02:14:17,197
Thank you.

1197
02:14:17,457 --> 02:14:17,997
Thank you.

1198
02:14:18,257 --> 02:14:18,837
Councilor Lemming.

1199
02:14:21,838 --> 02:14:31,963
So just with the with the citations question, I would repeat, you could Google it, I would advise that you go to a somewhat reputable news source for this.

1200
02:14:32,023 --> 02:14:38,265
I personally released a blog, mattlemming.com slash blog.

1201
02:14:38,686 --> 02:14:43,007
And if you there's my most recent post was called resisting ice.

1202
02:14:43,108 --> 02:14:43,968
And I understand that

1203
02:14:45,131 --> 02:14:50,156
I would like to thank all five people who actually read my blog, but I take pride.

1204
02:14:50,176 --> 02:14:57,183
And I take pride in how many URLs I link to throughout the text there.

1205
02:14:57,223 --> 02:15:03,189
And so there is plenty of cases that relate.

1206
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:07,994
There are plenty of articles linked there that relate to detaining Brown people,

1207
02:15:09,547 --> 02:15:15,312
women describing detention centers as hell on earth, people dying, particularly the detention center in Miami.

1208
02:15:15,972 --> 02:15:17,634
So it's out there.

1209
02:15:17,674 --> 02:15:26,761
I mean, if you're only news sources like Fox News, then you're not gonna see it, but just kind of go outside of that a little bit and you'll get a lot more information.

1210
02:15:26,941 --> 02:15:27,282
Thank you.

1211
02:15:28,783 --> 02:15:29,123
Thank you.

1212
02:15:29,163 --> 02:15:30,684
I heard Fox said the markets are up.

1213
02:15:31,045 --> 02:15:34,888
So I'm gonna go to Gene Zahner on Zoom.

1214
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:52,781
Hello and I just want to thank City Council for focusing on getting the knowledge out to community members about their rights and everything you've been doing on this issue.

1215
02:15:52,821 --> 02:15:53,742
I really appreciate it.

1216
02:15:55,063 --> 02:16:01,909
I wanted to let you know that Medford People Power has reached out to the city and asked the city to

1217
02:16:03,099 --> 02:16:07,301
put out information about knowing your rights and also the welcoming city ordinance.

1218
02:16:07,921 --> 02:16:17,066
So in the interest of just collaborating, communicating about this one to let you know that we met with their comms team and they said they'd get back to us next week.

1219
02:16:17,206 --> 02:16:19,527
So thank you so much for all you do.

1220
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:23,749
Thank you, Jean.

1221
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:28,592
I'm gonna go to Matthew Page Lieberman, name and address for the record, three minutes.

1222
02:16:30,483 --> 02:16:33,745
Yes, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

1223
02:16:34,406 --> 02:16:38,488
I just really appreciate everybody from the council as well as the community that are speaking up about this.

1224
02:16:39,029 --> 02:16:43,812
I think in regards to brown people, this question, it is not an artful term.

1225
02:16:44,212 --> 02:16:45,653
A lot of people have no clarity.

1226
02:16:45,693 --> 02:16:47,954
You ask different people on the street, what is a brown person?

1227
02:16:47,974 --> 02:16:48,915
You'll get different answers.

1228
02:16:49,335 --> 02:16:54,919
Many people find out when they filled out the most recent census, they identify as a person of color, they're brown.

1229
02:16:54,939 --> 02:16:56,640
The government says, no, we consider you white.

1230
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:59,622
People are Middle East, Northern Africa, are they brown?

1231
02:16:59,702 --> 02:17:00,082
Depends.

1232
02:17:01,748 --> 02:17:05,110
And so this question of, are they really going after Brown?

1233
02:17:05,170 --> 02:17:10,953
And if somebody wants to argue this point, I think it's kind of missing the forest for the trees.

1234
02:17:12,734 --> 02:17:14,434
We used to have a principal from the U.S.

1235
02:17:14,635 --> 02:17:19,517
Supreme Court in 1960, I don't know if it was Warren or I forget the one with the university.

1236
02:17:20,037 --> 02:17:20,618
that we have here.

1237
02:17:20,658 --> 02:17:25,562
But the principle was, it's better to release the guilty person than to imprison an innocent person.

1238
02:17:25,923 --> 02:17:28,885
Today, the Trump administration is doing the opposite.

1239
02:17:28,905 --> 02:17:30,427
They're like, let's cast a wide net.

1240
02:17:30,707 --> 02:17:32,068
We get some innocent people, that's fine.

1241
02:17:32,088 --> 02:17:37,293
And we already know about somebody who was shipped off to the prison in El Salvador that they know is innocent.

1242
02:17:37,313 --> 02:17:38,734
And they're saying, we can't do anything about it.

1243
02:17:38,774 --> 02:17:40,656
Innocent persons, they say, we don't care.

1244
02:17:40,896 --> 02:17:42,498
As far as Brown, again, after 9-11,

1245
02:17:44,392 --> 02:17:53,120
You know, people just if you're a person of color, you're possibly an Arab, you're possibly and if you're if you're possibly an Arab, you're possibly a terrorist, therefore will round you up.

1246
02:17:53,261 --> 02:17:58,726
I know when I was living in Brazil that there were Brazilians that were stopped at the airport.

1247
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:05,362
that had to be interrogated just because they thought they could be a terrorist because they kind of look maybe Middle Eastern.

1248
02:18:05,642 --> 02:18:11,884
And I think that trying to figure out where this line is, are they really going after people of color is completely missing the forest for the trees.

1249
02:18:13,165 --> 02:18:18,367
Your federal administration, your government is saying we'd rather lock up innocent people.

1250
02:18:18,967 --> 02:18:24,709
That's the main issue, as well as the racialized dynamics that are on top of that.

1251
02:18:29,875 --> 02:18:30,315
Thank you.

1252
02:18:31,116 --> 02:18:31,957
Any further discussion?

1253
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:36,501
Councillor Callahan.

1254
02:18:37,903 --> 02:18:38,824
Thank you.

1255
02:18:39,925 --> 02:18:52,878
Yeah, I think the most frightening thing to me is that it is very clear that people are being snatched off the street with absolutely no due process at all.

1256
02:18:54,295 --> 02:19:09,847
So this question of someone who it has now come out is really innocent of anything, even being in this country illegally, who has been deported not to his home country, but to a prison in El Salvador that is renowned around the world for torture.

1257
02:19:12,068 --> 02:19:18,693
And this person is not being recalled, even though it has now been made clear that they were not who the government thought that they were.

1258
02:19:20,897 --> 02:19:32,245
Seeing Rumesa snatched off the street in that video was genuinely, should be frightening for everyone.

1259
02:19:33,546 --> 02:19:42,792
And I think we should remember the famous poem from Nazi Germany that says, first they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.

1260
02:19:43,432 --> 02:19:47,334
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist.

1261
02:19:47,894 --> 02:19:51,236
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.

1262
02:19:51,896 --> 02:19:55,558
And then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.

1263
02:19:56,858 --> 02:20:11,505
So anyone who feels safe should really just pause and think about what it means for people to be snatched off the street by people who do not have a warrant and are not declaring who they are,

1264
02:20:13,196 --> 02:20:15,198
with absolutely no due process.

1265
02:20:15,699 --> 02:20:18,883
I think that that does not end well for anyone.

1266
02:20:19,304 --> 02:20:26,413
Anyone here could be mistaken for someone else and shipped off to a gulag.

1267
02:20:28,115 --> 02:20:29,617
So I am very happy

1268
02:20:31,125 --> 02:20:42,433
to be on a city council that is doing everything that we can in this moment to try to protect our residents who are being targeted for a variety of reasons.

1269
02:20:42,833 --> 02:20:45,956
But really, that ends with anyone.

1270
02:20:46,556 --> 02:20:46,836
Thank you.

1271
02:20:50,059 --> 02:20:51,540
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1272
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,021
Any further discussion on this paper?

1273
02:20:57,264 --> 02:20:58,745
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1274
02:21:02,455 --> 02:21:03,095
Councilor Callahan.

1275
02:21:03,576 --> 02:21:03,776
Yes.

1276
02:21:05,117 --> 02:21:05,958
Vice President Collins.

1277
02:21:05,978 --> 02:21:06,778
Yes.

1278
02:21:06,798 --> 02:21:07,659
Councilor Lazaro.

1279
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:08,940
Yes.

1280
02:21:09,981 --> 02:21:10,501
Councilor Lemming.

1281
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:11,442
Yes.

1282
02:21:11,462 --> 02:21:12,062
Councilor Scarpelli.

1283
02:21:12,082 --> 02:21:12,162
Yes.

1284
02:21:13,263 --> 02:21:13,724
Councilor Singh.

1285
02:21:13,744 --> 02:21:13,804
Yes.

1286
02:21:14,384 --> 02:21:14,965
President Paris.

1287
02:21:15,085 --> 02:21:17,366
Yes, I'm confirming the negative motion passes.

1288
02:21:17,386 --> 02:21:23,571
24468 draft charter as returned to Council by Mayor, submitted by Mayor Burrito Longo Kern.

1289
02:21:24,232 --> 02:21:27,835
The draft City Charter proposal as amended by the Mayor and returned to the Council on March 31st, 2025 is attached.

1290
02:21:29,951 --> 02:21:40,580
The fall this fall the approval by the city council at the March 11 2025 regular meeting by a vote of six to zero one absent of a draft charter referred from committee of the whole following the governance committee's review process.

1291
02:21:41,358 --> 02:21:48,086
If approved by the council this draft city charter as amended by the council will be resubmitted to the mayor for consideration for submission to the legislature.

1292
02:21:48,787 --> 02:22:01,281
Subsequently, if the mayor submits the draft city charter to the legislature and the legislature approved said draft prior to the printing and ballots for the November 4 2025 municipal election, the voters of the city of Medford will approve or deny the draft city charter

1293
02:22:01,962 --> 02:22:04,823
on the November 4th, 2025 municipal election ballot.

1294
02:22:04,843 --> 02:22:11,464
I'm not gonna read the whole charter, obviously, and I'm not even gonna read the 160 plus line by line changes.

1295
02:22:13,004 --> 02:22:24,867
The documents are available on the city council portal, but I will open it up to discussion by members of the council on the draft charter returned to the council by the mayor.

1296
02:22:27,768 --> 02:22:29,308
I'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

1297
02:22:33,401 --> 02:22:33,781
Thank you.

1298
02:22:34,762 --> 02:22:38,285
I appreciate, again, all the work that's gone into this.

1299
02:22:39,026 --> 02:22:47,753
Obviously, we've gone through the charter with the fine-tooth comb and the governance committee and committee of the whole.

1300
02:22:49,215 --> 02:22:57,642
We sent our version to the mayor and the mayor made her edits and I have a couple of

1301
02:22:59,557 --> 02:23:04,478
What I think are fairly small amendments I'd like to make to this.

1302
02:23:05,798 --> 02:23:09,919
Version of the charter, and then I would be comfortable voting in favor of it.

1303
02:23:10,879 --> 02:23:13,340
Those amendments are in section 3.

1304
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:20,481
3 subsection a. I would like to add back in the words or ordinance.

1305
02:23:23,256 --> 02:23:25,798
where in the red line version they were removed.

1306
02:23:26,238 --> 02:23:40,189
That is where the city council is able to add, um, is able to appoint members to, um, multiple member committees or commissions, um, by charter.

1307
02:23:40,249 --> 02:23:43,611
It says right now, um, only by charter.

1308
02:23:43,911 --> 02:23:47,414
Uh, I, it used to say or ordinance and that applies to, um,

1309
02:23:50,438 --> 02:23:53,139
that has active applications now.

1310
02:23:53,880 --> 02:24:00,183
And this version of the charter would remove the city council's ability to do that.

1311
02:24:00,363 --> 02:24:03,185
So I would like to add that back in.

1312
02:24:04,285 --> 02:24:05,066
That's one change.

1313
02:24:05,346 --> 02:24:09,528
And second change is in section 2.1 subsection C, the second sentence.

1314
02:24:13,932 --> 02:24:24,523
I would like it to say award counselor shall be a voter in the word from which election is sought, period, and I would like to strike the remainder of that sentence.

1315
02:24:25,404 --> 02:24:26,806
The rest of the sentence says.

1316
02:24:28,286 --> 02:24:39,916
They have to have resided in that word for a year, but there is no mention of having to reside in any word or district or city for a year.

1317
02:24:40,877 --> 02:24:50,485
For any other elected office anywhere else in the charter, including school committee at large, including an at large city counselor, including the mayor.

1318
02:24:51,426 --> 02:24:53,848
Including school committee district, so I.

1319
02:24:56,410 --> 02:25:01,975
I spoke to the mayor about both of these today and she said it was fine.

1320
02:25:02,155 --> 02:25:11,944
So I would like to make these amendments and motion to, I don't know if that would have to be a separate motion.

1321
02:25:13,913 --> 02:25:19,919
to approve, but I guess those two, I would motion for those two amendments first.

1322
02:25:20,299 --> 02:25:24,343
So it would be, I think technically a motion to approve as amended.

1323
02:25:24,683 --> 02:25:25,944
And those are the two amendments.

1324
02:25:27,206 --> 02:25:29,768
And that's my council, Lazaro, is there a second on the motion?

1325
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:34,493
Second by Councilor Sang, reminding that that motion can be further amended.

1326
02:25:35,732 --> 02:25:40,398
I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli and then Councillor Collins and then Councillor Lemming.

1327
02:25:40,999 --> 02:25:41,980
Councillor Scarpelli.

1328
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:44,082
Thank you, Council President.

1329
02:25:44,343 --> 02:25:50,691
I so appreciate everybody in the last few weeks, especially speaking on behalf of listening to our residents.

1330
02:25:51,452 --> 02:25:54,075
We heard so many topics that came up.

1331
02:25:55,137 --> 02:26:04,705
after the initial change of the 5-4, which wasn't what the residents of Medford were asking for.

1332
02:26:06,046 --> 02:26:14,333
As other issues came about, we heard this council speak over and over again, how we should have our community involved.

1333
02:26:14,694 --> 02:26:19,458
We should have the community make sure that we educate, we inform, we listen to our residents.

1334
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:37,660
And we've seen some things I know when I was away, my fellow counselor waited till 11 o'clock to revert back to a vote and zoning that that was readjusted for what the residents of that neighborhood wanted, and they waited till 11 o'clock that was my fear about tonight.

1335
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:45,461
and waiting longer because people find this to be probably one of the most important initiatives.

1336
02:26:45,481 --> 02:26:51,502
And we talked about some very important things tonight, not to belittle anything that was said tonight, because they're very important.

1337
02:26:53,723 --> 02:27:06,945
But this is initiative, and I'll say it again, that was put forth by this council, that this council ran as part of their agendas, that we look at charter review,

1338
02:27:08,158 --> 02:27:16,922
We are on the verge of making a decision and making a vote, as the mayor said, that probably needs a vote tonight unless we have an emergency meeting.

1339
02:27:18,243 --> 02:27:25,106
Because after tonight, if we wait until the last meeting of April, it'll be too late for our state delegates to move this forward.

1340
02:27:26,388 --> 02:27:30,050
Our state delegates that I've talked to have understand.

1341
02:27:30,711 --> 02:27:32,151
They listen to the residents.

1342
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:34,973
They know the residents want an A3 vote.

1343
02:27:35,493 --> 02:27:36,714
I give the mayor a lot of credit.

1344
02:27:36,754 --> 02:27:42,277
I'm the first person to attack the mayor when I think she's not listening to the residents, but she has.

1345
02:27:43,198 --> 02:27:44,298
She's listened to the residents.

1346
02:27:44,379 --> 02:27:53,284
She's listened to the Charter Review Committee that have worked tirelessly to go from corner to corner, neighborhood to neighborhood, home to home, to make sure everybody was heard.

1347
02:27:54,745 --> 02:27:55,265
They've done that.

1348
02:27:58,599 --> 02:28:07,702
They partnered with the Collins Center, the professionals, over 80 years of experience that came back and guided us with what is the best practice for our community.

1349
02:28:10,282 --> 02:28:13,063
We sent something off to the mayor and the mayor came back and said what?

1350
02:28:14,944 --> 02:28:22,366
I will concede and understand that if the council wants the mayor to step down as the chairperson of the school committee,

1351
02:28:23,617 --> 02:28:24,958
That is something she'll support.

1352
02:28:25,058 --> 02:28:32,042
But the 8-3 Ward representation is what our community is screaming for.

1353
02:28:33,423 --> 02:28:45,791
And I remind my colleagues, and I won't read it again because I don't want Zach getting mad at me, their platform that was forwarded by my friends from Our Revolution that read specifically that this is what they ran on.

1354
02:28:46,632 --> 02:28:48,333
This is why they supported my colleagues.

1355
02:28:50,374 --> 02:28:52,876
So we hear over and over again that

1356
02:28:54,262 --> 02:28:57,864
You know, the decisions you make today will affect you in November.

1357
02:28:59,405 --> 02:29:08,050
Well, there are so many things that we've done in the past couple of weeks, last couple of months, that we've tried very hard to make changes here.

1358
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:17,255
But in some of the biggest changes, some of the biggest concerns in this community, there is one common denominator that we've heard.

1359
02:29:18,595 --> 02:29:22,778
No matter what side you're on, why

1360
02:29:24,148 --> 02:29:28,330
are my local elected officials not listening.

1361
02:29:30,671 --> 02:29:53,321
So I hope my colleagues see the olive branch that the mayor has put forth, understand that we are in a very, very tight timeline right now, and we put forth a favorable vote of 7-0 to move the charter forward so our state delegation can vote to put this on the ballot.

1362
02:29:55,790 --> 02:29:56,690
Thank you, Mr. President.

1363
02:29:57,751 --> 02:30:00,871
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1364
02:30:04,933 --> 02:30:06,033
Thank you, President Behrs.

1365
02:30:06,753 --> 02:30:09,914
And I want to start by thanking everybody who's worked so hard in this process.

1366
02:30:10,554 --> 02:30:13,895
Genuinely, thank you so much for your hard work volunteering on behalf of this community.

1367
02:30:16,369 --> 02:30:21,392
This has been an interesting process, and it's been characterized by hard work by many volunteers to bring this forward.

1368
02:30:22,353 --> 02:30:32,939
The CSC's process was long and as expansive as it could be, given the resources they were allocated for a project of this size, scope, and importance.

1369
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:38,523
The council's process, I think, has been good faith, but fast.

1370
02:30:40,127 --> 02:30:46,353
Back in 2024, the council requested to begin the charter review process earlier, earlier than 2025.

1371
02:30:47,894 --> 02:30:50,617
The mayor's office did not indicate that this was something they could.

1372
02:30:52,671 --> 02:30:53,291
compromise on.

1373
02:30:54,052 --> 02:31:01,414
Um so in the past few short months, we've tried to do as thorough and thoughtful of of a review as this project deserves.

1374
02:31:02,274 --> 02:31:07,116
Um I don't think that that's quite a long enough time for something as important as this but we've done our best.

1375
02:31:07,936 --> 02:31:18,480
Uh this is after all as we're all very well aware the city's guiding foundational legal document and I have maintained that it would be inappropriate and irresponsible

1376
02:31:19,223 --> 02:31:32,111
for the council to consider its role as a rubber stamp on this document, no matter how eager we all are to complete this project and get it to the next phase of its journey.

1377
02:31:34,193 --> 02:31:42,498
The past few months of public meetings on the charter have been, in my estimation, largely consumed by one issue, which is council makeup.

1378
02:31:43,135 --> 02:31:46,897
We've had a lot of conversations about council makeup, wards or districts.

1379
02:31:46,937 --> 02:31:49,519
And as everybody knows, I preferred the district model.

1380
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:53,721
Four district counselors plus three at-large was the original proposal.

1381
02:31:53,841 --> 02:32:01,346
And then it was compromised to four district counselors plus five at-large to allow for a bigger council, more total representatives.

1382
02:32:02,967 --> 02:32:05,969
I was pretty dug in, but I've been thinking about it.

1383
02:32:07,350 --> 02:32:09,691
And that is not the hill that I'm going to die on.

1384
02:32:11,643 --> 02:32:23,649
Because in my thinking about this over the past several weeks, if that central kernel is representativeness, whether the council is 5-4 or 8-3 doesn't really get at the heart of the issue.

1385
02:32:25,129 --> 02:32:33,914
I think the most important thing that we could have done or could do for meaningful representativeness, which is a spectrum, is reevaluate our strong mayor system of government.

1386
02:32:34,734 --> 02:32:41,137
Because a more representative city council only goes so far when the mayor, most of the time, holds all of the cards.

1387
02:32:42,727 --> 02:32:49,274
An alternative to a strong mayor system was never given terribly serious consideration in this process.

1388
02:32:50,536 --> 02:32:54,320
I'm not, I do not mean to criticize the Charter Study Committee for this.

1389
02:32:54,400 --> 02:33:00,227
It was a volunteer process with volunteer resources and they made incredible strides given the resources and the time that they were given.

1390
02:33:01,137 --> 02:33:15,709
But this process did not interrogate our current strong mayor system, notwithstanding what I perceive to be genuine community interest in considering other alternatives, including recent specific efforts to renegotiate the balance of power between the city council and the mayor relative to the budgeting process.

1391
02:33:15,729 --> 02:33:17,851
This was brought up in our previous fiscal year.

1392
02:33:18,752 --> 02:33:20,874
And it shows up in lots of different ways.

1393
02:33:21,754 --> 02:33:24,717
Something that I really, I think it's important to surface is that

1394
02:33:26,105 --> 02:33:33,851
On balance, the types of requests that I get from residents most often is essentially asking the city council to do something or fund something.

1395
02:33:34,331 --> 02:33:36,913
And the answer is almost always, we can't.

1396
02:33:37,193 --> 02:33:38,274
That's the mayor's purview.

1397
02:33:39,375 --> 02:33:46,780
All of our major functions, ordinances, zoning, budget review are constrained by the much, much greater jurisdiction of the mayor.

1398
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:55,126
And I think that when residents say they want representativeness, they want representative not just for talk,

1399
02:33:56,315 --> 02:33:57,856
and for exposure, but for action.

1400
02:33:58,216 --> 02:33:59,677
That's meaningful representation.

1401
02:34:00,558 --> 02:34:23,753
What I mean to say, and I'm sorry, it's taken me a bit of a walk to get here, but this is important, and I really wanna make myself clear, is that this process has clarified for me that I believe the interest of the community is for a more genuinely representative system of governance where the executive office has less power, not no power, less power, and is more meaningfully checked by the school committee and the city council.

1402
02:34:24,351 --> 02:34:29,032
In addition to people enjoying more local representation on the school committee and on the city council.

1403
02:34:30,473 --> 02:34:35,134
So, on top of that, the mayor's most recent draft which gave us a week to consider amendments.

1404
02:34:36,654 --> 02:34:45,817
Many of those amendments further expanded mayoral power relative to the power of the Council and some of them were totally benign, but there are a number that I found very problematic and.

1405
02:34:46,781 --> 02:34:49,283
Frankly, I think that's the opposite of the direction that we should be going in.

1406
02:34:50,544 --> 02:34:56,908
I'm not saying we should scrap this and build a strong council or city manager draft charter, though we could do that with an elected charter commission.

1407
02:34:56,928 --> 02:34:57,769
I don't think that we should.

1408
02:34:58,309 --> 02:34:58,669
We could.

1409
02:34:58,689 --> 02:35:00,090
That's not what I'm advancing.

1410
02:35:01,791 --> 02:35:09,637
But I, as one councilor, I'm going to need to see some additional amendments that at least start to move this issue of power balance in the right direction.

1411
02:35:10,437 --> 02:35:14,420
and start to engage with that topic of the balance of power between mayor, council, school committee.

1412
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:21,464
I will support the amendments to protect and preserve the city council's right to make appointments to commissions unless otherwise specified.

1413
02:35:21,484 --> 02:35:33,071
I support the proposed amendment to remove the mayor's residency requirement for ward counselors, which as the councilor stated, places a burden on ward counselors greater than other electeds.

1414
02:35:35,272 --> 02:35:53,576
I would also like to make a motion to amend section 9-4B to amend the number of appointees allocated to future charter study committees by the mayor, city council, and school committee.

1415
02:35:53,596 --> 02:36:00,817
To change that language to this review shall be made by a special committee to be composed of three appointees of the mayor,

1416
02:36:01,718 --> 02:36:07,022
three appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee.

1417
02:36:07,042 --> 02:36:15,347
That's changing four mayor, three city council, two school committee, to three mayor, three city council, and three school committee.

1418
02:36:17,549 --> 02:36:20,591
And I would also like to make a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee.

1419
02:36:20,931 --> 02:36:26,135
That would be amendments to section 4-1, beginning with striking the last sentence of section 4-1A.

1420
02:36:26,155 --> 02:36:26,855
These amendments

1421
02:36:30,188 --> 02:36:44,219
In my one councilor's opinion, skip over I think the relatively smaller issue of four, three, or sorry, five to four versus eight to three, and more meaningly begin to engage with the city's balance of power.

1422
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:52,185
Those amendments would leave me feeling comfortable supporting this draft, including eight ward councilors and three at-large councilors.

1423
02:36:53,446 --> 02:36:56,889
And again, I want to acknowledge that there's impatience to get this done.

1424
02:36:58,663 --> 02:37:18,593
I hope that in my willingness to make uncomfortable motions, people and my fellow counselors might consider that this stems from a desire, that this stems not from an enjoyment of making uncomfortable and perhaps unpopular motions, but rather from a sincere desire to get this as right as possible because it's important.

1425
02:37:19,553 --> 02:37:27,017
I changed my mind on five and four and eight and three, and I've changed my mind on some other things too.

1426
02:37:28,494 --> 02:37:32,895
And I think it's my responsibility to take the votes that I think will be best for this community.

1427
02:37:33,775 --> 02:37:38,516
Our next charter needs to advance the cause of improving the balance of power between the mayor and the city council and the school committee.

1428
02:37:38,537 --> 02:37:40,517
And I think this would move the ball forward.

1429
02:37:41,057 --> 02:37:50,700
If it takes a special meeting next week to discuss this and then move this forward expeditiously, staying in April, that is fine with me.

1430
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:56,601
And we are not the only body that has affected the timeline

1431
02:37:57,921 --> 02:37:58,902
of this draft project.

1432
02:38:01,004 --> 02:38:02,005
So those are my two motions.

1433
02:38:02,025 --> 02:38:02,465
Thank you.

1434
02:38:03,566 --> 02:38:03,967
Thank you.

1435
02:38:03,987 --> 02:38:05,368
So those are motions to amend.

1436
02:38:05,448 --> 02:38:08,571
The main motion by Council is our, which is seconded by Councilor Sang.

1437
02:38:12,043 --> 02:38:17,004
If Councilor Zahra can accept the amendments or there can be votes to include them.

1438
02:38:18,044 --> 02:38:19,244
We do have more discussion.

1439
02:38:21,145 --> 02:38:28,146
So if there are other proposed, let's see if there are other proposed amendments to the motion and then we can vote on them at the end.

1440
02:38:28,206 --> 02:38:29,246
I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

1441
02:38:36,528 --> 02:38:36,808
Thank you.

1442
02:38:41,813 --> 02:38:45,235
I'll second Councilor Collins motion if if it needs a second.

1443
02:38:48,117 --> 02:39:05,607
So, I did write, I did, I wrote up a speech here or like just like more like listing out my thoughts on this whole process because I was, again, I was originally a member of the of the Charter Study Committee and

1444
02:39:07,541 --> 02:39:12,163
When I started my campaign for city council, I was asked to step down.

1445
02:39:13,003 --> 02:39:15,425
And you could read it.

1446
02:39:15,685 --> 02:39:17,365
You could read it on my blog.

1447
02:39:17,405 --> 02:39:32,552
I believe Mr. Gianvina here quoted my own blog at me during public comment when I sort of expressed blank check support for the work of the Charter Study Committee.

1448
02:39:35,913 --> 02:39:55,345
And I'm going to talk about that a little bit because I feel like this is probably the forum to have a little bit of discussion about this process as a whole and sort of how I think my opinions about how things have played out.

1449
02:39:55,745 --> 02:40:00,147
So two years ago, I was a member of the Medford Charter Review Coalition.

1450
02:40:01,533 --> 02:40:06,697
This was an advocacy group that lobbied city council to pass a petition for a home rule charter.

1451
02:40:08,018 --> 02:40:21,969
At the time, they were lobbying city council to pass this petition so that Medford could elect a charter review commission that would be elected directly by voters.

1452
02:40:22,569 --> 02:40:28,814
And at the time, city council had four members that were in favor of charter review and three that were strongly against.

1453
02:40:28,834 --> 02:40:30,395
And the petition was rejected.

1454
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:48,028
And then around the time that I joined the Medford Charter Review Coalition subsequently tried to collect the requisite signatures to initiate a homeroom petition process directly, building off of the many signatures that were collected by former school committee member Michael Ruggiero.

1455
02:40:49,368 --> 02:40:50,849
But we failed to collect those signatures.

1456
02:40:51,009 --> 02:40:52,530
And then after that,

1457
02:40:54,025 --> 02:40:58,267
the mayor then formed the 11-member Charter Study Committee.

1458
02:40:58,587 --> 02:41:01,028
And this is a group of Medford residents that the mayor appointed.

1459
02:41:01,048 --> 02:41:03,509
They're appointed at her discretion.

1460
02:41:03,529 --> 02:41:13,014
They didn't have, they weren't confirmed by city council, even though it was known throughout the process that council was the body that would eventually have to vote on the charter draft.

1461
02:41:13,054 --> 02:41:14,774
Now, I know, I understand why

1462
02:41:16,859 --> 02:41:25,696
like, if I had to guess, I'd say that the reason that they weren't confirmed by Council explicitly was because, again, at the time, about

1463
02:41:26,918 --> 02:41:32,821
almost half of the council was very opposed to the very idea of charter review.

1464
02:41:32,861 --> 02:41:34,903
But we had the 11-member study committee.

1465
02:41:34,983 --> 02:41:37,304
I was one of the original members of the charter study committee.

1466
02:41:37,324 --> 02:41:47,950
And I think the mayor's intent when forming this committee, which she has expressed more privately than others, was to have sort of an ideological balance, mixing progressives and conservatives.

1467
02:41:47,990 --> 02:41:52,533
About 50-50 conservatives are outnumbered in Medford.

1468
02:41:52,573 --> 02:41:56,135
But what she has said was that the idea was to have it

1469
02:41:56,475 --> 02:41:58,776
have an ideological balance when composing the committee.

1470
02:41:59,616 --> 02:42:02,658
I wasn't aware of that at the time when I was put on the COC.

1471
02:42:02,698 --> 02:42:11,321
I was, I believe it was four members of the Charter Review Coalition that were appointed there and other community members and membership did circulate over time.

1472
02:42:11,361 --> 02:42:12,242
So I stepped down.

1473
02:42:12,982 --> 02:42:15,063
The other co-chair at the time stepped down.

1474
02:42:15,143 --> 02:42:16,323
Other people have had to step down.

1475
02:42:16,403 --> 02:42:17,264
Others were appointed to it.

1476
02:42:17,304 --> 02:42:18,504
So the composition has changed.

1477
02:42:20,085 --> 02:42:22,586
When I announced my campaign for city council, I was asked

1478
02:42:23,772 --> 02:42:31,096
by the mayor, by others to step down from the Charter Study Committee because I was told involvement from the city council would be a conflict of interest.

1479
02:42:32,076 --> 02:42:39,480
I disagreed with this, but when somebody that appointed you to a committee asks you to step down, you do it.

1480
02:42:40,641 --> 02:42:43,442
I didn't want to create any controversy early on my campaign.

1481
02:42:44,283 --> 02:42:48,124
And during my campaign, I expressed full support for the work of the Charter Study Committee.

1482
02:42:50,027 --> 02:42:55,248
I think that a lot of that was to sort of bolster the public standing of the committee.

1483
02:42:55,288 --> 02:43:03,930
I hadn't still had good relationships with people, and I had faith in the work that they do.

1484
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:07,971
And I really want to see a new charter pass.

1485
02:43:08,551 --> 02:43:17,093
And again, when you have half the council hostile to the idea of charter review, it's really important to try to bolster up the committee that really wants it to pass.

1486
02:43:22,485 --> 02:43:39,955
Hearing some of the feedback from the committee, like in this seat, on their justifications for some of the aspects of city council and school committee composition, I don't know if I've been always satisfied with what's been presented.

1487
02:43:40,015 --> 02:43:45,698
I've been very pleased with most of the other work there, but I also thought that, like,

1488
02:43:46,669 --> 02:43:53,694
the more drama that we have surrounding the study committee, which is not a negatively affect the chances of charter you to pass the ballot.

1489
02:43:55,055 --> 02:44:02,200
I'm going to talk a bit about conflicts of interest here, which was something that has come up in public comment so in changing a document as important as a charter.

1490
02:44:02,978 --> 02:44:05,840
conflicts of interest are going to be part of it.

1491
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:20,031
So the draft of the charter before us, the one that the mayor just passed back to us has very minor edits that substantially put more power, more in favor of the mayor.

1492
02:44:20,811 --> 02:44:49,792
um and takes it away from city council and balance of powers is important here and I think and I think it's and even the original draft that was handed to us had had small edits like the charter the periodic charter review committee having over half of those appointees be be mayoral appointees I think that having this is natural because you know you did have a study committee that was appointed with uh without council input I think that these conflicts uh are these sort of conflicts of interest with elected officials and

1493
02:44:50,632 --> 02:44:57,799
groups that they appoint are why the state outlines a process for the Home Rule Commission of nine members to be elected directly.

1494
02:44:57,819 --> 02:45:03,444
I mean, this is the cleanest way to not have elected officials involved in making decisions surrounding their own process.

1495
02:45:04,766 --> 02:45:12,013
Again, Medford tried to do this twice and failed because initiating the Home Rule Charter position is

1496
02:45:13,009 --> 02:45:14,270
very difficult in itself.

1497
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:20,653
You need to collect something like around 6,000 signatures, I think, and that's just hard to do.

1498
02:45:21,753 --> 02:45:30,558
And when this cannot be done, approval of the charter by many groups of elected officials is the second best option, because elected officials, while they are

1499
02:45:31,417 --> 02:45:37,881
making decisions about their own positions are at least chosen by the voters and so representative of the city at a whole.

1500
02:45:37,941 --> 02:45:52,650
Our positions are more or less transparent to the city and we groups of elected officials have a pretty good understanding of city matters and ordinances that most members of the public aren't really as privy to.

1501
02:45:53,310 --> 02:46:07,523
This is why changes to the Constitution of the United States require both congressional approval and ratification from state legislatures, you need many groups of people elected by the voters of the United States to approve that the President cannot himself just change the Constitution.

1502
02:46:08,704 --> 02:46:12,987
With that in mind, and this is a part where I've really done my work in the past couple of weeks.

1503
02:46:14,927 --> 02:46:21,289
And again, I understand the political context at the time the formation the formation of the charter study committee was pretty unusual.

1504
02:46:22,849 --> 02:46:29,592
Most other municipalities have they varied in their exact methods for appointing a similar study committee or a charter review committee.

1505
02:46:31,112 --> 02:46:35,055
It's almost universal that city council or the equivalent body is involved in the process.

1506
02:46:35,095 --> 02:46:36,456
School committees often are as well.

1507
02:46:36,916 --> 02:46:41,919
Many cities have had counselors and school community members on their charter review committees.

1508
02:46:42,419 --> 02:46:48,923
There are a few home rule charters where elected officials are explicitly banned from serving on this body.

1509
02:46:48,963 --> 02:46:59,110
But in those cases, it's inevitably city council who appoints members of the review body because it is city council which will eventually have to approve that draft.

1510
02:46:59,811 --> 02:47:15,020
Again, I know why the mayor made the decision to not have a CSC confirmed by this council, nearly half of them were hostile at the time the very idea of charter abuse some understanding of the particular decisions made a particular times, and I think that the Charter Study Committee has worked extremely hard.

1511
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:18,021
in in their job.

1512
02:47:18,782 --> 02:47:34,876
I think that I personally think that especially after the 2024 elections when uh most like I think every member every member of the council right now is favorable to the idea of charter review um I think that

1513
02:47:35,778 --> 02:47:39,343
we should have been more involved in the drafting of the process, again, in other municipalities.

1514
02:47:41,225 --> 02:47:45,311
Sometimes counselors are even on the Charter Study Committee itself.

1515
02:47:46,172 --> 02:47:47,574
That, yeah.

1516
02:47:52,872 --> 02:48:05,474
The mayor, so the mayor in the current draft nixed the council's proposal to change 38254, but the reason that I just seconded Councilor Collins' motion is that all along they decided to keep the mayor on the school committee.

1517
02:48:06,254 --> 02:48:13,936
And this is something that bugs me because the charter study committee surveys showed that the public strongly disagreed with this choice.

1518
02:48:15,636 --> 02:48:21,157
I don't think that this exactly would have been a decision if the committee had been elected directly by voters.

1519
02:48:22,348 --> 02:48:29,530
Um, again, because it is clearly, according to their own surveys, the most popular decision have the mayor removed from the CSC entirely.

1520
02:48:31,991 --> 02:48:36,632
But it was a committee that was appointed by the mayor, so it does make sense with that in mind.

1521
02:48:37,252 --> 02:48:51,636
Um, I also think that the exclusion of council would have been more acceptable to me if the edits that we had made and approved six to zero

1522
02:48:52,488 --> 02:48:54,329
would have been accepted.

1523
02:48:56,110 --> 02:49:07,675
And with the fact that we only had three months to do this in mind, whereas the Mayor and Charter Study Committee had two years to do this.

1524
02:49:08,556 --> 02:49:17,220
But I do disagree with this process that we are given a new draft of the charter

1525
02:49:18,318 --> 02:49:44,297
one which we've made very relatively like I mean substantial but still like relatively minimal edits to with a very limited timeline and we're given it one week before uh we're supposed to approve it via press release and I only received red line edits to act to know which amendments actually were made uh when I saw the council agenda so

1526
02:49:45,838 --> 02:49:48,699
I'm aware of the timeline that we're on.

1527
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:53,481
I would also really like to see it get on the ballot this November.

1528
02:49:53,501 --> 02:49:56,822
So here's the thing.

1529
02:50:12,273 --> 02:50:26,539
I would be willing to go, I think that when this council voted on the draft of the charter that we voted on six to zero, we were voting for what we believed is the best policy and a policy that we believe would also be accepted by the mayor.

1530
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:38,865
It does bug me that in the only part of the process where another elected body did make edits, we have other groups that are trying to just completely undo those edits.

1531
02:50:39,861 --> 02:50:42,502
on this very limited timeline via press release.

1532
02:50:43,522 --> 02:50:50,504
So, I would be more comfortable voting on a draft of the charter.

1533
02:50:50,544 --> 02:51:05,887
I think that the amendments that were given that were given by Councilor Lazaro and were also mentioned by Councilor Collins do satisfy some of the concerns that I had previously with the red line that's made by the mayor.

1534
02:51:05,907 --> 02:51:08,088
I would be willing to support

1535
02:51:09,088 --> 02:51:15,190
3-8 if the mayor is also removed from the school committee because I think that shows some consistency.

1536
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:31,835
Again, that's what the public clearly said that they wanted and if we're going to go with policies that we think are the most popular with the voters, then I think that I see some head shaking there.

1537
02:51:32,895 --> 02:51:38,217
It was in their survey that people said they wanted to remove the mayor from the school committee, correct?

1538
02:51:40,648 --> 02:51:41,548
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
02:51:41,728 --> 02:51:42,229
Sorry, sorry.

1540
02:51:42,989 --> 02:51:43,829
I just, it is.

1541
02:51:43,949 --> 02:51:54,613
It was 43% removed from the school committee, 35% stay on the school committee, and 15% don't know.

1542
02:51:56,073 --> 02:52:04,176
So I think it does show some consistency in going with the most popular decisions if we went with that.

1543
02:52:04,256 --> 02:52:07,317
So again, as you can see, I am

1544
02:52:09,621 --> 02:52:16,284
I do commend the Charter Study Committee for all the work that they've put into this.

1545
02:52:16,424 --> 02:52:23,428
Obviously, from what you can hear, I do have some concerns with the way the process went down.

1546
02:52:24,969 --> 02:52:30,291
And the timeline issue is something that I'm dissatisfied with.

1547
02:52:31,132 --> 02:52:31,392
Thank you.

1548
02:52:32,917 --> 02:52:33,317
Thank you.

1549
02:52:33,357 --> 02:52:56,292
Before I go to Councilor Sagan, Councilor Callahan, I will note Councilor Sagan and I did try to work with the mayor to start the council part of the process earlier and eventually through the initial negotiations, we were asked to wait for the study committee to issue its final report before we began to take up consideration of any of this.

1550
02:52:57,213 --> 02:53:02,236
We would have started about three to six months earlier if we had not made that decision.

1551
02:53:08,797 --> 02:53:09,217
Thank you.

1552
02:53:11,299 --> 02:53:18,126
I've honestly had a difficult time thinking about how to vote tonight what to do tonight.

1553
02:53:19,588 --> 02:53:25,754
Because, at the end of the day I think it's, it is important for our city to get a new charter.

1554
02:53:28,147 --> 02:53:33,732
Also, at the end of the day, I think that this charter presents something that is better than the status quo.

1555
02:53:34,953 --> 02:53:43,719
And I've been reminded by residents over the last few weeks to not let perfect be the enemy of good.

1556
02:53:45,601 --> 02:53:53,327
But I think the added difficulty to this part is that I also do worry about this precluding something better.

1557
02:53:54,490 --> 02:53:55,491
in the future.

1558
02:53:56,151 --> 02:54:03,437
I think oftentimes we see good enough as just being good and we reject better.

1559
02:54:03,457 --> 02:54:06,359
And I think, you know, that weighs on my head.

1560
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:16,687
But I think, you know, what my mind has gone to more in the last week has been

1561
02:54:17,895 --> 02:54:23,656
edits that the mayor's made that didn't make it to the press release that very much don't count as a compromise.

1562
02:54:24,776 --> 02:54:38,699
And that, you know, against the platform I was elected on and against the feed, a lot of feedback from the community shift power to the mayor's office and away from the city council, even compared to the status quo.

1563
02:54:40,159 --> 02:54:42,760
And that would go against

1564
02:54:44,389 --> 02:54:46,550
that would go against the platform I ran on.

1565
02:54:46,650 --> 02:54:55,093
And I'm grateful that Councilor Zaro has introduced her amendments and communicated with the mayor about that and gotten to a point of understanding.

1566
02:54:56,453 --> 02:55:05,436
And I would support those motions, and which is why I also seconded her motion too.

1567
02:55:06,476 --> 02:55:08,317
In particular, I think it's important

1568
02:55:10,179 --> 02:55:23,409
to restore the words by ordinance 23-3A, because not having the section would remove the power of the council to have appointments to committees by ordinance, which is a power that we currently have.

1569
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:25,371
We see it, I believe, on the Water and Sewer Commission.

1570
02:55:26,212 --> 02:55:30,035
The Human Rights Commission ordinance that we were talking about includes that as well.

1571
02:55:30,515 --> 02:55:33,598
I don't see that as a huge, you know,

1572
02:55:34,418 --> 02:55:39,066
I don't see that as a major problem for the mayor to accept.

1573
02:55:39,366 --> 02:55:48,981
And it's something that if we don't make that amendment, it would shift power away from, it would concentrate power in the office of the executive.

1574
02:55:50,805 --> 02:56:10,140
I think Councillor Collins has called a motion to amend the Charter, the Article 9-4B to have the Charter Review Commission be composed of three appointees of the Mayor, the City Council, the School Committee is just an inherently fair

1575
02:56:10,921 --> 02:56:12,482
amendments so it support that.

1576
02:56:13,523 --> 02:56:26,334
And I think that really, really underscores that the way that this process was done this time inherently creates adversarial relationships between people who just want the best for their city and might not see the same.

1577
02:56:28,529 --> 02:56:35,791
You know, in my opinion, the City Council, we fought for what we thought was the best policy for our city.

1578
02:56:36,371 --> 02:56:46,093
I really appreciate a lot of the, you know, a lot of the support I've gotten over the last few weeks for speaking out, even from residents who don't necessarily agree with me.

1579
02:56:47,593 --> 02:56:52,514
And you know what, I accept the 8-3 plan.

1580
02:56:53,815 --> 02:56:54,815
I don't think it's perfect.

1581
02:56:55,515 --> 02:57:00,114
But I accept it because I see that that is the way to move this forward.

1582
02:57:00,858 --> 02:57:25,573
But at the same time, what I think Councilor Collins's, Vice President Collins's amendment does help us with is making sure that next time that process is more collaborative, that people feel like they're on an even footing, that we get a lot of this rich conversation that we've had over the last few months in the next Charter Review Committee's iteration.

1583
02:57:27,123 --> 02:57:48,748
I also think that process-wise, this has been slightly frustrating just from a procedural standpoint, not because of things that members of the committee have done, but from a procedural standpoint, just because I've been, quote, asked, I've been asked to, quote, rubber stamp the thing, to rush it through committee.

1584
02:57:48,989 --> 02:57:53,730
I've been asked to not have counsel scrutinize it, but that legally is our job.

1585
02:57:55,210 --> 02:58:05,654
As enforcers of the charter in the future, we need to have a say in that perspective as well, even if we don't win out.

1586
02:58:06,494 --> 02:58:09,275
And I think that goes to the inherent nature of the process.

1587
02:58:11,036 --> 02:58:21,119
I think another frustration I've had is that over the last week, I floated many different compromise models to the mayor.

1588
02:58:25,179 --> 02:58:29,803
Compromises that include not going to 4-5.

1589
02:58:30,363 --> 02:58:33,685
And I think compromises that gave up a lot of what I was arguing for.

1590
02:58:33,705 --> 02:58:41,771
And a lot of these compromises were very basic, doing things in a more democratic way, even just commissioning a poll.

1591
02:58:42,912 --> 02:58:43,973
All of that was rejected.

1592
02:58:45,334 --> 02:58:49,317
And there was a fear of how things would go down that way.

1593
02:58:51,683 --> 02:58:59,726
With regards to the motion to take the mayor off of the school committee, I'm still making my mind up on it.

1594
02:59:00,487 --> 02:59:15,173
I am compelled by the point that if we're doing things because are the people who answered the survey expressed their intentions one way, we should be consistent in how we apply that principle.

1595
02:59:16,919 --> 02:59:24,664
Frankly, I've also just gotten a lot of emails, a lot of messages from people in the last few days, asking us to revisit that.

1596
02:59:26,225 --> 02:59:40,154
And I do think it speaks to the Mayor's, or to the initial point that we were making, or the Councillors were making, that ultimately, while representation is important, that representation is

1597
02:59:41,762 --> 02:59:45,984
practically useless when the balance of power is not right.

1598
02:59:46,744 --> 02:59:49,485
And I think there's a real conversation to be had there.

1599
02:59:49,745 --> 02:59:54,787
I think I still feel of, I can see the merits of both arguments, to be quite honest with you all.

1600
02:59:56,528 --> 03:00:01,930
And I also hear the argument that urgency is important.

1601
03:00:03,980 --> 03:00:06,621
And I have to weigh that debate as well.

1602
03:00:06,801 --> 03:00:22,726
So urgency of getting this through versus making sure that even if the product that we get out of this council is something that I wouldn't have written myself, that it's sound enough to function.

1603
03:00:23,546 --> 03:00:29,068
And just to make sure that we have all the parts in place for this to work well.

1604
03:00:31,074 --> 03:00:33,615
So that's, yeah, I just want to be transparent about how I'm thinking.

1605
03:00:35,617 --> 03:00:36,577
It is my intention.

1606
03:00:38,657 --> 03:01:03,269
in my you know, my my intention to do in my powers what we can do to move this charter along but I also want to make sure that because this charter forms the foundation of our city's laws and we'll do so for at least 10 years that we do it right as well and even if you know, the bigger ambitious ideas that I had don't make it in.

1607
03:01:03,309 --> 03:01:04,730
I want to make sure that the

1608
03:01:08,448 --> 03:01:18,274
To that point, I would want, there are two smaller technical amendments that I think are important to make.

1609
03:01:18,794 --> 03:01:31,681
The first one being in article 8-2 to revert from city clerk back to the board of election commissioners because the city clerk's office doesn't have access to the voter rolls to certify the petitions.

1610
03:01:32,202 --> 03:01:34,543
So if we say city clerk, it just won't.

1611
03:01:35,450 --> 03:01:36,512
the article won't work.

1612
03:01:36,833 --> 03:01:40,480
So that's just a technical thing that we did switch back.

1613
03:01:42,170 --> 03:01:53,795
The other idea I'd want to float with the council is in part E, to revert back to a standard of 12%, not revert back, to revert to a standard of 12%.

1614
03:01:53,835 --> 03:01:55,276
This is 8-2-E.

1615
03:01:55,296 --> 03:01:56,256
8-2-E, yeah.

1616
03:01:56,276 --> 03:01:57,477
Thank you.

1617
03:01:57,537 --> 03:02:08,582
Just to align this with the citizen repeal referendum procedures, I think it can be really confusing to have different numbers and different bars for very similar things.

1618
03:02:11,064 --> 03:02:22,594
I know in committee we offered 15%, the mayor came back with 10%, 12% is a number that the Charter Study Committee came up with in the first place and seems like a fair compromise to me.

1619
03:02:28,999 --> 03:02:29,860
All good, Councilor Sang?

1620
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:30,340
Yes.

1621
03:02:30,681 --> 03:02:31,481
Councilor Callahan.

1622
03:02:32,642 --> 03:02:32,923
Thank you.

1623
03:02:34,204 --> 03:02:35,565
I apologize for not being there in person.

1624
03:02:35,645 --> 03:02:37,386
I am sick and I did not want to get anyone all sick.

1625
03:02:40,392 --> 03:02:45,397
I want to encourage anyone who was not at our last meeting to read my blog post.

1626
03:02:45,637 --> 03:03:01,111
I have been interested in the nitty-gritty details of how democracies work, including different voting systems and wards versus districts versus at large and all that stuff for a long, long time.

1627
03:03:02,913 --> 03:03:07,214
So if you want to know my full thoughts, that's on my blog at annakalahan.com.

1628
03:03:08,114 --> 03:03:28,960
The short story is that both nationally and internationally, people who study democracy and democratic systems all are pretty much in consensus that single seat first past the post districts, which is what ward or district seats are, are known to be one of the worst at appropriately representing people's political views.

1629
03:03:31,248 --> 03:03:33,228
Now, I want to mention that.

1630
03:03:34,509 --> 03:03:50,873
So I mean, I've been for 30 years, probably a person who believes that we that, you know, we're in a hybrid system, but one that is balanced, right, that does not have too many water district seats, and does not have too many at large seats.

1631
03:03:53,649 --> 03:03:58,970
I know the Charter Study Committee did do a survey, and a lot of people are talking about, you know, what came out of the survey.

1632
03:03:58,990 --> 03:04:04,312
I want to remind us that there were 663 responses to that survey.

1633
03:04:04,812 --> 03:04:13,654
So, you know, I really am happy that they did a survey, and I know how hard they worked to get those responses.

1634
03:04:15,658 --> 03:04:28,084
I will also comment that there never was a question asking how large the wards or district should be, whether we should have districts the same size as Somerville, which would be 4 or wards, which would be 8.

1635
03:04:28,124 --> 03:04:28,224
So.

1636
03:04:30,785 --> 03:04:46,369
I'm unconvinced that the community, from that particular survey that we can read out of that survey, that what everybody who answered those questions is that they wanted to have eight wards rather than districts the same size as other cities near us.

1637
03:04:47,189 --> 03:04:54,370
I will say one thing that we do know is that Medford voted strongly in favor of ranked choice voting in a statewide vote.

1638
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:57,471
And I think that over 10,000 people voted in that election.

1639
03:04:58,955 --> 03:05:05,957
So if we want to know what Medford actually thinks with confidence, we know that Medford wants rank-choice voting.

1640
03:05:06,477 --> 03:05:20,020
And my concern is that by passing this, we are locking ourselves into a charter that won't allow us to have rank-choice voting for these single-seat first-past-the-post districts.

1641
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:24,641
So whether it's wards or districts, we will not be able to have rank-choice voting.

1642
03:05:24,941 --> 03:05:28,862
If we had rank-choice voting, I would be happy to have eight and three.

1643
03:05:30,063 --> 03:05:39,071
But the more districts that you have compared to at large, right, the greater percentage of awards you have, the more it is a problem when you have this first-past-the-post single-seat district.

1644
03:05:39,591 --> 03:05:49,900
And when I say locking in, my understanding is, and I really hope that we can get a definitive answer to this, that if we pass this charter, that we will not be able to get a home rule charter for decades.

1645
03:05:52,444 --> 03:05:55,026
So I would like two things.

1646
03:05:55,166 --> 03:06:11,579
I would like, number one, if anyone among the city council can answer the question of who do we need to ask to get a definitive answer about whether passing this charter is locking us out of having a rank choice voting

1647
03:06:14,284 --> 03:06:21,150
a home rule charter that allows for ranked choice voting within the next 10, 20, 30 years.

1648
03:06:21,490 --> 03:06:25,574
I want to know who we can ask to definitively answer that question.

1649
03:06:25,994 --> 03:06:35,964
And then I would consider all of these amendments and things as long as we have one more week to work on this, as Vice President Collins suggested.

1650
03:06:36,885 --> 03:06:37,105
Thank you.

1651
03:06:39,597 --> 03:06:44,979
Councilor Callahan is that a motion to amend the main motion to refer this to committee of the whole.

1652
03:06:46,820 --> 03:06:47,080
Yes.

1653
03:06:47,100 --> 03:06:56,484
Okay.

1654
03:06:56,504 --> 03:07:01,586
And your other question is, who can give a definitive answer on what powers the.

1655
03:07:02,977 --> 03:07:23,809
charter review committees established under the special act charter would have would they be home rule charter powers or just special act charter powers and it looks like we have anthony wilson from the collins center who's raised a hand who may have the answer to that question amazing i will unmute anthony anthony thanks for being here

1656
03:07:27,286 --> 03:07:28,547
Thank thank you for having me.

1657
03:07:29,547 --> 03:07:31,008
Yes, Anthony Wilson with the call center.

1658
03:07:31,048 --> 03:07:41,575
I've worked with the, the committee, the mayor and members of this body as you sort of work through different permutations of this of this document with regard to the question about.

1659
03:07:43,456 --> 03:07:46,857
I think the phrase was sort of locked in for several decades.

1660
03:07:47,297 --> 03:07:48,677
So the short answer is no.

1661
03:07:49,517 --> 03:08:12,342
In theory, if the body passed the document, assuming this was passed and then it was adopted at the legislature and came back and was ratified by the voters, the next year, the city of Medford could send up another special act to make these modifications to the election to address the concerns around

1662
03:08:13,762 --> 03:08:15,243
first past the post-voting system.

1663
03:08:15,644 --> 03:08:21,708
So the short answer is no, you're not locked in for decades if this is adopted.

1664
03:08:22,128 --> 03:08:28,412
The charter that's before you does have provisions for a review every 10 years.

1665
03:08:28,612 --> 03:08:32,234
And I think the first one is five years out from the adoption date.

1666
03:08:33,155 --> 03:08:39,119
But those reviews do not preclude amendments to the charter before those designated times.

1667
03:08:40,476 --> 03:08:44,839
I don't want to speak for Councilor Callahan and Councilor Callahan if I get your question wrong please let me know.

1668
03:08:45,499 --> 03:08:56,546
Anthony, I think the question Councilor Callahan is asking is, is the Charter Review Committee established under the Special Act Charter empowered to

1669
03:08:58,861 --> 03:09:20,894
act as a home rule charter committee in the future, or would it only act as a special act charter committee, and therefore, if we wanted to do rank choice voting, would that have to be submitted to the legislature for their approval in a future amendment by the Charter Review Committee established under this charter, you know, the first one being five years and then 10 years after that.

1670
03:09:21,714 --> 03:09:25,116
Councilor Callahan, did I get your, is that the question you're asking?

1671
03:09:25,862 --> 03:09:31,407
No, I believe Anthony Wilson did answer my question, but I am interested in the answer, excuse me, to that question as well.

1672
03:09:31,448 --> 03:09:31,748
Thank you.

1673
03:09:32,128 --> 03:09:34,931
OK, well, then that's just my question and I'm asking it.

1674
03:09:38,154 --> 03:09:38,755
Yes, so.

1675
03:09:40,937 --> 03:09:46,162
Under the under the current charter, you'd have to submit a special act to make a modification to change it.

1676
03:09:47,678 --> 03:09:47,978
Okay.

1677
03:09:48,018 --> 03:09:53,699
So the charter review committee created under this would be another special act charter review committee.

1678
03:09:54,259 --> 03:09:56,520
And so it wouldn't be a home rule charter committee.

1679
03:09:58,080 --> 03:09:58,280
Yeah.

1680
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:00,481
I mean, there's some, there's some sort of nuances here.

1681
03:10:01,001 --> 03:10:05,302
If the question is purely around modifying elections, then yes, it would have to be a special act.

1682
03:10:05,322 --> 03:10:05,782
That's correct.

1683
03:10:06,662 --> 03:10:06,942
Okay.

1684
03:10:07,722 --> 03:10:12,063
And, and when you say, you know, basically what you're,

1685
03:10:14,048 --> 03:10:22,570
we'd have to assume if we wanted to change to ranked choice voting that the legislature would approve such an amendment, that the mayor would set it up and that the legislature would approve it if the council were to put it forward.

1686
03:10:24,370 --> 03:10:25,570
Correct, correct.

1687
03:10:25,850 --> 03:10:26,110
Okay.

1688
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:39,633
And, but you're also saying that if say in the future, they wanted to, their charter review wanted to happen under a home rule committee, that the signature collection process would still be a valid way to do that.

1689
03:10:41,071 --> 03:10:44,272
For each term for the creation of each of a charter commission.

1690
03:10:44,412 --> 03:10:47,153
Yes, you'd still have access to that provision under state law.

1691
03:10:47,333 --> 03:10:47,653
Correct.

1692
03:10:48,593 --> 03:10:49,174
Thank you.

1693
03:10:49,654 --> 03:10:55,076
Citizens gathering signatures and then having an election for a charter commission that route would still be available.

1694
03:10:56,016 --> 03:10:56,216
Great.

1695
03:10:56,596 --> 03:10:56,836
Thank you.

1696
03:10:56,856 --> 03:11:00,017
And that would be a home rule charter commission versus a special act charter commission.

1697
03:11:01,878 --> 03:11:02,038
Well,

1698
03:11:03,308 --> 03:11:31,806
uh... sort of and i'm sorry for sort of stumbling it i think the short answer sort of no like at home rule and i guess when i hear it it's sort of the community adopting something that it doesn't need the legislature to sort of adopt which in one case can be the charter commission but there are certain changes you can make to even this charter uh... that you wouldn't need the legislature to review uh... i'm just saying that elections would not be part of that group it's a it's a

1699
03:11:32,666 --> 03:11:55,414
it's sort of smaller more uh ministerial changes that you could make that you wouldn't need um uh the legislature to review so it's as with sort of everything in this area it's a it's a it's a yes and got it composition and mode of election would require legislative approval correct got it thank you councillor lemming

1700
03:11:58,730 --> 03:12:19,277
Yeah, just on that point, I don't think that anything we could do in this charter would affect our normal ability to initiate a home rule commission, which for clarity would be a group of people that are elected directly by voters who then draft another

1701
03:12:20,333 --> 03:12:23,796
original charter and then that is then sent to voters again.

1702
03:12:23,816 --> 03:12:43,975
I think that there are, there are kind of two different, and the, and the special, and the, the once every 10-year committee that's in this current draft of the charter would be, it would do things like update the charter if state law changed and the charter needed to be consistent with it or if there were normal things that we needed to change in the charter to do that.

1703
03:12:45,837 --> 03:12:49,241
Like, you know, turned out that something wasn't working and they can make normal edits.

1704
03:12:51,243 --> 03:12:58,952
When it came to like when it comes to think when it comes to the Home Rule Commission, it is important to clarify that they do have generally have more authority.

1705
03:12:59,552 --> 03:13:05,319
So, I don't think that the state legislature would normally approve something like

1706
03:13:06,653 --> 03:13:16,601
rank choice voting, but if the Home Rule Commission put forth something that wasn't explicitly illegal, they could end up implementing that.

1707
03:13:17,321 --> 03:13:19,183
So this doesn't take away the option explicitly.

1708
03:13:19,243 --> 03:13:26,649
I think that there is an argument to be made as to whether or not having this continuing process would sap motivation for doing that.

1709
03:13:27,442 --> 03:13:37,329
in the future, which there's kind of two different conversations to be had, but yeah.

1710
03:13:38,310 --> 03:13:43,974
All right.

1711
03:13:44,034 --> 03:13:45,836
Any further discussion by members of the council?

1712
03:13:47,517 --> 03:13:54,802
We have three amendments containing five provisions that councillors have requested to amend the main motion.

1713
03:13:57,251 --> 03:14:08,585
This is the two from Councilor Collins one is to amend the number of appointees to future charter review committees under section nine dash four, be to three Mayor three Council three school committee.

1714
03:14:10,224 --> 03:14:13,827
Under 4-1, a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee.

1715
03:14:13,847 --> 03:14:17,790
Now we have Councilor Sang.

1716
03:14:18,070 --> 03:14:22,393
Under 8-2, reverting the certification of petitions to the Board of Election Commissioners.

1717
03:14:24,795 --> 03:14:29,259
And 8-2E, a 12% threshold for the citizen initiative.

1718
03:14:29,279 --> 03:14:31,901
Is that the citizen initiative or the repeal referendum?

1719
03:14:37,485 --> 03:14:37,785
Got it.

1720
03:14:40,099 --> 03:14:44,603
And then Councilor Callahan to amend to refer to committee of the whole.

1721
03:14:48,507 --> 03:14:59,516
Councilor Lazaro, you could accept those, you could accept some of them, or we could vote on each of the five to include them as an amendment to the main motion.

1722
03:15:00,537 --> 03:15:06,903
The main motion is by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Sang to approve the draft as amended.

1723
03:15:07,541 --> 03:15:30,470
with those amendments being under section 3-3A, adding back the word, the words or ordinance and under 2-1C, changing that to a word counselor shall be a voter in which the office is sought or essentially just not having a additional residency requirement for that type of office where it doesn't exist for any other office.

1724
03:15:33,251 --> 03:15:36,552
I would like us to vote on each of those amendments, please.

1725
03:15:38,045 --> 03:15:38,325
Okay.

1726
03:15:39,687 --> 03:15:50,839
So we'll start with the first one which is the amending the number of appointees to future Charter Review Committees to three Mayor, three Council, and three School Committee under section 9-4B.

1727
03:15:52,901 --> 03:15:53,662
Councillor Scarbelli.

1728
03:15:54,659 --> 03:16:00,342
Is this with taking the mayor's changes to move back to eight to three?

1729
03:16:00,742 --> 03:16:04,323
Is that what my fellow councilors would support with these changes?

1730
03:16:05,044 --> 03:16:05,664
Just to be clear.

1731
03:16:05,944 --> 03:16:10,606
Yeah, so the starting point of this is the mayor's amended draft.

1732
03:16:11,426 --> 03:16:15,348
No motion has been made to change back to the five-four model.

1733
03:16:16,349 --> 03:16:23,872
So the starting point for all of this is the mayor's draft, and these would be amendments to the mayor's draft that was returned to us.

1734
03:16:24,637 --> 03:16:25,578
Thank you.

1735
03:16:25,618 --> 03:16:30,920
You got it.

1736
03:16:31,041 --> 03:16:39,305
On 9-4B, that's amending the number of appointees to future charter review committees to three mayor, three council, three school committee.

1737
03:16:40,386 --> 03:16:42,947
Any further discussion by members of the council and then we will open.

1738
03:16:43,187 --> 03:16:51,692
I want to get the main motion solidified and then we'll have discussion on the motion as amended by the council from members of the public.

1739
03:16:56,712 --> 03:17:03,339
Any further discussion by members of the council on changing to 333 for the future charter review committees under 9-4B?

1740
03:17:05,961 --> 03:17:09,505
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, could you call the roll?

1741
03:17:09,545 --> 03:17:12,467
That's to amend the main motion to include that amendment.

1742
03:17:13,649 --> 03:17:14,910
There's a second from Councilor Lemming.

1743
03:17:26,672 --> 03:17:27,312
Councilor Callahan?

1744
03:17:27,873 --> 03:17:28,093
Yes.

1745
03:17:30,334 --> 03:17:31,195
Vice President Collins?

1746
03:17:31,535 --> 03:17:31,655
Yes.

1747
03:17:32,956 --> 03:17:33,816
Councilor Lozaro?

1748
03:17:34,396 --> 03:17:34,697
Yes.

1749
03:17:36,558 --> 03:17:37,118
Councilor Lemming?

1750
03:17:37,138 --> 03:17:38,739
Yes.

1751
03:17:38,759 --> 03:17:39,479
Councilor Scarpelli?

1752
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:42,541
To move to 8-3, I will say yes to this.

1753
03:17:42,981 --> 03:17:56,009
No, this is a vote on... Okay, yep, just as long as I heard you correctly, Council President, so... Yeah, this is just on the specifically including the amendment to have the number of appointees on future charter review committees

1754
03:17:57,297 --> 03:17:59,779
Three by the mayor, three by the council, three by the school committee.

1755
03:17:59,799 --> 03:18:00,600
I appreciate that.

1756
03:18:01,021 --> 03:18:01,241
Thank you.

1757
03:18:01,261 --> 03:18:02,682
Is that a yes?

1758
03:18:02,863 --> 03:18:03,063
Yes.

1759
03:18:03,343 --> 03:18:03,543
Yes.

1760
03:18:04,704 --> 03:18:05,185
Councilor Sang.

1761
03:18:05,205 --> 03:18:05,265
Yes.

1762
03:18:06,506 --> 03:18:07,127
President Behrs.

1763
03:18:07,507 --> 03:18:07,767
Yes.

1764
03:18:08,748 --> 03:18:10,810
Seven affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

1765
03:18:12,472 --> 03:18:18,138
The second amendment to the main motion is section 4-1, the motion to remove the mayor from the school committee.

1766
03:18:26,470 --> 03:18:27,830
I do have one clarifying question.

1767
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:29,871
Would this replace the mayor with an at-large member?

1768
03:18:29,891 --> 03:18:33,512
Okay.

1769
03:18:36,473 --> 03:18:40,594
So there would be, the school committee would be made up of three at-large members and four district members.

1770
03:18:43,675 --> 03:18:51,337
Councillor Singh.

1771
03:18:53,317 --> 03:18:53,517
Yep.

1772
03:18:54,278 --> 03:18:55,238
I can't hear Councillor Singh.

1773
03:18:56,524 --> 03:18:58,565
Oh, sorry counselor saying, go ahead.

1774
03:18:59,206 --> 03:19:13,936
Thanks for letting us know if I vote this I'd like to, I'd like us to meet in an emergency committee the whole as soon as possible to, to have residents, talk about it with us and to, to be able to.

1775
03:19:15,832 --> 03:19:21,833
scrutinize this idea and to still be able to meet, to try our best to meet the deadlines.

1776
03:19:22,353 --> 03:19:22,973
Is that possible?

1777
03:19:23,654 --> 03:19:27,334
There is an open committee of the whole meeting next week that just opened up.

1778
03:19:27,574 --> 03:19:29,855
It's either Tuesday or Wednesday.

1779
03:19:29,895 --> 03:19:30,515
I'd have to confirm.

1780
03:19:30,575 --> 03:19:31,395
I'd have to check my email.

1781
03:19:31,415 --> 03:19:32,675
Okay, thank you.

1782
03:19:35,116 --> 03:19:35,836
Anna, can I jump in?

1783
03:19:36,776 --> 03:19:38,237
Councilor Callahan, yes, sorry.

1784
03:19:38,297 --> 03:19:40,097
I've got pop-ups covering you.

1785
03:19:41,782 --> 03:19:49,609
Um, yes, I, I would much prefer, like, I know we haven't yet voted on whether to move this to the city to the committee of the whole.

1786
03:19:50,309 --> 03:19:56,535
Um, but I would much prefer not to vote on this, that particular motion tonight, but to vote on that at the committee of the whole.

1787
03:19:58,677 --> 03:19:58,937
Got it.

1788
03:19:59,798 --> 03:20:00,058
Um, yep.

1789
03:20:00,158 --> 03:20:03,941
And there's 2 more motions before we get to the motion to amend to refer to committee though.

1790
03:20:04,442 --> 03:20:05,763
Can I amend can I, um.

1791
03:20:08,183 --> 03:20:14,425
I don't know if I can amend Councilor Lemming's motion to ask that that be voted on next week.

1792
03:20:19,926 --> 03:20:31,568
If it were, Vice President Collins, I will just say procedurally, if this were adopted and then the main motion were referred to Committee of the Whole, there'd be an opportunity of Committee of the Whole to then revert it.

1793
03:20:33,328 --> 03:20:34,569
Council Vice President Collins.

1794
03:20:35,149 --> 03:20:36,109
No, sorry, finish your thought.

1795
03:20:37,340 --> 03:20:37,520
Huh?

1796
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:38,501
Did you finish your thought?

1797
03:20:38,801 --> 03:20:39,001
Yes.

1798
03:20:39,181 --> 03:20:39,441
Okay.

1799
03:20:40,041 --> 03:20:43,223
Um the motion to refer to committee of the whole was not mine.

1800
03:20:43,243 --> 03:20:46,005
Uh though I do support it.

1801
03:20:46,065 --> 03:20:54,229
I think that we should take the available committee of the whole meeting next week and then immediately meet on this again in a regular meeting or special meeting.

1802
03:20:55,430 --> 03:20:59,892
Um but the the motion to move this to a committee of the whole wasn't mine.

1803
03:20:59,932 --> 03:21:03,814
I thought that was I think the question is whether you would amend your motion to amend

1804
03:21:06,646 --> 03:21:07,126
to what?

1805
03:21:07,466 --> 03:21:08,947
To not vote on it now.

1806
03:21:09,387 --> 03:21:10,387
No, I'd like to vote on it now.

1807
03:21:10,487 --> 03:21:10,707
Okay.

1808
03:21:10,727 --> 03:21:12,028
Sorry, Councilor Scarpelli.

1809
03:21:13,388 --> 03:21:19,870
Clarification, I think that what we've been told is the latest is mid-May, I mean mid-April, which is next week.

1810
03:21:20,450 --> 03:21:26,872
So if we go to Committee of the Whole, then we'd have to schedule a meeting, a regular meeting, correct, to then move this forward.

1811
03:21:26,952 --> 03:21:29,453
So if we call this an emergency meeting,

1812
03:21:30,553 --> 03:21:34,298
next week to be the latest that we can vote on then it could be moved forward to the legislature.

1813
03:21:34,698 --> 03:21:40,325
I think, would that be the more prudent decision if this is what we're doing, we could.

1814
03:21:41,766 --> 03:21:46,051
Instead of going to committee of the whole we could schedule a special regular meeting at the available time.

1815
03:21:47,813 --> 03:22:10,504
If this is the case, and this is, I'd rather not, I'd rather not lose this because, you know, semantics, you know, I'm ready to bend to make sure that we move something forward, Mr. President, but if we need to call it what we need to call it today, so we can vote on it Tuesday night, which is I believe the 12th, the 15th, excuse me.

1816
03:22:10,584 --> 03:22:11,865
So that's right in the middle.

1817
03:22:11,885 --> 03:22:15,126
If that's, then go off to the legislature on the 16th.

1818
03:22:16,777 --> 03:22:18,558
That hopefully that gives us enough time.

1819
03:22:18,678 --> 03:22:31,282
And I, I know my colleagues have said that being rushed, but holy cow, you know, you can't, you can't say that about one huge initiative in the community and then look what we're doing with zoning and not saying that we're not doing it there.

1820
03:22:31,322 --> 03:22:39,865
So please let's, let's figure out a way to make this work tonight so we can get this, we can get this way too much work done and we're right there.

1821
03:22:40,505 --> 03:22:40,805
Thank you.

1822
03:22:41,482 --> 03:22:42,683
Councilor Callahan.

1823
03:22:42,703 --> 03:22:45,585
I think I might have, I might have misunderstood.

1824
03:22:45,925 --> 03:22:49,027
I thought that I was asking Councilor Lemming.

1825
03:22:49,047 --> 03:22:53,770
I thought that we were voting on the removing the mayor from the school committee.

1826
03:22:53,790 --> 03:22:59,914
And if we were, I thought that was from Lemmings and that was the one that I was hoping to move to next week.

1827
03:23:00,155 --> 03:23:06,679
So I didn't quite understand why you were asking Councilor or Vice President Collins to amend her motion to move to next week.

1828
03:23:06,919 --> 03:23:08,060
So maybe I misunderstood.

1829
03:23:08,988 --> 03:23:15,054
The motion to remove the mayor from the school committee and replace with an at-large member was made by Councilor Collins.

1830
03:23:17,736 --> 03:23:18,697
Ah, I did not realize that.

1831
03:23:18,957 --> 03:23:20,298
And seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1832
03:23:23,101 --> 03:23:28,326
So Councilor Collins has indicated that she would prefer to vote on that amendment now.

1833
03:23:29,447 --> 03:23:33,671
I will however say, or I'm asking you now,

1834
03:23:35,843 --> 03:23:40,586
Three amendments from now, we have an amendment to refer this to a committee of the whole next week.

1835
03:23:41,487 --> 03:23:46,270
Councilor Scarpelli has requested that that be amended to refer to a special regular meeting next week.

1836
03:23:46,770 --> 03:23:47,450
Would you be amenable to that?

1837
03:23:47,470 --> 03:23:48,711
I'm absolutely amenable to that, yes.

1838
03:23:49,472 --> 03:23:52,073
Great, so we'll change that to a special regular meeting.

1839
03:23:53,514 --> 03:23:54,155
Councilor Sang.

1840
03:23:54,175 --> 03:23:57,837
Thank you.

1841
03:24:00,534 --> 03:24:11,946
I just want to provide my support to what Councillor Scarpelli said about doing an emergency meeting instead of a committee of the whole on this.

1842
03:24:12,006 --> 03:24:13,568
I think that makes sense.

1843
03:24:13,708 --> 03:24:17,512
It gets us in by the deadline or the supposed deadline as well.

1844
03:24:17,952 --> 03:24:21,236
I do want to note that it's not

1845
03:24:22,653 --> 03:24:27,997
very customary to send the City Council something that we have to vote through in just one week.

1846
03:24:29,018 --> 03:24:32,701
Usually you get, you know, a few weeks or a month to work it through.

1847
03:24:32,721 --> 03:24:35,603
Here in this situation, we could have gotten this draft.

1848
03:24:35,663 --> 03:24:38,065
We also could have gotten this draft a week earlier.

1849
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:51,372
We were just given a limited number of days to work through all the small edits that weren't in the press release as well, which is, I think, why it is prudent to do another meeting.

1850
03:24:52,193 --> 03:24:53,734
But I also recognize the urgency.

1851
03:24:55,496 --> 03:24:57,518
I think it's really important to underscore that part.

1852
03:24:58,318 --> 03:25:03,163
It's not just, you know, on the city council, I know President Behrs and I have been working really hard to

1853
03:25:04,403 --> 03:25:14,070
We had worked really hard to move this timeline as early as possible to give us as much time in case we had contingent situations like this and for us to have a real dialogue with the mayor's office.

1854
03:25:14,871 --> 03:25:22,537
Unfortunately, we were given a few days to look through edits that we expected would have been made earlier on.

1855
03:25:24,278 --> 03:25:24,879
So I think that

1856
03:25:26,252 --> 03:25:27,553
I think moving that makes sense.

1857
03:25:28,494 --> 03:25:40,844
And I think this is apples and oranges with zoning meetings that we were we have actually put off projects by months, but I know that's a whole other point, this is about the charter so we shouldn't litigate litigate that.

1858
03:25:41,965 --> 03:25:44,047
Thank you, Councilor Lemmon and Councilor Collins.

1859
03:25:45,628 --> 03:25:48,431
Yeah, I also have my hand up just to let you know.

1860
03:25:53,373 --> 03:25:56,275
I completely agree with the point about timelines.

1861
03:25:57,035 --> 03:26:08,540
The fact is, again, we got the draft of this about three months ago, three, four months ago, when it had been worked on for two years.

1862
03:26:09,141 --> 03:26:14,343
And at that very limited timeline, we passed a version of this 6-0.

1863
03:26:15,844 --> 03:26:22,547
And then a week ago, we got this version of the charter.

1864
03:26:23,827 --> 03:26:26,169
A week is not enough time to go through this.

1865
03:26:26,589 --> 03:26:35,716
And I personally do not care if this if we put it to the statehouse and it has to be delayed to the spring 2026 election.

1866
03:26:37,898 --> 03:26:50,047
Because we the way I see it, we passed a charter, this body did our job, just like with the zoning, we put out a timeline beforehand, clarifying how that would play out.

1867
03:26:51,008 --> 03:26:51,148
And

1868
03:26:51,623 --> 03:26:57,934
In January, we also the governance committee put out a timeline for how that play out that would play out, and we met that timeline.

1869
03:26:59,276 --> 03:27:01,760
So, I think, I think that.

1870
03:27:03,989 --> 03:27:16,755
passing a charter to us one week beforehand, again, via press release, is a strategy to try to rush this body into accepting edits without due thought.

1871
03:27:17,075 --> 03:27:19,036
And it's not a strategy that I want to fall for.

1872
03:27:19,456 --> 03:27:27,260
I'm going to support my colleagues if they want more time to think about this.

1873
03:27:27,460 --> 03:27:31,042
I personally have had a pretty stressful week beyond this charter.

1874
03:27:32,002 --> 03:27:39,348
beyond this charter business, and I can sympathize with the need for one more week to consider this.

1875
03:27:41,069 --> 03:27:51,777
And, you know, it is what it is, again, if the getting a version of the charter to the State House were truly a high priority, you could have accepted the version of the charter that we pass six to zero.

1876
03:27:54,839 --> 03:27:59,063
Thank you, Councilor Collins and then Councilor Lazaro and then Councilor Singh.

1877
03:27:59,788 --> 03:28:00,108
Thank you.

1878
03:28:00,508 --> 03:28:10,714
Super briefly, I support sending this not to a committee of the whole, but to a special meeting so that we can have one more time to discuss this and then pass it forward.

1879
03:28:10,854 --> 03:28:16,618
Hopefully, if it is the will of the council expeditiously with a strong vote when we talk about moving this along in the process.

1880
03:28:18,539 --> 03:28:23,641
Yes, we had a goal to approve this in mid-April to give it its best chance for success.

1881
03:28:23,701 --> 03:28:26,023
That is not the only criteria to guarantee

1882
03:28:26,623 --> 03:28:28,225
to guarantee a higher chance of success.

1883
03:28:28,325 --> 03:28:33,369
A strong vote for the council also affects its likelihood to be taken up by the legislature.

1884
03:28:33,389 --> 03:28:37,533
I do not think that we will have to push this off to the spring 2026 election.

1885
03:28:37,553 --> 03:28:38,434
I do not want that.

1886
03:28:38,494 --> 03:28:39,575
I don't think anybody wants that.

1887
03:28:39,655 --> 03:28:47,802
I don't think that taking one more week to have another discussion about this to get this right so we can feel comfortable putting this forward with a strong vote

1888
03:28:48,422 --> 03:28:50,344
I do not think that hurts this process.

1889
03:28:50,404 --> 03:28:56,328
I think that it is incumbent upon us to give this one more discussion if that's what it needs.

1890
03:28:56,928 --> 03:29:03,373
I think that improves this project's chances of going forward successfully, which is what we all want.

1891
03:29:03,393 --> 03:29:06,015
We don't just want it to go forward, we want it to go forward successfully.

1892
03:29:06,715 --> 03:29:07,016
Thank you.

1893
03:29:12,259 --> 03:29:12,880
Councilor Zaro.

1894
03:29:16,478 --> 03:29:21,784
I just wanted to say that I, I hope that the meeting next week can be on Tuesday.

1895
03:29:24,286 --> 03:29:26,429
Please be Tuesday the 15th at 6pm.

1896
03:29:26,869 --> 03:29:27,190
Excellent.

1897
03:29:27,310 --> 03:29:27,950
Okay, thank you.

1898
03:29:30,873 --> 03:29:33,416
Councilor saying, Oh, one second.

1899
03:29:34,297 --> 03:29:35,238
Go ahead.

1900
03:29:35,398 --> 03:29:37,120
I, I appreciate.

1901
03:29:38,830 --> 03:29:45,094
my fellow council members being willing to, you know, entertain giving us that one week.

1902
03:29:45,134 --> 03:29:52,918
I think one week with the stronger vote on this charter makes sense for the success of the charter in the statehouse as well.

1903
03:29:53,959 --> 03:30:00,422
I think, you know, taking those extra seven days to really do our due diligence will be worth it in the long run.

1904
03:30:00,442 --> 03:30:01,303
It's our job.

1905
03:30:02,215 --> 03:30:03,616
And I also just want to preempt.

1906
03:30:04,296 --> 03:30:15,800
I know a few residents, one or two residents have asked me why it was that early governance committee meetings on the charter weren't, you know, why we talked about procedure and rather than substance.

1907
03:30:16,500 --> 03:30:17,040
And, you know,

1908
03:30:17,740 --> 03:30:29,508
I want to be really forthright saying that we actually did want to talk about substance at those meetings but we were asked by multiple people including the mayor and the mayor's office to put that off and to just talk about procedure at those meetings.

1909
03:30:29,708 --> 03:30:33,550
So, I genuinely do think we would have been in a different position here.

1910
03:30:33,570 --> 03:30:36,012
And we could have passed it.

1911
03:30:36,652 --> 03:30:46,399
but we were told no at a lot of turns, even when we were willing to make compromises to not say any motion on anything substantive at those meetings.

1912
03:30:46,820 --> 03:30:52,204
I think we would have at least known where the kind of fault lines or differences lay.

1913
03:30:53,925 --> 03:30:54,766
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1914
03:30:54,786 --> 03:30:57,368
All right, back to where we were.

1915
03:30:58,589 --> 03:31:01,271
There are four amendments to the main motion.

1916
03:31:01,291 --> 03:31:03,572
The one we are currently considering is

1917
03:31:05,723 --> 03:31:13,691
an amendment to section 4-1 to remove the mayor from the school committee and replace with one at-large member, you would have a school committee of three at-large and four district.

1918
03:31:14,852 --> 03:31:18,335
That is Colin's motion, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1919
03:31:18,355 --> 03:31:28,325
We then have two motions by Councilor Sang regarding section 8-2 and then a motion by Councilor Callahan as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to refer

1920
03:31:30,103 --> 03:31:37,949
this draft as amended to a special meeting of the council next Tuesday, April 15th at 6 p.m.

1921
03:31:38,830 --> 03:31:50,239
So we are right now on the second Collins amendment 4-1, which is a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee and replace with an at-large member, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1922
03:31:50,339 --> 03:31:52,220
Is there any further discussion by members of the council?

1923
03:31:53,041 --> 03:31:58,225
Once we've gotten through these amendments, we'll have discussion by members of the public on the amended main motion.

1947
03:33:54,227 --> 03:33:55,308

Seconded by Vice President Collins.

1968
03:35:04,185 --> 03:35:05,346

The amendment is approved.

1999
03:36:45,151 --> 03:36:55,719
We now have a main motion by Councilor Zaro, seconded by Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilors Collins, Sang, Callahan, and Scarpelli, which would refer the mayor's draft

2000
03:36:56,466 --> 03:37:03,673
as amended to a special meeting of the council next week, Tuesday, April 15th at 6 p.m.

2001
03:37:04,854 --> 03:37:09,078
It's based on the mayor's draft return to the council with the following amendments.

2002

Under section 2-1C, removing the one-year in-ward residency requirement for ward counselors.

2003
03:37:22,323 --> 03:37:33,630
Under 3-3A, adding back the words or ordinance, which allows the council to appoint members of boards and commissions if the ordinance so says.

2004
03:37:35,011 --> 03:37:35,231
Under 4-1,

2005
03:37:36,792 --> 03:37:44,377
a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee and replace with one at-large member to have a school committee of three at-large and four district.

2006
03:37:45,238 --> 03:38:02,750
Under sections 8-2, a reversion of the certification of petitions to the board of elections commissioners, not the city clerk, and a 12% threshold for signatures so that the new initiative, citizen new initiative petition and the repeal referendum have the same threshold.

2007
03:38:03,530 --> 03:38:04,811
And finally, under section 9-4B,

2008
03:38:06,507 --> 03:38:11,910
amending the number of appointees to future charter review committees to three mayor, three council, and three school committee.

2009
03:38:12,710 --> 03:38:19,554
And that draft would go to the special meeting on April 15th at 6 p.m.

2010
03:38:20,754 --> 03:38:21,655
for a further discussion.

2011
03:38:21,675 --> 03:38:30,339
Is there any discussion by members of the council on the main motion to refer to the special meeting as amended?

2012
03:38:33,120 --> 03:38:34,081
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

2013
03:38:37,127 --> 03:38:38,687
Seeing none, we'll go to members of the public.

2014
03:38:39,008 --> 03:38:41,728
You can go to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

2015
03:38:43,989 --> 03:38:44,929
We have one hand on Zoom.

2016
03:38:44,949 --> 03:38:46,069
We have a couple people at the podium.

2017
03:38:46,089 --> 03:38:47,550
Name and address for the record, please.

2018
03:38:47,650 --> 03:38:49,130
You have three minutes.

2019
03:38:51,411 --> 03:38:54,112
Ron Chivino, 326 East Border Road.

2020
03:38:54,832 --> 03:38:55,312
What a night.

2021
03:38:56,292 --> 03:38:56,532
It's 1030.

2022
03:38:56,992 --> 03:39:00,573
Thank you, Memphis Community Cable, for being able to record this.

2023
03:39:02,154 --> 03:39:06,675
I can't help but notice that the school administration's gone home.

2024
03:39:07,460 --> 03:39:10,742
The Community Preservation Committee has gone home.

2025
03:39:11,362 --> 03:39:15,184
The Election Commission has gone home because their business was pushed out.

2026
03:39:15,584 --> 03:39:19,746
But when we talked about the Charter Committee, couldn't even get a second.

2027
03:39:20,467 --> 03:39:21,047
It's amazing.

2028
03:39:21,227 --> 03:39:22,067
It's amazing to me.

2029
03:39:22,768 --> 03:39:25,449
Did I hear correctly one councilor?

2030
03:39:25,629 --> 03:39:30,952
I'm speaking as a citizen, not as a member of this council, this committee, proud member though.

2031
03:39:31,792 --> 03:39:36,695
Did I hear a councilor say that the words he wrote about the Charter Committee

2032
03:39:37,424 --> 03:39:45,930
being the ultimate, doing the ultimate work and being the ultimate resource was only written to bolster his relationship with the committee and the community.

2033
03:39:46,390 --> 03:39:47,371
That's what I thought I heard.

2034
03:39:47,391 --> 03:39:48,071
Amazing.

2035
03:39:49,032 --> 03:39:49,892
Yes, you did.

2036
03:39:50,553 --> 03:39:51,053
Yes, you did.

2037
03:39:51,173 --> 03:39:52,094
Play it back tomorrow.

2038
03:39:52,134 --> 03:39:52,434
You did.

2039
03:39:52,614 --> 03:39:53,555
Councilor Lemming.

2040
03:39:53,675 --> 03:39:56,036
My three minutes.

2041
03:39:56,456 --> 03:39:58,338
I didn't even mention anybody's name.

2042
03:40:00,559 --> 03:40:01,240
Councilor Lemming.

2043
03:40:05,482 --> 03:40:06,143
Please pause.

2044
03:40:07,489 --> 03:40:09,070
You didn't you didn't mention anybody's name.

2045
03:40:09,130 --> 03:40:10,951
It's obvious that you're talking about.

2046
03:40:11,231 --> 03:40:12,452
It's obvious you're talking about me.

2047
03:40:13,172 --> 03:40:13,332
No.

2048
03:40:13,552 --> 03:40:13,792
Okay.

2049
03:40:14,012 --> 03:40:33,903
At the time, At the time, the Charter Study Committee was an appointed by was a body

2050
03:40:38,208 --> 03:40:43,252
At the time, I had good relationships with people on the committee.

2051
03:40:43,272 --> 03:40:46,375
I'd previously worked with them.

2052
03:40:48,276 --> 03:40:49,978
I really want to see Charter Review pass.

2053
03:40:51,178 --> 03:41:01,627
And when I was asked to step down from the committee after starting my campaign, I offered public support to the committee.

2054
03:41:03,672 --> 03:41:10,556
And no, I did not say that it was because I wanted to better my relations with people in the committee.

2055
03:41:10,957 --> 03:41:26,927
No, it's because increasing the visibility, increasing the faith that the community has in the Charter Study Committee would make it more likely that future councils would be more supportive of the idea of charter review.

2056
03:41:26,967 --> 03:41:27,487
And you know what?

2057
03:41:28,188 --> 03:41:28,548
It worked.

2058
03:41:30,901 --> 03:41:37,283
the Charter Study Committee is now very popular and the work that they've done is now very popular with the community.

2059
03:41:39,503 --> 03:41:55,767
And when I was offering my comments just now, this is the reason that I've tried up till this point to say as little as possible that I could, because I am proud of the majority of work that the Charter Study Committee has done.

2060
03:41:55,787 --> 03:41:58,368
And I think that

2061
03:41:58,972 --> 03:42:02,655
They are a group that has worked extremely hard.

2062
03:42:03,595 --> 03:42:13,743
But I got to say that during some of the presentations that I have seen, it did not satisfy me.

2063
03:42:13,923 --> 03:42:16,645
I wish that the presentation specifically around

2064
03:42:17,534 --> 03:42:24,079
council composition around the school committee that took place in these chambers could have been more substantive.

2065
03:42:24,139 --> 03:42:36,049
I wish that there were concerns consistently that counselors brought up and that school committee members for that matter brought up, which were not addressed.

2066
03:42:36,829 --> 03:42:43,515
And when I was bringing up my own concerns, and this is both in public and in one-on-one conversations,

2067
03:42:45,157 --> 03:42:50,901
I was, I consistently ran into this attitude of you shouldn't be considering that or you shouldn't be considering this.

2068
03:42:50,921 --> 03:42:55,705
So, so yeah, and it's tricky.

2069
03:42:56,266 --> 03:43:02,551
It is, it is, it's tricky for me because again, I did used to be part of that committee.

2070
03:43:04,313 --> 03:43:09,317
And so I do, I appreciate the work that they've done, but

2071
03:43:11,317 --> 03:43:18,622
I do need to have, but I would be remiss if I said that I didn't have criticism of their work in certain areas.

2072
03:43:21,004 --> 03:43:24,186
So that's the only point I'm making.

2073
03:43:24,206 --> 03:43:38,216
I mean, I understand that it's easy to twist what I'm saying from the seat, but yeah, that's all.

2074
03:43:39,456 --> 03:43:39,877
Thank you.

2075
03:43:42,612 --> 03:43:43,693
You have two minutes remaining.

2076
03:43:43,873 --> 03:43:50,837
Just so everybody knows, the charge from the mayor was that we represent the people, gather information, educate them on the process.

2077
03:43:51,077 --> 03:43:52,939
It wasn't a survey of 600 people.

2078
03:43:53,339 --> 03:43:58,822
It was conversations, interviews, questions, listening sessions out in the community.

2079
03:43:59,102 --> 03:44:00,203
We listened to people.

2080
03:44:01,384 --> 03:44:07,848
I think the people want to know whether what Councilor Lemming wrote is what he meant or what he's saying now he's meant.

2081
03:44:08,068 --> 03:44:08,448
I don't know.

2082
03:44:09,129 --> 03:44:10,089
All I know is that,

2083
03:44:12,571 --> 03:44:15,195
Charter committee has been working for two years.

2084
03:44:15,256 --> 03:44:17,900
If you didn't know what was coming, shame on you.

2085
03:44:18,301 --> 03:44:19,803
They were all open public meetings.

2086
03:44:19,903 --> 03:44:21,686
Everything we did was open public meeting.

2087
03:44:22,487 --> 03:44:23,629
The mayor's revisions

2088
03:44:24,620 --> 03:44:25,400
are nothing new.

2089
03:44:25,600 --> 03:44:26,581
We've had debates on it.

2090
03:44:26,601 --> 03:44:27,621
We've already discussed it.

2091
03:44:27,701 --> 03:44:30,922
You knew, you know how you have your, you already have your opinions on it.

2092
03:44:30,962 --> 03:44:37,764
It's not what the mayor didn't send any secret stuff like kicking the mayor off the school committee, which we're hearing for the first time from two different reps.

2093
03:44:37,804 --> 03:44:38,504
That's brand new.

2094
03:44:39,044 --> 03:44:41,184
Nobody discussed that not an open meeting.

2095
03:44:41,284 --> 03:44:42,585
And I think I saw most of them.

2096
03:44:43,065 --> 03:44:45,966
That's brand new stuff was talked about.

2097
03:44:46,006 --> 03:44:46,226
Right.

2098
03:44:47,446 --> 03:44:48,806
I mean, I think that that's, that's fair.

2099
03:44:48,826 --> 03:44:50,387
You know, it's 1030.

2100
03:44:50,747 --> 03:44:52,007
I've been here since six 30.

2101
03:44:52,067 --> 03:44:52,107
So

2102
03:44:56,242 --> 03:44:58,963
To me, I don't know what we're doing.

2103
03:45:00,204 --> 03:45:01,825
I think we all understand the options.

2104
03:45:02,245 --> 03:45:03,285
There's nothing new here.

2105
03:45:04,026 --> 03:45:15,612
If I said to you, let's sit down and negotiate a contract, and I said to the chairperson, the chairperson said, Mayor, I want you, the fiscally responsible person in the city to be off the school committee.

2106
03:45:15,692 --> 03:45:21,255
The mayor says to you, I want you off the city council, have any vote in the city council.

2107
03:45:21,964 --> 03:45:23,105
It's going back to the mayor.

2108
03:45:23,205 --> 03:45:25,527
Is she going to say I'm not on the city council?

2109
03:45:26,007 --> 03:45:27,208
We're negotiating here.

2110
03:45:27,529 --> 03:45:29,170
I mean, try it, but I don't think it's going to happen.

2111
03:45:29,270 --> 03:45:34,154
But ultimately, my final word is the people vote once it's on the ballot.

2112
03:45:34,234 --> 03:45:35,615
You're just getting it onto the ballot.

2113
03:45:36,115 --> 03:45:44,562
Process has always been, from the beginning, we supply you data, we make recommendations, your vote, mayor's vote, people's vote.

2114
03:45:45,603 --> 03:45:48,545
And the point is, it's going to get to the people.

2115
03:45:49,366 --> 03:45:50,267
And that's up to you guys.

2116
03:45:52,262 --> 03:45:56,785
I'm very disappointed in this process and I hope we can get this right next week.

2117
03:45:57,145 --> 03:45:57,946
I hope you guys do.

2118
03:45:58,026 --> 03:45:58,446
Good luck.

2119
03:45:59,747 --> 03:46:00,188
Thank you.

2120
03:46:00,348 --> 03:46:13,337
I do just, again, want to clarify that we did ask to have substantive meetings starting in September and the mayor, I don't know if she was speaking for the charter study committee or not, asked us to wait for the final report to be complete.

2121
03:46:14,337 --> 03:46:16,319
We would have started this process months earlier.

2122
03:46:17,848 --> 03:46:18,689
That's what happened.

2123
03:46:18,709 --> 03:46:20,471
So it's just the facts.

2124
03:46:21,052 --> 03:46:21,953
We're going to go to Zoom.

2125
03:46:22,694 --> 03:46:24,296
Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom.

2126
03:46:24,316 --> 03:46:25,297
You have three minutes.

2127
03:46:25,517 --> 03:46:27,159
Name and address for the record, please.

2128
03:46:29,262 --> 03:46:31,324
Goodness, I'm not quite sure where to start.

2129
03:46:32,225 --> 03:46:33,807
There's a lot that's been covered.

2130
03:46:35,197 --> 03:46:40,365
I appreciate everything that's been brought forward by the councillors tonight, with one exception.

2131
03:46:41,306 --> 03:46:49,138
But I think you all are under a massive amount of pressure, and I appreciate all the, especially the humility, the coming around, reconsidering things.

2132
03:46:49,758 --> 03:46:53,699
I hope to see the mayor as well be flexible and be able to come around.

2133
03:46:54,619 --> 03:46:56,380
I do wish things were more substantive.

2134
03:46:56,600 --> 03:47:03,421
However, I think that the lack of making things more substantive is by members of all of the bodies involved in this process.

2135
03:47:03,461 --> 03:47:07,142
It has not been really rigorous and merit based and looking at things.

2136
03:47:07,962 --> 03:47:09,663
So it's been lamentable the whole process.

2137
03:47:10,283 --> 03:47:15,304
particularly this charter committee, I agree with Councillor Collins.

2138
03:47:15,484 --> 03:47:25,486
There are various, there are quite a few things in which the members themselves, and this is not, if people say the process is lamentable, that does not mean that somebody needs to take it as a personal attack.

2139
03:47:26,246 --> 03:47:37,309
The process has been lamentable and there have been, I know even the report today on Reddit about the history, that is incomplete and it has a few of matters incorrect.

2140
03:47:38,689 --> 03:47:38,829
But

2141
03:47:39,586 --> 03:47:45,029
There have been two items that people have, three attempts have been made over the 14 or 15 years.

2142
03:47:47,271 --> 03:47:55,896
Term limits for the mayor, ward majority based for the council, but, but, but, but to move away from a strong mayor system.

2143
03:47:55,916 --> 03:48:00,399
And all the times the counselors have said, it's out of my hands, talk to the mayor, talk to the mayor.

2144
03:48:00,659 --> 03:48:04,261
And we've created a system, mayor is our single point of failure.

2145
03:48:05,000 --> 03:48:12,588
So initiatives like having councillors do more allocations to member bodies, that is a very great advancement.

2146
03:48:12,908 --> 03:48:14,449
That's a very great advancement.

2147
03:48:14,830 --> 03:48:17,973
There's going to be, the mayor wants more power, the councillors want more power.

2148
03:48:18,233 --> 03:48:23,338
There's an unavoidable conflict of interest when elected people are deciding on what will go in the charter.

2149
03:48:24,839 --> 03:48:27,162
One thing my issue is, is that

2150
03:48:28,152 --> 03:48:36,305
There's an expression by our own Massachusetts Ralph Waldo Emerson, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.

2151
03:48:36,765 --> 03:48:40,651
That does not mean I'm calling anybody on that's been participating foolish.

2152
03:48:41,665 --> 03:48:43,266
having a little mind or a hobgoblin.

2153
03:48:43,706 --> 03:48:53,149
But to try to have a consistency between that threshold for the initiatives based on it should just be the same number, I don't think that is very merit-based.

2154
03:48:53,169 --> 03:49:03,113
And I think that we should consider that when the process is that counselors are an inevitable conflict of interest because we could not get a petition done.

2155
03:49:03,133 --> 03:49:06,835
And there's a reason why the petition initiative did not happen.

2156
03:49:06,875 --> 03:49:07,695
It's not just because

2157
03:49:08,582 --> 03:49:12,345
things break down, which that's just not because people could not get enough signatures.

2158
03:49:13,206 --> 03:49:28,440
But when we know that that creates an inherent conflict of interest for counselors to be voting on the proposed charter, then I think because people have difficulty collecting signatures, then I think we should consider what are we doing when we're raising the threshold for citizen initiatives.

2159
03:49:34,265 --> 03:49:34,726
Thank you.

2160
03:49:36,649 --> 03:49:40,151
Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please.

2161
03:49:40,771 --> 03:49:41,751
Sorry, Milva, go ahead.

2162
03:49:42,092 --> 03:49:44,173
Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

2163
03:49:45,013 --> 03:49:48,755
I'm gonna try to be quick because I know I only have three minutes and it's late.

2164
03:49:50,415 --> 03:49:52,677
There's been discussion about the formation of the committee.

2165
03:49:52,697 --> 03:50:00,660
I just wanted to say that the mayor formed this committee because the Medford Charter Review Coalition requested it.

2166
03:50:00,900 --> 03:50:03,582
It was part of our work.

2167
03:50:05,423 --> 03:50:08,945
Despite the fact that we were the mayor's committee, we were independent.

2168
03:50:09,085 --> 03:50:21,995
And I wanna just clarify that because I feel, I just wanna make sure that some remarks were not interpreted to make it seem as though the mayor was in charge of us.

2169
03:50:22,315 --> 03:50:23,436
We were independent.

2170
03:50:24,216 --> 03:50:26,298
We had our meetings independent of the mayor.

2171
03:50:26,418 --> 03:50:29,240
She never influenced any decisions or discussions.

2172
03:50:31,381 --> 03:50:33,383
We did consider balance of power.

2173
03:50:35,356 --> 03:50:45,543
The, this, what we learned when we looked at other municipalities is that Medford's mayor is pretty much like all the other mayors in Massachusetts.

2174
03:50:46,904 --> 03:50:48,825
We have a mayor council form of government.

2175
03:50:49,766 --> 03:50:51,947
There was no will among the people.

2176
03:50:52,548 --> 03:50:58,872
We interviewed all the counselors, most of the counselors here and many other elected officials.

2177
03:50:59,992 --> 03:51:02,294
Nobody said they wanted to go to city manager.

2178
03:51:02,314 --> 03:51:02,354
Um,

2179
03:51:06,045 --> 03:51:10,050
We still considered balance of power, and I understand that it's an issue.

2180
03:51:12,333 --> 03:51:22,846
Taking the mayor off the school committee would make Medford one of a very, very few communities that doesn't have the mayor on the school committee.

2181
03:51:26,198 --> 03:51:36,620
Changing the charter committee to 333 would make Medford the only city in the state that gives the school committee that many appointees.

2182
03:51:37,221 --> 03:51:39,721
The school committee has a very narrow focus.

2183
03:51:40,621 --> 03:51:42,982
It focuses on the schools, not the entire city.

2184
03:51:43,202 --> 03:51:45,142
The charter focuses on the entire city.

2185
03:51:45,322 --> 03:51:47,483
The part of the charter that addresses the school committee

2186
03:51:48,343 --> 03:51:48,943
is small.

2187
03:51:48,963 --> 03:51:50,463
It addresses the composition.

2188
03:51:50,483 --> 03:51:54,824
The operations of the school committee are defined in state law.

2189
03:51:55,124 --> 03:51:58,505
Those are some of the reasons that we didn't make it equal.

2190
03:51:59,225 --> 03:52:07,287
And if you look at other charters, the school committee almost never has an appointee, but we didn't want to do that.

2191
03:52:07,667 --> 03:52:14,148
I'm just explaining this so it's understood because we weren't asked, but I feel like it's important.

2192
03:52:17,548 --> 03:52:22,411
Anthony Wilson from the Collins Center is on tonight and I don't know if you'll have him next week.

2193
03:52:23,532 --> 03:52:28,174
You might ask him about these changes before just deciding on them.

2194
03:52:28,554 --> 03:52:31,516
We actually looked at best practices.

2195
03:52:31,616 --> 03:52:34,357
We looked at the reasons why mayors are on school committee.

2196
03:52:35,078 --> 03:52:38,640
So it's maybe something that you want to get a little more information about.

2197
03:52:42,021 --> 03:52:44,143
I guess that's all I'm going to say right now.

2198
03:52:44,323 --> 03:52:44,663
Thank you.

2199
03:52:46,614 --> 03:52:49,997
We'll go to Alyssa Nugent on Zoom.

2200
03:52:51,819 --> 03:52:57,383
Alyssa, unmute you, you'll have, oh, actually I will go to Councilor Lemming and then we'll go to Alyssa.

2201
03:52:57,403 --> 03:52:58,044
Councilor Lemming.

2202
03:53:00,126 --> 03:53:05,190
I do have like a bit of a longer point that I wanna make about charter committee compositions.

2203
03:53:05,210 --> 03:53:06,852
Let's go through public participation.

2204
03:53:06,892 --> 03:53:07,772
Yeah, we can do that first.

2205
03:53:07,793 --> 03:53:08,573
We've talked for a while.

2206
03:53:08,653 --> 03:53:10,555
I have done my homework on this, that's the point I wanna make.

2207
03:53:14,556 --> 03:53:15,819
Go to Alyssa on Zoom.

2208
03:53:17,604 --> 03:53:18,526
Name and address for the record.

2209
03:53:18,546 --> 03:53:19,248
You have three minutes.

2210
03:53:20,830 --> 03:53:23,771
Melissa Nugent at 98 Sheridan Avenue.

2211
03:53:23,791 --> 03:53:31,915
I appreciate the time and effort that has gone into discussing the charter tonight and the mayor's revisions.

2212
03:53:31,975 --> 03:53:46,221
However, I am concerned with this decision to make further amendments to the charter, simply to put the ball back, because it'll have to go back to the mayor after you vote on these things.

2213
03:53:47,121 --> 03:53:52,405
that this is just an attempt to slow walk the charter so that it doesn't make the ballot in November.

2214
03:53:52,425 --> 03:54:00,591
I mean, we can all acknowledge that it's not a perfect document, but it is a vast improvement over what we have.

2215
03:54:01,352 --> 03:54:10,298
And it specifically includes provisions to allow further revision and review of things to see if there are certain

2216
03:54:12,881 --> 03:54:15,824
Portions are not working for the city of Medford.

2217
03:54:17,505 --> 03:54:24,613
So, I would really just urge you to take into account that the public wants representation.

2218
03:54:24,653 --> 03:54:28,858
They want these changes implemented and those are the major changes.

2219
03:54:28,898 --> 03:54:30,499
We shouldn't, we shouldn't lose the forest.

2220
03:54:31,280 --> 03:54:31,841
for the trees.

2221
03:54:32,921 --> 03:54:55,917
With respect to the removal of the mayor from the city council altogether, the city council has already looked at the provision of the mayor being on the city council, and they agreed, you agreed previously to leave her on, just not as the chairperson, and she made that compromise when she sent this version of the charter back to you.

2222
03:54:56,737 --> 03:55:11,280
I think that you've overlooked the final report from the Charter Study Committee, who investigated this issue and found that the vast majority of cities in Massachusetts have the mayor on the school committee.

2223
03:55:11,320 --> 03:55:14,201
And there are benefits to having the mayor on the school committee.

2224
03:55:14,301 --> 03:55:18,441
It's not just about power, which everybody seems to be so fixated on.

2225
03:55:19,862 --> 03:55:26,123
When we aren't changing the fundamental structure of our governance, it is still going to be a strong mayor system.

2226
03:55:27,183 --> 03:55:28,484
So let's not get caught up on that.

2227
03:55:28,864 --> 03:55:40,330
But by putting the mayor on the school committee, people on the school committee are going to have direct public access to her or him on a regular basis and are able to have a public

2228
03:55:41,691 --> 03:55:57,381
a public discussion about issues that are impacting the school so that the executive branch of our government is aware of those issues and and fully informed and is better able to maneuver the executive branch to assist the school committee and assist the schools.

2229
03:55:57,761 --> 03:56:10,490
So I don't think that we should overlook the positives of having the mayor in that position just because we want to fight over who has more power when we know that the system is set up and is going to continue to be set up.

2230
03:56:10,970 --> 03:56:14,391
to where the mayor has the majority of the power.

2231
03:56:15,211 --> 03:56:25,835
I would urge you to vote on this and get this to the state ASAP so that we can get this on the ballot and the people can have a voice on it come November.

2232
03:56:26,395 --> 03:56:26,755
Thank you.

2233
03:56:28,795 --> 03:56:29,176
Thank you.

2234
03:56:29,216 --> 03:56:31,236
We'll go to the podium.

2235
03:56:31,276 --> 03:56:32,557
Name and address for the record, please.

2236
03:56:32,577 --> 03:56:33,517
And you'll have three minutes.

2237
03:56:35,398 --> 03:56:36,779
My name is Phyllis Morrison.

2238
03:56:36,899 --> 03:56:38,859
I live at 32 Andrew Street, Medford.

2239
03:56:39,719 --> 03:56:41,160
I have three things I want to say.

2240
03:56:41,880 --> 03:56:49,582
My charter study colleague, Miller, addressed one of them, but I do want to reiterate to this group and to the people on Zoom.

2241
03:56:51,363 --> 03:57:03,747
I got the sense this evening that somehow it is understanding or implied some way that members of the charter committee have some special association with the mayor.

2242
03:57:04,972 --> 03:57:06,035
I barely know the mayor.

2243
03:57:06,737 --> 03:57:08,040
I do know her.

2244
03:57:08,902 --> 03:57:11,329
What I want to say is, is that that really

2245
03:57:13,037 --> 03:57:20,483
bothered me, and it led, I think, people to believe that somehow the Charter Committee was doing the mayor's bidding.

2246
03:57:21,104 --> 03:57:24,827
We're doing the people's bidding, and that's what we've done all along.

2247
03:57:25,588 --> 03:57:38,498
I did not join the Charter Study Committee until about a year into it, and when I joined, the group that I was working with were doing everything to engage the people in Medved in this process, everything.

2248
03:57:39,179 --> 03:57:41,380
They went out when people wouldn't show up.

2249
03:57:41,740 --> 03:57:43,281
They did yeoman's work.

2250
03:57:44,162 --> 03:57:57,309
So to have any sense or any implication that anyone in this Charter Committee had a special association or was appointed specially by the mayor is just not true.

2251
03:57:57,989 --> 03:57:58,789
That's number one.

2252
03:57:59,310 --> 03:58:06,834
The second point I'd like to ask is, I think it was you, Councilman Lemming, who said there was some presentations made to this committee from the Charter Committee.

2253
03:58:08,360 --> 03:58:12,201
I'm pretty sure you said that, and I'm not aware of any of those being presented.

2254
03:58:12,241 --> 03:58:14,462
Could you refresh my memory or inform me of those?

2255
03:58:14,482 --> 03:58:18,323
I don't think this committee ever made a presentation.

2256
03:58:21,484 --> 03:58:22,944
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

2257
03:58:22,964 --> 03:58:23,564
Hold on a second.

2258
03:58:23,825 --> 03:58:23,985
Yeah.

2259
03:58:25,745 --> 03:58:28,646
Councillor Lemming.

2260
03:58:28,666 --> 03:58:34,368
So if I said the committee as a body, I could go back on that.

2261
03:58:36,388 --> 03:58:48,150
individual committee members have spoken to this committee in their capacity as either the committee chair or the chair of individual subcommittees, and they've discussed it.

2262
03:58:48,490 --> 03:58:49,591
But you're right.

2263
03:58:50,551 --> 03:58:59,413
I guess the committee technically disbanded after the recommendations were submitted, but individual committee members have discussed the process that they've gone through with us.

2264
03:58:59,453 --> 03:59:00,313
But you're correct.

2265
03:59:00,373 --> 03:59:00,773
During

2266
03:59:01,580 --> 03:59:06,263
the process of drafting the charter, and I'm not a member of the governance committee, so I might have missed this.

2267
03:59:06,443 --> 03:59:13,628
I just wanted to clarify that, because I have come to as many meetings as I possibly can, and I did not see a presentation by the committee.

2268
03:59:13,648 --> 03:59:17,290
So if individuals were speaking to you, so be it.

2269
03:59:17,490 --> 03:59:20,492
Yeah, Paul, I probably should have clarified the wording there.

2270
03:59:20,552 --> 03:59:21,513
But yes, I hope you

2271
03:59:22,596 --> 03:59:28,661
people that were the chair of individual subcommittees that focused on different parts of the charter did speak to us about that.

2272
03:59:28,681 --> 03:59:32,925
Yeah, because we have spoken to people individually, but not presented to this committee in full.

2273
03:59:33,105 --> 03:59:34,146
That is a fact, yes.

2274
03:59:35,267 --> 03:59:46,216
The other point I'd like to make is it appears to me as a citizen that there's a power struggle that's blocking this process.

2275
03:59:46,856 --> 03:59:47,877
Now, it may be

2276
03:59:50,441 --> 03:59:54,764
The wish of this Council for certain things to happen.

2277
03:59:55,364 --> 03:59:59,287
But in the end of this day, it seems to me like there's a power struggle.

2278
03:59:59,808 --> 04:00:03,951
One thing I would, I would urge the Council to remember is that

2279
04:00:04,731 --> 04:00:16,837
we should all be fully invested in every citizen of Medford and not just in our own individual wants or desires for the city.

2280
04:00:17,817 --> 04:00:28,623
And the big point is, is that whatever amendments pass or don't pass, no matter how the charter is presented, the city of Medford will have this wonderful document and it can be amended going forward.

2281
04:00:29,043 --> 04:00:33,065
And my last point is this, the people will have the say in November.

2282
04:00:33,865 --> 04:00:37,189
and I think that's something that cannot be let out of mind.

2283
04:00:37,650 --> 04:00:41,074
The people will vote on this, so please get it to them so they can vote.

2284
04:00:41,434 --> 04:00:41,814
Thank you.

2285
04:00:41,834 --> 04:00:43,336
Thank you.

2286
04:00:43,416 --> 04:00:44,558
We'll go back to Zoom.

2287
04:00:45,619 --> 04:00:46,700
Eunice Brown.

2288
04:00:51,786 --> 04:00:52,767
Name and address for the record.

2289
04:00:52,807 --> 04:00:53,448
You have three minutes.

2290
04:00:55,294 --> 04:00:56,034
Hi, thanks.

2291
04:00:56,495 --> 04:00:58,136
Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

2292
04:00:59,256 --> 04:01:07,241
I could drone on for the next three minutes on how disgusted I am with six of you, but I'll leave that for another time.

2293
04:01:08,361 --> 04:01:11,563
My point right now is procedural.

2294
04:01:13,404 --> 04:01:15,065
And help me understand this a little bit.

2295
04:01:16,306 --> 04:01:22,509
So you're going to a special committee next Tuesday, special meeting next Tuesday, and

2296
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:32,364
I don't I'm not clear if that's just to talk about the removing the mayor from the school committee piece or.

2297
04:01:33,985 --> 04:01:40,248
Discussing a bunch of elements and you can answer that when I'm finished, but whatever it is.

2298
04:01:40,268 --> 04:01:42,729
Um, you've, you know.

2299
04:01:43,568 --> 04:01:47,209
uh, talked about and, you know, move forward some amendments.

2300
04:01:48,230 --> 04:01:54,932
Um, some big, some small was the biggest one, as I just mentioned, um, taking the mayor off the school committee.

2301
04:01:55,672 --> 04:02:03,535
So whatever you discuss and however things, whatever sort of outcome you have next Tuesday night, that has to go back to the mayor.

2302
04:02:04,623 --> 04:02:10,506
And then she has to mull it over and decides where she sits on all of this.

2303
04:02:11,467 --> 04:02:17,630
And then presumably it has to come back to you guys in another meeting.

2304
04:02:18,331 --> 04:02:22,013
So we're getting dangerously close to the time where

2305
04:02:23,135 --> 04:02:34,261
This really can't go to the state because they just, you know, the deadline that we've established for that, you know, will pass within the next couple of weeks.

2306
04:02:34,281 --> 04:02:35,301
So.

2307
04:02:38,067 --> 04:02:45,332
I'm very concerned that, and maybe the speaker, couple of speakers prior to me was right.

2308
04:02:45,412 --> 04:02:47,074
You are slow walking it.

2309
04:02:47,254 --> 04:02:52,798
I don't know, but this deadline is most definitely in jeopardy at this point.

2310
04:02:53,638 --> 04:03:03,406
And the other point I'll make, and it was also made by one of the prior speakers, is that this is a big improvement over what we have.

2311
04:03:03,886 --> 04:03:06,408
Our current charter is only two and a half pages long,

2312
04:03:07,340 --> 04:03:16,646
Is missing an awful lot of substance refers you to dozens of mass general laws, and it's just one of the most confusing things ever.

2313
04:03:17,927 --> 04:03:24,092
Whereas this is a nice, tidy little document that spells out.

2314
04:03:24,752 --> 04:03:26,513
how we should run our government.

2315
04:03:26,854 --> 04:03:27,534
Is it perfect?

2316
04:03:27,814 --> 04:03:28,094
No.

2317
04:03:28,415 --> 04:03:30,016
Did I get everything I wanted in it?

2318
04:03:30,456 --> 04:03:30,916
No.

2319
04:03:31,517 --> 04:03:32,517
Most of us didn't.

2320
04:03:32,918 --> 04:03:43,645
But we're all very satisfied with where things landed, and it is certainly something that will serve the citizens of Medford well.

2321
04:03:44,726 --> 04:03:45,747
And that's all I have to say.

2322
04:03:45,827 --> 04:03:46,507
Thank you very much.

2323
04:03:46,527 --> 04:03:49,149
Thank you.

2324
04:03:52,390 --> 04:03:53,473
still here, still alive.

2325
04:03:53,493 --> 04:03:56,280
I know some people would mind otherwise.

2326
04:03:57,383 --> 04:03:59,167
But I will say to your point,

2327
04:04:01,901 --> 04:04:05,543
Procedurally, yes, it will go to a special meeting next week.

2328
04:04:06,323 --> 04:04:11,605
Whatever version is voted by the council would have to be approved by the mayor.

2329
04:04:12,106 --> 04:04:14,287
The mayor could have submitted the previous version.

2330
04:04:14,327 --> 04:04:18,068
This does require consensus of the council and the mayor.

2331
04:04:19,129 --> 04:04:21,370
So that's part of the process.

2332
04:04:21,450 --> 04:04:30,334
And again, it is one of the reasons that Councilor Sang and I had hoped to start this process earlier than the council was able to.

2333
04:04:31,378 --> 04:04:32,200
Go to the podium.

2334
04:04:33,243 --> 04:04:35,227
Name and address for the record, please.

2335
04:04:35,267 --> 04:04:36,069
You have three minutes.

2336
04:04:36,972 --> 04:04:38,736
Nick Julio 40 Robinson road.

2337
04:04:40,727 --> 04:05:05,759
I'll try to be brief but basically my point is I think it's very important that the council remember the last step in this process right the last step of getting this done and that is it goes to the people, the people are voting on the charter, right, so we wouldn't want to go through a process in which we finally get to the last stage of it, and then we get some sort of tragic outcome of the people reject the charter, because they feel like it doesn't reflect

2338
04:05:06,680 --> 04:05:10,323
what they had believed over time it should contain.

2339
04:05:11,063 --> 04:05:12,444
So that's why it's very important.

2340
04:05:12,464 --> 04:05:17,468
I think the overarching consideration here should be, what do the people want?

2341
04:05:17,748 --> 04:05:22,351
So it's important to put individual opinions and egos aside and look to that.

2342
04:05:22,791 --> 04:05:32,658
So when it comes to ward versus district, when it comes to mayor on a school committee, we have to overall defer to what the people want.

2343
04:05:33,679 --> 04:05:34,340
And when we have,

2344
04:05:35,080 --> 04:05:55,330
Procedural issues like what we're going through now with the amendments, but also the fact that we didn't get the public comment until 1030 because we took other items up on the agenda first, despite the importance of this item, it really does diminish the ability of the council to understand what the people actually want, which will get us to that goal of getting a charter through.

2345
04:05:55,791 --> 04:05:59,413
So I would just encourage all of you to really take that into mind.

2346
04:05:59,753 --> 04:06:00,053
Thank you.

2347
04:06:01,413 --> 04:06:01,853
Thank you.

2348
04:06:01,893 --> 04:06:03,154
We'll go to Zoom.

2349
04:06:03,434 --> 04:06:05,254
We'll go to Sharon Hayes.

2350
04:06:05,575 --> 04:06:07,235
Name and address for the record, please.

2351
04:06:07,275 --> 04:06:08,116
You have three minutes.

2352
04:06:10,076 --> 04:06:12,877
Hi, Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.

2353
04:06:15,258 --> 04:06:22,161
I would like to speak about the new amendment to remove the mayor from the school committee.

2354
04:06:24,081 --> 04:06:30,684
As a resident, as a parent of two students in the Medford Public Schools, and as a former school committee member,

2355
04:06:32,047 --> 04:06:35,868
I am opposed to the idea of taking the mayor off of the school committee.

2356
04:06:36,569 --> 04:06:45,332
I spoke at a previous meeting where I agreed or supported the idea of removing her as the chair of the school committee.

2357
04:06:45,352 --> 04:06:48,953
And I spoke to some reasons about that at that time.

2358
04:06:49,413 --> 04:07:00,598
But having her on the school committee, or I should say having the mayor, whoever it is, on the school committee as the head of the city and as the school being the largest department

2359
04:07:02,115 --> 04:07:14,005
Budget wise and arguably to a lot of people, one of the if not the most important part of the city educating our students.

2360
04:07:14,866 --> 04:07:27,776
I think having the head of our city not be a part of that or when the mayor has been on the school committee all this time to now decide to take her off, to take that position off of the school committee.

2361
04:07:29,261 --> 04:07:32,522
I have to say I missed the earlier part of the meeting, I had to leave.

2362
04:07:32,942 --> 04:07:35,523
So I didn't hear the reasons that were given for that.

2363
04:07:36,124 --> 04:07:44,226
But I find it really difficult to believe that anyone would think that's a positive move.

2364
04:07:44,947 --> 04:07:52,970
The mayor needs to be there to hear what's going on with the schools, to understand what's going on with the schools, especially when it comes to the budget season.

2365
04:07:55,100 --> 04:08:08,587
And so I'm really, really shocked when I, when I came back on and found that that was being put forward, especially given that, as I said at a previous meeting, I spoke to the idea of taking her, taking the mayor off of, of being the chair.

2366
04:08:09,127 --> 04:08:15,490
And then that was what was put forward to the mayor in the revision that was sent to her.

2367
04:08:15,971 --> 04:08:22,354
And now when it comes back after her agreeing to it, you're now deciding to take the mayor off of the school committee.

2368
04:08:22,735 --> 04:08:26,298
I think that's really, really surprising, and I am really opposed to that.

2369
04:08:26,838 --> 04:08:27,259
Thank you.

2370
04:08:30,561 --> 04:08:31,002
Thank you.

2371
04:08:31,042 --> 04:08:32,083
We'll go to the podium.

2372
04:08:33,003 --> 04:08:34,424
Name and address for the record, please.

2373
04:08:34,484 --> 04:08:35,525
And you'll have three minutes.

2374
04:08:35,926 --> 04:08:36,186
Sure.

2375
04:08:36,286 --> 04:08:38,348
Micah Shalom Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

2376
04:08:39,128 --> 04:08:48,796
I just want to emphasize that I think that this charter needs to get moved forward.

2377
04:08:49,577 --> 04:08:51,158
It's really important.

2378
04:08:52,030 --> 04:09:10,438
Where it is now, there's a lot of compromises that are in there, but if it's going to die in some power struggle between city council and the mayor's office, justified or not, that's going to reflect on the city council, not on the mayor.

2379
04:09:10,998 --> 04:09:14,320
That's what people are going to see and take away from it.

2380
04:09:16,000 --> 04:09:21,503
You have time to revisit it, even if it passes as is.

2381
04:09:22,313 --> 04:09:35,422
And as it is now, it is more likely to pass than I think realistically you are likely to get something able to be pushed forward to a vote within your really tight timeline.

2382
04:09:36,763 --> 04:09:48,971
And I also wanna make sure that I don't neglect to mention that the ward versus district issue is really important.

2383
04:09:51,333 --> 04:10:06,645
I think a lot of people in Medford, and I really think you're underestimating how many people in Medford are in favor of ward representation and think district representation, it just doesn't make sense, like doing a partial ward versus district.

2384
04:10:06,725 --> 04:10:08,526
It just doesn't make any sense.

2385
04:10:08,587 --> 04:10:13,010
I understand, Councilor Callahan, that you put together a blog post and I read the blog post.

2386
04:10:14,111 --> 04:10:19,535
It doesn't get to this issue of why is a district and ward,

2387
04:10:20,283 --> 04:10:27,385
and general better than board and general.

2388
04:10:27,985 --> 04:10:30,486
The proposed solution doesn't solve anything.

2389
04:10:30,946 --> 04:10:37,368
So as I'll say that what is in there now is as representative as we can get.

2390
04:10:37,859 --> 04:10:38,720
with what we have.

2391
04:10:39,080 --> 04:10:41,943
Rank choice would be dope to put in there, but we're not going to get that in there.

2392
04:10:42,163 --> 04:10:45,546
I mean, I didn't even know that was on in the cards until today, to be honest.

2393
04:10:45,606 --> 04:10:49,790
So that's a bummer that we won't see that in there, but maybe later.

2394
04:10:51,051 --> 04:11:04,683
But nevertheless, if we have closer representation to the members of our city, when it does go into another review in the future, it should, in theory,

2395
04:11:06,226 --> 04:11:15,889
be closer to the actual wants and needs of the residents of Medford as a result.

2396
04:11:16,549 --> 04:11:26,132
So this is a very long winded way of saying that I really think that you guys should just take the compromise and just move it forward because you don't have time to dilly dally and it's going to

2397
04:11:27,074 --> 04:11:32,359
And it's gonna hit you guys on the council, the council in general, back in the face, not the mayor.

2398
04:11:32,619 --> 04:11:35,402
And sometimes you just have to take a loss.

2399
04:11:35,942 --> 04:11:37,323
Like that's just the way it is.

2400
04:11:37,364 --> 04:11:38,465
So thanks.

2401
04:11:39,646 --> 04:11:40,146
Thank you.

2402
04:11:40,166 --> 04:11:42,528
We'll go to Miranda Briseño on Zoom.

2403
04:11:43,569 --> 04:11:44,750
Name and address for the record.

2404
04:11:44,770 --> 04:11:45,691
You have three minutes.

2405
04:11:46,892 --> 04:11:49,174
Hi, Miranda Briseño, Taylor Street.

2406
04:11:50,716 --> 04:11:51,737
I will pretend to...

2407
04:11:52,787 --> 04:11:55,409
know anything that is in this new proposed version.

2408
04:11:55,990 --> 04:12:00,132
I just wanted one support that moving this to a special meeting for next week.

2409
04:12:00,633 --> 04:12:19,165
I think given the importance that the charter serves to the city, and the fact that changing it requires a lot of reflection and to one of the councillors points that it is quite literally the legal obligation of the council to scrutinize what's put forth in front of them.

2410
04:12:19,505 --> 04:12:20,546
It makes sense that you all

2411
04:12:21,194 --> 04:12:24,216
need more than a week to review such an important document.

2412
04:12:25,516 --> 04:12:34,260
And then I also just wanted to point out that, you know, there are, while I can, I certainly appreciate the survey that the committee did, I certainly filled it out myself.

2413
04:12:35,801 --> 04:12:42,144
It was only 663 people out of a roughly, you know, 58,000 city, 58,000 person city.

2414
04:12:43,625 --> 04:12:48,727
I think there's a lot of underrepresentation and that's not necessarily anyone's fault here.

2415
04:12:49,228 --> 04:12:49,728
But if we

2416
04:12:50,432 --> 04:13:12,630
are, you know, taking, uh, research and, um, academics that have done this work, um, to understand that, you know, the history of red lining based on racism and that has segregated the city, you know, including that of, you know, 93 separating the east and west, uh, parts of the city.

2417
04:13:12,650 --> 04:13:14,972
Um, those.

2418
04:13:16,470 --> 04:13:21,073
long-term effects will be reflected in ward district representation.

2419
04:13:21,173 --> 04:13:34,761
Again, I don't know all the specifics of it, but that's just to say that we can't decide that something is going to be representative because we're moving towards this without understanding the historical context of who lives where and why.

2420
04:13:36,602 --> 04:13:44,667
All to say, I think that moving this for another week for you all to review it, for the public to review it and come back, make more comment.

2421
04:13:46,120 --> 04:13:47,021
is certainly worth it.

2422
04:13:47,982 --> 04:13:56,289
And, you know, moving things forward under a sense of urgency without a quality check.

2423
04:13:56,609 --> 04:14:10,342
And, you know, everyone doing the whole point of this was to put more checks and balances into place for the city, where the mayor has a lot of executive power and

2424
04:14:11,679 --> 04:14:15,581
to say that, you know, the whole point of the council is to check that power.

2425
04:14:15,621 --> 04:14:16,381
I think it makes sense.

2426
04:14:17,102 --> 04:14:19,023
Anyway, that was rambling, but thanks so much.

2427
04:14:19,143 --> 04:14:19,583
Good night.

2428
04:14:22,624 --> 04:14:23,065
Thank you.

2429
04:14:23,345 --> 04:14:35,371
And I think just to that point, right, we have a survey that folks worked really hard to try to make representative, still ended up 82% homeowner, 18% renter in a city that's 55% homeowner, 45% renter.

2430
04:14:40,583 --> 04:14:44,985
We have the body of the work of the Charter Study Committee, immense research, lots of public outreach.

2431
04:14:46,766 --> 04:14:51,828
We have the body of work that the council's done, the council's individual councilor's positions.

2432
04:14:52,728 --> 04:15:04,593
We have councilors who have campaigned a lot, talked to a lot of people around the city for many years, received a significant endorsement from the city by being elected and the number of votes they received.

2433
04:15:05,174 --> 04:15:06,594
And I think a lot of this comes down to

2434
04:15:09,355 --> 04:15:16,599
You know, and again, right, word representation, the council has accepted the compromise submitted by the mayor.

2435
04:15:16,819 --> 04:15:17,619
That was the big issue.

2436
04:15:17,639 --> 04:15:22,722
It's 8-3, no one motioned to go to 5-4, it's 8-3.

2437
04:15:24,262 --> 04:15:27,724
There were some other things, most of them small, one of them large.

2438
04:15:30,766 --> 04:15:35,108
And that's what happens when there's a back and forth negotiation, but fundamentally,

2439
04:15:36,037 --> 04:15:48,326
All we have in terms of quote unquote knowing what the people think is each different body's interpretation of the work that they've done, and how the public engagement that they have.

2440
04:15:48,806 --> 04:15:49,366
That's what we have.

2441
04:15:50,947 --> 04:15:56,712
So, you know, a scientific poll if there was a scientific poll that was representative that said.

2442
04:15:58,392 --> 04:16:07,516
40% support, eight, three, 20% support, five, four, 10% support all at large, 10% support, only eight ward councilors.

2443
04:16:07,536 --> 04:16:09,016
It'd be very easy to make this decision.

2444
04:16:09,156 --> 04:16:14,218
We don't have that because it didn't happen because the resources weren't put out to do that.

2445
04:16:14,879 --> 04:16:24,482
So, you know, a lot of people on all sides of this, the council and others included have talked about what do the people want?

2446
04:16:24,522 --> 04:16:25,603
And this is what the people want.

2447
04:16:26,432 --> 04:16:34,696
We just have what we think the people want, and most of that is actually just based on what we think, and our opinions, and the work that we've done.

2448
04:16:35,597 --> 04:16:37,057
So, just putting that out there.

2449
04:16:37,598 --> 04:16:42,520
I'm going to go to the podium, name and address for the record please give three minutes.

2450
04:16:44,221 --> 04:16:48,223
Thank you, Counselor Beatty, Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, Medford Mass.

2451
04:16:48,843 --> 04:16:49,703
It's late.

2452
04:16:51,573 --> 04:16:54,635
A clarification, I'd like to ask two or three simple questions.

2453
04:16:55,836 --> 04:17:01,640
First one is, are we still going to be a strong mayor, plan A government, what's proposed?

2454
04:17:02,500 --> 04:17:03,481
Basically, yes.

2455
04:17:04,702 --> 04:17:05,282
Basically.

2456
04:17:05,342 --> 04:17:10,445
Technically, we're moving away from quote unquote plan A, but it retains the balance of power largely.

2457
04:17:10,465 --> 04:17:11,166
What's it called?

2458
04:17:11,226 --> 04:17:11,966
What's the term?

2459
04:17:12,166 --> 04:17:13,307
There is no term anymore.

2460
04:17:13,727 --> 04:17:16,789
It's a special act charter with a strong mayor and a weak council.

2461
04:17:17,890 --> 04:17:19,391
No term.

2462
04:17:19,471 --> 04:17:20,492
Second question is,

2463
04:17:21,537 --> 04:17:27,959
You have seven counselors presently, and what will it be if it goes through in the future?

2464
04:17:28,599 --> 04:17:36,041
As currently referred to the special meeting next week, 11 counselors, three at large, eight ward.

2465
04:17:37,141 --> 04:17:43,063
OK, so you're going to have to add some carpentry and furniture here, evidently, if it goes through.

2466
04:17:43,463 --> 04:17:45,904
It's one of the arguments I made that was most pilloried.

2467
04:17:48,144 --> 04:17:51,567
And also a lady was on the Zoom and she was asking a question.

2468
04:17:51,587 --> 04:17:58,492
I don't know if she got an answer, but she asked why was the mayor taken off the school committee?

2469
04:18:00,354 --> 04:18:01,935
That was a motion that was made tonight.

2470
04:18:04,177 --> 04:18:09,441
Councillor Collins presented it and there was a compelling enough

2471
04:18:10,264 --> 04:18:15,992
based on that presentation and previous discussions that it was adopted for consideration at next week's meeting.

2472
04:18:16,693 --> 04:18:20,178
Council Vice President Collins, and I'll pause your time, Andy, so that she can respond.

2473
04:18:21,313 --> 04:18:27,878
I'm not going to restate my rationale because I think I spent at least five minutes explaining myself earlier and nobody wants to be kept here for longer than necessary.

2474
04:18:28,459 --> 04:18:38,566
But to any folks who weren't present for that part of the meeting, I gave like a fairly long speech explaining my rationale for why I made the motion to remove the mayor from school committee.

2475
04:18:39,107 --> 04:18:50,015
And if folks want to watch that back on the live stream that's already on the city's YouTube and send me their thoughts and comments and show up to the special meeting next week, I think it'd be great to continue the conversation about this.

2476
04:18:54,555 --> 04:18:55,315
balance of power.

2477
04:18:57,837 --> 04:18:58,297
Thank you.

2478
04:18:58,317 --> 04:19:03,701
We have no hands on Zoom, so we will go stay at the podium.

2479
04:19:03,901 --> 04:19:07,003
Nate, name and address record of three minutes.

2480
04:19:07,923 --> 04:19:09,484
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2481
04:19:10,625 --> 04:19:16,328
Just a question for you, sir, because I know there were a lot of motions, I'm sorry, amendments that were part of this.

2482
04:19:18,049 --> 04:19:22,192
Was there an amendment made to get rid of the one-year

2483
04:19:23,262 --> 04:19:28,468
I'll call it residency requirement for a ward counselor that was proposed by the mayor.

2484
04:19:30,490 --> 04:19:39,659
There was an amendment that the language we changed to a word counselor shall be a voter in the word for which the office is sought so there's not a one year

2485
04:19:40,421 --> 04:19:41,121
pre-lookback.

2486
04:19:41,161 --> 04:19:48,585
There also was no one-year look back for at-large council, at-large school committee, at-large or district school committee or mayor.

2487
04:19:49,065 --> 04:19:55,008
So, it was added back in by the mayor only for the office of ward counselor but not for any other office.

2488
04:19:55,128 --> 04:19:55,989
So, that was removed.

2489
04:19:56,709 --> 04:19:56,949
Okay.

2490
04:19:56,989 --> 04:20:01,471
So, that and the rationale for that, I didn't I've been here the whole time.

2491
04:20:01,531 --> 04:20:02,412
So, I was paying attention.

2492
04:20:02,752 --> 04:20:04,493
I don't know if it was necessarily clear why the

2493
04:20:06,121 --> 04:20:07,602
I can tell you why I supported it.

2494
04:20:07,622 --> 04:20:13,187
It was a restriction on the word councilor office that wasn't applied to any other office in the charter.

2495
04:20:13,667 --> 04:20:24,876
So, if it was applied to every office, that's something you all would consider if it was applied evenly and the reason why I'm poking at this particular one is because I'm sorry, I'm not putting words in your mouth.

2496
04:20:25,536 --> 04:20:29,979
The reason why I'm poking at this is because it's been discussed, you know, by a number of people.

2497
04:20:30,000 --> 04:20:31,461
This is the city, right?

2498
04:20:31,481 --> 04:20:31,681
These

2499
04:20:35,453 --> 04:20:42,254
representation, especially in like a ward style, probably, you know, it's good to have someone that knows the ward.

2500
04:20:42,594 --> 04:20:44,595
I don't know how you establish really knowing it.

2501
04:20:44,655 --> 04:20:53,076
If say you moved in like six months before said election and decided to run for that ward, how much do you really know that ward kind of defeats the purpose.

2502
04:20:53,797 --> 04:21:00,778
So I guess that to me is a big deal that just changed between what was presented to you tonight

2503
04:21:01,657 --> 04:21:03,578
versus now it's gonna go back to the mayor.

2504
04:21:04,679 --> 04:21:09,001
But I see that this is one of those important things that really should be thought through.

2505
04:21:09,021 --> 04:21:11,362
And if it's not just for city councilor, great.

2506
04:21:12,002 --> 04:21:15,784
If it's for school committee or mayor, wonderful.

2507
04:21:15,824 --> 04:21:24,809
But I think the people should be electing people from the city that know the city and not necessarily just, you know, I'll use the term of Johnny come lately.

2508
04:21:25,769 --> 04:21:27,510
If there's a chance to codify that,

2509
04:21:28,387 --> 04:21:38,632
right, at least be around for a year, know your city, and especially if it's to establish that, knowing the ward, and that's the whole point, maybe a period of residency beforehand isn't a bad idea.

2510
04:21:39,112 --> 04:21:46,736
It's not saying homeowner versus renter, it's just saying you have to, I don't know if it's right, is it residency versus being a voter?

2511
04:21:46,996 --> 04:21:49,077
I don't know how that, it's registered voter.

2512
04:21:50,357 --> 04:21:53,639
But in essence, to be a registered voter in that ward, you'd be a resident, correct?

2513
04:21:55,384 --> 04:21:55,524
Yeah.

2514
04:21:55,924 --> 04:22:05,371
So, so it's it's semantics but but that to me is something y'all should really consider before striking because that I'm a big fan of that.

2515
04:22:05,411 --> 04:22:10,155
I think a lot of the members of the city would be too.

2516
04:22:10,435 --> 04:22:10,755
Thank you.

2517
04:22:12,236 --> 04:22:13,857
I'm going to finish public comment.

2518
04:22:15,959 --> 04:22:17,160
You've already spoken on this item.

2519
04:22:17,180 --> 04:22:19,601
I also have someone on Zoom who's already spoken on this item.

2520
04:22:19,621 --> 04:22:21,322
So, I'm going to give Matthew

2521
04:22:25,298 --> 04:22:28,220
Matthew H. Lieberman, 15 Canal Street first, the three items first.

2522
04:22:28,600 --> 04:22:31,382
RCV, you know, I'm not a fan.

2523
04:22:31,422 --> 04:22:32,083
I support it.

2524
04:22:32,103 --> 04:22:35,025
I support, you know, approval voting or star voting.

2525
04:22:36,246 --> 04:22:47,574
But regardless, I think one thing that hasn't been explored and perhaps something that you can see before the next meeting is the degree to which RCV can get passed through a citizen initiative rather than a homeowner petition.

2526
04:22:47,594 --> 04:22:49,095
That would be a good thing to get clarity on.

2527
04:22:50,056 --> 04:22:53,038
The second thing is there are people that are very toxic and they attack others.

2528
04:22:53,119 --> 04:23:11,876
Calling members of this body disgusting is particularly rich given the kind of glass house that people operate in the Charter Committee, in which some members were explicitly saying in meetings that they'd like to use the charter review process in order to make sure that progressives were taken out of the majority.

2529
04:23:11,996 --> 04:23:12,757
That is on record.

2530
04:23:12,797 --> 04:23:13,638
That is indisputable.

2531
04:23:14,473 --> 04:23:19,635
Third, now what Kit said, what Councilor Collins said is extremely important.

2532
04:23:19,655 --> 04:23:23,316
I think there's a false dichotomy between city manager versus strong mayor.

2533
04:23:24,916 --> 04:23:25,256
Is that it?

2534
04:23:26,677 --> 04:23:27,037
That's it.

2535
04:23:27,357 --> 04:23:27,997
Thanks, MJ.

2536
04:23:28,117 --> 04:23:32,278
I'll send my stuff about... Okay, I'll just shut up.

2537
04:23:32,438 --> 04:23:32,698
Thank you.

2538
04:23:33,719 --> 04:23:34,239
Thank you.

2539
04:23:35,259 --> 04:23:37,840
Go to the podium for a minute for your second comment.

2540
04:23:39,627 --> 04:23:44,410
Sure, yeah, I just want to, Mike Schoen has 1499 Main Street.

2541
04:23:47,412 --> 04:23:57,357
Just for like, there's like a really strong logistical reason to drop that weird one year, like arbitrary one year residency thing for a ward.

2542
04:23:58,678 --> 04:24:06,623
Because consider the situation real quickly, like if you live like one street over, and then you move one year, like you know the city,

2543
04:24:07,361 --> 04:24:09,483
People move in Medford all the time.

2544
04:24:10,224 --> 04:24:12,446
It's not that weird.

2545
04:24:14,748 --> 04:24:23,996
And if it is that big of an issue, then in theory, you will have another candidate step up who will be more competitive because they do know the city.

2546
04:24:27,169 --> 04:24:34,576
Like, it just does not make sense to have this restriction for you have to live in a ward for a year before you can possibly run in it.

2547
04:24:35,336 --> 04:24:38,519
Because just like the logistics of it, frankly, just don't make sense.

2548
04:24:38,639 --> 04:24:39,800
Like you're going to run into issues.

2549
04:24:40,160 --> 04:24:41,141
So that's it.

2550
04:24:41,181 --> 04:24:42,002
I just wanted to respond.

2551
04:24:42,102 --> 04:24:42,703
Thank you.

2552
04:24:42,723 --> 04:24:49,969
I'm going to go back to Zoom to Eunice for one minute for a second comment.

2553
04:24:53,132 --> 04:24:53,472
Go ahead.

2554
04:24:55,007 --> 04:24:55,787
Hi, thanks.

2555
04:24:55,888 --> 04:24:57,088
Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

2556
04:24:57,548 --> 04:25:02,091
I just have one quick comment, something that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.

2557
04:25:03,071 --> 04:25:08,994
You've all made various comments on the survey that the Charter Committee put out.

2558
04:25:09,174 --> 04:25:12,736
And in my opinion, at least, I feel like you've denigrated it a bit.

2559
04:25:13,697 --> 04:25:16,358
I would ask this question rhetorically, I guess.

2560
04:25:17,038 --> 04:25:19,820
How is that different from any other surveys

2561
04:25:20,340 --> 04:25:24,741
that have come out of any of the other departments from the city.

2562
04:25:24,781 --> 04:25:28,681
We got, what was it, 630 responses.

2563
04:25:29,562 --> 04:25:45,564
The Office of Planning and Sustainability puts out surveys on a pretty regular basis, whether it be on the trash or on renovating a local park or something else, and they get 600 or 700 responses.

2564
04:25:46,925 --> 04:25:48,765
Seemingly probably the same people

2565
04:25:49,335 --> 04:25:55,221
over and over again that take the time to, you know, complete a survey and return it.

2566
04:25:55,561 --> 04:26:02,568
Who's to say that the, you know, trash survey that they did, that that's what the city really wanted.

2567
04:26:02,688 --> 04:26:06,471
Only those 750 people that bothered to reply to the survey.

2568
04:26:06,491 --> 04:26:07,933
This is no different.

2569
04:26:08,433 --> 04:26:11,836
So, you know, denigrating it doesn't seem right to me.

2570
04:26:12,197 --> 04:26:12,457
Thanks.

2571
04:26:14,429 --> 04:26:14,969
Thank you.

2572
04:26:16,270 --> 04:26:18,252
As one person, I would agree with what you just said.

2573
04:26:18,292 --> 04:26:22,535
I think government by unscientific survey is not the best way to make decisions.

2574
04:26:23,236 --> 04:26:27,779
And that's why other information needs to be included as decision-making factors.

2575
04:26:29,901 --> 04:26:30,982
I will go to the podium.

2576
04:26:31,542 --> 04:26:33,503
Not a tit for tat, I promise.

2577
04:26:33,563 --> 04:26:34,965
Name and address for the record.

2578
04:26:35,485 --> 04:26:37,246
And just, we know you are Nate Merritt.

2579
04:26:37,286 --> 04:26:37,827
You have a minute.

2580
04:26:37,847 --> 04:26:38,247
Yeah, okay.

2581
04:26:38,587 --> 04:26:43,131
So if this doesn't get onto the November ballot,

2582
04:26:43,902 --> 04:27:01,717
Then the next option, I guess question for you is in the spring, a special election could be called, although I think the in within this document it says for the November 2025 election so we might have to pass something again, saying we want it for a special election.

2583
04:27:02,611 --> 04:27:14,162
It could go on a separate ballot in the 2026 cycle, but state law prohibits state elections and municipal matters from being on the same ballot.

2584
04:27:14,543 --> 04:27:18,527
So let's say this went on for November 2026, you'd get a ballot with

2585
04:27:19,640 --> 04:27:30,629
you know, Senator X and Representative X, and then you'd get a ballot with just the, maybe not just the question, but with just municipal matters, potentially just the question about the charter.

2586
04:27:30,929 --> 04:27:32,191
But that could happen in November.

2587
04:27:32,211 --> 04:27:34,152
It doesn't necessarily have to happen in the spring.

2588
04:27:35,173 --> 04:27:38,716
There could be a special election that would be called specially and separate.

2589
04:27:38,876 --> 04:27:39,717
It could also happen.

2590
04:27:40,357 --> 04:27:45,602
The point being, at least the Collins Center said here, there's two separate ballots, so it adds some logistical

2591
04:27:47,240 --> 04:27:53,244
issues potentially, or voters need to fill out both ballots, and then you have to keep the ballots separate, but it could happen.

2592
04:27:53,524 --> 04:27:53,664
Right.

2593
04:27:54,005 --> 04:28:03,071
I guess my only thing to consider is that this is a big deal that I don't know how turnout necessarily is for voters in spring elections versus November.

2594
04:28:03,411 --> 04:28:07,334
Special elections usually have lower turnout than non-special elections.

2595
04:28:07,494 --> 04:28:16,700
So I would think that this is probably one of those things you don't want to have in a special election if it's in the spring versus, and everyone knows, go out on the first Tuesday of the month in November, right?

2596
04:28:17,015 --> 04:28:17,175
Yeah.

2597
04:28:20,038 --> 04:28:20,258
All right.

2598
04:28:20,278 --> 04:28:22,179
Do we have any further public comment?

2599
04:28:24,561 --> 04:28:28,665
I'm going to go to Councillor Lemming, then Councillor Sang, then Councillor Collins, Councillor Lemming.

2600
04:28:30,527 --> 04:28:34,450
I'd like to apologize ahead of time for subjecting everybody to this, but can I share my screen?

2601
04:28:36,902 --> 04:28:48,327
Okay, yeah, so I actually kind of got into like, I was on a work trip a few weeks ago and I got into a research binge on this because, you know, I was kind of bored.

2602
04:28:48,947 --> 04:28:56,230
So I just started looking up the composition of charter study committees in other municipalities, who appointed who.

2603
04:28:56,250 --> 04:29:01,232
The real takeaway here is that there's not much of a pattern

2604
04:29:02,164 --> 04:29:05,567
Um, to it, like, I think that.

2605
04:29:06,607 --> 04:29:20,837
I was able to find three other instances in this list that a point where it was the executive of the town that appointed the charter study committee or the equivalent charter review committee themselves.

2606
04:29:21,778 --> 04:29:28,963
And that was, that was like a town manager or a town council president, like positions that did have.

2607
04:29:30,055 --> 04:29:44,507
The that did have the executive that were in what's the executive did have like a lot more checks over from the legislative body, but in other municipalities, like I don't yeah there's not a 333 between mayor.

2608
04:29:46,889 --> 04:29:48,730
council and the school committee.

2609
04:29:48,850 --> 04:29:50,791
There are some where the mayor gets more appointees.

2610
04:29:50,811 --> 04:30:01,255
There are some where the council president and the councilors get and the mayor get equal appointees and the school committee doesn't appoint anybody.

2611
04:30:01,615 --> 04:30:04,596
But there are also there are also others where

2612
04:30:05,167 --> 04:30:18,314
like Mashpee, for instance, where each, the mayor, the council, and the school committee get equal appointees, and the appointees of other independent bodies are also there as well.

2613
04:30:18,915 --> 04:30:23,637
In all cases that I could find, there was involvement from the city council.

2614
04:30:23,697 --> 04:30:33,302
Either the city council appointed or confirmed the study committee, or they got their own independent appointees, which is outlined in the current draft of the charter, which we just amended back to 333.

2615
04:30:34,763 --> 04:30:42,851
I do think that the school committee is affected by the charter.

2616
04:30:42,891 --> 04:30:48,276
They are largely governed by state law, but it does talk about the composition of the school committee.

2617
04:30:48,296 --> 04:30:54,342
So it is important for me personally to keep that balance of power.

2618
04:30:54,362 --> 04:30:54,983
So yeah, I just wanted

2619
04:31:00,038 --> 04:31:04,881
I just wanted to have an excuse to finally share that spreadsheet with the public.

2620
04:31:05,641 --> 04:31:06,702
So thank you.

2621
04:31:07,342 --> 04:31:08,823
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

2622
04:31:09,303 --> 04:31:14,066
I see Anthony from the Collins Center, I'm guessing on this specific point.

2623
04:31:14,146 --> 04:31:17,608
So I'll go to Anthony and then I'll go to Councilor Seng and then Councilor Collins.

2624
04:31:19,414 --> 04:31:23,498
Thank you, Mr chair, a really great spreadsheet.

2625
04:31:23,518 --> 04:31:32,045
I'd love to see that that data just 1 piece of context for the, for the body that a lot of people may not know is that in towns.

2626
04:31:33,046 --> 04:31:35,448
The select board is actually part of the executive branch.

2627
04:31:35,849 --> 04:31:39,011
So, just when you're looking when you see a select board, just remember that that is.

2628
04:31:39,923 --> 04:31:41,783
the executive in those in those types of communities.

2629
04:31:41,803 --> 04:31:43,704
So I just want to add that context for them.

2630
04:31:43,904 --> 04:31:46,905
Yeah, I was when I was apologies.

2631
04:31:47,685 --> 04:32:01,328
But when I was making the spreadsheet, I was trying to I was trying to sort of like fit different towns of different types of government into into a format that sort of those sort of limiting for it.

2632
04:32:02,528 --> 04:32:10,434
I attempted to note it when I didn't think that the strong mayor system was necessarily comparable to what you see in other municipalities.

2633
04:32:14,017 --> 04:32:20,861
And again, this was more of a weekend project for me.

2634
04:32:20,941 --> 04:32:25,645
So it's an imperfect piece of research, but I was doing a lot of reading about what I found in other areas.

2635
04:32:27,133 --> 04:32:28,014
Thank you, Anthony.

2636
04:32:28,074 --> 04:32:29,096
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

2637
04:32:29,997 --> 04:32:36,386
And I think the other thing to add on this around the school committee is school committee is also quasi-executive.

2638
04:32:36,706 --> 04:32:41,212
It has executive functions that the council does not have.

2639
04:32:42,355 --> 04:32:52,703
Not only appointing the chief executive of the schools, but also line item authority over the school budget, which as we've noted is 40 to 50% of the city budget.

2640
04:32:52,903 --> 04:32:56,065
So, when we talk about power and authority.

2641
04:32:56,966 --> 04:33:01,009
In many ways the school committee is as powerful or more powerful than the city council.

2642
04:33:08,267 --> 04:33:10,408
I'm between you and Micah you really covered my points.

2643
04:33:12,229 --> 04:33:21,954
I think to on on the one year residency requirement thing consistency was part of the reason I voted for the other reason is I think there are really.

2644
04:33:23,212 --> 04:33:36,831
concrete examples in Medford, where there are, I think a really great examples Pleasant Street, and that kind of corner right there by 93, where you can argue, I think a lot of people would feel like that is.

2645
04:33:38,893 --> 04:33:45,019
that Washington Street right there is part is close to Ward 1 or like is pretty integrated with Ward 1.

2646
04:33:45,399 --> 04:33:56,169
That's somewhere where during a redistricting process with boundary review, that might get shifted into Ward 1, but then we would prevent anyone in that block for running for City, for Ward Councillor.

2647
04:33:57,511 --> 04:34:01,815
Even though they've lived there the whole time, they're, they're pretty much in the neighborhood.

2648
04:34:02,580 --> 04:34:04,981
I think moving across the street is another great example.

2649
04:34:05,762 --> 04:34:10,184
We have a lot of, if you look at our ward map, it's not, it doesn't really line up with our neighborhood map.

2650
04:34:10,764 --> 04:34:17,347
And so there are a lot of nooks and crannies like that where people might be shifted in a redistricting process.

2651
04:34:19,789 --> 04:34:19,949
Yeah.

2652
04:34:20,289 --> 04:34:27,192
And I think it also is particularly impacts renters who may be moving from one part of the city or another due to the housing crisis.

2653
04:34:29,905 --> 04:34:39,972
still know the city pretty well may have served for many terms, but suddenly find themselves forced into another ward, and I think to build upon what we're seeing right now.

2654
04:34:39,992 --> 04:34:44,075
I do ultimately trust the voters to make that judgment if they feel like.

2655
04:34:44,731 --> 04:34:47,993
the the candidate doesn't know the district well enough.

2656
04:34:48,033 --> 04:34:51,555
I I assume that will come up as a at the ward election.

2657
04:34:52,256 --> 04:34:55,458
Um and so I think we have a check there that we can trust.

2658
04:34:56,338 --> 04:34:58,220
And we also review the election calendar tonight.

2659
04:34:58,500 --> 04:35:04,764
Um pulling up papers is at least five months before the election where they have to be a resident.

2660
04:35:05,524 --> 04:35:07,485
A voter registered voter within the ward.

2661
04:35:07,846 --> 04:35:07,966
So,

2662
04:35:14,449 --> 04:35:27,984
I only wanted to make the point that based on some of the hypotheticals that were being asked this evening, I have a concern that people are going to come out of this meeting saying this process is definitely going to happen in spring of 2026.

2663
04:35:28,044 --> 04:35:30,146
That is not an accurate thing to say.

2664
04:35:30,166 --> 04:35:36,273
And I want us to be proactive about not spreading that speculation in the community.

2665
04:35:37,434 --> 04:35:48,088
It's because I want this to go forward successfully that I support that I'm going to support the motion to have a special meeting on this next week and I just I

2666
04:35:50,520 --> 04:35:52,681
Every community is a fertile ground for rumors.

2667
04:35:52,761 --> 04:35:57,124
I don't want this to get out the gate and have people thinking this is definitely going to be a spring of 2026 election.

2668
04:35:57,144 --> 04:35:58,525
It's certainly not what I want.

2669
04:35:58,945 --> 04:36:03,507
And I don't think that this timeline at all locks us into that timeline.

2670
04:36:03,567 --> 04:36:09,371
And I feel very confident that we'll all be making best efforts to stick to the November 2025 timeline.

2671
04:36:09,391 --> 04:36:13,733
So I just wanted to be very clear about that because there was this question and questions about it just earlier.

2672
04:36:13,853 --> 04:36:14,133
Thank you.

2673
04:36:14,754 --> 04:36:16,315
And with that, I'd like to move the question.

2674
04:36:17,115 --> 04:36:17,595
Thank you.

2675
04:36:19,171 --> 04:36:23,674
We don't have any further comment from members of the council, members of the public on the main motion.

2676
04:36:23,694 --> 04:36:31,538
I will also just add that I think taking, sounded like there would have been a vote with no votes tonight.

2677
04:36:32,218 --> 04:36:46,887
If it taking a week gets us to a 7-0 result, I'm confident in our legislative delegation to be able to advance a unanimous council vote and the assent of the mayor through formal or informal session.

2678
04:36:49,903 --> 04:36:57,447
On the motion of Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilors Collins, Sang, Callahan, and Scarpelli.

2679
04:37:02,410 --> 04:37:03,471
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2680
04:37:07,072 --> 04:37:07,813
Councilor Callahan.

2681
04:37:08,313 --> 04:37:08,513
Yes.

2682
04:37:12,475 --> 04:37:13,716
Is that a yes, Councilor Callahan?

2683
04:37:16,698 --> 04:37:17,658
Yes, that was a yes.

2684
04:37:18,399 --> 04:37:18,699
Thank you.

2685
04:37:21,183 --> 04:37:22,043
Vice President Collins.

2686
04:37:23,564 --> 04:37:24,424
Councilor Lazaro.

2687
04:37:25,445 --> 04:37:25,885
Yes.

2688
04:37:27,185 --> 04:37:27,765
Councilor Lemming.

2689
04:37:29,206 --> 04:37:29,906
Councilor Scarpelli.

2690
04:37:29,926 --> 04:37:29,986
Yes.

2691
04:37:31,187 --> 04:37:31,747
Councilor Singh.

2692
04:37:31,767 --> 04:37:32,287
Yes.

2693
04:37:32,307 --> 04:37:32,927
President Beers.

2694
04:37:32,967 --> 04:37:34,428
Yes, and the affirmative, then the negative.

2695
04:37:34,448 --> 04:37:35,568
The motion passes.

2696
04:37:35,588 --> 04:37:47,853
24-054, sorry, 25-054 vacant building ordinance offered by Councilor Lemming and Councilor Lazaro, whereas the city has several commercial storefronts that have been vacant for a long period of time.

2697
04:37:48,513 --> 04:38:09,568
Whereas their opportunities to incentivize owners of such property to maintain and rent their storefronts active businesses, whereas active and well maintained databases of business owners in the city of Medford will allow for a more robust and prosperous business community, whereas full vibrant and bustling business districts and city of Medford will allow our community to improve visually and economically and add vitality to our squares and corridors.

2698
04:38:10,270 --> 04:38:20,434
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council adopt a vacant building ordinance which can be applied to incentivize these storefront properties to remain occupied, or otherwise encourage them to beautify their properties with public art.

2699
04:38:21,075 --> 04:38:27,157
Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the Building Commissioner and Economic Development Director, which committee?

2700
04:38:29,938 --> 04:38:32,700
Oh fun, you're gonna make me chair in Admin and Finance.

2701
04:38:34,320 --> 04:38:38,062
On the motion of Council, let me to refer to Admin and Finance, seconded by...

2702
04:38:39,425 --> 04:38:44,430
Seconded by Councillor saying any discussion I'll go to Councilor Lemming and then Councils are Council let me.

2703
04:38:46,291 --> 04:38:47,913
Wow, we still have more on this agenda.

2704
04:38:48,493 --> 04:38:48,793
Okay.

2705
04:38:52,497 --> 04:38:58,222
Yes, so this was an ordinance proposal that was a while and making.

2706
04:39:00,206 --> 04:39:16,066
Lazar and I received a message from the Chamber of Commerce, they received a lot of feedback that they're dissatisfied with some of the vacant storefronts, the continuously vacant storefronts, particularly in the West Medford area.

2707
04:39:17,288 --> 04:39:33,448
Currently it's being sat on by a fellow who owns it and is expecting whoever decides to rent it out to pay a large upfront capital cost to repair the whole thing, and there's just really not a whole lot of tools.

2708
04:39:33,928 --> 04:39:38,649
that the city has to be able to do anything about that.

2709
04:39:38,869 --> 04:39:47,812
What this ordinance allows is for the building commissioner to create first a registry of businesses in order to keep track of vacant businesses.

2710
04:39:47,872 --> 04:39:50,592
It also has provisions in there to

2711
04:39:55,074 --> 04:40:06,562
Enforcing long term vacancies to put up public art so that the storefronts are more visually appealing which would help the area pretty substantially.

2712
04:40:07,330 --> 04:40:16,618
and it would allow the city to charge a fee for maintaining this database to longer term vacancies.

2713
04:40:17,759 --> 04:40:28,247
This is designed to, this is modeled off of the version of the same ordinance that they came up with in East Hampton.

2714
04:40:29,168 --> 04:40:33,872
So I included in this agenda current draft language

2715
04:40:34,698 --> 04:40:43,901
I would further motion to send, just to expedite this, to send the draft language to legal for review to hear their feedback.

2716
04:40:43,921 --> 04:41:01,066
I would also motion to send this, as you said, to admin and finance so that we can have more discussions about this with the economic development director, the building commissioner, and the Medford Chamber of Commerce so that we can hear any potential edits that they may have to this.

2717
04:41:02,547 --> 04:41:02,787
Thank you.

2718
04:41:03,687 --> 04:41:14,743
On the motion of Councilor lemming to refer this to the committee on administration and finance and refer this to the building commissioner and city legal counsel for review.

2719
04:41:16,245 --> 04:41:16,966
Council is our.

2720
04:41:18,428 --> 04:41:18,889
Thank you.

2721
04:41:20,440 --> 04:41:22,721
Councilor Lemming really covered it pretty well.

2722
04:41:23,361 --> 04:41:30,444
This is something that the Chamber of Commerce is in favor of and supportive of and something we've talked about at length.

2723
04:41:30,844 --> 04:41:46,491
And I think it would be a great benefit to the city to have just baseline ways for us to make sure that our storefronts are being well maintained and keeping our business districts

2724
04:41:51,199 --> 04:41:55,242
vibrant and looking as lovely as possible.

2725
04:41:55,642 --> 04:42:06,710
If something is vacant for a period of time, that it can be beautified by public art, which is supportive of our local artists as well, so win-win.

2726
04:42:08,011 --> 04:42:18,799
Yes, this probably would have been in the section of the agenda that would refer to committee, so it's not really meant for us to be going carefully through the ordinance.

2727
04:42:19,580 --> 04:42:22,544
at this time, so we would have a lot more work to do on it still.

2728
04:42:24,567 --> 04:42:25,689
Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

2729
04:42:25,829 --> 04:42:33,820
To the petitioners or the offering Councilors, got to tell them which committee to send it to if you want it in the refer to committee section.

2730
04:42:35,008 --> 04:42:37,229
Good to know for next time.

2731
04:42:37,729 --> 04:42:38,269
Thank you.

2732
04:42:41,530 --> 04:42:41,830
All right.

2733
04:42:43,871 --> 04:42:44,811
I also just want to thank you.

2734
04:42:44,851 --> 04:42:46,632
I know that we discussed this about a year ago.

2735
04:42:46,652 --> 04:43:00,956
And it sounds like through work with the economic development team and the chamber, we're moving along on this path, which I think is important of not just carrots, but also understanding there are some sticky wickets and sticks are sometimes necessary.

2736
04:43:00,996 --> 04:43:02,277
So thank you for your work on this.

2737
04:43:03,277 --> 04:43:09,924
I will go to Matthew Page-Lieberman name and address for the record you have three minutes.

2738
04:43:12,106 --> 04:43:17,491
Yeah, I'm Matt Page-Lieberman 15 Canal Street, just disclosure I was behind the scenes on

2739
04:43:18,608 --> 04:43:21,791
on Councilor Lemming's campaign a couple years ago, this is something that we discussed.

2740
04:43:22,311 --> 04:43:25,495
There was an issue about being able to find sticks, not too many carrots.

2741
04:43:25,535 --> 04:43:28,017
They said, I'll put in some carrots in the platform.

2742
04:43:28,318 --> 04:43:30,540
I put in some, but there are some that I did not.

2743
04:43:31,000 --> 04:43:40,850
And those are the kinds of, still did not get to, but those are the kinds of things that I think the city should also consider, which is, you know, and City Hall has this idea for a,

2744
04:43:41,930 --> 04:43:44,937
you know, some tax incentives, tax cuts, really.

2745
04:43:45,398 --> 04:43:53,054
If you'll hire, you know, hire at least one person from the city, there are much more expansive things we can do, like incentivizing

2746
04:43:53,733 --> 04:43:58,275
worker cooperatives, or companies that pay a real living wage to their workers.

2747
04:43:58,995 --> 04:44:07,998
And all that they have a mission based companies that want to make sure that they help to address wealth and income disparities within our own community.

2748
04:44:08,038 --> 04:44:08,678
That's another thing.

2749
04:44:09,118 --> 04:44:11,759
It'd be good the economic development thinks about in this body thinks about.

2750
04:44:11,779 --> 04:44:12,120
Thank you.

2751
04:44:15,661 --> 04:44:16,181
Thank you.

2752
04:44:16,201 --> 04:44:20,723
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

2753
04:44:21,103 --> 04:44:21,863
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2754
04:44:24,542 --> 04:44:24,642
Yes.

2755
04:44:24,662 --> 04:44:24,862
Yes.

2756
04:44:24,882 --> 04:44:25,063
Yes.

2757
04:44:27,725 --> 04:44:27,985
Yes.

2758
04:44:29,686 --> 04:44:29,767
Yes.

2759
04:44:29,787 --> 04:44:29,847
Yes.

2760
04:44:29,867 --> 04:44:30,007
Yes.

2761
04:44:47,412 --> 04:44:49,013
I'm not going to ask.

2762
04:44:49,193 --> 04:44:51,193
Councilor Collins, if less folks mind.

2763
04:44:51,213 --> 04:44:58,536
This is a relatively form resolution in some discussions with some experts.

2764
04:45:00,911 --> 04:45:09,198
and folks who are working to have MassHealth work better to support children in Massachusetts with autism spectrum disorder.

2765
04:45:10,259 --> 04:45:17,685
There is a way that the state could change the way that it has care set up here.

2766
04:45:17,786 --> 04:45:24,892
Essentially right now, there's a large wait list of 2,000 to 3,500 children, ages two to five,

2767
04:45:28,044 --> 04:45:31,545
who aren't getting the care that they need because of a shortage of key practitioners.

2768
04:45:32,346 --> 04:45:44,831
And while specialists can diagnose autism by age to the average age of autism diagnosis in Massachusetts is 5.3 years old, and that can put children at risk of receiving critical critical intervention.

2769
04:45:46,782 --> 04:45:55,509
At a time of narrow and ever closing windows of human neurological development and basically what's happening here is Massachusetts has a two tier delivery model.

2770
04:45:56,109 --> 04:46:07,798
Rather than a three tier delivery model like some other states and adding what is called a board certified assistant applied behavior analyst has allowed these states to double the amount of

2771
04:46:09,050 --> 04:46:15,815
clients and young people who are able to be seen by board certified applied behavior analysts.

2772
04:46:15,995 --> 04:46:34,348
So this is a request that we urge the executive office of health and human services and MassHealth without delay to recognize this, implement this three tier model and add the role of an assistant behavioral analyst to the current system because it would

2773
04:46:35,047 --> 04:46:43,152
allow our system to see more young people and diagnose autism sooner, and it has been effective in other states.

2774
04:46:50,532 --> 04:46:53,695
Yes, I'd like to thank you for bringing this forward.

2775
04:46:54,155 --> 04:46:59,921
A lot of what I studied in grad school was autism.

2776
04:47:01,122 --> 04:47:08,328
I was in the psychiatry department over there, so this was a subject of research of mine.

2777
04:47:08,428 --> 04:47:10,070
It is early intervention.

2778
04:47:14,112 --> 04:47:23,683
in cases where the first symptoms of autism are showing up is huge for quality of life later on.

2779
04:47:24,204 --> 04:47:31,472
And I just want to express my appreciation for supporting proactive initiatives to get

2780
04:47:33,418 --> 04:47:41,685
to get children with autism spectrum disorder off the wait list so that they can get treatment sooner because it will have substantial long-term effects.

2781
04:47:41,885 --> 04:47:43,867
So I will happily support this.

2782
04:47:43,907 --> 04:47:44,227
Thank you.

2783
04:47:46,229 --> 04:47:46,689
Thank you.

2784
04:47:46,769 --> 04:47:48,171
And I would also just note that the

2785
04:47:49,199 --> 04:48:06,611
coalition to improve quality and end wait lists lists a number of organizations, including the mass association of school superintendents, masters professionals in behavior analysis, council of autism service providers, as well as 23 mayors, including mayor logo.

2786
04:48:08,752 --> 04:48:15,437
You want to say anything on the motion of councilor lemming to approve seconded by counselor Collins, any further discussion.

2787
04:48:17,762 --> 04:48:20,403
Seeing no discussion by counselors is there any discussion by members of the public.

2788
04:48:22,423 --> 04:48:23,744
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

2789
04:48:24,584 --> 04:48:25,284
Councilor Callahan.

2790
04:48:30,906 --> 04:48:31,526
Councilor Callahan.

2791
04:48:32,307 --> 04:48:34,067
We may have lost Councilor Callahan.

2792
04:48:35,948 --> 04:48:36,808
Vice President Collins.

2793
04:48:38,168 --> 04:48:38,969
Councilor Lazaro.

2794
04:48:39,369 --> 04:48:39,649
Yes.

2795
04:48:40,929 --> 04:48:41,469
Councilor Lemming.

2796
04:48:41,729 --> 04:48:42,650
Yes.

2797
04:48:44,803 --> 04:48:46,704
Councilor saying President bears.

2798
04:48:46,784 --> 04:49:03,333
Yes, I'm in 60 for me to what I've seen the motion passes to 5058 request request list request report on tree rules and keep in park be resolved with the dpw Commissioner and city arborist or back to the council with the reasons and process for true removal at Cape and Park Councilors capital.

2799
04:49:03,833 --> 04:49:13,398
Thank you, Mr. President, although both those departments didn't respond the residents that reached out and had some concerns.

2800
04:49:14,217 --> 04:49:42,024
did email me saying that he did speak with with a representative from the city and they explained the reasoning I believe is because of the construction work being done at Cape and Park basketball court that they had to take up those the existing trees which were full healthy trees I was told and then and there will be new trees

2801
04:49:44,426 --> 04:49:48,028
planted there as part of the project in completion.

2802
04:49:48,088 --> 04:49:50,610
So I just wanted to share that with everybody.

2803
04:49:50,910 --> 04:49:51,250
Thank you.

2804
04:49:51,771 --> 04:49:52,091
Thank you.

2805
04:49:52,111 --> 04:49:53,672
Is that a motion receiving place on file?

2806
04:49:53,692 --> 04:49:54,252
Yes, please.

2807
04:49:54,672 --> 04:49:57,594
On the motion receiving place on file by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by.

2808
04:49:57,614 --> 04:49:59,195
Seconded by Councillor Lemming.

2809
04:49:59,235 --> 04:49:59,735
Mr. Clerk, please.

2810
04:50:00,896 --> 04:50:02,057
Councillor Lazaro is still here, right?

2811
04:50:02,677 --> 04:50:02,857
Yep.

2812
04:50:03,037 --> 04:50:03,898
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2813
04:50:11,929 --> 04:50:15,892
Council Callahan is absent, Vice President Collins Councils are.

2814
04:50:19,155 --> 04:50:19,836
Sorry, yes.

2815
04:50:19,856 --> 04:50:21,838
That's a lemon.

2816
04:50:22,678 --> 04:50:23,399
Councilor Scarpelli.

2817
04:50:24,840 --> 04:50:26,842
Councilor saying, President bears.

2818
04:50:27,242 --> 04:50:29,444
Yes, 60 affirmative one absent the motion passes.

2819
04:50:30,545 --> 04:50:31,326
Do we read this whole thing.

2820
04:50:34,696 --> 04:50:50,553
I'll read it 25059 a resolution encouraging peace unity and constructive dialogue on the Israel Palestine conflict and condemning anti semitism offered by counselors Kelly, whereas city of Medford values diversity inclusivity and the peaceful coexistence of all citizens regardless of race, religion or national origin.

2821
04:50:51,414 --> 04:50:59,239
And whereas Medford is home to a vibrant diverse community including Jewish Muslim and other faith based populations who contribute to the social, cultural and economic fabric of our city.

2822
04:50:59,919 --> 04:51:09,906
And whereas the city council recognizes that Israel Palestine conflict is a complex and long standing issue with a history of suffering on both sides and acknowledges the pain and hardship faced by both Israelis and Palestinians.

2823
04:51:10,586 --> 04:51:16,391
And whereas Medford affirms that the right of Israel to exist and defend itself from violence should be recognized as an important principle of international law.

2824
04:51:16,951 --> 04:51:26,378
And whereas the city of Medford expresses sorrow over the tragic events of October 7 2023 when Hamas carried out an attack that led to the loss of over 1200 lives the abduction of innocent civilians.

2825
04:51:27,439 --> 04:51:35,149
And whereas Medford city of Medford condemns all acts of violence including terrorism and stands for victims of violence regardless of their national identity or religious background.

2826
04:51:35,769 --> 04:51:45,802
And whereas the city of entry recognize that anti semitism is a serious issue with a painful history, where we must and we must stand against all forms of hate and discrimination in our community and beyond, and whereas the city of Medford

2827
04:51:46,422 --> 04:51:54,485
also acknowledges the difficulties faced by Palestinians, including displacement and lack of a permanent homeland, and supports efforts to find peaceful resolution of their challenges.

2828
04:51:54,806 --> 04:52:13,013
And whereas the city of Medford believes the path forward in the Israel-Palestine conflict lies in peaceful dialogue, mutual respect, human-to-human rights for all individuals, regardless of ethnicity or religion, and whereas the city of Medford recognizes that while individuals may have differing views on the appropriate responses to the conflict, it is essential to ensure these differences

2829
04:52:13,578 --> 04:52:16,441
do not lead to division of our community or demonization of any group.

2830
04:52:17,161 --> 04:52:27,331
And whereas the city of Medford encourages dialogue and peaceful discussion as a means to foster understanding and believes that divisive actions, such as divestments or boycotts may undermine these efforts and should be approached with caution.

2831
04:52:28,152 --> 04:52:37,121
And whereas the city of Medford acknowledges the painful history of antisemitism and other forms of hatred, and reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that bigotry has no place in our city or our collective future.

2832
04:52:37,857 --> 04:52:48,637
Now therefore be it resolved that the city of Medford City Council condemns all forms of hate, including anti semitism and commits to fostering environment of respect and understanding for all people regardless of their background or identity.

2833
04:52:49,385 --> 04:53:11,050
affirms the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign state and its right to protect citizens from violence, encourages continued dialogue and efforts towards a peaceful and just resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict where the rights and dignity of Israelis and Palestinians are respected, supports the people of Medford in engaging in thoughtful, respectful dialogue on this important issue, recognizing the need for understanding and reconciliation between communities with differing viewpoints,

2834
04:53:12,062 --> 04:53:27,513
urges caution and considering measures such as divestment or boycotts and instead encourages actions that promote diplomacy mutual understanding and peace encourages all citizens of Medford to unite and sending its violence hatred and extremism in all forms while advocating for peace, security and justice for all people.

2835
04:53:28,650 --> 04:53:40,233
supports and supports educational efforts in the community to increase awareness and understanding of the complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and to promote constructive and respectful discussions on this and other important issues.

2836
04:53:40,894 --> 04:53:50,116
Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council will continue to encourage peace, unity, and understanding, and will work to create opportunities for meaningful dialogue among all members of Medford's diverse community.

2837
04:53:50,176 --> 04:53:52,357
Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Collins.

2838
04:53:53,518 --> 04:54:07,259
Mr President, and again this is, this was something that I'd rather not be talking about 12 o'clock at night because it is important but I think it's important that this was, this was an initiative that was put forth by.

2839
04:54:08,402 --> 04:54:34,482
not just one, but many Jewish residents that reached out and I've talked to, and this was crafted with their support and understanding that this obviously isn't an easy topic, but this has come about with especially neighboring communities that have been holding different movements and directly witnessing

2840
04:54:35,027 --> 04:54:46,503
The removal of swastika is another anti semitic propaganda that is really it's spewing hate and it's something that.

2841
04:54:47,203 --> 04:54:48,484
we don't want here in Medford.

2842
04:54:48,544 --> 04:54:59,549
And I wanted to make sure that the key piece of this whole resolution is made sure that people understood that to encourage peace and unity and understanding.

2843
04:54:59,609 --> 04:55:16,478
I think that's what the key phrase in when I've talked, when I've met with my Jewish residents and friends that said, George, this is important because they feel that at a time where we're seeing

2844
04:55:17,623 --> 04:55:30,382
concerns and issues with the, the, the, the dialogue that's being spread out, we're forgetting what people feel here and what people are feeling here is fair and.

2845
04:55:32,825 --> 04:55:50,630
Not to say that I've had some great dialogue with residents that are Jewish and have mentioned that this is I should take this resolution and dissolve it and get rid of it and, and I can understand and respect their input, but at the same time.

2846
04:55:51,357 --> 04:56:17,071
Um, as we said, as we became the welcoming city and we look at what we said many times today, even this afternoon, uh, it felt like, but as we talked about making sure that every member of our community feels welcome and feel safe and, um, and they feel like they've been heard, I think it was important that I followed through with this resolution and, uh, not everybody's going to, uh, going to agree with that, but that's fine.

2847
04:56:17,491 --> 04:56:18,592
Um, um, I,

2848
04:56:19,132 --> 04:56:42,358
you know, I, I think again, the motive at the end of this is making sure that, uh, looking at this resolution and having an open dialogue of peace and unity and understanding, uh, what our opportunities are here to have a dialogue, to not have Medford be, um, be, uh, dragged into something, um,

2849
04:56:43,017 --> 04:56:50,019
something negative, something that's even worse that's going on around the world.

2850
04:56:50,099 --> 04:56:57,701
So I appreciate my colleagues for letting me put this on the agenda and sharing this.

2851
04:56:58,041 --> 04:57:05,384
And I hope that our members of our Jewish community that have felt this pain and feel the fear that

2852
04:57:07,283 --> 04:57:15,114
They know that this Council and the city are behind them and know that we support their endeavors.

2853
04:57:15,434 --> 04:57:15,955
So thank you.

2854
04:57:17,156 --> 04:57:19,019
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

2855
04:57:21,843 --> 04:57:22,804
Thank you, President Behrs.

2856
04:57:24,998 --> 04:57:31,660
So I remember the very first resolution that I ever sponsored after becoming Medford's first Jewish city councilor.

2857
04:57:31,680 --> 04:57:40,823
It was about condemning anti-Semitism because it was in the wake of an unintentional but still real and painful anti-Semitic event that occurred in Medford in December of 2021.

2858
04:57:42,838 --> 04:57:49,481
I know that the councilor's intention with this resolution was simply to make Jewish residents, or at least certain Jewish residents, feel supported.

2859
04:57:50,142 --> 04:57:58,486
But this resolution makes omissions that imply that supporting Jews is contingent on ignoring, erasing, and minimizing the genocide in Palestine.

2860
04:57:58,526 --> 04:58:02,528
And as a Jew, I find that offensive, unhelpful, and unacceptable.

2861
04:58:03,708 --> 04:58:08,011
This city council has already passed a resolution about Israel and Palestine in March of 2024.

2862
04:58:08,651 --> 04:58:10,772
On that one, frankly, I think we got it right.

2863
04:58:11,570 --> 04:58:25,017
Jewish, Arab, and Muslim residents and allies came together, we collaboratively crafted a statement that did not receive universal support, but earned hours of impassioned support from community members, many of whom had never been inside these council chambers before.

2864
04:58:25,717 --> 04:58:31,200
In that statement, we condemned the murder of Israelis by terrorists on October 7th and the taking of hostages.

2865
04:58:31,780 --> 04:58:46,872
We did not fail to condemn the murder of Palestinians by the IDF for every single month since then the taking of political prisoners terrorism in the West Bank by Israeli settler extremists and Israeli war crimes to name one but not the other.

2866
04:58:47,348 --> 04:59:07,395
However, unintentionally sends a very strong message that messages, some pain is more real and more important than other pain to specifically mourn the 1200 Israelis murdered by Hamas on October 7 2023, but with no acknowledgement of the over 62,000 Palestinians murdered since then in Gaza by the IDF.

2867
04:59:08,435 --> 04:59:18,438
which, according to the Lancet Medical Journal, could be undercounted by up to 40% and does not even include the over 100,000 people who have died of starvation and disease in Gaza.

2868
04:59:19,566 --> 04:59:31,249
and does not include Palestinians murdered by extremist Israeli settler terrorism in the West Bank, that is participating in the dehumanization that allows this genocide to continue unchecked.

2869
04:59:31,830 --> 04:59:42,873
And to affirm Israel's right to exist while failing to mention Palestine's right to exist is offensive to Palestinians in our community and perpetuates a false, unhelpful right-wing ideology.

2870
04:59:43,433 --> 04:59:50,559
It is incredibly radical to suggest, as this resolution does, that the Palestinians, quote, lack a permanent homeland.

2871
04:59:51,540 --> 04:59:57,125
The city of Medford cannot be in the business of normalizing this objectively fringe and right wing opinion.

2872
04:59:58,726 --> 05:00:04,531
If the council is going to be bold enough to weigh in on Israel and Palestine, we should be bold enough to call things what they are.

2873
05:00:05,223 --> 05:00:07,825
What's happening in Palestine is not, quote, hardship.

2874
05:00:08,285 --> 05:00:09,245
It's not difficulty.

2875
05:00:09,385 --> 05:00:10,286
It's not complexity.

2876
05:00:10,366 --> 05:00:11,247
It is war crimes.

2877
05:00:11,707 --> 05:00:12,547
It is genocide.

2878
05:00:12,727 --> 05:00:13,528
It is apartheid.

2879
05:00:15,138 --> 05:00:19,281
Supporting Jews is not contingent on erasing the genocide of Palestinians.

2880
05:00:19,862 --> 05:00:28,008
Supporting Jews is not contingent on erasing the solidarity, pain, and outrage that so many Jews share with Palestinian victims of genocide.

2881
05:00:28,929 --> 05:00:39,897
Personally, I will never support any language that clearly does not dare to weight all human life as equal, knowing that as a Jew, I'm supposed to read this with gratitude.

2882
05:00:41,727 --> 05:00:48,396
Further, I find it really irresponsible to force anti-Semitism and Israel and Palestine together into one topic.

2883
05:00:48,996 --> 05:00:52,441
The implication is that it's anti-Semitic to criticize Israel.

2884
05:00:52,461 --> 05:00:53,923
That is false.

2885
05:00:54,704 --> 05:00:57,127
That is a false premise that we must not entertain.

2886
05:00:58,501 --> 05:01:11,334
Right now we are in a moment where many people, including many people in our community, including many Jews like me in our community, are actively exercising their free speech to criticize Israeli genocide, Israeli war crimes, Israeli terrorism.

2887
05:01:12,455 --> 05:01:20,904
In response, across America, conservative movements are weaponizing the language of Jewish safety and weaponizing accusations of anti-Semitism

2888
05:01:22,143 --> 05:01:26,324
in a coordinated effort to delegitimize criticism of Israel.

2889
05:01:27,044 --> 05:01:32,405
They see clearly that a good way to shut people up is by suggesting that they are being anti-Semitic.

2890
05:01:33,025 --> 05:01:37,186
And that is why we cannot afford to entertain this false premise anywhere.

2891
05:01:38,006 --> 05:01:40,787
Even here at Medford City Hall, we cannot entertain this.

2892
05:01:41,387 --> 05:01:45,628
It is dangerous, it is corrosive, it stifles free speech, and it silences Jews.

2893
05:01:46,828 --> 05:01:47,048
Again,

2894
05:01:47,877 --> 05:01:53,922
I really do want to be clear, I appreciate any opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ending anti-Semitism.

2895
05:01:54,502 --> 05:01:56,564
Anti-Semitism is real and deadly.

2896
05:01:57,105 --> 05:02:03,029
which is why we should not allow it to be twisted into a tool for stifling pro-Palestinian activism.

2897
05:02:03,889 --> 05:02:09,753
It does not make Jews safer when we cheapen a real phenomenon with irrelevant and politicized conflations.

2898
05:02:10,474 --> 05:02:23,903
It does not help Jews when we reaffirm right-wing messaging that ignores or legitimizes the genocide and the war crimes that occur every day with American tax dollars, when we legitimize false claims about the dangers of peace activism.

2899
05:02:24,718 --> 05:02:37,952
It really makes me wonder how weak does a person have to think Jews are, that our safety is contingent not only on the eradication of Palestinians, but on that genocide also going unmentioned and unprotested.

2900
05:02:40,034 --> 05:02:46,241
At best, that premise treats Jews like children, and at worst, it allows us to be used like pawns.

2901
05:02:48,192 --> 05:02:54,575
If we want to pass a different resolution that aligns with the language we passed last year, that would be fine with me, but this isn't it.

2902
05:02:55,596 --> 05:03:06,462
This language takes more issue with certain forms of protest than it does with a historic genocide that is directly affecting members of our community who have family in or displaced from Palestine.

2903
05:03:07,522 --> 05:03:16,367
And I have no idea why we would entertain the notion that the city of Medford should weigh in on how its residents should or should not exercise their constitutional right to protest.

2904
05:03:17,531 --> 05:03:19,072
We are counselors, not parents.

2905
05:03:19,713 --> 05:03:22,094
It is not our job to tell people how to use their free speech.

2906
05:03:22,755 --> 05:03:28,879
It is condescending and we should not pretend that it is anything other than irrelevant to the goal of supporting and protecting Jews.

2907
05:03:30,761 --> 05:03:36,165
I also know that there are people who will agree with what I've said tonight and those who won't, that's also fine.

2908
05:03:36,765 --> 05:03:43,190
There's obviously a difference of opinion on this within and outside of the Jewish community and anyone who pretends otherwise is lying.

2909
05:03:44,460 --> 05:03:54,724
But that doesn't make it okay for this council to normalize, however unintentionally, right-wing messaging that uses Jewish identities as an excuse for stifling free speech and protest.

2910
05:03:56,005 --> 05:04:08,210
It doesn't make it okay for this council to conspicuously fail to stand equally strongly against anti-Palestinian hate and anti-Palestinian rhetoric as we continue to condemn the poison of antisemitism.

2911
05:04:09,170 --> 05:04:14,232
And it certainly isn't for anyone outside of the Jewish community to tell any Jews how we should feel about it.

2912
05:04:15,378 --> 05:04:16,138
a motion to table.

2913
05:04:18,840 --> 05:04:21,061
Motion to table by Councilor Collins.

2914
05:04:21,101 --> 05:04:22,281
Is there a second on the motion?

2915
05:04:25,843 --> 05:04:29,285
Motion to table by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2916
05:04:30,925 --> 05:04:33,947
Council, yes, a motion to table is undebatable.

2917
05:04:33,967 --> 05:04:38,709
Is there any further discussion?

2918
05:04:38,889 --> 05:04:39,769
Well, it's undebatable.

2919
05:04:39,810 --> 05:04:40,650
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2920
05:04:44,583 --> 05:04:45,664
Councilor Callahan is absent.

2921
05:04:46,004 --> 05:04:46,864
Vice President Collins.

2922
05:04:48,285 --> 05:04:49,086
Councilor Lazaro.

2923
05:04:49,586 --> 05:04:49,866
Yes.

2924
05:04:51,227 --> 05:04:51,787
Councilor Lemming.

2925
05:04:56,170 --> 05:04:57,110
Can't vote present.

2926
05:05:01,293 --> 05:05:01,593
Sorry.

2927
05:05:01,953 --> 05:05:02,153
No.

2928
05:05:06,896 --> 05:05:07,036
Oh.

2929
05:05:08,197 --> 05:05:08,657
All right.

2930
05:05:11,690 --> 05:05:12,810
So I think we're just gonna have to mark you.

2931
05:05:13,451 --> 05:05:14,571
I'll mark him as present.

2932
05:05:15,011 --> 05:05:15,691
Okay, that's fine.

2933
05:05:16,912 --> 05:05:17,672
If it's because of that.

2934
05:05:17,872 --> 05:05:18,732
Yeah, because of that.

2935
05:05:19,432 --> 05:05:19,673
All right.

2936
05:05:20,813 --> 05:05:21,533
Councilor Scarpelli.

2937
05:05:23,674 --> 05:05:24,214
Councilor Sang.

2938
05:05:24,514 --> 05:05:24,654
Yeah.

2939
05:05:25,234 --> 05:05:25,874
President Behrs.

2940
05:05:25,995 --> 05:05:31,036
Yes, for the affirmative one and the negative one present the motion is tabled.

2941
05:05:33,497 --> 05:05:34,157
And one absent.

2942
05:05:34,717 --> 05:05:35,237
One, one, one.

2943
05:05:35,598 --> 05:05:36,318
Four, one, one.

2944
05:05:49,183 --> 05:05:57,126
Oh a participation to participate outside of zoom please email a her to be submitted for an ma.gov.

2945
05:05:57,246 --> 05:06:04,069
This is the part of the meeting where anyone can participate on any issue for three minutes the Council cannot take votes.

2946
05:06:13,922 --> 05:06:18,183
I have a hand on Zoom, unless there's anyone who wants to speak in the chamber.

2947
05:06:20,684 --> 05:06:22,085
Who's in line first?

2948
05:06:22,205 --> 05:06:23,105
Somebody go first.

2949
05:06:24,106 --> 05:06:26,566
All right, we'll start here, three minutes.

2950
05:06:27,127 --> 05:06:30,988
Name and address for the record, please, and then we'll go to Zoom, and then we'll come back to the chamber.

2951
05:06:31,488 --> 05:06:33,269
Ezekiel Silverstein, Kenya Road.

2952
05:06:33,449 --> 05:06:34,689
We've been here five hours.

2953
05:06:34,989 --> 05:06:39,691
I hope you can give me three minutes, and I hope my being here this long gives weight to my statement.

2954
05:06:40,331 --> 05:06:47,233
I'm here to speak in favor of cancer Scarpelli resolution encouraging peace unity and constructive dialogue and condemning anti semitism.

2955
05:06:48,354 --> 05:06:57,757
Since October 7 2023 when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and committed unspeakable atrocities targeted at civilians, the Jewish community worldwide

2956
05:06:58,933 --> 05:07:06,718
and locally has been shocked by the market increase in anti-Semitism as evidenced by studies conducted by numerous reputable organizations.

2957
05:07:07,098 --> 05:07:15,503
The state legislature has convened a special commission on combating anti-Semitism as a result of local Massachusetts anti-Semitism that we've seen.

2958
05:07:16,423 --> 05:07:27,630
On the topic of the horrific actions specifically targeting civilians in Israel, the joy and celebration seen across the world, even here in the United States and in Medford, is exceptionally painful to see.

2959
05:07:28,350 --> 05:07:36,657
just a small amount of context, half the world's Jewish population lives in Israel, and it is the historic homeland of the Jewish people, of the Jewish nation.

2960
05:07:36,677 --> 05:07:45,704
In the same way, an Irish American or an Indian American can feel a connection to their homelands and their ethnic brethren, not religious brethren, ethnic brethren.

2961
05:07:45,724 --> 05:07:47,285
We are a people, not just religion.

2962
05:07:48,328 --> 05:07:51,829
Many Jewish Americans feel a strong connection to their homeland in Israel as well.

2963
05:07:52,489 --> 05:08:02,813
Zionism is the belief that like any other nation's aspirations for self determination, the Jewish nation has a right to the state to a state in the historic homeland as well.

2964
05:08:03,093 --> 05:08:07,014
It is not mutually exclusive to a free and independent Palestine.

2965
05:08:07,554 --> 05:08:14,443
In fact, a two-state solution is indeed Zionist in nature, and well over 80% of Jewish Americans support this stance.

2966
05:08:14,503 --> 05:08:16,466
It's not a left-wing or right-wing issue.

2967
05:08:16,786 --> 05:08:19,270
That is the consensus of the Jewish community.

2968
05:08:21,264 --> 05:08:31,429
In the last 18 months in Medford and in the greater Boston area, we have seen marches, graffiti, and statements that are incredibly hurtful to hear and border on anti-Semitism, if not being outright anti-Semitic.

2969
05:08:31,889 --> 05:08:42,454
Slogans like globalize the Intifada and from the river to the sea that called for the elimination of the world's only Jewish state and the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Jews harken back to dark days.

2970
05:08:43,014 --> 05:08:50,458
Calling it for the elimination of Israel or engaging in a Holocaust inversion, which we've seen here today, is certainly anti-Semitic.

2971
05:08:51,078 --> 05:09:06,038
Jewish residents of Medford have been isolated and denigrated based on our ethnicity and connection to our homeland, and to our brothers and sisters, 59 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza by Hamas terrorists, including an American civilian or citizen, even Alexander.

2972
05:09:07,589 --> 05:09:18,299
As we all know, city councils have no international jurisdiction and attempts to pass motions and resolutions pertaining to such are mostly symbolic, but residents of these communities feel strongly about them.

2973
05:09:18,699 --> 05:09:20,921
Hence why I'm still here after five hours tonight.

2974
05:09:22,219 --> 05:09:31,224
One-sided ceasefire or boycott resolutions do nothing but tear communities apart, isolate one group at the expense of another, and stifle any attempt to dialogue.

2975
05:09:31,964 --> 05:09:45,451
I strongly support Councilman Scarpelli's resolution that condemns all types of ethnic and faith-based hate, encourages cross-community dialogue, and urge caution regarding divisive measures that do nothing but sow discord in our city.

2976
05:09:45,811 --> 05:09:46,091
Thank you.

2977
05:09:46,935 --> 05:09:47,535
Thank you.

2978
05:09:47,815 --> 05:09:50,557
We'll go to Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom.

2979
05:09:51,637 --> 05:09:52,718
Name and address for the record, please.

2980
05:09:52,738 --> 05:09:53,478
You have three minutes.

2981
05:09:53,958 --> 05:10:01,381
Yeah, I'm just trying to really understand what's going on here, because, you know, when I saw this resolution today through the chair, I called Councillor Scarpelli asking what it was about.

2982
05:10:01,822 --> 05:10:09,225
I was told that it was about people at a rally to Somerville last week to try to get end of contracts with Israel.

2983
05:10:09,773 --> 05:10:12,334
were carrying swastikas and that these were removed by police.

2984
05:10:12,374 --> 05:10:14,755
I told Councilor Scarpelli, I cannot find this in the news.

2985
05:10:14,775 --> 05:10:17,896
He said that firsthand, he saw people carrying swastika posters.

2986
05:10:18,336 --> 05:10:21,777
I did not hear that in the resolution tonight, any of the text, I don't understand.

2987
05:10:22,438 --> 05:10:24,138
And I do agree completely with Councilor Collins.

2988
05:10:24,378 --> 05:10:28,680
As a Jew, I've heard anti-Semitic things all my whole life, up and down the East Coast of the U.S.

2989
05:10:28,700 --> 05:10:29,260
and in Brazil.

2990
05:10:29,720 --> 05:10:29,860
What?

2991
05:10:29,900 --> 05:10:32,601
Matt, MJ, MJ, one second, I'm gonna pause your time.

2992
05:10:32,861 --> 05:10:33,922
Councilor Scarpelli.

2993
05:10:34,563 --> 05:10:39,407
that there was an incident in a neighboring community where there was swastikas.

2994
05:10:39,467 --> 05:10:40,087
I did say that.

2995
05:10:40,688 --> 05:10:42,209
That's what I did say.

2996
05:10:44,470 --> 05:10:44,811
Thank you.

2997
05:10:44,891 --> 05:10:45,631
Evan Cheng, go ahead.

2998
05:10:45,651 --> 05:10:46,952
No, I completely agree with that.

2999
05:10:47,052 --> 05:10:55,258
I mean, look, I called somebody out for anti-Semitism two days ago, and I'm not going to try not to cry, but I buried my grandmother.

3000
05:10:55,799 --> 05:10:58,561
I mean, it was at the funeral of my grandmother, and she was Jewish.

3001
05:11:00,721 --> 05:11:04,964
Antisemitism is something extremely important to me, but this particular resolution, I don't understand what's going on.

3002
05:11:04,984 --> 05:11:07,966
I don't understand this resolution, the text.

3003
05:11:08,126 --> 05:11:09,687
I don't understand what's going on.

3004
05:11:10,187 --> 05:11:23,897
If we're only caring about the lives of one people, and we're talking about the violence in the Middle East, and we're acknowledging the pain of Jewish suffering, and we're just, Palestinians are just, they're not even a footnote, I find that extremely problematic, and I agree with Councilor Collins.

3005
05:11:24,925 --> 05:11:25,446
Extremely.

3006
05:11:25,906 --> 05:11:30,168
During a genocide, you don't acknowledge the suffering of people exponentially suffering more.

3007
05:11:31,329 --> 05:11:34,711
Now, there are a couple other things earlier about charter review.

3008
05:11:36,752 --> 05:11:41,174
I guess I've kind of run out of time, but there are a couple things that were left off the table by the Charter Study Committee.

3009
05:11:42,114 --> 05:11:44,856
One of the things is participatory budgeting, and I'm glad that Councillor

3010
05:11:46,197 --> 05:11:55,343
on Callahan and is going to be working with Councilor Seng and Councilor Lemming, but that's mostly work that should be done at the mayor's office.

3011
05:11:56,264 --> 05:11:59,426
I worked with Stephanie Muccini-Burke about this a decade ago.

3012
05:11:59,466 --> 05:12:05,090
I met with Alicia Nunley and basically we didn't get a participatory budgeting because I was working on other things.

3013
05:12:05,150 --> 05:12:07,911
I didn't follow up with that, but that can be done through the mayor's office.

3014
05:12:08,352 --> 05:12:10,073
It's limited what the Congress, what the

3015
05:12:10,653 --> 05:12:14,555
legislature can do as far as getting PB since the mayor writes the budget.

3016
05:12:15,495 --> 05:12:20,957
And then the last thing as far as what Councillor Collins was talking about, yeah, the Charter Study Committee left a lot of things on the table.

3017
05:12:20,977 --> 05:12:28,339
There are reasons that we have juries where they try to select for people that are impartial, and the same reason we have double blind studies.

3018
05:12:28,660 --> 05:12:35,042
There are people that were in the meeting, the Charter Study Committee saying, I want a mayor, I want a mayor, and I reprimanded folks for talking about this before they even

3019
05:12:35,582 --> 05:12:59,887
you know I'm saying before they even ask the public and so you know people already have a preference it's it's going to result in how much information is provided the public about alternative options so they can really consider those outside of a strong mayor so I completely rise and support once again Councillor Collins for saying that the committee did not really really really do a process of providing education the community talk about all the alternatives so people could in the community make the most informed decision about the available options thank you.

3020
05:13:02,584 --> 05:13:05,747
Thank you go back to the podium name and address for the record you have three minutes.

3021
05:13:06,929 --> 05:13:09,892
My name is Michael Kesselman at 499 Main Street.

3022
05:13:11,073 --> 05:13:16,078
I hate that I have to do this but I'm going to say, I also go by Micha Shalom Kesselman.

3023
05:13:16,098 --> 05:13:19,522
I also go by Micha Shalom Kesselman.

3024
05:13:20,042 --> 05:13:20,623
I am Jewish.

3025
05:13:21,564 --> 05:13:24,127
I am arguably extremely Jewish.

3026
05:13:25,783 --> 05:13:28,904
straight Talmud, I have to fill in from my grandparents.

3027
05:13:28,944 --> 05:13:35,487
My family was instrumental in getting Jews out of the Soviet Union before it collapsed as refugees into the US.

3028
05:13:38,268 --> 05:13:41,610
George, I understand that you approach us with the best.

3029
05:13:41,650 --> 05:13:45,751
Sorry, person next to George Scapelli.

3030
05:13:46,852 --> 05:13:53,454
I believe that Councilor Scapelli brought this to the table with the best of intentions.

3031
05:13:55,331 --> 05:14:02,614
So if I come off as angry, please understand that's not towards you.

3032
05:14:03,975 --> 05:14:15,080
However, that resolution is offensive for a litany of reasons to the Jewish community at large, specifically to diaspora Jews.

3033
05:14:15,860 --> 05:14:16,620
I am not Israeli.

3034
05:14:18,061 --> 05:14:19,702
I don't ever want to go to Israel.

3035
05:14:19,802 --> 05:14:20,902
It's an apartheid state.

3036
05:14:21,883 --> 05:14:24,844
It is a state that actively

3037
05:14:25,513 --> 05:14:30,736
wants the rest of the world to engage in anti-Semitism so that we all move to Israel.

3038
05:14:31,316 --> 05:14:32,137
I am not Israeli.

3039
05:14:35,078 --> 05:14:48,725
Conflating anti-Zionism, and I would consider myself very much anti-Zionist, with anti-Semitism is beyond insulting.

3040
05:14:48,865 --> 05:14:51,827
And it's the equivalent of saying that

3041
05:14:53,324 --> 05:15:01,528
An Italian American as a Catholic is loyal to the Pope before the president of the US or before the US as a nation.

3042
05:15:02,228 --> 05:15:02,989
It's crazy.

3043
05:15:03,549 --> 05:15:05,190
It's absurdly insulting.

3044
05:15:06,670 --> 05:15:16,475
Moreover, well, if you are not super familiar with this particular issue and divide within the Jewish community, specifically in the diaspora,

3045
05:15:19,632 --> 05:15:25,929
There is clearly coded language in that resolution, attacking the

3046
05:15:27,544 --> 05:15:35,151
mode of protest that some call for, known as boycott, divest, sanction.

3047
05:15:35,611 --> 05:15:40,855
It is firmly couched in anti-BDS terms.

3048
05:15:41,576 --> 05:15:46,560
And that is a valid, totally reasonable way of protesting.

3049
05:15:46,980 --> 05:15:55,708
Say, I don't want to have anything to do with an apartheid, genocidal, fundamentally actually anti-Semitic itself government.

3050
05:15:57,607 --> 05:16:02,713
It is, there should be a dialogue, I agree.

3051
05:16:03,794 --> 05:16:13,226
But there is a concerted effort by certain elements of the Jewish community who want to conflate anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism.

3052
05:16:14,567 --> 05:16:16,570
There's inarguably an

3053
05:16:19,472 --> 05:16:28,419
Basically an anti semitism industrial complex, because organizations are able to pull money by rallying up fear were anti semitism.

3054
05:16:28,560 --> 05:16:34,124
So if you could, and it is a complex, I'll wrap it up, it is a complex nexus of issues.

3055
05:16:34,725 --> 05:16:40,010
So if you do indeed want to bring forth a resolution that is

3056
05:16:41,462 --> 05:16:46,825
representatives of representative of the needs and and issues that the Jewish community in Medford faces.

3057
05:16:47,485 --> 05:16:51,708
And I think that's a totally valid and wonderful thing to bring to the table.

3058
05:16:53,329 --> 05:16:59,092
It needs to be done with input from the entire Medford Jewish community.

3059
05:16:59,552 --> 05:17:01,053
I don't know who wrote drafted that for you.

3060
05:17:01,273 --> 05:17:03,034
I have an idea, but I don't know who did it.

3061
05:17:03,614 --> 05:17:04,575
But they did.

3062
05:17:05,678 --> 05:17:13,261
you a disservice, they did the city council a disservice, and they did the Jews who do not agree with them a disservice.

3063
05:17:14,041 --> 05:17:15,842
It is an awful resolution.

3064
05:17:15,922 --> 05:17:17,362
Thank you for your comment.

3065
05:17:18,283 --> 05:17:19,543
I just want to note it was tabled.

3066
05:17:20,163 --> 05:17:31,768
So this is where this public participation piece gets a little messy, is what should we be talking about.

3067
05:17:36,620 --> 05:17:55,735
I'll go, we'll say we don't have any hands will stay at the podium, name and name and address the record three minutes, a mirror through some through Riverside have I'm not talking about this topic, something completely different that's allowable that's yeah that's okay cool honestly I'm uncertain, I'm going to pause your time as the chair I'm legitimately uncertain as to whether

3068
05:17:56,778 --> 05:18:03,302
If a resolution is tabled, we should be able to talk about it in the open public participation section, but continue.

3069
05:18:03,583 --> 05:18:03,783
Okay.

3070
05:18:04,483 --> 05:18:05,444
Ebisu is closing.

3071
05:18:06,124 --> 05:18:06,825
That really sucks.

3072
05:18:07,245 --> 05:18:07,485
Yes.

3073
05:18:09,046 --> 05:18:14,430
So, you know, I got the email from, you know, because I'm one of the members and whatnot.

3074
05:18:14,790 --> 05:18:24,537
And I can tell you that, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I first found Medford when I was living, you know, before being resident of Medford would come to the Japanese market.

3075
05:18:25,220 --> 05:18:37,882
There used to be one on near Porter Square, and that building that the Japanese market was in there, I think it was called Miso Market, I think at the time, wound up getting torn down, turned into a department complex.

3076
05:18:38,562 --> 05:18:40,683
So this one really seemed out of the blue to me.

3077
05:18:40,843 --> 05:18:44,323
In fact, there aren't many Japanese markets in the whole region.

3078
05:18:45,143 --> 05:18:46,724
Ebisu is the only one in 20 square miles.

3079
05:18:48,064 --> 05:18:53,645
Kevin, the owner, is one of the most upstanding shop owners you could ever want.

3080
05:18:54,420 --> 05:19:12,607
I don't know if there's anything that the city can do to help him, and it's kind of weird right because it's, you know, oh my god one business, but that business is a grocery store in Medford Square, I mean you all, Clark Kirby's, I'm not going to put you on the spot but I mean if you want to go grab a bite to eat, it's a place where you can go buy something to eat.

3081
05:19:12,767 --> 05:19:19,190
There aren't many of the, there's plenty of restaurants, but not a store or shop there's a handful of them, let alone.

3082
05:19:20,053 --> 05:19:21,334
you know, Japanese.

3083
05:19:22,194 --> 05:19:25,196
It's just there's a lot of Chinese Korean shops, but not Japanese.

3084
05:19:25,276 --> 05:19:30,679
So I think it will be a hit to the community is something that made Medford unique.

3085
05:19:31,760 --> 05:19:33,681
The closest place now is to go to Arlington.

3086
05:19:34,401 --> 05:19:43,586
So it's one of those economic drivers where you were bringing people in especially Asian community from Malden from other places into Medford that now you won't have that draw.

3087
05:19:43,687 --> 05:19:46,068
So if there are vacant buildings,

3088
05:19:46,906 --> 05:19:57,996
that maybe you're looking for a small store I don't know if anyone's reached out to that business but any commercial business is a good thing in the city so just want to mention that to have some answers I think Councilor saying has some answers.

3089
05:19:59,938 --> 05:20:02,961
The building has been is structurally failing.

3090
05:20:03,580 --> 05:20:15,830
And that's why they're closing that's why the daycare move that's why all those tenants were protesting their notices to quit in last fall, the property owners the Hamilton companies.

3091
05:20:17,571 --> 05:20:20,454
Essentially, they actually tried to have the building condemned last year.

3092
05:20:22,376 --> 05:20:24,458
to accelerate their ability to move people out of it.

3093
05:20:25,418 --> 05:20:28,161
But because there are severe structural issues with the building.

3094
05:20:29,141 --> 05:20:48,997
My understanding is that the community development planning about the sustainability office and the economic development director met and spoke with the owners trying to connect them directly with other spaces in the city, and that they decided to not move this business but to focus on another business that they have involved in which I think is more of a restaurant.

3095
05:20:49,417 --> 05:20:49,537
Yes.

3096
05:20:51,193 --> 05:20:53,215
but there was active communication there.

3097
05:20:53,935 --> 05:21:05,444
And the other thing I can say is that we have been trying to get the, there's an RFP process going on for the vacant city-owned lots that surround this building.

3098
05:21:05,464 --> 05:21:13,970
The Hamilton Properties also owns the Riverside Plaza building and then that building across East Transit Way all the way down to

3099
05:21:15,807 --> 05:21:19,169
I think they actually own everything down to the old Papagenos, which is now the dentist's office.

3100
05:21:21,070 --> 05:21:21,850
Which dentist's office?

3101
05:21:21,870 --> 05:21:22,150
Who knows?

3102
05:21:24,291 --> 05:21:29,113
We have been trying to get them to incorporate their properties, you know, or talk to them.

3103
05:21:29,233 --> 05:21:41,899
And we included in the RFP to say, hey, reach out to neighboring property owners to see if maybe we could expand this project and include even other properties because the city owns the parking behind that building.

3104
05:21:41,919 --> 05:21:41,979
And

3105
05:21:46,012 --> 05:21:52,035
That is ongoing those discussions are ongoing, I think because of the state of the structure.

3106
05:21:54,156 --> 05:22:01,460
It's going to have to, there's going to need to be significant renovation or demolition is my understanding the building commissioner and development office but no more.

3107
05:22:03,363 --> 05:22:05,787
Oh, not to say the city has been very active in this question.

3108
05:22:05,847 --> 05:22:06,027
Sure.

3109
05:22:06,248 --> 05:22:10,234
And I know there was direct outreach to NBC to try to get see if there was a place that they could move.

3110
05:22:11,616 --> 05:22:17,786
And they, I think they decided not to, is my understanding, I don't know counselor saying do you have more information.

3111
05:22:20,225 --> 05:22:25,287
I think that's a pretty in-depth, thorough account of what's been happening.

3112
05:22:25,587 --> 05:22:30,969
I've been working with PDS as well to try to find a solution there.

3113
05:22:32,129 --> 05:22:42,613
But I think there's been some difficulties because of what you described, because they want to focus on another business.

3114
05:22:42,693 --> 05:22:45,134
And there's also the question of,

3115
05:22:46,659 --> 05:22:55,249
even if we can find another space, and I think there are some potential eligible spaces in Medford, they would have to do a lot of front-end spending on their end to

3116
05:22:57,418 --> 05:23:00,940
uh, to fit the space to become a supermarket, a grocery store.

3117
05:23:01,000 --> 05:23:04,241
So that's, uh, that's a difficult part of the calculus as well.

3118
05:23:04,261 --> 05:23:08,243
But I do know that, um, the planning department is on it.

3119
05:23:08,624 --> 05:23:15,607
They've been emailing and trying to reach out every week, um, to deal with this issue, um, to help them find a place in Medford.

3120
05:23:15,807 --> 05:23:17,228
So it's yeah.

3121
05:23:17,708 --> 05:23:17,948
Yeah.

3122
05:23:18,188 --> 05:23:18,428
I get it.

3123
05:23:18,448 --> 05:23:21,090
It's a business decision, you know, but

3124
05:23:21,966 --> 05:23:29,228
hopefully they know that there's a lot of us in the community that would hate to see them go, that that's a big hit, even though it's such a small store.

3125
05:23:31,769 --> 05:23:33,730
Yeah, I mean, they're great.

3126
05:23:33,830 --> 05:23:39,251
It's where we spent all in my in high school, that's where we spent all our half days after class, right?

3127
05:23:39,271 --> 05:23:40,432
Think of how much older I am than him.

3128
05:23:40,472 --> 05:23:41,332
That's where I spent mine.

3129
05:23:44,253 --> 05:23:44,493
Thank you.

3130
05:23:47,289 --> 05:23:53,114
Anyone who wants to speak for the first time for public comment we're going to go to first time people before we go to people for their second.

3131
05:23:53,934 --> 05:23:55,135
Let's cast any three minutes.

3132
05:23:55,816 --> 05:23:57,357
Okay, thank you.

3133
05:23:57,377 --> 05:24:07,285
Before I start the first two hours of this meeting was like there's a lot going on.

3134
05:24:07,765 --> 05:24:12,469
I didn't want to interrupt it, but I had to write this paragraph.

3135
05:24:13,568 --> 05:24:23,856
We are a nation, a country of laws that must be enforced, or else we don't have a country worth a damn, especially for our children.

3136
05:24:27,479 --> 05:24:32,322
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Aginju, and East Medford.

3137
05:24:34,724 --> 05:24:40,488
First, I must commend Councilor George Scarpelli, Little Shoes,

3138
05:24:44,045 --> 05:24:46,286
searching for a peace.

3139
05:24:48,826 --> 05:24:57,168
Seems evil Adolf Hitler was POed at the Jews.

3140
05:25:00,829 --> 05:25:06,911
He was rejected for an art school position in Austria as a youth.

3141
05:25:09,051 --> 05:25:12,032
And Jews controlled the finances in Germany.

3142
05:25:13,828 --> 05:25:15,409
But you should have a good.

3143
05:25:16,009 --> 05:25:18,230
And I don't think we're going to go down this road here.

3144
05:25:20,031 --> 05:25:22,812
I'm not allowed to tell you what to say I'm literally legally prohibited.

3145
05:25:23,753 --> 05:25:26,874
Well, some of it might be but it sounds pretty messed up man.

3146
05:25:29,295 --> 05:25:36,799
Let them know, I just wanted to be clear that I'm legally prohibited from regulating when people are able to say this body and it's frustrating, continue.

3147
05:25:44,220 --> 05:25:46,641
Dr. Starello, you might recall him, I hope.

3148
05:25:47,801 --> 05:25:51,082
I once said to him, man is basically good, doctor.

3149
05:25:51,842 --> 05:25:54,523
He replied, that's not true, Andrew.

3150
05:25:55,563 --> 05:25:57,404
I'm afraid to say it seems that he's right.

3151
05:25:59,644 --> 05:26:04,025
Almighty God was quoted in Genesis chapter 12, verse three.

3152
05:26:04,325 --> 05:26:09,787
I will bless thee who blesses thee, or I will curse he, her, or it.

3153
05:26:11,285 --> 05:26:12,285
who curses thee.

3154
05:26:12,605 --> 05:26:15,866
Translation is, if you go against the Jews, you will perish.

3155
05:26:18,447 --> 05:26:21,227
You gotta have peace or there's gonna be war.

3156
05:26:22,487 --> 05:26:26,448
And this time, I believe Jesus Christ himself will be returned.

3157
05:26:26,488 --> 05:26:30,729
He'll be coming back to fix this whole business, period.

3158
05:26:32,330 --> 05:26:33,470
This is a sad situation.

3159
05:26:33,490 --> 05:26:39,151
I'm worried about my family, I'm worried about your family, I'm worried about this country, and I'm worried about the world.

3160
05:26:40,535 --> 05:26:41,676
They're not worrying about me.

3161
05:26:46,239 --> 05:26:46,539
All right.

3162
05:26:49,881 --> 05:26:50,562
We can go back.

3163
05:26:51,442 --> 05:26:52,303
Would you like to speak again?

3164
05:26:52,323 --> 05:26:54,565
Get another minute in here.

3165
05:26:55,285 --> 05:26:56,886
Just one final minute there.

3166
05:26:56,926 --> 05:27:03,070
Just a couple of things that Ezekiel Silverstein, Kenya Road, once again, there are a couple of things mentioned that I wanted to raise.

3167
05:27:03,711 --> 05:27:08,154
One, some statistics mentioned during Vice President Collins

3168
05:27:10,283 --> 05:27:10,583
speech.

3169
05:27:11,064 --> 05:27:16,308
She used some statistics that were from Hamas filtered through the UN.

3170
05:27:16,388 --> 05:27:18,050
These are not trustworthy sources.

3171
05:27:18,110 --> 05:27:19,931
We wouldn't trust data from Al Qaeda.

3172
05:27:19,971 --> 05:27:22,053
We wouldn't trust data from ISIS.

3173
05:27:22,313 --> 05:27:26,537
We shouldn't trust data from a federally prescribed terrorist organization.

3174
05:27:27,137 --> 05:27:29,459
In fact, last week,

3175
05:27:31,593 --> 05:27:38,859
their roles of deceased, they removed about 10,000 or so names.

3176
05:27:39,359 --> 05:27:48,466
And it's come down to about 70% of deaths are military aged men, which is incredibly accurate and effective use of force.

3177
05:27:49,447 --> 05:27:55,932
Secondly, the International Holocaust Remembrance Association definition of antisemitism, the federally

3178
05:27:58,029 --> 05:28:14,262
allow the fairly observed definition, that's Holocaust inversion, but the Nazis is the Jews, that Jews are not doing to Palestinians, is a clear form of anti-Semitism that has, I've heard multiple times here today, and I want that on the record that that is unacceptable.

3179
05:28:14,602 --> 05:28:23,869
It's free speech and should be allowed, but that is what this resolution is about, is targeting and acknowledging the anti-Semitism we see and denouncing it.

3180
05:28:24,310 --> 05:28:24,550
Thank you.

3181
05:28:29,801 --> 05:28:30,141
Thank you.

3182
05:28:30,662 --> 05:28:40,152
The statistics I was referencing was pulled from BBC and Al Jazeera, internationally respected incredible news sources.

3183
05:28:43,216 --> 05:28:46,780
Obviously, any Jew would take issue with being called anti-Semitic.

3184
05:28:46,820 --> 05:28:50,464
It's not the first time I've been called anti-Semitic, but I think it's

3185
05:28:59,001 --> 05:29:11,584
It's very convenient to have a term for why it's anti-Semitic to observe and literally describe a genocide that is going on.

3186
05:29:13,765 --> 05:29:15,525
It doesn't make it Holocaust inversion.

3187
05:29:15,545 --> 05:29:21,106
It doesn't make it anti-Semitic to observe and tell the truth.

3188
05:29:22,287 --> 05:29:27,568
I struggle to find words for how offensive it is

3189
05:29:29,592 --> 05:29:48,883
to be told over and over again that telling the truth about this is in any way offensive to my religion and my family, who are only here in the first place because of real, not rhetorical, not invented, not fictionalized or exaggerated anti-Semitism.

3190
05:29:52,114 --> 05:29:53,694
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

3191
05:29:54,235 --> 05:29:55,515
We're still in public participation.

3192
05:29:55,535 --> 05:30:00,296
Go to the podium, do a minute, since this is your second time around on this.

3193
05:30:01,997 --> 05:30:02,277
Go ahead.

3194
05:30:02,577 --> 05:30:03,037
Sure, thanks.

3195
05:30:03,137 --> 05:30:05,838
Yeah, Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

3196
05:30:06,738 --> 05:30:10,259
I just can't not respond to what was just said.

3197
05:30:13,800 --> 05:30:19,342
Ignoring, even setting aside, what's Gaza for a second, actually.

3198
05:30:19,752 --> 05:30:28,220
There's literally pogroms being reported on that are being done by settlers with IDF protection on West Bankers.

3199
05:30:29,301 --> 05:30:34,445
Hundreds of children, a month effectively, are being killed in the West Bank.

3200
05:30:35,106 --> 05:30:41,992
It is crazy to dispute that there is genocidal activity happening in Israel.

3201
05:30:42,455 --> 05:30:45,196
on the part of Israelis against Palestinians.

3202
05:30:45,556 --> 05:30:49,057
It's just factually incorrect.

3203
05:30:49,237 --> 05:30:50,017
It's on its face.

3204
05:30:50,037 --> 05:30:52,117
It's a prima facie nonsensical thing to say.

3205
05:30:53,178 --> 05:31:09,742
And the idea that we have to comply with the definition of antisemitism as put forward by an organization invested in

3206
05:31:10,276 --> 05:31:20,216
I think rallying up fears about anti semitism in American Jewry is is just wild to like we can use common sense and understanding what anti semitism is okay.

3207
05:31:22,084 --> 05:31:24,585
It is, you know it when you see it.

3208
05:31:25,445 --> 05:31:32,287
Saying Israel is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity is not anti-Semitic.

3209
05:31:32,607 --> 05:31:34,287
Just use common sense.

3210
05:31:34,927 --> 05:31:40,869
I don't know how it come to a point where I even need to say, just use your common sense.

3211
05:31:43,144 --> 05:31:59,829
And keep in mind, this organization is also, this is an organization affiliated with another organization that literally is saying that from the river to the sea is anti-Semitic, which yes, there are issues there.

3212
05:32:00,269 --> 05:32:09,472
But at the same time, we'll say double Hitler saluting is just punctuated autism.

3213
05:32:11,278 --> 05:32:15,560
Be real here, just use your brain and common sense in trying to define what anti-Semitism is.

3214
05:32:15,660 --> 05:32:16,580
It's crazy.

3215
05:32:17,200 --> 05:32:17,741
Thank you.

3216
05:32:17,761 --> 05:32:22,343
MJ, I'm gonna have to page you and then we'll go to you for a minute.

3217
05:32:27,325 --> 05:32:40,090
Yeah, I just, you know, two years ago I said to my father, if I were not a Jew, if somebody told me I'm not a Jew, nothing would make sense in my whole life.

3218
05:32:40,924 --> 05:32:54,194
And I just think this is so incredibly strange that in the middle of the night we have Jews debating, as Jews love to debate, but we have a particular argument that's being made, which I think is very strange.

3219
05:32:54,794 --> 05:32:58,177
We're saying, no, Hamas is pumping up the numbers.

3220
05:32:58,477 --> 05:32:59,718
Is that really your argument?

3221
05:33:00,058 --> 05:33:02,300
The state of Israel is not killing as many babies?

3222
05:33:03,447 --> 05:33:07,270
as the world understands from other people that have done research.

3223
05:33:07,290 --> 05:33:11,713
It's not just Hamas, John Hopkins, it's many institutions that have replicated, confirmed those numbers.

3224
05:33:12,433 --> 05:33:15,856
And you're saying, no, no, we're not massacring as many people as they say.

3225
05:33:16,036 --> 05:33:17,096
Is that really your argument?

3226
05:33:17,196 --> 05:33:18,297
Where is your humanity?

3227
05:33:23,100 --> 05:33:23,541
Thank you.

3228
05:33:24,581 --> 05:33:26,743
Any further discussion in public participation tonight?

3229
05:33:31,752 --> 05:33:34,934
Councillor saying it's participation over.

3230
05:33:34,954 --> 05:33:35,034
Yeah.

3231
05:33:36,215 --> 05:33:36,535
All right.

3232
05:33:36,875 --> 05:33:38,716
So what is it, Councillor saying, go ahead.

3233
05:33:38,956 --> 05:33:41,157
Take the McCormick parcels off the table.

3234
05:33:45,120 --> 05:33:50,303
Take paper 25020 off the table by Councillor saying seconded by seconded by Councillor Collins.

3235
05:33:51,423 --> 05:33:53,044
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3236
05:33:53,064 --> 05:33:55,646
25020 McCormick Avenue parcels.

3237
05:34:13,571 --> 05:34:17,554
All right, color was clear.

3238
05:34:18,914 --> 05:34:21,316
Councilor Callahan is absent, Vice President Collins.

3239
05:34:22,757 --> 05:34:27,660
Council is our.

3240
05:34:27,800 --> 05:34:28,120
Yes.

3241
05:34:28,621 --> 05:34:29,061
Yes.

3242
05:34:30,162 --> 05:34:35,205
Council Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor saying, President bears.

3243
05:34:36,393 --> 05:34:37,694
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent.

3244
05:34:37,714 --> 05:34:39,415
The motion is taken off the table.

3245
05:34:39,615 --> 05:34:40,756
Two, five, zero, two, zero.

3246
05:34:40,776 --> 05:34:42,877
McCormick Avenue Parcels, Transfer and Conveyance.

3247
05:34:44,919 --> 05:34:48,982
The motion to reject by Councilor Sang.

3248
05:34:49,102 --> 05:34:51,123
So voting yes means rejecting.

3249
05:34:52,464 --> 05:34:53,725
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

3250
05:34:53,745 --> 05:34:55,406
Again, this is a motion to reject.

3251
05:34:56,207 --> 05:34:58,848
Voting yes means it fails.

3252
05:35:04,252 --> 05:35:05,153
On the motion, okay.

3253
05:35:06,873 --> 05:35:08,294
It's now a motion to approve.

3254
05:35:08,314 --> 05:35:13,119
Yeah, exactly.

3255
05:35:18,544 --> 05:35:19,424
Shane's gonna lose it.

3256
05:35:19,484 --> 05:35:22,427
I mean, you can motion to whatever you want, but the point here being this is a motion to approve.

3257
05:35:22,447 --> 05:35:23,688
If you vote yes, it is approved.

3258
05:35:23,728 --> 05:35:25,009
If you vote no, it is denied.

3259
05:35:26,290 --> 05:35:30,955
So if you do not want to transfer and convey these parcels, vote no.

3260
05:35:34,491 --> 05:35:37,293
Is there any discussion, Councilor Collins.

3261
05:35:38,234 --> 05:35:38,394
No.

3262
05:35:39,174 --> 05:35:41,556
All right, well it was here.

3263
05:35:41,776 --> 05:35:43,097
What's the motion.

3264
05:35:43,137 --> 05:35:49,442
Motion to approve by Councilor Sang seconded by Councilor Collins.

3265
05:35:58,369 --> 05:35:58,909
Okay, ready.

3266
05:36:00,190 --> 05:36:01,991
Is there no discussion by members of the Council.

3267
05:36:03,222 --> 05:36:06,543
Any discussion by members of the public here on Zoom?

3268
05:36:10,985 --> 05:36:12,465
I guess we'll do one really quick thing.

3269
05:36:13,105 --> 05:36:13,906
Eric's getting ready.

3270
05:36:14,066 --> 05:36:14,546
I know, I know.

3271
05:36:15,666 --> 05:36:16,786
Oh, sorry.

3272
05:36:16,826 --> 05:36:20,228
Last time I said that I was tempted to vote yes on this.

3273
05:36:20,388 --> 05:36:24,189
I've heard a lot from residents about the sale of public lands.

3274
05:36:26,050 --> 05:36:29,010
I've gotten the feedback, so I'm planning to vote no on this.

3275
05:36:29,651 --> 05:36:30,351
Councilor Leving.

3276
05:36:32,570 --> 05:36:51,742
I would just, I would just like to mention, I do understand the back and forth about sale of public land I would still like to support the recommendation of the affordable housing trust so that's, that's, that's my position but I respect the decisions made by my colleagues.

3277
05:36:54,584 --> 05:36:56,465
That are present bears can I.

3278
05:37:01,856 --> 05:37:11,579
Thank you, I just want to reiterate that the cost of the study is much less than what would be, what the parcels would be sold for.

3279
05:37:11,599 --> 05:37:16,801
The parcels are only not buildable because there's an imaginary line drawn between the two of them.

3280
05:37:18,401 --> 05:37:23,943
Portable housing could be built on this land and I don't believe that there is a need to sell them at this time.

3281
05:37:24,623 --> 05:37:26,104
That is why I will be voting no.

3282
05:37:28,485 --> 05:37:29,185
Councilor Lemming.

3283
05:37:32,872 --> 05:37:34,914
Prepare for my 45 minutes speech.

3284
05:37:35,915 --> 05:37:38,318
No, no I've spread.

3285
05:37:47,192 --> 05:38:05,066
No, no, no, no, I just, no, I just, I just want to mention that if this, if this does fail, then I would strongly urge that we pay for the nexus study with free cash of which, as we have seen, we do have enough free cash for

3286
05:38:05,871 --> 05:38:08,172
These relatively minor capital allocations.

3287
05:38:09,592 --> 05:38:20,395
I still, I just want to be clear for my colleagues here that I, I do not think that it is appropriate to use free cash for operating expenses, but in the case of studies.

3288
05:38:21,956 --> 05:38:25,156
It's perfectly in case of one time studies, it's perfectly fine.

3289
05:38:25,737 --> 05:38:26,077
Okay.

3290
05:38:26,457 --> 05:38:29,938
Okay, one time funds for one time expense we got a counselor's are.

3291
05:38:31,232 --> 05:38:44,361
I also want to reiterate that, or maybe say for the first time, that sometimes things are communicated to boards and commissions as the best way to do something, but they may not have the full story.

3292
05:38:44,401 --> 05:38:55,048
So I just think that disagreeing with something as presented doesn't necessarily mean we don't support the work that's happening by the boards and commissions.

3293
05:38:55,569 --> 05:38:55,789
Thanks.

3294
05:38:56,265 --> 05:38:58,065
Thank you, Councilor Zaro.

3295
05:38:58,165 --> 05:39:00,986
Public participation, Matthew Page-Lieberman, you have three minutes.

3296
05:39:02,326 --> 05:39:04,087
Yeah, I don't know if there's a little bit of confusion.

3297
05:39:04,107 --> 05:39:11,009
I think Councilor Zao said she'd be voting no, but my understanding is to vote yes is to mean to cancel the request to sell the land.

3298
05:39:11,109 --> 05:39:11,529
Is that correct?

3299
05:39:12,689 --> 05:39:14,329
This is a motion to approve.

3300
05:39:15,410 --> 05:39:19,511
To vote no means that the council would not allow the land to be sold.

3301
05:39:20,151 --> 05:39:21,311
Yes, yes, very, very good.

3302
05:39:21,691 --> 05:39:22,491
Okay, to vote no.

3303
05:39:22,671 --> 05:39:23,151
Okay, very good.

3304
05:39:23,331 --> 05:39:25,452
Well, thank you for the clarification.

3305
05:39:26,380 --> 05:39:33,623
I just want to point out that, yes, I'm absolutely opposed to selling off our patrimony for plugging the budget or anything else.

3306
05:39:34,243 --> 05:39:44,266
I do believe that this council sent to the mayor a request that both Councilor Callahan and Councilor Lemming would like to see money put aside to fund the nexus study, which would then be able to, is that correct?

3307
05:39:45,007 --> 05:39:48,308
That is correct as part of our collective budget recommendation.

3308
05:39:48,568 --> 05:39:51,349
So the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board of Trustees,

3309
05:39:52,205 --> 05:39:55,146
they just look to the city, send us some money.

3310
05:39:55,686 --> 05:39:59,526
And they had a meeting about this last week, and the DQ reported on the results from the survey.

3311
05:39:59,566 --> 05:40:00,766
They said, how can we raise money?

3312
05:40:00,806 --> 05:40:01,507
We don't know what to do.

3313
05:40:02,287 --> 05:40:05,727
And they said, well, you sell off McCormick, because they don't know what else is on the table.

3314
05:40:06,187 --> 05:40:08,048
I've talked to people in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

3315
05:40:08,568 --> 05:40:13,549
They don't understand they have any responsibility whatsoever as board of trustees to raise money for the trust.

3316
05:40:14,169 --> 05:40:16,829
They've told me some very, very strange things that things are not possible.

3317
05:40:17,189 --> 05:40:21,170
You can't apply for grants, because a grant says, it just does not make any sense.

3318
05:40:22,258 --> 05:40:34,385
In the ordinance establishing the board of trustees, it does not specify this, but in the open announcement to the applicants, it says that they will be responsible for applying for grants and stuff like this.

3319
05:40:34,805 --> 05:40:41,569
That is their role to find money for the trust and not just to look to the city, will you sell off some land because we don't know what to do.

3320
05:40:41,589 --> 05:40:46,532
They have to educate themselves and they have to, that's the responsibility of a trustee, getting the money.

3321
05:40:47,383 --> 05:40:49,265
not just waiting on the city to hand over the money.

3322
05:40:49,305 --> 05:40:53,709
And the community land trust group that I'm in, we're going to be doing that.

3323
05:40:53,729 --> 05:40:56,091
We understand it's the responsibility.

3324
05:40:56,911 --> 05:40:59,314
You can't just steady sell off some land.

3325
05:40:59,354 --> 05:41:07,040
And the mayor, she didn't even report in the meeting last week that you guys requested that budget in her for the money for the Nexus study.

3326
05:41:07,341 --> 05:41:09,182
So that's even out of sight, out of mind for her.

3327
05:41:12,285 --> 05:41:12,725
Thank you.

3328
05:41:12,745 --> 05:41:14,267
Thank you.

3329
05:41:16,138 --> 05:41:17,980
Any further public participation on this item.

3330
05:41:19,081 --> 05:41:22,785
Seeing none, Mr please call the roll Council Callahan is absent.

3331
05:41:24,747 --> 05:41:28,251
That's a Callahan is absent.

3332
05:41:28,912 --> 05:41:29,873
Vice President Collins.

3333
05:41:29,893 --> 05:41:32,456
That's a little sorrow.

3334
05:41:32,876 --> 05:41:35,579
Now, Council Lemming.

3335
05:41:41,570 --> 05:41:48,975
Councilor saying, President bears know to the affirmative for the negative one absence the motion fails, any further discussion.

3336
05:41:48,995 --> 05:41:54,218
That's a client is absent Vice President Collins Council is our own.

3337
05:42:10,702 --> 05:42:21,669
Yes, that's a lemming counter scrap Kelly counter saying present bears.

3338
05:42:21,829 --> 05:42:22,050
Yes.
