    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1951.405s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1952.625s">Thank</a>  you very much for having us here this evening to give you an update on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1957.647s">This</a>  evening, as Council President mentioned, here with Brenda Pike, also Tom Ellis, Josh Doolittle. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1965.069s">Tom</a>  is from JLL, our owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1968.37s">Josh</a>  is from our designer B2Q, and Alicia Hunt from the city's Office of Sustainability is also here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1978.542s">As</a>  we've previously presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1980.723s">This</a>  is a comprehensive project to replace and update the HVAC and heating ventilation air conditioning systems at the McGlynn in the Andrews with modern systems the buildings as mentioned previously are approaching 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1996.949s">The</a>  building systems have expended their useful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2001.231s">At</a>  present, we have previously been here for $5 million for pre purchase of equipment that pre purchase of equipment actually went through this past Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2011.662s">There</a>  was Herculean effort done by all parties involved including the city's procurement office, mayor's office, and vice chair of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2020.451s">So</a>  really appreciate everybody who has really made this project happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2024.554s">It's</a>  definitely a sprint to make sure that we get these systems installed prior to students arriving as best as possible at the end of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2034.522s">So</a>  phase one pre-construction involved $5 million and we appreciate that bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2040.387s">Of</a>  that was equipment pre-purchase of $3.3 million and numerous other costs that you can see on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2052.317s">construction</a>  for this project as we enter phase two is estimated to be $22,945,000 with <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2062.787s">contingency</a>  costs of $687,273 for owner contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2070.929s">Designer</a>  through construction to finish the project for B2Q is $1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2075.75s">Our</a>  owner's project manager, $484,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2079.07s">And</a>  other contingencies not considered in the GMP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2083.271s">GMP</a>  stands for gross maximum price. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2086.012s">That</a>  means that our costs will not exceed the gross maximum price when we're using construction management at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2092.973s">The</a>  construction manager, Consigli, has been brought on early in the design process so that they can be involved in making sure that we have a complete package ready to be installed, ordered and installed for our schools.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2109.726s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to talk a little bit about some of these other costs that we have on here, which include $500,000 for <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2118.366s">commissioning</a>  the systems once they're installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2121.81s">We</a>  have in here 619,000 for ADA upgrades that were triggered by a project of this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2129.958s">I</a>  want to note here that there's an additional 2.3 million in ADA upgrades that were identified through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2141.238s">Because</a>  of changes in ADA requirements from when the building was built to now, based on the consultant's experience, they expect that we can get variances for those because while the $619,000 that we have here is for things that are <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2159.428s">are</a>  that are considered we consider very beneficial, or not too costly beneficial like fixing the entrance to the McGlynn so that there's no lip there that that wheelchairs can't get over for instance, the that additional 2.3 million are for things that are changes that are have very <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2184.026s">relatively</a>  small benefits, but relatively high costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2188.088s">So</a>  for instance, moving a sink up one inch and all the associated plumbing and tiling and other costs along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2196.591s">So</a>  we're going through that variance process in April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2203.373s">I'll</a>  note here the IT rooms, we now have just the IT rooms for the Anders and McGlynn listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2209.896s">The</a>  other three schools IT room equipment <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2213.385s">will</a>  be done through the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2217.888s">We</a>  have the McGlynn roof refurbishment at $1.5 million instead of a $3 million replacement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2226.574s">The</a>  warranty is roughly the same and would still allow for moving forward with solar if we decide that we want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2235.838s">And</a>  then I also want to point out that we are expecting about $2.2 million in mass save incentives for this project but those are reimbursable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2245.244s">So,</a>  we've, we have to authorize the spending and buy the equipment and install them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2252.638s">before</a>  getting those rebates back some months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2257.143s">So</a>  that amount is not included in the 25 or that amount is not subtracted from that $25 million bond because we do need to have that to spend that up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2269.834s">But</a>  we do expect that long term, we won't be paying that off for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2277.284s">And</a>  then I would add that we have solar on here as an add alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2282.408s">That's</a>  not included in the above cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2284.41s">We</a>  had just been considering it if we were able to do it cheaper through this process than we otherwise would be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2292.976s">And</a>  it's still a possibility if the project comes in under the expected cost, but it's not included right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2301.888s">project</a>  could very well come in under the this expected cost here, because we do have some very healthy contingencies built in, not just that owner contingency and the construction contingencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2312.457s">But</a>  we also have over $2 million in contingencies for possible tariffs and possible second shift work if the project is delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2321.064s">And</a>  so we need to do a lot of second shift work in order to make up the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2325.027s">So</a>  we're hoping that that won't need to be dug into too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2328.77s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2329.35s">it's</a>  there so that we don't have to come back to you a third time.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2335.535s">We</a>  are being very proactive, though, in making sure that this project is being well managed, well run. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2340.84s">Our</a>  OPM is being really on the ball with us and the construction management designer as well to make sure that we are well prepared <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2350.649s">when</a>  we hit the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2352.01s">We've</a>  already worked internally as a school to make sure that all summer programming has been redistributed throughout the district to other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2359.475s">And</a>  we are making efforts to make sure that if any office staff need to be moved as well, they'll be able to be moved during the summer as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2369.183s">Just</a>  one more slide for the final. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2372.145s">So</a>  you can see the total costs <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2375.388s">brought</a>  in and our hopes that $30,111,000 number does include healthy contingencies that we plan to be very hawkish on and preserve as much of that as possible for the City of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2397.583s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2398.724s">And</a>  this is our third time I think seeing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2401.987s">If</a>  you could, could you just discuss any thing that's changed since the first two presentations that we received and then I can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2408.913s">I'm</a>  sure a lot of small things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2410.435s">You</a>  can keep it to the bigger things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2411.636s">And</a>  then I'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2414.492s">I</a>  would say the two most significant changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2418.495s">We</a>  were planning to do some mechanical installations in the building for cost savings and preventing workers from being in the buildings we've moved a lot of the equipment to rooftop rooftop units. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2432.766s">I'm</a>  just turning to my team to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2435.207s">I</a>  have a lot of other things besides the HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2437.668s">So</a>  as the assistant superintendent, but this is definitely the biggest project right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2442.11s">So</a>  that's a major piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2445.091s">I</a>  would say the second major piece is the ADA upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2449.973s">If</a>  I'm going to be honest, we, these buildings were built in 2001, and open to students in 2001, that is well after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, but codes have changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2462.449s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2463.25s">So,</a>  I would say that and just so everyone is clear, when a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2468.777s">exceeds</a>  30% of the assessed value of the buildings and the assessed value of these buildings in the city of Medford is approximately $69, $70 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2479.7s">So</a>  once you exceed 30%, it requires a full review of the entire structure for ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2488.143s">So</a>  I'd say those are the two biggest things in my book that have changed.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2492.309s">Yeah,</a>  and then I would say in terms of the budget the base, the difference would be that the tariff contingency and the second shift premium contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2500.613s">I</a>  think the budget is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2504.324s">about</a>  a million dollars higher than what we had anticipated it would be the last time that we came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2508.949s">And</a>  that's entirely because the additional contingencies that we built in there.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2514.876s">There</a>  is Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2516.758s">One</a>  more thing to when I had entered this project I had fully expected for us to go for a new roof, a soup to nuts new roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2524.086s">because</a>  the added R value insulation of a new roof following the 2011 building codes of Massachusetts, I expected to have considerable savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2534.509s">The</a>  new roof would cost approximately $3 million all in new roofing materials, EPDM, and the insulation plus the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2546.292s">The</a>  reality is, okay, that we get the same <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2550.795s">Warranty</a>  as a fluid applied solution that was done to the Andrews roof so we get a 20 year life expectancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2561.004s">we</a>  would only see approximately $300,000 of savings from the new installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2569.291s">So</a>  we would be spending $1.2 million to get essentially the same outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2576.897s">So</a>  a restoration is not only the most fiscally responsible, but it achieves the same end as a new roof.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2587.045s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2587.906s">Go</a>  to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.963s">I</a>  wanted to thank you again for coming before us to again, describe this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2597.464s">For</a>  folks who weren't at the previous presentations that the city council received on this, just to quickly paraphrase the overview that you gave, my understanding is this is to support the urgent and necessary HVAC repairs and roof repairs so that when kids go back to school in the fall, they'll have functioning air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2617.828s">and</a>  non-leaky roofs to enjoy at the start of the new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2621.409s">Very</a>  glad that we can support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2624.55s">I'm</a>  so glad to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2625.671s">Obviously,</a>  taking on a major capital expense is not something that any of us take lightly, but I'm glad that this project is one whose scale enables us to do those ADA upgrades that I know people in the community have been asking for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2638.234s">Thank</a>  you for your diligence around that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2640.735s">I</a>  appreciate all of the documentation for continuing to keep the council abreast of this and I would motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2650.003s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2650.204s">We</a>  have a motion to approve from Vice President Collins, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2653.694s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Tseng and we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2656.595s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2658.415s">I</a>  know that it's not not you two but Mr. Dickinson's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2662.435s">Did</a>  we entertain by any chance using any of the 28 million dollars in free cash now that we see is that that number came out a few weeks ago that we have in excess of 28 million and in the past we've shown that we've actively actively worked by moving that money into capital projects to possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2683.847s">speed</a>  things up and then take some future costs to our citizens away, if that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2692.492s">I'm</a>  not qualified to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2697.394s">We</a>  will be looking at all different ways to finance this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2701.477s">Obviously,</a>  there's a lot of it that absolutely... Okay, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2710.664s">Obviously</a>  this has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2714.635s">When</a>  I'm looking at it, I'm looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2717.647s">how</a>  much the interest in principal cost will affect the budget going forward right now, five, six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2727.972s">It</a>  does put, if we borrow this full sum of money, it would put a big damper on the budget in 2028 and 2029 given the increase we would get through Prop 2.5 and new growth and what debt is actually coming off <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2745.2s">of</a>  our debt schedule, our waterfall schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2749.164s">So</a>  yes, we will probably be looking hard at not only using free cash to fund some of this to see how we can fit everything into the budget, but also the timing of the borrowings and when we will actually have to start paying principal and interest on the full general obligation bond.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2767.125s">So</a>  that's good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2768.406s">Like</a>  I said, I didn't expect to use all $28 million and get this project done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2773.449s">But</a>  I know that since we have $20 million and we need to move quickly with this project, I appreciate the fact that we're looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2780.933s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2781.534s">No,</a>  we're looking at this very carefully.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3052.162s">Great,</a>  so we'd like to hear a bit more about the petition, what you're requesting, and then we will discuss it.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3059.127s">Yeah,</a>  so as you may know, back in 2013, we installed a back-to-back digital billboard, 282 Mystic Ave, and at such time, the digital screens have outlived their useful life, and they're antiquated, so we're simply asking to amend the existing special permit just to simply replace the existing digital screens.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3083.735s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3084.295s">It</a>  also says that there's a request to reduce the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3087.959s">Do</a>  you have any comment on that?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3090.101s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3090.401s">So</a>  a couple of years ago, I believe at 262, Mr. Gaff, we replaced the digital screens on that unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3096.947s">And</a>  I believe the permit fee was approximately $5,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3099.709s">And</a>  I'm not sure if anything's changed with the current bylaws when it comes to the price on permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3108.101s">this</a>  permit is a little over $24,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3110.942s">So</a>  I'm not sure what the huge difference was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3115.144s">So</a>  I have a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3117.985s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3118.245s">Um,</a>  I can't say that we have been a lot of the city's fees have not been updated in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3123.067s">It's</a>  very likely that the building department may have updated them to reflect the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3127.649s">But</a>  I'm going to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3129.77s">If</a>  I could, Mr. President, I think that, uh, the first issue with changing of the signs, I understand it gets <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3136.872s">The</a>  systems are antiquated we need to move forward as long as there aren't any huge changes that would disrupt our residents, I don't think it's a problem but again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3147.9s">both</a>  with this and with the adjusting the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3152.763s">I</a>  think if we could probably table this to the next meeting and get some updates, and then I don't see that the changeover will be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3162.229s">And</a>  if we can look into seeing what the qualifications or the protocol for the fee structure, and then maybe you can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3169.894s">But</a>  right now, I don't think we're equipped to vote on that this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3175.021s">I</a>  appreciate the petitioner being here, petitioner speaking on behalf, but if we could table this to the next meeting, that'd be super important, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3184.009s">And</a>  Councilor Stroud, just to clarify the motion, if the petitioner wanted to move forward tonight without changing the fee, would you be comfortable with that or do you think</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3196.49s">I</a>  would feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3197.491s">I</a>  just like I said, I don't see the any of the particulars in front of me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3202.096s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3202.476s">All</a>  I'm hearing is a petitioner saying that just changing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3205.019s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3205.739s">And</a>  I, we, unfortunately, I don't have anything in front that might cause some problems legally for us.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3212.106s">All</a>  right, so there's a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3214.728s">to</a>  the next regular meeting, actually motion to continue the public hearing to the next regular meeting and request an update on the application and the fee from the building department and also to request legal to give us an opinion on whether or not we can reduce the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3236.043s">When</a>  you have that, Mr. Clerk, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3239.649s">All</a>  right, so there's a motion to continue the public hearing to the April 29 meeting by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3247.634s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3251.716s">Seeing</a>  none.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3252.397s">On</a>  Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3254.778s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3257.545s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to make sure that we're not sending stuff to legal that we don't need to send to legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3262.186s">My</a>  understanding from the building commissioner is that on that we are the appropriate body to make appeals and final decisions when it has already gone through the building department on things like signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3277.85s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3280.331s">I'm</a>  not positive it doesn't need to go to legal, but I think we should not just send everything to legal just to send things to legal.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3289.637s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3290.657s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3293.119s">Out</a>  of all due respect, this is the fourth time I've asked something that I feel important that might put our committee in question legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3304.88s">to</a>  go to legal and this councilor has refused a question to every single one and i find this to be a problem this is very easy if we had a city solicitor i'm the i'm the eldest uh i'm i've sat in a seat longer than anybody here i've been here when we've had an active city solicitor that i could call any time to answer any questions so we can move an issue forward unfortunately this is year four without a city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3331.543s">So</a>  if one member of this council, out of due respect, if it was my fellow council, the same question, I wouldn't stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3338.629s">So</a>  this is an issue that if we move something forward and legally comes back on us, I'd rather not pay the consequences with a higher fee or a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3348.058s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3477.038s">No,</a>  I owe the respect to my fellow councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3480.399s">We've</a>  started resolutions that thought would be quick and lasted 45 to one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3487.582s">As</a>  I said, residents that are on the charter committee that said that, unfortunately, they can't stay later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3496.685s">These</a>  are people that have worked in this community on this project for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3501.126s">I</a>  would hope we give them the respect to move them to the front so we could hear them, so they could <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3506.001s">be</a>  off and whatever the resolution ends up to be, that they can be heard and then move on to their evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3514.948s">And</a>  from what I hear, most of them to sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3517.33s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3518.771s">I</a>  think you can make the same arguments the other way, given that this ordinance has also been- So don't vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3523.495s">That's</a>  my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3524.276s">Don't</a>  vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3669.057s">Yes,</a>  I'm the affirmative, negative, the motion passes, Councilor say, Thank you, Mr. President, um, as we, as, as we know from watching the news and from paying attention to, you know, our neighbors concerns over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3684.896s">The</a>  access to gender affirming care and reproductive health care has become an incredibly contentious issue in our country, despite these being basic forms of medical care and basic rights that individuals have, or should have in this country, and has have historically had in this country until recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3703.9s">A</a>  lot of our residents are fairly asking us how we can best protect our own neighbors best protect our own residents and provide the security that they need and need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3716.265s">for</a>  enjoying their lives here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3719.268s">This</a>  ordinance would protect medical providers and people who seek that care from out-of-state arrest warrants and prosecutions, from out-of-state attempts to apply laws that aren't Massachusetts laws, laws that aren't Massachusetts values to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3739.926s">We've</a>  heard early on in the process years ago that if we didn't pass something like this, it was very likely, if not mandatory, that we would have to carry out those warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3750.33s">Now</a>  the situation at the state level has changed, but it is important for us to reaffirm this and to acknowledge that just because state law says something doesn't mean that we can't back that up as well, and that we need that additional layer of protection for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3769.856s">During</a>  the process, Councilor Lazzaro and I worked hard to invite stakeholders, including medical providers in the community, including residents with experience, including city staff across the health police departments and the administration to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3790.29s">We</a>  know that Medford faces limited resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3794.954s">We've</a>  talked about that over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3797.416s">We</a>  want to make sure that those resources aren't expended to the end of denying any individual's right to their bodily autonomy or to criminalize any person's effort to live as their full and authentic self. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3811.554s">This</a>  ordinance, if you walk through it, essentially protects the information, the health information of people who come to Medford to use our care. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3823.88s">It</a>  protects health information from medical providers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3827.568s">It</a>  affirms our city's policy and enshrines into law that we won't treat any individual differently based on their gender identity or gender expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3842.973s">It</a>  follows state laws language with regards to definitions with regards to how we're going to do what I just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3851.821s">It</a>  also empowers our city to to provide fair access to reproductive health and gender affirming healthcare information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3860.531s">Because</a>  we know that there are predatory sources out there that are putting limited or fake information out into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3870.121s">This</a>  empowers our administration to post proper guidelines, to post <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3877.168s">a</a>  full comprehensive picture as to that information on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3881.409s">I</a>  know there are residents who want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3882.969s">I</a>  know there are councilors who've worked hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3886.11s">I</a>  do also want to thank councilors Collins, Bears, and former councilor Morell for introducing parts of this ordinance as well, or a resolution language to support this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3896.972s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3898.312s">Thank</a>  you, councilor Sagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3899.152s">Is</a>  there a further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3901.993s">Council</a>  Vice President Tom.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3905.635s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3907.498s">I</a>  just want to share my gratitude for this Councilors for the sponsors for shepherding through this draft which strongly and boldly defines protections for seekers of gender affirming and reproductive health care in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3918.259s">This</a>  draft has gone through a careful legal review, and its sponsors, Councilors Sang and Lazzaro, made sure it was in alignment with other communities and with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3927.746s">And</a>  I want to highlight that this is protective of the whole city because it guarantees that if the federal government decides to pick a fight over cities allowing unfettered access to health care, then we won't be fighting that battle alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3938.494s">We'll</a>  be going in as part of a regional and statewide cavalry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3942.513s">We</a>  are in a moment where the federal government is attacking women's access to health care and trans and non-binary people's access to health care in a deliberate attempt to punish political enemies and create a distraction from this administration's catastrophic economic agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3957.92s">They're</a>  making a goal of actively making Americans' lives worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3961.341s">And</a>  I'm very grateful for this leadership to do what we can on the city level to say that won't happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3966.63s">So</a>  I want to extend my gratitude to the sponsors and also to the residents who held this council to account for making this ordinance happen.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3974.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3975.016s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3977.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3978.838s">I</a>  just wanted to also extend my gratitude to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Morell, President Bears, and the city's legal team, KP Law, for helping us <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3995.809s">review</a>  the ordinance and align it with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3999.531s">And</a>  this draft, I think, is the strongest we can make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4003.774s">So</a>  I think we're really in a position to protect our residents to the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4009.117s">And</a>  I'm proud of how far we've taken it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4012.919s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mike Denton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4067.956s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4070.968s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Collins for saying everything that I was coming here to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4078.27s">So</a>  I'd just like to reiterate that as a business owner who serves a wide swath of the community that would be directly impacted by this ordinance, thank you, thank you, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4094.014s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4096.595s">I</a>  think the only other thing that I wanted to say is that this is the kind of ordinance that will go a long way to making sure that people who live in Medford know that Medford cares about them and that there's a degree of safety that they're going to work towards for on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4117.619s">So</a>  thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4120.399s">Medford</a>  sees you and appreciates you and that, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4124.749s">the</a>  slice of Medford that I'm exposed to sees you and appreciate it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4129.172s">So</a>  that's all.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4132.194s">Thank</a>  you, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4134.956s">We'll</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4137.037s">Name</a>  and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4138.018s">For</a>  the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4244.002s">That's</a>  a lemon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4247.044s">I'll</a>  just go Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4247.765s">I</a>  was just saying, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4251.907s">Yes,</a>  77 affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4254.249s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4254.829s">None</a>  of the negative motion passes for first reading. <a href="../resolutions/25-055.pdf"><font color="green">25-055</font></a> resolution to support the release of Ramesa Ozturk council is our own president bears whereas Ramesa Ozturk was an international student with a legal student visa at Tufts University in Medford and whereas Ramesa Ozturk student visa was canceled because she co-wrote an op-ed in 2024 and the Tufts University student newspaper that was critical of the Tufts administration's refusal to acknowledge and stand against the ongoing genocide in Gaza and
 <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4284.303s">whereas</a>  the Constitution protects everyone in the United States regardless of immigration status, and whereas the First Amendment of the Constitution protects the rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government, and where it's clear that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4295.617s">Öztürk's</a>  visa was canceled because of political speech, which is a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4301.092s">and</a>  where it is the obligation of our local, state, and federal government to uphold and protect the rights of our residents, permanent and temporary, all of whom are protected by the United States Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4310.502s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council condemns the abduction of Hermesa Ozturk by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as unlawful punishment for political speech, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4319.653s">and</a>  acknowledges and condemns that Ramesa Osterk is a political prisoner, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council calls for the release of Ramesa Osterk immediately, so that she may resume her studies of child development at Tufts University and her peaceful residence in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4333.315s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests an update from Tufts University on the specific policies to protect their students, faculty, and staff from similar abductions by ICE in the future, and to protect their community's right to exercise freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4347.66s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that our partners in local government and our state and federal delegations speak out publicly against the unlawful arrest of a student in our community in violation of her due process rights and in violation of the United States Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4360.585s">Council</a>  Dizaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4362.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4364.651s">I</a>  found myself very upset when I saw the video of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4370.313s">Ozturk</a>  being taken by ICE officers from her home in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4376.796s">I'm</a>  very familiar with where she lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4379.617s">A</a>  close friend of mine lives on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4383.119s">And</a>  I've been there many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4385.52s">It's</a>  a safe neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4386.401s">It</a>  makes me feel, it made me feel very afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4390.431s">And</a>  as a local elected official, I felt that there wasn't much that I could do except for craft a resolution stating publicly the things that I felt were most egregious about what happened, which were that the Constitution was violated and the rule of law was ignored by our federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4417.102s">I</a>  wanted to point that out, I wanted to do it here, and I wanted to make sure that we had a forum where our residents can understand that their city government feels strongly that that's not okay, it's not what we believe in, and we do not think that this is something that we can let continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4439.68s">in</a>  any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4444.322s">This</a>  is what we have access to as city councillors, this is what we're able, this is our forum to be able to say something, so I thought it was appropriate to say something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4453.805s">I</a>  did reach out to Tufts University, our contact at Tufts as city councillors is Rocco DiRico, he is the Government Affairs <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4465.57s">connector,</a>  person, he is a great person to speak with in times like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4471.472s">And</a>  he did give me a couple of statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4474.014s">He</a>  sent me an email, I'd like to read just about what they, I mean, we spoke on the phone, he sent me a statement, and then he also updated me with the Tufts president's statement that also, it was posted online, so some people may have seen it, but I would also like to read that here because I feel that it does respond <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4494.183s">It</a>  is kind of the response that I call for in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4498.807s">So</a>  I feel that even beyond what I'm going to read, I think that Tufts has been really active in responding to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4508.056s">They've</a>  done things that you can't really talk about publicly because they've really tried to <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4515.543s">do</a>  everything in their power to have Remesa released. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4519.244s">And</a>  the administration at the federal level really doesn't always listen, even though people in power are really doing what they can to try to access humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4535.53s">anybody's</a>  humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4537.432s">So</a>  Rocco's response to me was the university recognizes how frightening the situation is for her, her family and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4554.525s">We</a>  are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa has provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4562.308s">The</a>  university is actively working to support the Tufts community as it mobilizes its collective resources and contacts to ensure our students' safety and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4571.411s">The</a>  university has sent emails to all our students, faculty, and staff <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4575.452s">to</a>  outline our protocol for engaging with government officials, recommendations for documentation, and support resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4582.155s">We</a>  encourage our students, faculty, and staff to contact the International Center for additional support and resources." <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4588.077s">And</a>  then he added in a later email, we're also working with Rameses' attorneys. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4593.999s">And</a>  there was also, I will also read, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4599.942s">The</a>  Declaration of Tufts University from President Sunil Kumar. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4607.422s">Tufts</a>  University, an entity legally known as the Trustees of Tufts College and henceforth referred to as Tufts University, the university or Tufts declares as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4617.625s">One,</a>  on Tuesday, March 25, 2025, the university learned that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral student from Turkey, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4630.668s">The</a>  university understands that she was leaving her home that evening for an iftar dinner hosted at the Tufts Interfaith Center, where she would break her Ramadan fast for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4639.554s">Two,</a>  at around 6.30pm that evening, the Tufts University Police Department received courtesy notification from the Somerville Police Department that an individual had been detained by federal authorities and that the person in custody might be a Tufts student. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4652.563s">We</a>  confirmed through our records that the person in question was Ramesa Ozturk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4656.645s">Three,</a>  at 7.32 p.m., Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4658.626s">Ozturk's</a>  record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, was updated to note that her visa was terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4667.489s">Prior</a>  to that, and at the time of her detention, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4669.47s">Ozturk</a>  was in, quote, good immigration standing, according to her record in SEVIS, and both Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4674.872s">Ozturk</a>  and Tufts had followed the governing regulations for students on visas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4681.535s">The</a>  university then received a notice dated March 25, 2025, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4685.823s">and</a>  received via email on March 26, 2025, at 10.31 a.m., stating that Rameza's visa was canceled because she was a non-immigrant status violator, citing 237A1CI of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and or that the United States believes that her presence in the country would result in, quote, potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4710.462s">With</a>  her consent, the university can confirm that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4712.703s">Ozturk</a>  is a third-year doctoral student in good academic and administrative standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4716.724s">Her</a>  research focuses on how young adults can use social media in positive, pro-social ways, and she is described by her faculty as a hard-working student dedicated to her studies, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4726.848s">and</a>  the Tufts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4728.29s">The</a>  university has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4734.595s">The</a>  university has seen an outpouring of support from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4736.997s">Ozturk</a>  over the last week from Tufts students, faculty, and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4740.82s">These</a>  individuals have described Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4742.081s">Ozturk</a>  as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits, and committed to her colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4748.346s">Five,</a>  the university can confirm that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4750.047s">Ozturk</a>  was one of several authors of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, the Tufts Daily, published on March 26, 2024, entitled, Try Again, President Kumar, Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate Resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4764.193s">The</a>  university declares that this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4769.095s">Further,</a>  no complaints were filed with the university or to our knowledge outside of the university about this op-ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4775.157s">The</a>  university maintains that the op-ed was consistent with speech permitted by the Declaration on Freedom of Expression adopted by our trustees on November 7, 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4784.504s">For</a>  the record, a search on the Tufts Daily will reveal op-eds on multiple sides of the issue with opinions that were shared just as strongly as the op-ed Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4791.209s">Oster</a>  co-authored. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4792.63s">The</a>  university has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the university's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4802.116s">Six,</a>  our international students, faculty, and staff are vital to deliver on the education, teaching, research, and public service mission of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4809.88s">University</a>  sponsors 1,818 continuing international students on F-1 visas alongside 569 alumni who are pursuing post-completion work authorization in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4822.585s">24</a>  degree and non-degree students on J-1 visas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4825.247s">This</a>  is in addition to the broader community of students, faculty, and staff that hold various immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4831.474s">Seven,</a>  the free movement of our international community members is therefore essential to the functioning of the university and serving our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4837.783s">The</a>  university has heard from students, faculty and staff who are foregoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4846.576s">In</a>  the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4852.745s">The</a>  university declares that many of these students will go on to make significant economic and intellectual contributions to the United States and in countries around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4860.736s">They</a>  will do so, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4861.998s">by</a>  working in or building new companies through teaching and research and universities and other academic and healthcare institutions and through public service in the United States and across the globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4870.683s">The</a>  university is confident in its exploration because thousands of Tufts University alumni have received their education while on F-1 visas and have gone on to make a positive impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4879.267s">to</a>  the economic prosperity and intellectual success of the United States and in other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4884.412s">The</a>  undersigned submits this declaration on behalf of Tufts University in support of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4887.956s">Azterk</a>  and asks that she receive the due process rights to which she is entitled. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4892.46s">Based</a>  on everything we know and have shared here, the university seeks relief so that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4895.583s">Azterk</a>  is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.075s">And</a>  then it is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.895s">On</a>  behalf of the university, I understand declares under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on April 1 2025 at Tufts University Sunil Kumar president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4915.979s">I,</a>  I'm sorry that was so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4919.54s">I</a>  just felt that it was important to articulate everything that was shared with me from Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4926.302s">The</a>  important thing I think is that Tufts did give like a very, very thorough response. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4933.747s">And</a>  I just feel very strongly that we declare that the Constitution was not followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4947.797s">We</a>  still, Ramesa is still in Louisiana, and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4953.821s">And</a>  that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4955.102s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4957.4s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4962.165s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4963.106s">I</a>  want to thank yourself and Councilor Lazzaro for putting this together for this meeting's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4968.151s">I</a>  just think this is a moment in which it's really, really important for city leaders and leaders at all levels to be vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4974.557s">We're</a>  in a really scary era where the federal government is using all sorts of strategies <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4980.183s">to</a>  try and actively make people more scared, more vulnerable, more unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4987.106s">The</a>  goal of detentions like Ramesa's is to intimidate activists into hiding, to intimidate organizers into silence, to make non-citizens feel endangered, to make everyone afraid to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4999.35s">And</a>  I would hate to see the city of Medford perpetuate that because it's not going to help us withstand this very insidious culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5007.955s">So</a>  I'm very grateful to your leadership and putting this language forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5011.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5012.898s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Cohns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5013.979s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5017.141s">I'd</a>  like to thank you as well for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5022.353s">Scary</a>  and disgraceful that we're having federal authorities pick up students from the street, plainclothes officers, deporting them out of state so that they don't have access to legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5043.001s">And</a>  in many other cases, even just putting them out of the country and ignoring court orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5051.337s">just</a>  because they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5054.298s">Elections</a>  have consequences, and this is what we're seeing because of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5058.9s">I</a>  mean, in other parts of the country, it's not... Ramesa Ozturk was a case that received a lot of publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5068.363s">I</a>  worked for five years as a postdoc at Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5072.324s">I</a>  attempted <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5076.047s">Keyword</a>  attempted, didn't succeed to unionize over there, but ended up creating some groups that had a lot of postdocs on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5085.769s">And</a>  a lot of them are international. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5088.35s">And</a>  so they're coming up with a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5089.53s">And</a>  so they're sharing reports of people they know, their friends just being randomly abducted, detained in places like Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5100.81s">Maldon.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5102.071s">Last</a>  night, the Democratic City Committee met and decided to put some of the committee's own funding into purchasing 8,000 red cards, which are cards that you can give out to immigrants who may be at risk of being detained in order for them to understand their legal rights and understand how they <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5130.553s">can</a>  interact when federal authorities try to illegally detain them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5137.221s">In</a>  many cases, there have also been reports of just US citizens being detained because they're brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5143.068s">And</a>  then ICE will only figure that out later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5147.31s">when</a>  they go through their wallet and figure out that they were just randomly abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5153.796s">And</a>  what's going on here is that ICE is basically just taking in anybody that they can, trying to figure out if there was ever any lapse in Visa or anything that they might have done technically wrong on a piece of paper, and then using that as an excuse to deport them all while ignoring court orders <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5173.516s">to</a>  the contrary, and then publicizing the few cases where they actually do manage to deport a violent criminal, and then using those few cases as justification for this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5187.584s">So,</a>  it is important, I agree for city leaders to speak up vocally because intimidation is a big part of this intimidation is the name of the game here that is a huge reason why this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5206.501s">Independence</a>  at different levels of government can help to stop this, but understand that being vocal and vocally saying this isn't right is the best tool that we have to stop an authoritarian regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5223.455s">So</a>  again, I would just like to thank my colleague for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5232.21s">and</a>  I look forward to voting in favor of it and hearing whatever public comment we have.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5239.474s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5240.654s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5241.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5242.275s">I'll</a>  be brief because I think councilors have been very thorough with their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5247.278s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Councilor Lazzaro for introducing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5251.22s">I</a>  know a lot of residents have been clamoring for us to say something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5257.097s">and</a>  the timing of the regular meetings didn't allow us to make a statement earlier, but this is, it's helpful that we're doing it at the earliest possible opportunity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5270.332s">All</a>  I'll say is that this is a fearful time, and the freedom that we have to free speech and to our due process rights, which means not being deprived of our life, liberty, or property without a due process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5289.162s">These</a>  rights are sacred to who we are as Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5292.724s">They're</a>  sacred to democracy, and they form the bedrock of a strong society. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5300.115s">And</a>  I think this really exemplifies what I've been saying for a very long time, which is that oftentimes the national can be local. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5308.843s">And</a>  as the federal government seeks to interfere in people's everyday lives, seeks to interfere and retaliate against individuals for publishing their thoughts in an op-ed, be it something you agree with or disagree with, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5324.89s">As</a>  the federal government tries to commandeer state and local governments into following its policies when federalism exists, and when we have powers delegated to us, to the voters, to hold local and state officials accountable for, this all matters to the rule of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5345.383s">It</a>  all matters to who we are as Americans and our identity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5351.757s">I</a>  think passing a resolution like this tonight, you know, I wish we could do more, but this solidifies our intent as a city council to stand by our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5361.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5363.481s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sagan.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5365.642s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5370.623s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5372.904s">I</a>  have two hands on Zoom or one hand just went down and we have someone in the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5381.283s">We'll</a>  go to the podium first. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5386.346s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5387.307s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5389.668s">Hello</a>  again, Nick Traleo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5393.051s">Um</a>  I'd like to first just reiterate what I said in the earlier discussion about, you know, taking this resolution over resolution of the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5402.477s">Again,</a>  concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5405.107s">But</a>  in terms of what happened to miss us Turk, I just like to offer a legal perspective given the lawyer and this is what I do for a living is think about legal problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5414.439s">I</a>  think the issue is very narrow, to be honest with you, you know, because I think the legal questions really does a visa recipient. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5421.287s">have</a>  that same right to freedom of speech as a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5424.969s">And</a>  I'm not here to answer that question I mean it would require a great deal of research to try to understand what the law says on that subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5432.732s">Ultimately,</a>  I think it's a question that judges have to decide and that's what's happening right it's being litigated in the federal court. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5440.354s">So</a>  I think when we use inflammatory language, really on either side, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5445.177s">Screaming</a>  about deportation or screaming about political imprisonment, it really doesn't help address this problem, which is to try to resolve a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5455.005s">Another</a>  thing I'd like to just point out is I think this is a little bit beyond the scope of what the city council is tasked with doing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5462.75s">We're</a>  talking about federal immigration law here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5464.992s">I</a>  think every one of you would admit you don't have any jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5467.714s">to</a>  handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5468.956s">Um</a>  so, you know, ultimately, if you're not happy with what happened with miss Oster, you do have a right to be upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5474.822s">You</a>  do have a right to petition your elected representatives in Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5478.966s">Um</a>  but you know, let's try to respect what authority this city council has to actually do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5484.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5494.362s">Just</a>  a quick correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5496.164s">The</a>  Constitution protects freedom of speech for everybody in America, regardless of immigration status.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5506.752s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5507.052s">We'll</a>  go to Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5511.315s">You'll</a>  have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5512.716s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5514.695s">Yes,</a>  I'm Matthew Page-Liverman, 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5519.78s">First,</a>  I very much appreciate Councilor Lazzaroff for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5523.303s">I</a>  also appreciate Councilor Collins' editorial in Commonwealth Beacon, which I've not heard praised yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5532.352s">It's</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5532.972s">I</a>  hope everybody should read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5534.474s">There</a>  are four items I want to hit on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5535.955s">One</a>  is that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5538.7s">And</a>  I think we should really address this and absolutely kind of embarrassing misunderstanding about the role of the courts and interpretations at this moment in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5549.509s">It's</a>  extremely outdated and kind of really dense misunderstanding about the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5556.634s">You</a>  know, the first amendment about the right to freedom of speech is regarding what Congress may do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5564.1s">that</a>  Congress may not bridge this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5565.501s">Now</a>  that has been gone to be interpreted that the government, the federal government and the state governments may not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5571.405s">What</a>  we're dealing with right now is we know that the executive branch is carrying out things that even people in the legislature, including Republicans are saying, he's taken away, he's ignoring the whole first article of the constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5585.995s">That's</a>  what we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5587.096s">And</a>  we're dealing with <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5589.438s">courts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5590.559s">We're</a>  saying, well, the courts will reside. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5592.601s">Well,</a>  first off, the executive branch is saying we will ignore the courts and they're trying to discredit the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5599.807s">And</a>  we have a Supreme Court that just the other day or today said that they will temporarily permit Trump to do the Alien Enemies Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5609.107s">That's</a>  the situation we're dealing with in this kind of, well, we'll let the courts decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5613.049s">The</a>  courts are quite possibly not going to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5616.471s">And</a>  if they do, they can very quite possibly be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5619.672s">Okay,</a>  so it's not a question of what will the courts decide? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5622.854s">Let</a>  me tell you about the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5624.855s">Okay,</a>  a second component I really want to bring up is that Honan, or you know, the whatever czar, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5632.179s">you</a>  know, he actually changed his mind as much as he threatens Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5638.104s">He</a>  changed his mind just the other day in that, you know, ICE went to, they said there are people doing child sex trafficking, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5646.492s">And</a>  they have to go get some, well, they also round up three people, there are three children, and they transfer them to Texas, they're undocumented, but they figure we'll round them up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5655.34s">Well,</a>  people protested outside Honan's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5658.743s">And</a>  then he changed his mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5660.464s">And</a>  those people are being those three children being flown back from Texas to I forget the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5665.586s">But</a>  that's what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5666.826s">That's</a>  what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5667.807s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5670.128s">Okay,</a>  that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5671.588s">At</a>  a moment like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5673.609s">At</a>  a moment like this, there was only one answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5675.95s">And</a>  that's when the people rise up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5678.591s">And</a>  don't just say this is not acceptable, but make it a living hell for the new authoritarians. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5684.013s">And</a>  then the third thing is about the canary mission, that there are people that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5689.583s">like</a>  a Stasi government, they destroyed, they decided to retaliate against somebody for an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5696.367s">And</a>  they are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5698.148s">They</a>  are tattling on people in the community, trying to get them deported. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5701.45s">And</a>  those are the people that we should be saying are not welcome in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5705.013s">Those</a>  people that are ratting up people in the federal government, trying to get them expelled, the people in the Canary Mission, and those people- MJ, your time's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5714.178s">Well,</a>  those are the people we should also name.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5718.341s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5723.73s">Go</a>  to the podium, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5725.792s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5727.653s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5727.913s">My</a>  name is Micah Shalom Hesselman, and I live at 499 Main Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5734.918s">Thank</a>  you, councillors, and councillors of our own in particular, because I've had a lot of back and forth, too, for bringing forth this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5742.424s">And</a>  to the people who are, whatever, I have a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5746.827s">But</a>  this is an important resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5749.969s">We</a>  are a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5752.202s">Rumeysa,</a>  she did not live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5757.743s">However,</a>  that's at our doorstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5759.823s">We've</a>  been railing against this since Mahmoud Khalil was illegally abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5764.664s">And</a>  we have people that are literally being blocked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5767.945s">To</a>  the previous speaker's point, most of this is due to basically lists given to these people by Canary Mission and Beitar and these doxing groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5780.707s">Now,</a>  I am also a lawyer, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5784.09s">So</a>  I also have some legal opinions on what is going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5788.413s">This</a>  is unlawful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5789.474s">If</a>  you could just address the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5791.055s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5792.896s">This</a>  is clearly unlawful behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5796.339s">Before</a>  even getting to the freedom of speech and the basic freedoms, you cannot arrest people without having cause, without giving them cause and showing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5807.076s">You</a>  cannot have masked individuals show up and black bag someone and then post hoc justify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5814.384s">That</a>  is not how a lawful society can be run. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5817.787s">That's</a>  how you get people shooting each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5820.33s">So</a>  yeah, it's a big deal, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5823.834s">Arguably</a>  more important than the charter issue, which is also very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5827.258s">But</a>  this is an important issue too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5830.603s">Further,</a>  this is important to me as a resident of Medford, because all of this is being done under this veneer of fighting back against anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5840.271s">I</a>  am a Jew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5841.692s">I</a>  am a Semite. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5843.554s">This</a>  is using actually laws that were expressly anti-Semitic in form, purpose, and function to deport people for expressing opinions about a foreign government and their conduct <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5860.073s">against</a>  people in that region. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5863.074s">It</a>  has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5865.314s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5867.675s">And</a>  we should be pushing back on this as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5871.875s">Last</a>  thing I want to say is that I understand that no one's sure what they can do right now when it comes to these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5879.197s">And</a>  to Councilor Tseng's point, yes, this is a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5883.838s">We</a>  are doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5884.898s">It's</a>  small, but at least it's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5886.678s">I</a>  urge the committee or the council <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5890.296s">to</a>  look at ways you can set up a committee or working group to proactively guard Medford, our community, against federal overreach and increasing lawlessness, which is only going to continue to get worse as things go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5907.759s">There</a>  is no indication that they're going to be any better about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5911.56s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5913.36s">Something</a>  needs to happen, something real. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5915.801s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5916.101s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5916.761s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5917.161s">Thank</a>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6100.765s">Hi</a>  everybody, my name is Michael Prentke. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6102.646s">I</a>  live at 340 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6106.588s">I</a>  don't have a lot extra to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6108.769s">I</a>  just want to kind of amplify what my friend Micah had to say earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6112.411s">I</a>  appreciate his sentiments and I appreciate Councilman Lazzaro's introduction of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6121.075s">I</a>  too am Jewish and want to sort of further this <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6127.275s">dialogue</a>  that these actions by ICE is not making Jews safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6133.539s">I</a>  want to be very clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6136.341s">I,</a>  as a Jew, do not feel any safer with this, these deportations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6141.344s">In</a>  fact, I would say it's actually offensive that they're saying this is in the name of anti-Semitism, that we're deporting these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6147.748s">That</a>  actually makes me feel less safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6151.731s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6165.461s">Jennifer</a>  Yanko, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6168.583s">I</a>  want to thank the council for putting forth this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6174.947s">It's</a>  true that it's just a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6178.468s">But</a>  I think that we might underestimate the power of speaking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6183.31s">And</a>  I feel really proud and safer to be in a community that's willing to say no, not on our watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6192.253s">Because</a>  this is not happening only in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6195.034s">And</a>  let's face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6196.855s">where</a>  Rumesa was picked up is right across the border. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6200.198s">It</a>  may as well be in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6201.88s">But</a>  this is happening all over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6204.022s">I</a>  grew up in Western Washington State, and people are being rounded up there in large numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6212.769s">And</a>  so I think it's really important that we do speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6215.231s">And</a>  I just want to thank you and say, yes, it's so important to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6221.157s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6235.001s">Hi,</a>  I'm Katie Dick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6236.563s">I'm</a>  at 129 Traincraft Northwest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6239.705s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Lazzaro for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6244.008s">I</a>  think what happened to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6246.43s">Ozturk</a>  is an unconscionable act by ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6251.465s">And</a>  so I agree with all of the speakers ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6254.487s">I</a>  just think it's so important that we speak out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6256.928s">This</a>  is right in our backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6259.329s">And,</a>  you know, as someone who sort of won the citizenship lottery, enjoys all the privileges of being a US citizen, I think it's important that people in our own community who don't sort of enjoy the benefits of this lottery ticket know that a lot of us are <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6280.22s">Looking</a>  out for them, I'm terrified of what might happen to friends and neighbors here in Medford under these circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6291.268s">And</a>  so I'm strongly in support of this resolution and grateful to the council for speaking out and for anything that we can do here in Medford to support the immigrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6301.696s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6303.878s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6304.378s">Go</a>  back to the podium, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6308.661s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6311.442s">Ezekiel</a>  Silverstein, 71 Kenmia Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6317.507s">I</a>  understand the councilors bringing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6322.071s">Rumeysa</a>  was, even though apparently not a resident of Medford, was part of the Medford community, and it is your purview to try and defend your constituents or members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6335.312s">And</a>  even if it comes out that all she did was write an op-ed that I personally disagree with wholeheartedly, I think it's offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6344.322s">But</a>  freedom of speech is incredibly important, and due process needs to be obeyed and abided by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6352.151s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6355.843s">she</a>  should be afforded all those rights of due process and her moment in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6362.709s">But</a>  someone else brought up others like Mahmoud Khadil or others like Mahmoud Uttal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6369.635s">There</a>  are other people who are being <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6372.578s">apprehended</a>  and in court for deportation, who have provided material support for terrorist organizations, who have offended the rights of other students on other campuses, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6390.851s">And</a>  if someone here is taking action that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6396.833s">offends</a>  the rights, the civil rights of citizens, then their visas can and, in my opinion, should be revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6403.798s">But</a>  Ramesa Ozturk, from my understanding, has only committed speech, and that is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6413.065s">So</a>  if it does come out that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6417.538s">She</a>  has provided other support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6421.62s">We</a>  wouldn't want people who support ISIS coming into this country on a visa. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6426.401s">If</a>  people who support Hamas come in, then that's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6431.753s">But</a>  as it stands, her freedom of speech has been bridged, and I think that due process needs to be abided by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6440.195s">I</a>  hate the as a Jew statement, but I do feel safer when people who support terrorist organizations that call for the genocide of Jews are removed from this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6453.939s">She</a>  has freedom of speech, but it's limited as a non-citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6459.081s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6459.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6464.06s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6467.488s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6468.65s">I'll</a>  just be brief as a co sponsor, but also as the chair I didn't want to say anything until everyone had had their say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6475.437s">One</a>  thing I think that's important to note is when what councilors are read on the previous or earlier on this item, Tufts made it very clear that I slide about when the visa was revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6488.588s">So</a>  it's another post-hoc attempt to justify this abhorrent act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6495.013s">The</a>  Supreme Court ruled yesterday, yes, that some of these folks are gonna have to refile in different courts of jurisdiction, but they were very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6503.303s">I</a>  believe it was 9 to 0, that there is no justification for this venue shopping and trying to move people from Boston to Louisiana before their lawyers have the ability to file a habeas petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6518.992s">The</a>  government's blatantly violating basic due process rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6521.713s">Never</a>  mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6522.194s">That's</a>  before we get to the question of First Amendment rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6526.876s">Just</a>  to say, oh, we're going to get you out of the country faster than your lawyer can file a habeas petition <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6531.879s">one</a>  of the most egregious violations of due process that I think we've seen since the internment of Japanese people in the 1940s during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6542.906s">And</a>  again, to note that the Alien Enemies Act was what Franklin Roosevelt used to justify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6549.711s">It's</a>  a 1798 law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6551.191s">I</a>  think our values have changed a little bit since 1798, maybe at least only for some of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6558.536s">And</a>  just on the point of acting locally, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6562.67s">I</a>  can't really think of a greater danger to our residents and masked agents of the state abducting people off the street and beyond a resolution I would like to see the city seriously consider not just this item like the know your rights information but. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6580.865s">Joining</a>  up with Community members and potentially using city employees to warn residents when ice is present in the Community, I think it's essential that residents are informed that there are dangerous people here who might try to take them for no reason against their basic human rights, and I say that to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6603.279s">When</a>  we passed the welcoming city ordinance a couple months ago, there was a. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6610.292s">you</a>  know, some statements and questions went around, well, it's not going to happen to US citizens, or it's not going to happen to naturalized citizens, or it's not going to happen to green card holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6619.958s">Well,</a>  it's not just, there's not just, you know, I think it's this mythical idea that there's this group of violent immigrants who have no documentation, and that's who is going to be attacked, and no one else is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6632.807s">Well,</a>  it's visa holders who've done nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6635.588s">It's</a>  green card holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6638.438s">And</a>  we've heard stories from the border of Canadian citizens, of naturalized U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6645.761s">citizens,</a>  of natural born, native born U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6648.242s">citizens</a>  being detained by ICE because they refuse to turn over their phone so that ICE can search whether they've put out statements against the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6658.946s">So</a>  it's everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6660.587s">It's</a>  moving up the scale every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6663.352s">Um,</a>  and that's why we passed that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6665.773s">We</a>  said, we're not going to cooperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6666.994s">And</a>  now I think it's up to us to convene, uh, and to push the mayor to take action, to actively warn residents that there are dangerous agents of this Trump regime who are coming to this community who, um, may well pose them grave danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6684.924s">I</a>  think that's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6686.264s">That's</a>  what local government should do. <a

are around, especially because, as was noted, we don't have the ability to tell them not to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6698.225s">You</a>  know, when dangerous people, when danger happens, local government, you know, stands up and says, we're going to try to stop this danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6707.353s">And</a>  the sad part of what's happening right now is we can't tell the federal government not to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6711.816s">All</a>  we can do is say they're here, please stay away. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6714.938s">So</a>  that's something I would like to see happen personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6717.14s">And</a>  I thank you for your indulgence in me making that statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6722.457s">Is</a>  there any further discussion by members of the public or members of the council on this resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6726.678s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6733.261s">Milton</a>  McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6737.082s">I</a>  understand that this resolution is symbolic, but I think it's an important statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6741.304s">So</a>  I thank you on a somewhat separate topic, but I believe it's related. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6747.446s">There's</a>  also been <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6749.26s">an</a>  attack on DEI in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6753.401s">And</a>  I know that I personally have reached out to our DEI director to offer my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6760.984s">And</a>  I don't know if the council has, and I don't, I'm not aware that any public statement has been made, but I would like you to consider offering support to our DEI director at this time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6773.948s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6775.043s">Thank</a>  you, yes, we have offered support including the prior ordinance on the transgender rights and reproductive healthcare inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6784.67s">But</a>  if someone would wanna make an amendment to add that to the resolution, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6792.617s">I'd</a>  be happy to add that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6796.9s">Should</a>  we do it as a B paper since the main paper is about Ramesa? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6802.402s">Is</a>  there a preference on this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6803.765s">Do</a>  you have a preference, Councilor Lazzaro?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6809.977s">A</a>  B paper would be my preference.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6813.345s">And</a>  I also want to, to that point, draw attention to the work that we're doing in our resident services, resident services committee on a human rights commission ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6827.17s">So</a>  essentially we are reforming that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6831.272s">So</a>  the HRC has a lot more power to advise city governments about <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6839.636s">how</a>  to protect our residents, how to inform residents of their rights on DEI measures as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6845.557s">So</a>  defending diversity, equity, and inclusion, and having more voices there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6851.059s">And</a>  I hope that residents will support that measure as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6857.4s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6858.38s">We</a>  do have one hand raised again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6863.522s">Matthew</a>  Page-Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6865.222s">Matthew,</a>  I can go to you for one more minute since you've already spoken once.</p>
