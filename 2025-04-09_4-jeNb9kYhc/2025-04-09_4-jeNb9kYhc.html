    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1951.405s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1952.625s">Thank</a>  you very much for having us here this evening to give you an update on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1957.647s">This</a>  evening, as Council President mentioned, here with Brenda Pike, also Tom Ellis, Josh Doolittle. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1965.069s">Tom</a>  is from JLL, our owner's project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1968.37s">Josh</a>  is from our designer B2Q, and Alicia Hunt from the city's Office of Sustainability is also here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1978.542s">As</a>  we've previously presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1980.723s">This</a>  is a comprehensive project to replace and update the HVAC and heating ventilation air conditioning systems at the McGlynn in the Andrews with modern systems the buildings as mentioned previously are approaching 25 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1996.949s">The</a>  building systems have expended their useful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2001.231s">At</a>  present, we have previously been here for $5 million for pre purchase of equipment that pre purchase of equipment actually went through this past Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2011.662s">There</a>  was Herculean effort done by all parties involved including the city's procurement office, mayor's office, and vice chair of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2020.451s">So</a>  really appreciate everybody who has really made this project happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2024.554s">It's</a>  definitely a sprint to make sure that we get these systems installed prior to students arriving as best as possible at the end of August. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2034.522s">So</a>  phase one pre-construction involved $5 million and we appreciate that bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2040.387s">Of</a>  that was equipment pre-purchase of $3.3 million and numerous other costs that you can see on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2052.317s">construction</a>  for this project as we enter phase two is estimated to be $22,945,000 with <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2062.787s">contingency</a>  costs of $687,273 for owner contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2070.929s">Designer</a>  through construction to finish the project for B2Q is $1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2075.75s">Our</a>  owner's project manager, $484,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2079.07s">And</a>  other contingencies not considered in the GMP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2083.271s">GMP</a>  stands for gross maximum price. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2086.012s">That</a>  means that our costs will not exceed the gross maximum price when we're using construction management at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2092.973s">The</a>  construction manager, Consigli, has been brought on early in the design process so that they can be involved in making sure that we have a complete package ready to be installed, ordered and installed for our schools.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2109.726s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to talk a little bit about some of these other costs that we have on here, which include $500,000 for <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2118.366s">commissioning</a>  the systems once they're installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2121.81s">We</a>  have in here 619,000 for ADA upgrades that were triggered by a project of this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2129.958s">I</a>  want to note here that there's an additional 2.3 million in ADA upgrades that were identified through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2141.238s">Because</a>  of changes in ADA requirements from when the building was built to now, based on the consultant's experience, they expect that we can get variances for those because while the $619,000 that we have here is for things that are <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2159.428s">are</a>  that are considered we consider very beneficial, or not too costly beneficial like fixing the entrance to the McGlynn so that there's no lip there that that wheelchairs can't get over for instance, the that additional 2.3 million are for things that are changes that are have very <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2184.026s">relatively</a>  small benefits, but relatively high costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2188.088s">So</a>  for instance, moving a sink up one inch and all the associated plumbing and tiling and other costs along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2196.591s">So</a>  we're going through that variance process in April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2203.373s">I'll</a>  note here the IT rooms, we now have just the IT rooms for the Anders and McGlynn listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2209.896s">The</a>  other three schools IT room equipment <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2213.385s">will</a>  be done through the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2217.888s">We</a>  have the McGlynn roof refurbishment at $1.5 million instead of a $3 million replacement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2226.574s">The</a>  warranty is roughly the same and would still allow for moving forward with solar if we decide that we want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2235.838s">And</a>  then I also want to point out that we are expecting about $2.2 million in mass save incentives for this project but those are reimbursable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2245.244s">So,</a>  we've, we have to authorize the spending and buy the equipment and install them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2252.638s">before</a>  getting those rebates back some months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2257.143s">So</a>  that amount is not included in the 25 or that amount is not subtracted from that $25 million bond because we do need to have that to spend that up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2269.834s">But</a>  we do expect that long term, we won't be paying that off for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2277.284s">And</a>  then I would add that we have solar on here as an add alternate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2282.408s">That's</a>  not included in the above cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2284.41s">We</a>  had just been considering it if we were able to do it cheaper through this process than we otherwise would be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2292.976s">And</a>  it's still a possibility if the project comes in under the expected cost, but it's not included right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2301.888s">project</a>  could very well come in under the this expected cost here, because we do have some very healthy contingencies built in, not just that owner contingency and the construction contingencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2312.457s">But</a>  we also have over $2 million in contingencies for possible tariffs and possible second shift work if the project is delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2321.064s">And</a>  so we need to do a lot of second shift work in order to make up the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2325.027s">So</a>  we're hoping that that won't need to be dug into too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2328.77s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2329.35s">it's</a>  there so that we don't have to come back to you a third time.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2335.535s">We</a>  are being very proactive, though, in making sure that this project is being well managed, well run. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2340.84s">Our</a>  OPM is being really on the ball with us and the construction management designer as well to make sure that we are well prepared <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2350.649s">when</a>  we hit the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2352.01s">We've</a>  already worked internally as a school to make sure that all summer programming has been redistributed throughout the district to other buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2359.475s">And</a>  we are making efforts to make sure that if any office staff need to be moved as well, they'll be able to be moved during the summer as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2369.183s">Just</a>  one more slide for the final. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2372.145s">So</a>  you can see the total costs <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2375.388s">brought</a>  in and our hopes that $30,111,000 number does include healthy contingencies that we plan to be very hawkish on and preserve as much of that as possible for the City of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2397.583s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2398.724s">And</a>  this is our third time I think seeing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2401.987s">If</a>  you could, could you just discuss any thing that's changed since the first two presentations that we received and then I can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2408.913s">I'm</a>  sure a lot of small things have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2410.435s">You</a>  can keep it to the bigger things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2411.636s">And</a>  then I'll go to Vice President Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2414.492s">I</a>  would say the two most significant changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2418.495s">We</a>  were planning to do some mechanical installations in the building for cost savings and preventing workers from being in the buildings we've moved a lot of the equipment to rooftop rooftop units. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2432.766s">I'm</a>  just turning to my team to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2435.207s">I</a>  have a lot of other things besides the HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2437.668s">So</a>  as the assistant superintendent, but this is definitely the biggest project right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2442.11s">So</a>  that's a major piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2445.091s">I</a>  would say the second major piece is the ADA upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2449.973s">If</a>  I'm going to be honest, we, these buildings were built in 2001, and open to students in 2001, that is well after the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, but codes have changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2462.449s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2463.25s">So,</a>  I would say that and just so everyone is clear, when a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2468.777s">exceeds</a>  30% of the assessed value of the buildings and the assessed value of these buildings in the city of Medford is approximately $69, $70 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2479.7s">So</a>  once you exceed 30%, it requires a full review of the entire structure for ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2488.143s">So</a>  I'd say those are the two biggest things in my book that have changed.</p>

    <p>[Brenda Pike]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2492.309s">Yeah,</a>  and then I would say in terms of the budget the base, the difference would be that the tariff contingency and the second shift premium contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2500.613s">I</a>  think the budget is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2504.324s">about</a>  a million dollars higher than what we had anticipated it would be the last time that we came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2508.949s">And</a>  that's entirely because the additional contingencies that we built in there.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2514.876s">There</a>  is Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2516.758s">One</a>  more thing to when I had entered this project I had fully expected for us to go for a new roof, a soup to nuts new roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2524.086s">because</a>  the added R value insulation of a new roof following the 2011 building codes of Massachusetts, I expected to have considerable savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2534.509s">The</a>  new roof would cost approximately $3 million all in new roofing materials, EPDM, and the insulation plus the labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2546.292s">The</a>  reality is, okay, that we get the same <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2550.795s">Warranty</a>  as a fluid applied solution that was done to the Andrews roof so we get a 20 year life expectancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2561.004s">we</a>  would only see approximately $300,000 of savings from the new installation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2569.291s">So</a>  we would be spending $1.2 million to get essentially the same outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2576.897s">So</a>  a restoration is not only the most fiscally responsible, but it achieves the same end as a new roof.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2587.045s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2587.906s">Go</a>  to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2591.963s">I</a>  wanted to thank you again for coming before us to again, describe this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2597.464s">For</a>  folks who weren't at the previous presentations that the city council received on this, just to quickly paraphrase the overview that you gave, my understanding is this is to support the urgent and necessary HVAC repairs and roof repairs so that when kids go back to school in the fall, they'll have functioning air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2617.828s">and</a>  non-leaky roofs to enjoy at the start of the new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2621.409s">Very</a>  glad that we can support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2624.55s">I'm</a>  so glad to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2625.671s">Obviously,</a>  taking on a major capital expense is not something that any of us take lightly, but I'm glad that this project is one whose scale enables us to do those ADA upgrades that I know people in the community have been asking for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2638.234s">Thank</a>  you for your diligence around that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2640.735s">I</a>  appreciate all of the documentation for continuing to keep the council abreast of this and I would motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2650.003s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2650.204s">We</a>  have a motion to approve from Vice President Collins, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2653.694s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Tseng and we'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2656.595s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2658.415s">I</a>  know that it's not not you two but Mr. Dickinson's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2662.435s">Did</a>  we entertain by any chance using any of the 28 million dollars in free cash now that we see is that that number came out a few weeks ago that we have in excess of 28 million and in the past we've shown that we've actively actively worked by moving that money into capital projects to possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2683.847s">speed</a>  things up and then take some future costs to our citizens away, if that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2692.492s">I'm</a>  not qualified to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2697.394s">We</a>  will be looking at all different ways to finance this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2701.477s">Obviously,</a>  there's a lot of it that absolutely... Okay, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2710.664s">Obviously</a>  this has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2714.635s">When</a>  I'm looking at it, I'm looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2717.647s">how</a>  much the interest in principal cost will affect the budget going forward right now, five, six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2727.972s">It</a>  does put, if we borrow this full sum of money, it would put a big damper on the budget in 2028 and 2029 given the increase we would get through Prop 2.5 and new growth and what debt is actually coming off <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2745.2s">of</a>  our debt schedule, our waterfall schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2749.164s">So</a>  yes, we will probably be looking hard at not only using free cash to fund some of this to see how we can fit everything into the budget, but also the timing of the borrowings and when we will actually have to start paying principal and interest on the full general obligation bond.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2767.125s">So</a>  that's good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2768.406s">Like</a>  I said, I didn't expect to use all $28 million and get this project done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2773.449s">But</a>  I know that since we have $20 million and we need to move quickly with this project, I appreciate the fact that we're looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2780.933s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Dickinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=2781.534s">No,</a>  we're looking at this very carefully.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3052.162s">Great,</a>  so we'd like to hear a bit more about the petition, what you're requesting, and then we will discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Mike Morello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3059.127s">Yeah,</a>  so as you may know, back in 2013, we installed a back-to-back digital billboard, 282 Mystic Ave, and at such time, the digital screens have outlived their useful life, and they're antiquated, so we're simply asking to amend the existing special permit just to simply replace the existing digital screens.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3083.735s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3084.295s">It</a>  also says that there's a request to reduce the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3087.959s">Do</a>  you have any comment on that?</p>

    <p>[Mike Morello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3090.101s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3090.401s">So</a>  a couple of years ago, I believe at 262, Mr. Gaff, we replaced the digital screens on that unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3096.947s">And</a>  I believe the permit fee was approximately $5,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3099.709s">And</a>  I'm not sure if anything's changed with the current bylaws when it comes to the price on permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3108.101s">this</a>  permit is a little over $24,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3110.942s">So</a>  I'm not sure what the huge difference was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3115.144s">So</a>  I have a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3117.985s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3118.245s">Um,</a>  I can't say that we have been a lot of the city's fees have not been updated in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3123.067s">It's</a>  very likely that the building department may have updated them to reflect the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3127.649s">But</a>  I'm going to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3129.77s">If</a>  I could, Mr. President, I think that, uh, the first issue with changing of the signs, I understand it gets <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3136.872s">The</a>  systems are antiquated we need to move forward as long as there aren't any huge changes that would disrupt our residents, I don't think it's a problem but again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3147.9s">both</a>  with this and with the adjusting the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3152.763s">I</a>  think if we could probably table this to the next meeting and get some updates, and then I don't see that the changeover will be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3162.229s">And</a>  if we can look into seeing what the qualifications or the protocol for the fee structure, and then maybe you can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3169.894s">But</a>  right now, I don't think we're equipped to vote on that this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3175.021s">I</a>  appreciate the petitioner being here, petitioner speaking on behalf, but if we could table this to the next meeting, that'd be super important, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3184.009s">And</a>  Councilor Stroud, just to clarify the motion, if the petitioner wanted to move forward tonight without changing the fee, would you be comfortable with that or do you think</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3196.49s">I</a>  would feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3197.491s">I</a>  just like I said, I don't see the any of the particulars in front of me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3202.096s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3202.476s">All</a>  I'm hearing is a petitioner saying that just changing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3205.019s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3205.739s">And</a>  I, we, unfortunately, I don't have anything in front that might cause some problems legally for us.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3212.106s">All</a>  right, so there's a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3214.728s">to</a>  the next regular meeting, actually motion to continue the public hearing to the next regular meeting and request an update on the application and the fee from the building department and also to request legal to give us an opinion on whether or not we can reduce the fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3236.043s">When</a>  you have that, Mr. Clerk, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3239.649s">All</a>  right, so there's a motion to continue the public hearing to the April 29 meeting by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3247.634s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3251.716s">Seeing</a>  none.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3252.397s">On</a>  Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3254.778s">Oh,</a>  sorry, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3257.545s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to make sure that we're not sending stuff to legal that we don't need to send to legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3262.186s">My</a>  understanding from the building commissioner is that on that we are the appropriate body to make appeals and final decisions when it has already gone through the building department on things like signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3277.85s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3280.331s">I'm</a>  not positive it doesn't need to go to legal, but I think we should not just send everything to legal just to send things to legal.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3289.637s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3290.657s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3293.119s">Out</a>  of all due respect, this is the fourth time I've asked something that I feel important that might put our committee in question legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3304.88s">to</a>  go to legal and this councilor has refused a question to every single one and i find this to be a problem this is very easy if we had a city solicitor i'm the i'm the eldest uh i'm i've sat in a seat longer than anybody here i've been here when we've had an active city solicitor that i could call any time to answer any questions so we can move an issue forward unfortunately this is year four without a city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3331.543s">So</a>  if one member of this council, out of due respect, if it was my fellow council, the same question, I wouldn't stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3338.629s">So</a>  this is an issue that if we move something forward and legally comes back on us, I'd rather not pay the consequences with a higher fee or a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3348.058s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3477.038s">No,</a>  I owe the respect to my fellow councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3480.399s">We've</a>  started resolutions that thought would be quick and lasted 45 to one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3487.582s">As</a>  I said, residents that are on the charter committee that said that, unfortunately, they can't stay later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3496.685s">These</a>  are people that have worked in this community on this project for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3501.126s">I</a>  would hope we give them the respect to move them to the front so we could hear them, so they could <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3506.001s">be</a>  off and whatever the resolution ends up to be, that they can be heard and then move on to their evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3514.948s">And</a>  from what I hear, most of them to sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3517.33s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3518.771s">I</a>  think you can make the same arguments the other way, given that this ordinance has also been- So don't vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3669.057s">Yes,</a>  I'm the affirmative, negative, the motion passes, Councilor say, Thank you, Mr. President, um, as we, as, as we know from watching the news and from paying attention to, you know, our neighbors concerns over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3684.896s">The</a>  access to gender affirming care and reproductive health care has become an incredibly contentious issue in our country, despite these being basic forms of medical care and basic rights that individuals have, or should have in this country, and has have historically had in this country until recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3703.9s">A</a>  lot of our residents are fairly asking us how we can best protect our own neighbors best protect our own residents and provide the security that they need and need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3716.265s">for</a>  enjoying their lives here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3719.268s">This</a>  ordinance would protect medical providers and people who seek that care from out-of-state arrest warrants and prosecutions, from out-of-state attempts to apply laws that aren't Massachusetts laws, laws that aren't Massachusetts values to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3739.926s">We've</a>  heard early on in the process years ago that if we didn't pass something like this, it was very likely, if not mandatory, that we would have to carry out those warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3750.33s">Now</a>  the situation at the state level has changed, but it is important for us to reaffirm this and to acknowledge that just because state law says something doesn't mean that we can't back that up as well, and that we need that additional layer of protection for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3769.856s">During</a>  the process, Councilor Lazzaro and I worked hard to invite stakeholders, including medical providers in the community, including residents with experience, including city staff across the health police departments and the administration to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3790.29s">We</a>  know that Medford faces limited resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3794.954s">We've</a>  talked about that over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3797.416s">We</a>  want to make sure that those resources aren't expended to the end of denying any individual's right to their bodily autonomy or to criminalize any person's effort to live as their full and authentic self. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3811.554s">This</a>  ordinance, if you walk through it, essentially protects the information, the health information of people who come to Medford to use our care. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3823.88s">It</a>  protects health information from medical providers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3827.568s">It</a>  affirms our city's policy and enshrines into law that we won't treat any individual differently based on their gender identity or gender expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3842.973s">It</a>  follows state laws language with regards to definitions with regards to how we're going to do what I just described. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3851.821s">It</a>  also empowers our city to to provide fair access to reproductive health and gender affirming healthcare information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3860.531s">Because</a>  we know that there are predatory sources out there that are putting limited or fake information out into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3870.121s">This</a>  empowers our administration to post proper guidelines, to post <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3877.168s">a</a>  full comprehensive picture as to that information on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3881.409s">I</a>  know there are residents who want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3882.969s">I</a>  know there are councilors who've worked hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3886.11s">I</a>  do also want to thank councilors Collins, Bears, and former councilor Morell for introducing parts of this ordinance as well, or a resolution language to support this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3896.972s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3898.312s">Thank</a>  you, councilor Sagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3899.152s">Is</a>  there a further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3901.993s">Council</a>  Vice President Tom.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3905.635s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3907.498s">I</a>  just want to share my gratitude for this Councilors for the sponsors for shepherding through this draft which strongly and boldly defines protections for seekers of gender affirming and reproductive health care in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3918.259s">This</a>  draft has gone through a careful legal review, and its sponsors, Councilors Sang and Lazzaro, made sure it was in alignment with other communities and with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3927.746s">And</a>  I want to highlight that this is protective of the whole city because it guarantees that if the federal government decides to pick a fight over cities allowing unfettered access to health care, then we won't be fighting that battle alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3938.494s">We'll</a>  be going in as part of a regional and statewide cavalry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3942.513s">We</a>  are in a moment where the federal government is attacking women's access to health care and trans and non-binary people's access to health care in a deliberate attempt to punish political enemies and create a distraction from this administration's catastrophic economic agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3957.92s">They're</a>  making a goal of actively making Americans' lives worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3961.341s">And</a>  I'm very grateful for this leadership to do what we can on the city level to say that won't happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3966.63s">So</a>  I want to extend my gratitude to the sponsors and also to the residents who held this council to account for making this ordinance happen.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3974.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3975.016s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3977.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3978.838s">I</a>  just wanted to also extend my gratitude to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Morell, President Bears, and the city's legal team, KP Law, for helping us <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3995.809s">review</a>  the ordinance and align it with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=3999.531s">And</a>  this draft, I think, is the strongest we can make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4003.774s">So</a>  I think we're really in a position to protect our residents to the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4009.117s">And</a>  I'm proud of how far we've taken it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4012.919s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mike Denton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4067.956s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4070.968s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Collins for saying everything that I was coming here to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4078.27s">So</a>  I'd just like to reiterate that as a business owner who serves a wide swath of the community that would be directly impacted by this ordinance, thank you, thank you, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4094.014s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4096.595s">I</a>  think the only other thing that I wanted to say is that this is the kind of ordinance that will go a long way to making sure that people who live in Medford know that Medford cares about them and that there's a degree of safety that they're going to work towards for on their behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4117.619s">So</a>  thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4120.399s">Medford</a>  sees you and appreciates you and that, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4124.749s">the</a>  slice of Medford that I'm exposed to sees you and appreciate it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4129.172s">So</a>  that's all.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4132.194s">Thank</a>  you, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4134.956s">We'll</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4137.037s">Name</a>  and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4138.018s">For</a>  the record, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4141.16s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4141.7s">Nick</a>  Troleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4144.042s">I</a>  was originally going to comment on the substance of this motion and just express some opinions about why I think it's overbroad and doesn't really do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4153.11s">I'm</a>  very frustrated with what procedurally happened leading up to this taking of this motion or this resolution, sorry, discussion of the ordinance out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4162.815s">I</a>  think it's really, really shameful that this Council would not second Councilor Scarpelli's motion to take the city charter resolution out of order and discuss that first. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4174.962s">We're</a>  prioritizing here <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4176.633s">an</a>  ordinance on gender identity over our city charter, our constitutional foundational government, the changes in the city charter are going to significantly impact how elected officials are elected in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4189.757s">So</a>  the fact that we would just not even second the motion and not even be courageous enough to vote no on it really is shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4196.7s">So</a>  I think everyone in this council who did that should be ashamed of themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4200.581s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4244.002s">That's</a>  a lemon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4247.044s">I'll</a>  just go Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4247.765s">I</a>  was just saying, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4251.907s">Yes,</a>  77 affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4254.249s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4254.829s">None</a>  of the negative motion passes for first reading. <a href="../resolutions/25-055.pdf"><font color="green">25-055</font></a> resolution to support the release of Ramesa Ozturk council is our own president bears whereas Ramesa Ozturk was an international student with a legal student visa at Tufts University in Medford and whereas Ramesa Ozturk student visa was canceled because she co-wrote an op-ed in 2024 and the Tufts University student newspaper that was critical of the Tufts administration's refusal to acknowledge and stand against the ongoing genocide in Gaza and
 <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4284.303s">whereas</a>  the Constitution protects everyone in the United States regardless of immigration status, and whereas the First Amendment of the Constitution protects the rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government, and where it's clear that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4295.617s">Öztürk's</a>  visa was canceled because of political speech, which is a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4301.092s">and</a>  where it is the obligation of our local, state, and federal government to uphold and protect the rights of our residents, permanent and temporary, all of whom are protected by the United States Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4310.502s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council condemns the abduction of Hermesa Ozturk by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as unlawful punishment for political speech, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4319.653s">and</a>  acknowledges and condemns that Ramesa Osterk is a political prisoner, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council calls for the release of Ramesa Osterk immediately, so that she may resume her studies of child development at Tufts University and her peaceful residence in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4333.315s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests an update from Tufts University on the specific policies to protect their students, faculty, and staff from similar abductions by ICE in the future, and to protect their community's right to exercise freedom of speech, assembly, and to petition the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4347.66s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that our partners in local government and our state and federal delegations speak out publicly against the unlawful arrest of a student in our community in violation of her due process rights and in violation of the United States Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4360.585s">Council</a>  Dizaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4362.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4364.651s">I</a>  found myself very upset when I saw the video of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4370.313s">Ozturk</a>  being taken by ICE officers from her home in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4376.796s">I'm</a>  very familiar with where she lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4379.617s">A</a>  close friend of mine lives on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4383.119s">And</a>  I've been there many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4385.52s">It's</a>  a safe neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4386.401s">It</a>  makes me feel, it made me feel very afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4390.431s">And</a>  as a local elected official, I felt that there wasn't much that I could do except for craft a resolution stating publicly the things that I felt were most egregious about what happened, which were that the Constitution was violated and the rule of law was ignored by our federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4417.102s">I</a>  wanted to point that out, I wanted to do it here, and I wanted to make sure that we had a forum where our residents can understand that their city government feels strongly that that's not okay, it's not what we believe in, and we do not think that this is something that we can let continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4439.68s">in</a>  any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4444.322s">This</a>  is what we have access to as city councillors, this is what we're able, this is our forum to be able to say something, so I thought it was appropriate to say something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4453.805s">I</a>  did reach out to Tufts University, our contact at Tufts as city councillors is Rocco DiRico, he is the Government Affairs <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4465.57s">connector,</a>  person, he is a great person to speak with in times like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4471.472s">And</a>  he did give me a couple of statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4474.014s">He</a>  sent me an email, I'd like to read just about what they, I mean, we spoke on the phone, he sent me a statement, and then he also updated me with the Tufts president's statement that also, it was posted online, so some people may have seen it, but I would also like to read that here because I feel that it does respond <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4494.183s">It</a>  is kind of the response that I call for in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4498.807s">So</a>  I feel that even beyond what I'm going to read, I think that Tufts has been really active in responding to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4508.056s">They've</a>  done things that you can't really talk about publicly because they've really tried to <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4515.543s">do</a>  everything in their power to have Remesa released. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4519.244s">And</a>  the administration at the federal level really doesn't always listen, even though people in power are really doing what they can to try to access humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4535.53s">anybody's</a>  humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4537.432s">So</a>  Rocco's response to me was the university recognizes how frightening the situation is for her, her family and the larger community here at Tufts, especially our international students, staff and faculty who may be feeling vulnerable or unsettled by these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4554.525s">We</a>  are in touch with local, state, and federal elected officials and hope that Rumeysa has provided the opportunity to avail herself of her due process rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4562.308s">The</a>  university is actively working to support the Tufts community as it mobilizes its collective resources and contacts to ensure our students' safety and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4571.411s">The</a>  university has sent emails to all our students, faculty, and staff <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4575.452s">to</a>  outline our protocol for engaging with government officials, recommendations for documentation, and support resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4582.155s">We</a>  encourage our students, faculty, and staff to contact the International Center for additional support and resources." <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4588.077s">And</a>  then he added in a later email, we're also working with Rameses' attorneys. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4593.999s">And</a>  there was also, I will also read, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4599.942s">The</a>  Declaration of Tufts University from President Sunil Kumar. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4607.422s">Tufts</a>  University, an entity legally known as the Trustees of Tufts College and henceforth referred to as Tufts University, the university or Tufts declares as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4617.625s">One,</a>  on Tuesday, March 25, 2025, the university learned that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral student from Turkey, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4630.668s">The</a>  university understands that she was leaving her home that evening for an iftar dinner hosted at the Tufts Interfaith Center, where she would break her Ramadan fast for the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4639.554s">Two,</a>  at around 6.30pm that evening, the Tufts University Police Department received courtesy notification from the Somerville Police Department that an individual had been detained by federal authorities and that the person in custody might be a Tufts student. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4652.563s">We</a>  confirmed through our records that the person in question was Ramesa Ozturk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4656.645s">Three,</a>  at 7.32 p.m., Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4658.626s">Ozturk's</a>  record in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, was updated to note that her visa was terminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4667.489s">Prior</a>  to that, and at the time of her detention, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4669.47s">Ozturk</a>  was in, quote, good immigration standing, according to her record in SEVIS, and both Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4674.872s">Ozturk</a>  and Tufts had followed the governing regulations for students on visas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4681.535s">The</a>  university then received a notice dated March 25, 2025, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4685.823s">and</a>  received via email on March 26, 2025, at 10.31 a.m., stating that Rameza's visa was canceled because she was a non-immigrant status violator, citing 237A1CI of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and or that the United States believes that her presence in the country would result in, quote, potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4710.462s">With</a>  her consent, the university can confirm that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4712.703s">Ozturk</a>  is a third-year doctoral student in good academic and administrative standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4716.724s">Her</a>  research focuses on how young adults can use social media in positive, pro-social ways, and she is described by her faculty as a hard-working student dedicated to her studies, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4726.848s">and</a>  the Tufts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4728.29s">The</a>  university has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4734.595s">The</a>  university has seen an outpouring of support from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4736.997s">Ozturk</a>  over the last week from Tufts students, faculty, and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4740.82s">These</a>  individuals have described Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4742.081s">Ozturk</a>  as a valued member of the community, dedicated to her academic pursuits, and committed to her colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4748.346s">Five,</a>  the university can confirm that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4750.047s">Ozturk</a>  was one of several authors of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, the Tufts Daily, published on March 26, 2024, entitled, Try Again, President Kumar, Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate Resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4764.193s">The</a>  university declares that this opinion piece was not in violation of any Tufts policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4769.095s">Further,</a>  no complaints were filed with the university or to our knowledge outside of the university about this op-ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4775.157s">The</a>  university maintains that the op-ed was consistent with speech permitted by the Declaration on Freedom of Expression adopted by our trustees on November 7, 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4784.504s">For</a>  the record, a search on the Tufts Daily will reveal op-eds on multiple sides of the issue with opinions that were shared just as strongly as the op-ed Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4791.209s">Oster</a>  co-authored. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4792.63s">The</a>  university has no further information suggesting that she has acted in a manner that would constitute a violation of the university's understanding of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4802.116s">Six,</a>  our international students, faculty, and staff are vital to deliver on the education, teaching, research, and public service mission of Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4809.88s">University</a>  sponsors 1,818 continuing international students on F-1 visas alongside 569 alumni who are pursuing post-completion work authorization in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4822.585s">24</a>  degree and non-degree students on J-1 visas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4825.247s">This</a>  is in addition to the broader community of students, faculty, and staff that hold various immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4831.474s">Seven,</a>  the free movement of our international community members is therefore essential to the functioning of the university and serving our mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4837.783s">The</a>  university has heard from students, faculty and staff who are foregoing opportunities to speak at international conferences and avoiding or postponing international travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4846.576s">In</a>  the worst cases, many report being fearful of leaving their homes, even to attend and teach classes on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4852.745s">The</a>  university declares that many of these students will go on to make significant economic and intellectual contributions to the United States and in countries around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4860.736s">They</a>  will do so, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4861.998s">by</a>  working in or building new companies through teaching and research and universities and other academic and healthcare institutions and through public service in the United States and across the globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4870.683s">The</a>  university is confident in its exploration because thousands of Tufts University alumni have received their education while on F-1 visas and have gone on to make a positive impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4879.267s">to</a>  the economic prosperity and intellectual success of the United States and in other countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4884.412s">The</a>  undersigned submits this declaration on behalf of Tufts University in support of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4887.956s">Azterk</a>  and asks that she receive the due process rights to which she is entitled. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4892.46s">Based</a>  on everything we know and have shared here, the university seeks relief so that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4895.583s">Azterk</a>  is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.075s">And</a>  then it is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4903.895s">On</a>  behalf of the university, I understand declares under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct executed on April 1 2025 at Tufts University Sunil Kumar president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4915.979s">I,</a>  I'm sorry that was so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4919.54s">I</a>  just felt that it was important to articulate everything that was shared with me from Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4926.302s">The</a>  important thing I think is that Tufts did give like a very, very thorough response. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4933.747s">And</a>  I just feel very strongly that we declare that the Constitution was not followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4947.797s">We</a>  still, Ramesa is still in Louisiana, and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4953.821s">And</a>  that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4955.102s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4957.4s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4962.165s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4963.106s">I</a>  want to thank yourself and Councilor Lazzaro for putting this together for this meeting's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4968.151s">I</a>  just think this is a moment in which it's really, really important for city leaders and leaders at all levels to be vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4974.557s">We're</a>  in a really scary era where the federal government is using all sorts of strategies <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4980.183s">to</a>  try and actively make people more scared, more vulnerable, more unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4987.106s">The</a>  goal of detentions like Ramesa's is to intimidate activists into hiding, to intimidate organizers into silence, to make non-citizens feel endangered, to make everyone afraid to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=4999.35s">And</a>  I would hate to see the city of Medford perpetuate that because it's not going to help us withstand this very insidious culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5007.955s">So</a>  I'm very grateful to your leadership and putting this language forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5011.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5012.898s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Cohns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5013.979s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5017.141s">I'd</a>  like to thank you as well for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5022.353s">Scary</a>  and disgraceful that we're having federal authorities pick up students from the street, plainclothes officers, deporting them out of state so that they don't have access to legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5043.001s">And</a>  in many other cases, even just putting them out of the country and ignoring court orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5051.337s">just</a>  because they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5054.298s">Elections</a>  have consequences, and this is what we're seeing because of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5058.9s">I</a>  mean, in other parts of the country, it's not... Ramesa Ozturk was a case that received a lot of publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5068.363s">I</a>  worked for five years as a postdoc at Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5072.324s">I</a>  attempted <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5076.047s">Keyword</a>  attempted, didn't succeed to unionize over there, but ended up creating some groups that had a lot of postdocs on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5085.769s">And</a>  a lot of them are international. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5088.35s">And</a>  so they're coming up with a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5089.53s">And</a>  so they're sharing reports of people they know, their friends just being randomly abducted, detained in places like Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5100.81s">Maldon.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5102.071s">Last</a>  night, the Democratic City Committee met and decided to put some of the committee's own funding into purchasing 8,000 red cards, which are cards that you can give out to immigrants who may be at risk of being detained in order for them to understand their legal rights and understand how they <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5130.553s">can</a>  interact when federal authorities try to illegally detain them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5137.221s">In</a>  many cases, there have also been reports of just US citizens being detained because they're brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5143.068s">And</a>  then ICE will only figure that out later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5147.31s">when</a>  they go through their wallet and figure out that they were just randomly abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5153.796s">And</a>  what's going on here is that ICE is basically just taking in anybody that they can, trying to figure out if there was ever any lapse in Visa or anything that they might have done technically wrong on a piece of paper, and then using that as an excuse to deport them all while ignoring court orders <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5173.516s">to</a>  the contrary, and then publicizing the few cases where they actually do manage to deport a violent criminal, and then using those few cases as justification for this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5187.584s">So,</a>  it is important, I agree for city leaders to speak up vocally because intimidation is a big part of this intimidation is the name of the game here that is a huge reason why this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5206.501s">Independence</a>  at different levels of government can help to stop this, but understand that being vocal and vocally saying this isn't right is the best tool that we have to stop an authoritarian regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5223.455s">So</a>  again, I would just like to thank my colleague for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5232.21s">and</a>  I look forward to voting in favor of it and hearing whatever public comment we have.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5239.474s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5240.654s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5241.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5242.275s">I'll</a>  be brief because I think councilors have been very thorough with their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5247.278s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Councilor Lazzaro for introducing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5251.22s">I</a>  know a lot of residents have been clamoring for us to say something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5257.097s">and</a>  the timing of the regular meetings didn't allow us to make a statement earlier, but this is, it's helpful that we're doing it at the earliest possible opportunity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5270.332s">All</a>  I'll say is that this is a fearful time, and the freedom that we have to free speech and to our due process rights, which means not being deprived of our life, liberty, or property without a due process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5289.162s">These</a>  rights are sacred to who we are as Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5292.724s">They're</a>  sacred to democracy, and they form the bedrock of a strong society. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5300.115s">And</a>  I think this really exemplifies what I've been saying for a very long time, which is that oftentimes the national can be local. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5308.843s">And</a>  as the federal government seeks to interfere in people's everyday lives, seeks to interfere and retaliate against individuals for publishing their thoughts in an op-ed, be it something you agree with or disagree with, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5324.89s">As</a>  the federal government tries to commandeer state and local governments into following its policies when federalism exists, and when we have powers delegated to us, to the voters, to hold local and state officials accountable for, this all matters to the rule of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5345.383s">It</a>  all matters to who we are as Americans and our identity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5351.757s">I</a>  think passing a resolution like this tonight, you know, I wish we could do more, but this solidifies our intent as a city council to stand by our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5361.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5363.481s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sagan.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5365.642s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5370.623s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll go to members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5372.904s">I</a>  have two hands on Zoom or one hand just went down and we have someone in the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5381.283s">We'll</a>  go to the podium first. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5386.346s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5387.307s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5389.668s">Hello</a>  again, Nick Traleo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5393.051s">Um</a>  I'd like to first just reiterate what I said in the earlier discussion about, you know, taking this resolution over resolution of the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5402.477s">Again,</a>  concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5405.107s">But</a>  in terms of what happened to miss us Turk, I just like to offer a legal perspective given the lawyer and this is what I do for a living is think about legal problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5414.439s">I</a>  think the issue is very narrow, to be honest with you, you know, because I think the legal questions really does a visa recipient. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5421.287s">have</a>  that same right to freedom of speech as a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5424.969s">And</a>  I'm not here to answer that question I mean it would require a great deal of research to try to understand what the law says on that subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5432.732s">Ultimately,</a>  I think it's a question that judges have to decide and that's what's happening right it's being litigated in the federal court. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5440.354s">So</a>  I think when we use inflammatory language, really on either side, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5445.177s">Screaming</a>  about deportation or screaming about political imprisonment, it really doesn't help address this problem, which is to try to resolve a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5455.005s">Another</a>  thing I'd like to just point out is I think this is a little bit beyond the scope of what the city council is tasked with doing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5462.75s">We're</a>  talking about federal immigration law here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5464.992s">I</a>  think every one of you would admit you don't have any jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5467.714s">to</a>  handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5468.956s">Um</a>  so, you know, ultimately, if you're not happy with what happened with miss Oster, you do have a right to be upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5474.822s">You</a>  do have a right to petition your elected representatives in Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5478.966s">Um</a>  but you know, let's try to respect what authority this city council has to actually do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5484.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5494.362s">Just</a>  a quick correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5496.164s">The</a>  Constitution protects freedom of speech for everybody in America, regardless of immigration status.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5506.752s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5507.052s">We'll</a>  go to Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5511.315s">You'll</a>  have three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5512.716s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5514.695s">Yes,</a>  I'm Matthew Page-Liverman, 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5519.78s">First,</a>  I very much appreciate Councilor Lazzaroff for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5523.303s">I</a>  also appreciate Councilor Collins' editorial in Commonwealth Beacon, which I've not heard praised yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5532.352s">It's</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5532.972s">I</a>  hope everybody should read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5534.474s">There</a>  are four items I want to hit on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5535.955s">One</a>  is that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5538.7s">And</a>  I think we should really address this and absolutely kind of embarrassing misunderstanding about the role of the courts and interpretations at this moment in history. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5549.509s">It's</a>  extremely outdated and kind of really dense misunderstanding about the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5556.634s">You</a>  know, the first amendment about the right to freedom of speech is regarding what Congress may do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5564.1s">that</a>  Congress may not bridge this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5565.501s">Now</a>  that has been gone to be interpreted that the government, the federal government and the state governments may not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5571.405s">What</a>  we're dealing with right now is we know that the executive branch is carrying out things that even people in the legislature, including Republicans are saying, he's taken away, he's ignoring the whole first article of the constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5585.995s">That's</a>  what we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5587.096s">And</a>  we're dealing with <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5589.438s">courts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5590.559s">We're</a>  saying, well, the courts will reside. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5592.601s">Well,</a>  first off, the executive branch is saying we will ignore the courts and they're trying to discredit the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5599.807s">And</a>  we have a Supreme Court that just the other day or today said that they will temporarily permit Trump to do the Alien Enemies Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5609.107s">That's</a>  the situation we're dealing with in this kind of, well, we'll let the courts decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5613.049s">The</a>  courts are quite possibly not going to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5616.471s">And</a>  if they do, they can very quite possibly be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5619.672s">Okay,</a>  so it's not a question of what will the courts decide? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5622.854s">Let</a>  me tell you about the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5624.855s">Okay,</a>  a second component I really want to bring up is that Honan, or you know, the whatever czar, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5632.179s">you</a>  know, he actually changed his mind as much as he threatens Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5638.104s">He</a>  changed his mind just the other day in that, you know, ICE went to, they said there are people doing child sex trafficking, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5646.492s">And</a>  they have to go get some, well, they also round up three people, there are three children, and they transfer them to Texas, they're undocumented, but they figure we'll round them up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5655.34s">Well,</a>  people protested outside Honan's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5658.743s">And</a>  then he changed his mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5660.464s">And</a>  those people are being those three children being flown back from Texas to I forget the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5665.586s">But</a>  that's what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5666.826s">That's</a>  what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5667.807s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5670.128s">Okay,</a>  that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5671.588s">At</a>  a moment like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5673.609s">At</a>  a moment like this, there was only one answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5675.95s">And</a>  that's when the people rise up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5678.591s">And</a>  don't just say this is not acceptable, but make it a living hell for the new authoritarians. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5684.013s">And</a>  then the third thing is about the canary mission, that there are people that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5689.583s">like</a>  a Stasi government, they destroyed, they decided to retaliate against somebody for an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5696.367s">And</a>  they are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5698.148s">They</a>  are tattling on people in the community, trying to get them deported. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5701.45s">And</a>  those are the people that we should be saying are not welcome in our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5705.013s">Those</a>  people that are ratting up people in the federal government, trying to get them expelled, the people in the Canary Mission, and those people- MJ, your time's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5714.178s">Well,</a>  those are the people we should also name.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5718.341s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5723.73s">Go</a>  to the podium, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5725.792s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5727.653s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5727.913s">My</a>  name is Micah Shalom Hesselman, and I live at 499 Main Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5734.918s">Thank</a>  you, councillors, and councillors of our own in particular, because I've had a lot of back and forth, too, for bringing forth this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5742.424s">And</a>  to the people who are, whatever, I have a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5746.827s">But</a>  this is an important resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5749.969s">We</a>  are a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5752.202s">Rumeysa,</a>  she did not live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5757.743s">However,</a>  that's at our doorstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5759.823s">We've</a>  been railing against this since Mahmoud Khalil was illegally abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5764.664s">And</a>  we have people that are literally being blocked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5767.945s">To</a>  the previous speaker's point, most of this is due to basically lists given to these people by Canary Mission and Beitar and these doxing groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5780.707s">Now,</a>  I am also a lawyer, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5784.09s">So</a>  I also have some legal opinions on what is going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5788.413s">This</a>  is unlawful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5789.474s">If</a>  you could just address the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5791.055s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5792.896s">This</a>  is clearly unlawful behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5796.339s">Before</a>  even getting to the freedom of speech and the basic freedoms, you cannot arrest people without having cause, without giving them cause and showing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5807.076s">You</a>  cannot have masked individuals show up and black bag someone and then post hoc justify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5814.384s">That</a>  is not how a lawful society can be run. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5817.787s">That's</a>  how you get people shooting each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5820.33s">So</a>  yeah, it's a big deal, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5823.834s">Arguably</a>  more important than the charter issue, which is also very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5827.258s">But</a>  this is an important issue too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5830.603s">Further,</a>  this is important to me as a resident of Medford, because all of this is being done under this veneer of fighting back against anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5840.271s">I</a>  am a Jew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5841.692s">I</a>  am a Semite. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5843.554s">This</a>  is using actually laws that were expressly anti-Semitic in form, purpose, and function to deport people for expressing opinions about a foreign government and their conduct <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5860.073s">against</a>  people in that region. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5863.074s">It</a>  has nothing to do with anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5865.314s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5867.675s">And</a>  we should be pushing back on this as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5871.875s">Last</a>  thing I want to say is that I understand that no one's sure what they can do right now when it comes to these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5879.197s">And</a>  to Councilor Tseng's point, yes, this is a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5883.838s">We</a>  are doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5884.898s">It's</a>  small, but at least it's something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5886.678s">I</a>  urge the committee or the council <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5890.296s">to</a>  look at ways you can set up a committee or working group to proactively guard Medford, our community, against federal overreach and increasing lawlessness, which is only going to continue to get worse as things go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5907.759s">There</a>  is no indication that they're going to be any better about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5911.56s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5913.36s">Something</a>  needs to happen, something real. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5915.801s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5916.101s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5916.761s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5917.161s">Thank</a>

    <p>[Michael Prentke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6100.765s">Hi</a>  everybody, my name is Michael Prentke. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6102.646s">I</a>  live at 340 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6106.588s">I</a>  don't have a lot extra to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6108.769s">I</a>  just want to kind of amplify what my friend Micah had to say earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6112.411s">I</a>  appreciate his sentiments and I appreciate Councilman Lazzaro's introduction of the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6121.075s">I</a>  too am Jewish and want to sort of further this <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6127.275s">dialogue</a>  that these actions by ICE is not making Jews safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6133.539s">I</a>  want to be very clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6136.341s">I,</a>  as a Jew, do not feel any safer with this, these deportations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6141.344s">In</a>  fact, I would say it's actually offensive that they're saying this is in the name of anti-Semitism, that we're deporting these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6147.748s">That</a>  actually makes me feel less safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6151.731s">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6154.113s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6157.198s">No</a>  one else on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6160.139s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6165.461s">Jennifer</a>  Yanko, 16 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6168.583s">I</a>  want to thank the council for putting forth this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6174.947s">It's</a>  true that it's just a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6178.468s">But</a>  I think that we might underestimate the power of speaking up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6183.31s">And</a>  I feel really proud and safer to be in a community that's willing to say no, not on our watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6192.253s">Because</a>  this is not happening only in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6195.034s">And</a>  let's face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6196.855s">where</a>  Rumesa was picked up is right across the border. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6200.198s">It</a>  may as well be in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6201.88s">But</a>  this is happening all over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6204.022s">I</a>  grew up in Western Washington State, and people are being rounded up there in large numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6212.769s">And</a>  so I think it's really important that we do speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6215.231s">And</a>  I just want to thank you and say, yes, it's so important to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6221.157s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6303.878s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6304.378s">Go</a>  back to the podium, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6308.661s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ezekiel Silverstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6311.442s">Ezekiel</a>  Silverstein, 71 Kenmia Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6317.507s">I</a>  understand the councilors bringing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6322.071s">Rumeysa</a>  was, even though apparently not a resident of Medford, was part of the Medford community, and it is your purview to try and defend your constituents or members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6335.312s">And</a>  even if it comes out that all she did was write an op-ed that I personally disagree with wholeheartedly, I think it's offensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6344.322s">But</a>  freedom of speech is incredibly important, and due process needs to be obeyed and abided by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6352.151s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6355.843s">she</a>  should be afforded all those rights of due process and her moment in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6362.709s">But</a>  someone else brought up others like Mahmoud Khadil or others like Mahmoud Uttal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6369.635s">There</a>  are other people who are being <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6372.578s">apprehended</a>  and in court for deportation, who have provided material support for terrorist organizations, who have offended the rights of other students on other campuses, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6390.851s">And</a>  if someone here is taking action that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6396.833s">offends</a>  the rights, the civil rights of citizens, then their visas can and, in my opinion, should be revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6403.798s">But</a>  Ramesa Ozturk, from my understanding, has only committed speech, and that is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6413.065s">So</a>  if it does come out that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6417.538s">She</a>  has provided other support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6421.62s">We</a>  wouldn't want people who support ISIS coming into this country on a visa. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6426.401s">If</a>  people who support Hamas come in, then that's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6431.753s">But</a>  as it stands, her freedom of speech has been bridged, and I think that due process needs to be abided by. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6440.195s">I</a>  hate the as a Jew statement, but I do feel safer when people who support terrorist organizations that call for the genocide of Jews are removed from this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6453.939s">She</a>  has freedom of speech, but it's limited as a non-citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6459.081s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6459.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6464.06s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6467.488s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6468.65s">I'll</a>  just be brief as a co sponsor, but also as the chair I didn't want to say anything until everyone had had their say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6475.437s">One</a>  thing I think that's important to note is when what councilors are read on the previous or earlier on this item, Tufts made it very clear that I slide about when the visa was revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6488.588s">So</a>  it's another post-hoc attempt to justify this abhorrent act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6495.013s">The</a>  Supreme Court ruled yesterday, yes, that some of these folks are gonna have to refile in different courts of jurisdiction, but they were very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6503.303s">I</a>  believe it was 9 to 0, that there is no justification for this venue shopping and trying to move people from Boston to Louisiana before their lawyers have the ability to file a habeas petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6518.992s">The</a>  government's blatantly violating basic due process rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6521.713s">Never</a>  mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6522.194s">That's</a>  before we get to the question of First Amendment rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6526.876s">Just</a>  to say, oh, we're going to get you out of the country faster than your lawyer can file a habeas petition <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6531.879s">one</a>  of the most egregious violations of due process that I think we've seen since the internment of Japanese people in the 1940s during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6542.906s">And</a>  again, to note that the Alien Enemies Act was what Franklin Roosevelt used to justify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6549.711s">It's</a>  a 1798 law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6551.191s">I</a>  think our values have changed a little bit since 1798, maybe at least only for some of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6558.536s">And</a>  just on the point of acting locally, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6562.67s">I</a>  can't really think of a greater danger to our residents and masked agents of the state abducting people off the street and beyond a resolution I would like to see the city seriously consider not just this item like the know your rights information but. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6580.865s">Joining</a>  up with Community members and potentially using city employees to warn residents when ice is present in the Community, I think it's essential that residents are informed that there are dangerous people here who might try to take them for no reason against their basic human rights, and I say that to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6603.279s">When</a>  we passed the welcoming city ordinance a couple months ago, there was a. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6610.292s">you</a>  know, some statements and questions went around, well, it's not going to happen to US citizens, or it's not going to happen to naturalized citizens, or it's not going to happen to green card holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6619.958s">Well,</a>  it's not just, there's not just, you know, I think it's this mythical idea that there's this group of violent immigrants who have no documentation, and that's who is going to be attacked, and no one else is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6632.807s">Well,</a>  it's visa holders who've done nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6635.588s">It's</a>  green card holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6638.438s">And</a>  we've heard stories from the border of Canadian citizens, of naturalized U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6645.761s">citizens,</a>  of natural born, native born U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6648.242s">citizens</a>  being detained by ICE because they refuse to turn over their phone so that ICE can search whether they've put out statements against the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6658.946s">So</a>  it's everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6660.587s">It's</a>  moving up the scale every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6663.352s">Um,</a>  and that's why we passed that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6665.773s">We</a>  said, we're not going to cooperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6666.994s">And</a>  now I think it's up to us to convene, uh, and to push the mayor to take action, to actively warn residents that there are dangerous agents of this Trump regime who are coming to this community who, um, may well pose them grave danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6684.924s">I</a>  think that's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6686.264s">That's</a>  what local government should do. <a

are around, especially because, as was noted, we don't have the ability to tell them not to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6698.225s">You</a>  know, when dangerous people, when danger happens, local government, you know, stands up and says, we're going to try to stop this danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6707.353s">And</a>  the sad part of what's happening right now is we can't tell the federal government not to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6711.816s">All</a>  we can do is say they're here, please stay away. <a

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6775.043s">Thank</a>  you, yes, we have offered support including the prior ordinance on the transgender rights and reproductive healthcare inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6784.67s">But</a>  if someone would wanna make an amendment to add that to the resolution, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6792.617s">I'd</a>  be happy to add that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6796.9s">Should</a>  we do it as a B paper since the main paper is about Ramesa? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6802.402s">Is</a>  there a preference on this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6803.765s">Do</a>  you have a preference, Councilor Lazzaro?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6809.977s">A</a>  B paper would be my preference.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6813.345s">And</a>  I also want to, to that point, draw attention to the work that we're doing in our resident services, resident services committee on a human rights commission ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6827.17s">So</a>  essentially we are reforming that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6831.272s">So</a>  the HRC has a lot more power to advise city governments about <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6839.636s">how</a>  to protect our residents, how to inform residents of their rights on DEI measures as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6845.557s">So</a>  defending diversity, equity, and inclusion, and having more voices there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6851.059s">And</a>  I hope that residents will support that measure as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6857.4s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6858.38s">We</a>  do have one hand raised again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6863.522s">Matthew</a>  Page-Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=6865.222s">Matthew,</a>  I can go to you for one more minute since you've already spoken once.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7170.626s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7172.609s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7175.158s">I</a>  think it's always good for a government to inform their residents of their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7182.624s">We</a>  have these rights for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7184.706s">We</a>  have these rights to protect our freedoms and to protect our way of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7190.591s">And,</a>  you know, I've heard a lot recently, I acknowledged this earlier, but I've heard a lot recently from residents about what we can do as politicians, as elected officials to protect our residents, to help our residents, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7205.33s">And</a>  we talked about how some measures might be symbolic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7210.454s">It's</a>  important to do those, because if you can't do the symbolic, you can't do the substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7214.936s">But</a>  likewise, we have to be creative, and we have to be smart in trying to figure out the little ways that we can help affect this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7228.425s">Because</a>  sometimes, even the little ways can have great effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7233.514s">And</a>  for our residents to know their rights is one of those really great effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7240.617s">This</a>  is, you know, I spoke about how this is a fearful moment earlier as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7246.199s">And,</a>  you know, I want to underscore that from my perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7250.7s">I'm</a>  the son of immigrants, my parents are green card holders, and even my presence on this council today makes me fearful for their own safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7262.075s">you</a>  know, not to say anything about the cases of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7265.477s">citizens</a>  that have been, you know, put at danger because of this administration's actions, but, you know, the lived reality of being afraid going out, being afraid for my parents, you know, to see their, to go travel abroad to see their family, their really old family, you know, for them to, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7288.585s">For</a>  people like my parents and so many residents in Medford to be afraid to go out to the grocery store, to go out to run their errands, for so many Medford students to be afraid to go to school, I think it's a real problem that we face in the city that we have to learn how to address, be it through the government doing something or be it through mutual aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7315.965s">I</a>  think knowing your rights is the first basic and maybe one of the most important steps you can know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7324.732s">I</a>  feel privileged in that I've studied this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7332.808s">I've</a>  gotten this knowledge before, but I also know that when I was walking through these rights with my parents, even just last week or two weeks ago, I guess, they didn't know half of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7343.616s">And</a>  I think it's really important for us to get this information out there ASAP, for us to translate this information into other languages as well, and for us to be creative in how we get this message across. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7357.147s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Eileen Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7484.444s">My</a>  name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7490.866s">And</a>  this was a political act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7494.981s">by</a>  the present administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7497.963s">All</a>  this disappearing of people is definitely political. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7501.866s">It</a>  happened because they took a stance that was in opposition to the president and his crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7509.991s">And</a>  so to criticize the council for being political <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7516.415s">when</a>  we've had a political act that's so destructive going on in our communities all over the country doesn't make any sense to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7525.442s">And</a>  also, I just wanted to say about the Alien Enemies Act that that was an act that followed the Dred Scott decision, which said that any self-emancipated slave had no rights and could be returned to their masters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7543.896s">The</a>  Alien Enemies Act <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7546.743s">went</a>  further and targeted any people who aided emancipated slaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7553.848s">So</a>  it was a furtherance of depriving people of their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7559.471s">Now</a>  we have a situation where international students and other workers are being targeted and disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7567.603s">and</a>  do not think they will not come after other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7570.925s">They</a>  already are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7572.626s">It</a>  will continue unless people stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7576.088s">I</a>  really wanna thank Councilor Lazzaro and all the councilors that have voted, that have indicated sympathy with people who are being disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7587.515s">As</a>  a Jew, I echo the statement of other Jews here that to use us to justify <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7596.892s">What's</a>  going on is absolutely horrendous and appalling and standing up right now, as you all are doing, as we all are doing, is so very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7612.326s">We</a>  cannot remain silent or the situation that's going on is gonna escalate and who knows who will be next. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7621.854s">So</a>  thank you for letting me speak.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7625.405s">Thank</a>  you, Eileen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7626.726s">We'll</a>  go to the podium name and address for the record please you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Ellen Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7632.068s">Ellen</a>  Epstein 15 growth street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7636.07s">I</a>  want to say that as a representative of safe Medford we're totally behind this initiative of distributing know your rights cards, it's kind of a no brainer and we're happy to help with this in any way we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7651.376s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7653.797s">Personally,</a>  I'm just going to say it's not only appropriate, but it's imperative that you guys as city Councilors as our government representatives speak out about what is happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7668.965s">And</a>  I thank you and I appreciate you, and I am in full support. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7675.188s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7677.189s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7678.888s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Jess Healy on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7681.35s">Jess,</a>  name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7686.353s">Jessica</a>  Healy, Four Lock Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7689.695s">I</a>  just want to know, can we get any citations for every, you know, different information that has been stated here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7699.981s">I</a>  know one of the Councilors stated that people are getting, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7707.71s">detained</a>  just for being brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7710.051s">Is</a>  there any like where I haven't seen this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7713.553s">So</a>  I just want to know if anyone can release the information where they're getting it from. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7720.817s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7724.899s">Also,</a>  with having a task force to let people know ICE is either in Medford or around Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7736.187s">Um,</a>  I just want to know, is this for like residents that you're warning or is it for people that came to this country illegally? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7746.41s">Because</a>  coming illegally is breaking the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7749.731s">I'm</a>  just not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7750.731s">Are</a>  you saying you want to warn residents that are here legally or people that came into this country not legally? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7760.413s">That's</a>  what I'd like clarification on.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7766.898s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7767.358s">I</a>  can, if you want to use the rest of your time, I can answer questions at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7772.119s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7773.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7774.88s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7775.14s">So</a>  that was basically what I'm looking for is just the citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7779.901s">Cause</a>  we don't want any misinformation getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7782.262s">So</a>  just citations of where the Councilors have found this information would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7786.883s">And</a>  also with notifying people, you know, that have, there's a lot of people waiting to come to the country legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7794.085s">So</a>  I just want to know, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7795.454s">who</a>  you are looking to warn.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7800.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7801.539s">In</a>  terms of what Councilors or members of the public have said for Councilors, you can certainly email Councilors if you have a specific citation for a specific piece of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7813.409s">You</a>  know, for the information I cited, I believe I read a New York Times article I could look for and provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7820.49s">And</a>  when I mentioned a task force or a warning about the presence of ICE, I was talking about all Medford residents, regardless of their documentation status, because as we've seen, the administration is politicizing documentation status at this point.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7839.116s">But</a>  it is against the federal law to be here illegally, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7844.077s">If</a>  that's not a political thing, I mean, it's the law.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7847.32s">I'm</a>  not going to get into a back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7849.062s">There</a>  are civil violations, but there are also people who are here legally and are now having their legal status revoked for political reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7855.867s">So</a>  it's unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7858.49s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7859.01s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7861.272s">Go</a>  back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7862.073s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7863.033s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Micah Kesselman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7863.994s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7864.294s">Hi,</a>  my name is Michael Tesselman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7865.575s">I'm</a>  at 499 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7866.776s">So</a>  there's a lot to unpack here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7868.918s">One,</a>  for the disproportionate targeting of brown people, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7874.195s">Reports</a>  are coming out from all over the country about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7876.156s">I</a>  mean, my recommendation is just search Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7880.317s">It's</a>  ubiquitous. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7883.958s">Off</a>  the top of my head, Chicago, guy got literally pulled over by ICE, wasn't actually an, quote unquote, illegal immigrant, but he was Mexican looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7896.981s">So</a>  that was enough to temporarily detain him, which again, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7902.376s">very</a>  much an unlawful detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7906.278s">So</a>  the idea that, oh, we don't know that brown people are being disproportionately targeted, you have to have your head so far in the sand that you're on the season finale of Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7919.444s">This</a>  is wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7921.085s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7922.752s">It</a>  is a civil violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7925.634s">It</a>  is not like a felony. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7929.037s">You</a>  commit a civil crime when you jaywalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7931.899s">And</a>  I know you jaywalk because you live in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7935.282s">So</a>  it is insane to say that someone should have their life upended because they've committed a civil infraction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7945.17s">That's</a>  bonkers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7948.392s">Finally,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7954.092s">Yes,</a>  like distribute, oh, and then as far as the inflammatory language goes, our current body politic is a flame. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7965.216s">You</a>  cannot do anything political without it being in some way inflammatory right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7971.639s">If</a>  it is inflammatory to say that we respect the basic rights and dignities of human beings, regardless of where they happen to be from, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7980.687s">then</a>  I don't know, man, like catch on fire with me because that's bonkers that you're against that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7986.21s">So</a>  like, just some of the pushback on this is just absolutely crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7992.673s">And</a>  at the end of the day, I want to remind people whether or not they have documentation, whether or not they've overstayed a visa, by the way, that is the largest source of illegal immigration is visa overstays and now people crossing the border, whether or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8010.235s">any</a>  of this other nonsense that people are trying to use to justify a slow goose step into authoritarianism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8017.459s">These</a>  are your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8019.26s">These</a>  are the people who live next door to you that we are trying to protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8023.122s">They</a>  are the people that you go grocery shopping with and let your kids hang out with because you like them and you talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8030.706s">This</a>  is your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8033.711s">Like</a>  this, this like wild attempt to other people at the behest of authoritarianism is distressing, disgusting, and just wildly depressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8047.274s">And</a>  both for like what it means about our society, but also what it means about the people doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8052.976s">Like,</a>  it just makes me sad for everyone involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8056.276s">That's</a>  my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8056.836s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8061.838s">So</a>  just with the with the citations question, I would repeat, you could Google it, I would advise that you go to a somewhat reputable news source for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8072.023s">I</a>  personally released a blog, mattLeming.com slash blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8078.686s">And</a>  if you there's my most recent post was called resisting ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8083.108s">And</a>  I understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8085.131s">I</a>  would like to thank all five people who actually read my blog, but I take pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8090.176s">And</a>  I take pride in how many URLs I link to throughout the text there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8097.223s">And</a>  so there is plenty of cases that relate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8103.449s">There</a>  are plenty of articles linked there that relate to detaining Brown people, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8109.547s">women</a>  describing detention centers as hell on earth, people dying, particularly the detention center in Miami. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8115.972s">So</a>  it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8117.674s">I</a>  mean, if you're only news sources like Fox News, then you're not gonna see it, but just kind of go outside of that a little bit and you'll get a lot more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8126.941s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8128.783s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8129.163s">I</a>  heard Fox said the markets are up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8131.045s">So</a>  I'm gonna go to Gene Zahner on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8140.291s">Hello</a>  and I just want to thank City Council for focusing on getting the knowledge out to community members about their rights and everything you've been doing on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8152.821s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8155.063s">I</a>  wanted to let you know that Medford People Power has reached out to the city and asked the city to <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8163.099s">put</a>  out information about knowing your rights and also the welcoming city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8167.921s">So</a>  in the interest of just collaborating, communicating about this one to let you know that we met with their comms team and they said they'd get back to us next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8177.206s">So</a>  thank you so much for all you do.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8190.483s">Yes,</a>  Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8194.406s">I</a>  just really appreciate everybody from the council as well as the community that are speaking up about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8199.029s">I</a>  think in regards to brown people, this question, it is not an artful term. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8204.212s">A</a>  lot of people have no clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8205.693s">You</a>  ask different people on the street, what is a brown person? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8207.974s">You'll</a>  get different answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8209.335s">Many</a>  people find out when they filled out the most recent census, they identify as a person of color, they're brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8214.939s">The</a>  government says, no, we consider you white. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8217.16s">People</a>  are Middle East, Northern Africa, are they brown? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8219.702s">Depends.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8221.748s">And</a>  so this question of, are they really going after Brown? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8225.17s">And</a>  if somebody wants to argue this point, I think it's kind of missing the forest for the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8232.734s">We</a>  used to have a principal from the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8234.635s">Supreme</a>  Court in 1960, I don't know if it was Warren or I forget the one with the university. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8240.037s">that</a>  we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8240.658s">But</a>  the principle was, it's better to release the guilty person than to imprison an innocent person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8245.923s">Today,</a>  the Trump administration is doing the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8248.905s">They're</a>  like, let's cast a wide net. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8250.707s">We</a>  get some innocent people, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8252.088s">And</a>  we already know about somebody who was shipped off to the prison in El Salvador that they know is innocent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8257.313s">And</a>  they're saying, we can't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8258.774s">Innocent</a>  persons, they say, we don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8260.896s">As</a>  far as Brown, again, after 9-11, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8264.392s">You</a>  know, people just if you're a person of color, you're possibly an Arab, you're possibly and if you're if you're possibly an Arab, you're possibly a terrorist, therefore will round you up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8273.261s">I</a>  know when I was living in Brazil that there were Brazilians that were stopped at the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8279.34s">that</a>  had to be interrogated just because they thought they could be a terrorist because they kind of look maybe Middle Eastern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8285.642s">And</a>  I think that trying to figure out where this line is, are they really going after people of color is completely missing the forest for the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8293.165s">Your</a>  federal administration, your government is saying we'd rather lock up innocent people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8298.967s">That's</a>  the main issue, as well as the racialized dynamics that are on top of that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8309.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8311.116s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8315.861s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8317.903s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8319.925s">Yeah,</a>  I think the most frightening thing to me is that it is very clear that people are being snatched off the street with absolutely no due process at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8334.295s">So</a>  this question of someone who it has now come out is really innocent of anything, even being in this country illegally, who has been deported not to his home country, but to a prison in El Salvador that is renowned around the world for torture. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8352.068s">And</a>  this person is not being recalled, even though it has now been made clear that they were not who the government thought that they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8360.897s">Seeing</a>  Rumesa snatched off the street in that video was genuinely, should be frightening for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8373.546s">And</a>  I think we should remember the famous poem from Nazi Germany that says, first they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8383.432s">Then</a>  they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8387.894s">Then</a>  they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8391.896s">And</a>  then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8396.858s">So</a>  anyone who feels safe should really just pause and think about what it means for people to be snatched off the street by people who do not have a warrant and are not declaring who they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8413.196s">with</a>  absolutely no due process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8415.699s">I</a>  think that that does not end well for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8419.304s">Anyone</a>  here could be mistaken for someone else and shipped off to a gulag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8428.115s">So</a>  I am very happy <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8431.125s">to</a>  be on a city council that is doing everything that we can in this moment to try to protect our residents who are being targeted for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8442.833s">But</a>  really, that ends with anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8446.556s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8475.085s">Yes,</a>  I'm confirming the negative motion passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-468.pdf"><font color="green">24-468</font></a> draft charter as returned to Council by Mayor, submitted by Mayor Burrito Lungo-Koehn.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8484.232s">The</a>  draft City Charter proposal as amended by the Mayor and returned to the Council on March 31st, 2025 is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8489.951s">The</a>  fall this fall the approval by the city council at the March 11 2025 regular meeting by a vote of six to zero one absent of a draft charter referred from committee of the whole following the governance committee's review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8501.358s">If</a>  approved by the council this draft city charter as amended by the council will be resubmitted to the mayor for consideration for submission to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8508.787s">Subsequently,</a>  if the mayor submits the draft city charter to the legislature and the legislature approved said draft prior to the printing and ballots for the November 4 2025 municipal election, the voters of the city of Medford will approve or deny the draft city charter <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8521.962s">on</a>  the November 4th, 2025 municipal election ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8524.843s">I'm</a>  not gonna read the whole charter, obviously, and I'm not even gonna read the 160 plus line by line changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8533.004s">The</a>  documents are available on the city council portal, but I will open it up to discussion by members of the council on the draft charter returned to the council by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8547.768s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8553.401s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8554.762s">I</a>  appreciate, again, all the work that's gone into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8559.026s">Obviously,</a>  we've gone through the charter with the fine-tooth comb and the governance committee and committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8569.215s">We</a>  sent our version to the mayor and the mayor made her edits and I have a couple of <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8579.557s">What</a>  I think are fairly small amendments I'd like to make to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8585.798s">Version</a>  of the charter, and then I would be comfortable voting in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8590.879s">Those</a>  amendments are in section 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8593.38s">3</a>  subsection a. I would like to add back in the words or ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8603.256s">where</a>  in the red line version they were removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8606.238s">That</a>  is where the city council is able to add, um, is able to appoint members to, um, multiple member committees or commissions, um, by charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8620.249s">It</a>  says right now, um, only by charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8623.911s">Uh,</a>  I, it used to say or ordinance and that applies to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8630.438s">that</a>  has active applications now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8633.88s">And</a>  this version of the charter would remove the city council's ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8640.363s">So</a>  I would like to add that back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8644.285s">That's</a>  one change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8645.346s">And</a>  second change is in section 2.1 subsection C, the second sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8653.932s">I</a>  would like it to say award Councilor shall be a voter in the word from which election is sought, period, and I would like to strike the remainder of that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8665.404s">The</a>  rest of the sentence says. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8668.286s">They</a>  have to have resided in that word for a year, but there is no mention of having to reside in any word or district or city for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8680.877s">For</a>  any other elected office anywhere else in the charter, including school committee at large, including an at large city Councilor, including the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8691.426s">Including</a>  school committee district, so I. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8696.41s">I</a>  spoke to the mayor about both of these today and she said it was fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8702.155s">So</a>  I would like to make these amendments and motion to, I don't know if that would have to be a separate motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8713.913s">to</a>  approve, but I guess those two, I would motion for those two amendments first.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8720.299s">So</a>  it would be, I think technically a motion to approve as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8724.683s">And</a>  those are the two amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8727.206s">And</a>  that's my council, Lazzaro, is there a second on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8731.43s">Second</a>  by Councilor Tseng, reminding that that motion can be further amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8735.732s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Collins and then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8740.999s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8742.5s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8744.343s">I</a>  so appreciate everybody in the last few weeks, especially speaking on behalf of listening to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8751.452s">We</a>  heard so many topics that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8755.137s">after</a>  the initial change of the 5-4, which wasn't what the residents of Medford were asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8766.046s">As</a>  other issues came about, we heard this council speak over and over again, how we should have our community involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8774.694s">We</a>  should have the community make sure that we educate, we inform, we listen to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8780.53s">And</a>  we've seen some things I know when I was away, my fellow Councilor waited till 11 o'clock to revert back to a vote and zoning that that was readjusted for what the residents of that neighborhood wanted, and they waited till 11 o'clock that was my fear about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8798.4s">and</a>  waiting longer because people find this to be probably one of the most important initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8805.481s">And</a>  we talked about some very important things tonight, not to belittle anything that was said tonight, because they're very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8813.723s">But</a>  this is initiative, and I'll say it again, that was put forth by this council, that this council ran as part of their agendas, that we look at charter review, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8828.158s">We</a>  are on the verge of making a decision and making a vote, as the mayor said, that probably needs a vote tonight unless we have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8838.243s">Because</a>  after tonight, if we wait until the last meeting of April, it'll be too late for our state delegates to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8846.388s">Our</a>  state delegates that I've talked to have understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8850.711s">They</a>  listen to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8852.231s">They</a>  know the residents want an A3 vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8855.493s">I</a>  give the mayor a lot of credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8856.754s">I'm</a>  the first person to attack the mayor when I think she's not listening to the residents, but she has. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8863.198s">She's</a>  listened to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8864.379s">She's</a>  listened to the Charter Review Committee that have worked tirelessly to go from corner to corner, neighborhood to neighborhood, home to home, to make sure everybody was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8874.745s">They've</a>  done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8878.599s">They</a>  partnered with the Collins Center, the professionals, over 80 years of experience that came back and guided us with what is the best practice for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8890.282s">We</a>  sent something off to the mayor and the mayor came back and said what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8894.944s">I</a>  will concede and understand that if the council wants the mayor to step down as the chairperson of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8903.617s">That</a>  is something she'll support. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8905.058s">But</a>  the 8-3 Ward representation is what our community is screaming for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8913.423s">And</a>  I remind my colleagues, and I won't read it again because I don't want Zach getting mad at me, their platform that was forwarded by my friends from Our Revolution that read specifically that this is what they ran on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8926.632s">This</a>  is why they supported my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8930.374s">So</a>  we hear over and over again that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8934.262s">You</a>  know, the decisions you make today will affect you in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8939.405s">Well,</a>  there are so many things that we've done in the past couple of weeks, last couple of months, that we've tried very hard to make changes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8949.51s">But</a>  in some of the biggest changes, some of the biggest concerns in this community, there is one common denominator that we've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8958.595s">No</a>  matter what side you're on, why <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8964.148s">are</a>  my local elected officials not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8970.671s">So</a>  I hope my colleagues see the olive branch that the mayor has put forth, understand that we are in a very, very tight timeline right now, and we put forth a favorable vote of 7-0 to move the charter forward so our state delegation can vote to put this on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8995.79s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

everybody who's worked so hard in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9010.554s">Genuinely,</a>  thank you so much for your hard work volunteering on behalf of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9016.369s">This</a>  has been an interesting process, and it's been characterized by hard work by many volunteers to bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9022.353s">The</a>  CSC's process was long and as expansive as it could be, given the resources they were allocated for a project of this size, scope, and importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9034.28s">The</a>  council's process, I think, has been good faith, but fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9040.127s">Back</a>  in 2024, the council requested to begin the charter review process earlier, earlier than 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9047.894s">The</a>  mayor's office did not indicate that this was something they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9052.671s">compromise</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9054.052s">Um</a>  so in the past few short months, we've tried to do as thorough and thoughtful of of a review as this project deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9062.274s">Um</a>  I don't think that that's quite a long enough time for something as important as this but we've done our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9067.936s">Uh</a>  this is after all as we're all very well aware the city's guiding foundational legal document and I have maintained that it would be inappropriate and irresponsible <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9079.223s">for</a>  the council to consider its role as a rubber stamp on this document, no matter how eager we all are to complete this project and get it to the next phase of its journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9094.193s">The</a>  past few months of public meetings on the charter have been, in my estimation, largely consumed by one issue, which is council makeup. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9103.135s">We've</a>  had a lot of conversations about council makeup, wards or districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9106.937s">And</a>  as everybody knows, I preferred the district model. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9110.159s">Four</a>  district Councilors plus three at-large was the original proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9113.841s">And</a>  then it was compromised to four district Councilors plus five at-large to allow for a bigger council, more total representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9122.967s">I</a>  was pretty dug in, but I've been thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9127.35s">And</a>  that is not the hill that I'm going to die on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9131.643s">Because</a>  in my thinking about this over the past several weeks, if that central kernel is representativeness, whether the council is 5-4 or 8-3 doesn't really get at the heart of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9145.129s">I</a>  think the most important thing that we could have done or could do for meaningful representativeness, which is a spectrum, is reevaluate our strong mayor system of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9154.734s">Because</a>  a more representative city council only goes so far when the mayor, most of the time, holds all of the cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9162.727s">An</a>  alternative to a strong mayor system was never given terribly serious consideration in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9170.536s">I'm</a>  not, I do not mean to criticize the Charter Study Committee for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9174.4s">It</a>  was a volunteer process with volunteer resources and they made incredible strides given the resources and the time that they were given. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9181.137s">But</a>  this process did not interrogate our current strong mayor system, notwithstanding what I perceive to be genuine community interest in considering other alternatives, including recent specific efforts to renegotiate the balance of power between the city council and the mayor relative to the budgeting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9195.729s">This</a>  was brought up in our previous fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9198.752s">And</a>  it shows up in lots of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9201.754s">Something</a>  that I really, I think it's important to surface is that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9206.105s">On</a>  balance, the types of requests that I get from residents most often is essentially asking the city council to do something or fund something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9214.331s">And</a>  the answer is almost always, we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9217.193s">That's</a>  the mayor's purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9219.375s">All</a>  of our major functions, ordinances, zoning, budget review are constrained by the much, much greater jurisdiction of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9227.4s">And</a>  I think that when residents say they want representativeness, they want representative not just for talk, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9236.315s">and</a>  for exposure, but for action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9238.216s">That's</a>  meaningful representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9240.558s">What</a>  I mean to say, and I'm sorry, it's taken me a bit of a walk to get here, but this is important, and I really wanna make myself clear, is that this process has clarified for me that I believe the interest of the community is for a more genuinely representative system of governance where the executive office has less power, not no power, less power, and is more meaningfully checked by the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9264.351s">In</a>  addition to people enjoying more local representation on the school committee and on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9270.473s">So,</a>  on top of that, the mayor's most recent draft which gave us a week to consider amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9276.654s">Many</a>  of those amendments further expanded mayoral power relative to the power of the Council and some of them were totally benign, but there are a number that I found very problematic and. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9286.781s">Frankly,</a>  I think that's the opposite of the direction that we should be going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9290.544s">I'm</a>  not saying we should scrap this and build a strong council or city manager draft charter, though we could do that with an elected charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9296.928s">I</a>  don't think that we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9298.309s">We</a>  could. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9298.689s">That's</a>  not what I'm advancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9301.791s">But</a>  I, as one councilor, I'm going to need to see some additional amendments that at least start to move this issue of power balance in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9310.437s">and</a>  start to engage with that topic of the balance of power between mayor, council, school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9315.28s">I</a>  will support the amendments to protect and preserve the city council's right to make appointments to commissions unless otherwise specified. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9321.484s">I</a>  support the proposed amendment to remove the mayor's residency requirement for ward Councilors, which as the councilor stated, places a burden on ward Councilors greater than other electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9335.272s">I</a>  would also like to make a motion to amend section 9-4B to amend the number of appointees allocated to future charter study committees by the mayor, city council, and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9353.596s">To</a>  change that language to this review shall be made by a special committee to be composed of three appointees of the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9361.718s">three</a>  appointees of the city council, and three appointees of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9367.042s">That's</a>  changing four mayor, three city council, two school committee, to three mayor, three city council, and three school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9377.549s">And</a>  I would also like to make a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9380.931s">That</a>  would be amendments to section 4-1, beginning with striking the last sentence of section 4-1A. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9386.155s">These</a>  amendments <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9390.188s">In</a>  my one councilor's opinion, skip over I think the relatively smaller issue of four, three, or sorry, five to four versus eight to three, and more meaningly begin to engage with the city's balance of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9405.12s">Those</a>  amendments would leave me feeling comfortable supporting this draft, including eight ward councilors and three at-large councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9413.446s">And</a>  again, I want to acknowledge that there's impatience to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9418.663s">I</a>  hope that in my willingness to make uncomfortable motions, people and my fellow Councilors might consider that this stems from a desire, that this stems not from an enjoyment of making uncomfortable and perhaps unpopular motions, but rather from a sincere desire to get this as right as possible because it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9439.553s">I</a>  changed my mind on five and four and eight and three, and I've changed my mind on some other things too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9448.494s">And</a>  I think it's my responsibility to take the votes that I think will be best for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9453.775s">Our</a>  next charter needs to advance the cause of improving the balance of power between the mayor and the city council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9458.537s">And</a>  I think this would move the ball forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9461.057s">If</a>  it takes a special meeting next week to discuss this and then move this forward expeditiously, staying in April, that is fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9470.72s">And</a>  we are not the only body that has affected the timeline <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9477.921s">of</a>  this draft project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9481.004s">So</a>  those are my two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9482.025s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9483.566s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9483.987s">So</a>  those are motions to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9485.448s">The</a>  main motion by Council is our, which is seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9492.043s">If</a>  Councilor Lazzaro can accept the amendments or there can be votes to include them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9498.044s">We</a>  do have more discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9501.145s">So</a>  if there are other proposed, let's see if there are other proposed amendments to the motion and then we can vote on them at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9508.206s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9516.528s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9521.813s">I'll</a>  second Councilor Collins motion if if it needs a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9528.117s">So,</a>  I did write, I did, I wrote up a speech here or like just like more like listing out my thoughts on this whole process because I was, again, I was originally a member of the of the Charter Study Committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9547.541s">When</a>  I started my campaign for city council, I was asked to step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9553.003s">And</a>  you could read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9555.685s">You</a>  could read it on my blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9557.405s">I</a>  believe Mr. Gianvina here quoted my own blog at me during public comment when I sort of expressed blank check support for the work of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9575.913s">And</a>  I'm going to talk about that a little bit because I feel like this is probably the forum to have a little bit of discussion about this process as a whole and sort of how I think my opinions about how things have played out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9595.745s">So</a>  two years ago, I was a member of the Medford Charter Review Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9601.533s">This</a>  was an advocacy group that lobbied city council to pass a petition for a home rule charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9608.018s">At</a>  the time, they were lobbying city council to pass this petition so that Medford could elect a charter review commission that would be elected directly by voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9622.569s">And</a>  at the time, city council had four members that were in favor of charter review and three that were strongly against. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9628.834s">And</a>  the petition was rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9632.08s">And</a>  then around the time that I joined the Medford Charter Review Coalition subsequently tried to collect the requisite signatures to initiate a homeroom petition process directly, building off of the many signatures that were collected by former school committee member Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9649.368s">But</a>  we failed to collect those signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9651.009s">And</a>  then after that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9654.025s">the</a>  mayor then formed the 11-member Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9658.587s">And</a>  this is a group of Medford residents that the mayor appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9661.048s">They're</a>  appointed at her discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9663.529s">They</a>  didn't have, they weren't confirmed by city council, even though it was known throughout the process that council was the body that would eventually have to vote on the charter draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9673.054s">Now,</a>  I know, I understand why <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9676.859s">like,</a>  if I had to guess, I'd say that the reason that they weren't confirmed by Council explicitly was because, again, at the time, about <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9686.918s">almost</a>  half of the council was very opposed to the very idea of charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9692.861s">But</a>  we had the 11-member study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9694.983s">I</a>  was one of the original members of the charter study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9697.324s">And</a>  I think the mayor's intent when forming this committee, which she has expressed more privately than others, was to have sort of an ideological balance, mixing progressives and conservatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9707.99s">About</a>  50-50 conservatives are outnumbered in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9712.573s">But</a>  what she has said was that the idea was to have it <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9716.475s">have</a>  an ideological balance when composing the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9719.616s">I</a>  wasn't aware of that at the time when I was put on the COC. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9722.698s">I</a>  was, I believe it was four members of the Charter Review Coalition that were appointed there and other community members and membership did circulate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9731.361s">So</a>  I stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9732.982s">The</a>  other co-chair at the time stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9735.143s">Other</a>  people have had to step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9736.403s">Others</a>  were appointed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9737.304s">So</a>  the composition has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9740.085s">When</a>  I announced my campaign for city council, I was asked <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9743.772s">by</a>  the mayor, by others to step down from the Charter Study Committee because I was told involvement from the city council would be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9752.076s">I</a>  disagreed with this, but when somebody that appointed you to a committee asks you to step down, you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9760.641s">I</a>  didn't want to create any controversy early on my campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9764.283s">And</a>  during my campaign, I expressed full support for the work of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9770.027s">I</a>  think that a lot of that was to sort of bolster the public standing of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9775.288s">I</a>  hadn't still had good relationships with people, and I had faith in the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9785.33s">And</a>  I really want to see a new charter pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9788.551s">And</a>  again, when you have half the council hostile to the idea of charter review, it's really important to try to bolster up the committee that really wants it to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9802.485s">Hearing</a>  some of the feedback from the committee, like in this seat, on their justifications for some of the aspects of city council and school committee composition, I don't know if I've been always satisfied with what's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9820.015s">I've</a>  been very pleased with most of the other work there, but I also thought that, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9826.669s">the</a>  more drama that we have surrounding the study committee, which is not a negatively affect the chances of charter you to pass the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9835.055s">I'm</a>  going to talk a bit about conflicts of interest here, which was something that has come up in public comment so in changing a document as important as a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9842.978s">conflicts</a>  of interest are going to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9845.88s">So</a>  the draft of the charter before us, the one that the mayor just passed back to us has very minor edits that substantially put more power, more in favor of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9860.811s">um</a>  and takes it away from city council and balance of powers is important here and I think and I think it's and even the original draft that was handed to us had had small edits like the charter the periodic charter review committee having over half of those appointees be be mayoral appointees I think that having this is natural because you know you did have a study committee that was appointed with uh without council input I think that these conflicts uh are these sort of conflicts of interest with elected officials and <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9890.632s">groups</a>  that they appoint are why the state outlines a process for the Home Rule Commission of nine members to be elected directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9897.819s">I</a>  mean, this is the cleanest way to not have elected officials involved in making decisions surrounding their own process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9904.766s">Again,</a>  Medford tried to do this twice and failed because initiating the Home Rule Charter position is <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9913.009s">very</a>  difficult in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9915.11s">You</a>  need to collect something like around 6,000 signatures, I think, and that's just hard to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9921.753s">And</a>  when this cannot be done, approval of the charter by many groups of elected officials is the second best option, because elected officials, while they are <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9931.417s">making</a>  decisions about their own positions are at least chosen by the voters and so representative of the city at a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9937.941s">Our</a>  positions are more or less transparent to the city and we groups of elected officials have a pretty good understanding of city matters and ordinances that most members of the public aren't really as privy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9953.31s">This</a>  is why changes to the Constitution of the United States require both congressional approval and ratification from state legislatures, you need many groups of people elected by the voters of the United States to approve that the President cannot himself just change the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9968.704s">With</a>  that in mind, and this is a part where I've really done my work in the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9974.927s">And</a>  again, I understand the political context at the time the formation the formation of the charter study committee was pretty unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9982.849s">Most</a>  other municipalities have they varied in their exact methods for appointing a similar study committee or a charter review committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9991.112s">It's</a>  almost universal that city council or the equivalent body is involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9995.095s">School</a>  committees often are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9996.916s">Many</a>  cities have had Councilors and school community members on their charter review committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10002.419s">There</a>  are a few home rule charters where elected officials are explicitly banned from serving on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10008.963s">But</a>  in those cases, it's inevitably city council who appoints members of the review body because it is city council which will eventually have to approve that draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10019.811s">Again,</a>  I know why the mayor made the decision to not have a CSC confirmed by this council, nearly half of them were hostile at the time the very idea of charter abuse some understanding of the particular decisions made a particular times, and I think that the Charter Study Committee has worked extremely hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10036.56s">in</a>  in their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10038.782s">I</a>  think that I personally think that especially after the 2024 elections when uh most like I think every member every member of the council right now is favorable to the idea of charter review um I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10055.778s">we</a>  should have been more involved in the drafting of the process, again, in other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10061.225s">Sometimes</a>  Councilors are even on the Charter Study Committee itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10066.172s">That,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10072.872s">The</a>  mayor, so the mayor in the current draft nixed the council's proposal to change 38254, but the reason that I just seconded Councilor Collins' motion is that all along they decided to keep the mayor on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10086.254s">And</a>  this is something that bugs me because the charter study committee surveys showed that the public strongly disagreed with this choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10095.636s">I</a>  don't think that this exactly would have been a decision if the committee had been elected directly by voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10102.348s">Um,</a>  again, because it is clearly, according to their own surveys, the most popular decision have the mayor removed from the CSC entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10111.991s">But</a>  it was a committee that was appointed by the mayor, so it does make sense with that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10117.252s">Um,</a>  I also think that the exclusion of council would have been more acceptable to me if the edits that we had made and approved six to zero <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10132.488s">would</a>  have been accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10136.11s">And</a>  with the fact that we only had three months to do this in mind, whereas the Mayor and Charter Study Committee had two years to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10148.556s">But</a>  I do disagree with this process that we are given a new draft of the charter <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10158.318s">one</a>  which we've made very relatively like I mean substantial but still like relatively minimal edits to with a very limited timeline and we're given it one week before uh we're supposed to approve it via press release and I only received red line edits to act to know which amendments actually were made uh when I saw the council agenda so <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10185.838s">I'm</a>  aware of the timeline that we're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10188.799s">I</a>  would also really like to see it get on the ballot this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10193.501s">So</a>  here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10212.273s">I</a>  would be willing to go, I think that when this council voted on the draft of the charter that we voted on six to zero, we were voting for what we believed is the best policy and a policy that we believe would also be accepted by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10227.1s">It</a>  does bug me that in the only part of the process where another elected body did make edits, we have other groups that are trying to just completely undo those edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10239.861s">on</a>  this very limited timeline via press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10243.522s">So,</a>  I would be more comfortable voting on a draft of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10250.544s">I</a>  think that the amendments that were given that were given by Councilor Lazzaro and were also mentioned by Councilor Collins do satisfy some of the concerns that I had previously with the red line that's made by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10265.907s">I</a>  would be willing to support <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10269.088s">3-8</a>  if the mayor is also removed from the school committee because I think that shows some consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10276.23s">Again,</a>  that's what the public clearly said that they wanted and if we're going to go with policies that we think are the most popular with the voters, then I think that I see some head shaking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10292.895s">It</a>  was in their survey that people said they wanted to remove the mayor from the school committee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10300.648s">OK,</a>  yeah, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10301.728s">Sorry,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10302.989s">I</a>  just, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10303.949s">It</a>  was 43% removed from the school committee, 35% stay on the school committee, and 15% don't know.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10316.073s">So</a>  I think it does show some consistency in going with the most popular decisions if we went with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10324.256s">So</a>  again, as you can see, I am <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10329.621s">I</a>  do commend the Charter Study Committee for all the work that they've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10336.424s">Obviously,</a>  from what you can hear, I do have some concerns with the way the process went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10344.969s">And</a>  the timeline issue is something that I'm dissatisfied with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10351.132s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10352.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10353.357s">Before</a>  I go to Councilor Sagan, Councilor Callahan, I will note Councilor Sagan and I did try to work with the mayor to start the council part of the process earlier and eventually through the initial negotiations, we were asked to wait for the study committee to issue its final report before we began to take up consideration of any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10377.213s">We</a>  would have started about three to six months earlier if we had not made that decision.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10388.797s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10391.299s">I've</a>  honestly had a difficult time thinking about how to vote tonight what to do tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10399.588s">Because,</a>  at the end of the day I think it's, it is important for our city to get a new charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10408.147s">Also,</a>  at the end of the day, I think that this charter presents something that is better than the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10414.953s">And</a>  I've been reminded by residents over the last few weeks to not let perfect be the enemy of good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10425.601s">But</a>  I think the added difficulty to this part is that I also do worry about this precluding something better. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10434.49s">in</a>  the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10436.151s">I</a>  think oftentimes we see good enough as just being good and we reject better. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10443.457s">And</a>  I think, you know, that weighs on my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10447.9s">But</a>  I think, you know, what my mind has gone to more in the last week has been <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10457.895s">edits</a>  that the mayor's made that didn't make it to the press release that very much don't count as a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10464.776s">And</a>  that, you know, against the platform I was elected on and against the feed, a lot of feedback from the community shift power to the mayor's office and away from the city council, even compared to the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10480.159s">And</a>  that would go against <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10484.389s">that</a>  would go against the platform I ran on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10486.65s">And</a>  I'm grateful that Councilor Lazzaro has introduced her amendments and communicated with the mayor about that and gotten to a point of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10496.453s">And</a>  I would support those motions, and which is why I also seconded her motion too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10506.476s">In</a>  particular, I think it's important <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10510.179s">to</a>  restore the words by ordinance 23-3A, because not having the section would remove the power of the council to have appointments to committees by ordinance, which is a power that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10523.51s">We</a>  see it, I believe, on the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10526.212s">The</a>  Human Rights Commission ordinance that we were talking about includes that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10530.515s">I</a>  don't see that as a huge, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10534.418s">I</a>  don't see that as a major problem for the mayor to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10539.366s">And</a>  it's something that if we don't make that amendment, it would shift power away from, it would concentrate power in the office of the executive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10550.805s">I</a>  think Councilor Collins has called a motion to amend the Charter, the Article 9-4B to have the Charter Review Commission be composed of three appointees of the Mayor, the City Council, the School Committee is just an inherently fair <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10570.921s">amendments</a>  so it support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10573.523s">And</a>  I think that really, really underscores that the way that this process was done this time inherently creates adversarial relationships between people who just want the best for their city and might not see the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10588.529s">You</a>  know, in my opinion, the City Council, we fought for what we thought was the best policy for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10596.371s">I</a>  really appreciate a lot of the, you know, a lot of the support I've gotten over the last few weeks for speaking out, even from residents who don't necessarily agree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10607.593s">And</a>  you know what, I accept the 8-3 plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10613.815s">I</a>  don't think it's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10615.515s">But</a>  I accept it because I see that that is the way to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10620.858s">But</a>  at the same time, what I think Councilor Collins's, Vice President Collins's amendment does help us with is making sure that next time that process is more collaborative, that people feel like they're on an even footing, that we get a lot of this rich conversation that we've had over the last few months in the next Charter Review Committee's iteration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10647.123s">I</a>  also think that process-wise, this has been slightly frustrating just from a procedural standpoint, not because of things that members of the committee have done, but from a procedural standpoint, just because I've been, quote, asked, I've been asked to, quote, rubber stamp the thing, to rush it through committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10668.989s">I've</a>  been asked to not have counsel scrutinize it, but that legally is our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10675.21s">As</a>  enforcers of the charter in the future, we need to have a say in that perspective as well, even if we don't win out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10686.494s">And</a>  I think that goes to the inherent nature of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10691.036s">I</a>  think another frustration I've had is that over the last week, I floated many different compromise models to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10705.179s">Compromises</a>  that include not going to 4-5. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10710.363s">And</a>  I think compromises that gave up a lot of what I was arguing for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10713.705s">And</a>  a lot of these compromises were very basic, doing things in a more democratic way, even just commissioning a poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10722.912s">All</a>  of that was rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10725.334s">And</a>  there was a fear of how things would go down that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10731.683s">With</a>  regards to the motion to take the mayor off of the school committee, I'm still making my mind up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10740.487s">I</a>  am compelled by the point that if we're doing things because are the people who answered the survey expressed their intentions one way, we should be consistent in how we apply that principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10756.919s">Frankly,</a>  I've also just gotten a lot of emails, a lot of messages from people in the last few days, asking us to revisit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10766.225s">And</a>  I do think it speaks to the Mayor's, or to the initial point that we were making, or the Councilors were making, that ultimately, while representation is important, that representation is <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10781.762s">practically</a>  useless when the balance of power is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10786.744s">And</a>  I think there's a real conversation to be had there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10789.745s">I</a>  think I still feel of, I can see the merits of both arguments, to be quite honest with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10796.528s">And</a>  I also hear the argument that urgency is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10803.98s">And</a>  I have to weigh that debate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10806.801s">So</a>  urgency of getting this through versus making sure that even if the product that we get out of this council is something that I wouldn't have written myself, that it's sound enough to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10823.546s">And</a>  just to make sure that we have all the parts in place for this to work well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10831.074s">So</a>  that's, yeah, I just want to be transparent about how I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10835.617s">It</a>  is my intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10838.657s">in</a>  my you know, my my intention to do in my powers what we can do to move this charter along but I also want to make sure that because this charter forms the foundation of our city's laws and we'll do so for at least 10 years that we do it right as well and even if you know, the bigger ambitious ideas that I had don't make it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10863.309s">I</a>  want to make sure that the <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10868.448s">To</a>  that point, I would want, there are two smaller technical amendments that I think are important to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10878.794s">The</a>  first one being in article 8-2 to revert from city clerk back to the board of election commissioners because the city clerk's office doesn't have access to the voter rolls to certify the petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10892.202s">So</a>  if we say city clerk, it just won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10895.45s">the</a>  article won't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10896.833s">So</a>  that's just a technical thing that we did switch back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10902.17s">The</a>  other idea I'd want to float with the council is in part E, to revert back to a standard of 12%, not revert back, to revert to a standard of 12%. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10913.835s">This</a>  is 8-2-E. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10915.296s">8-2-E,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10916.276s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10917.537s">Just</a>  to align this with the citizen repeal referendum procedures, I think it can be really confusing to have different numbers and different bars for very similar things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10931.064s">I</a>  know in committee we offered 15%, the mayor came back with 10%, 12% is a number that the Charter Study Committee came up with in the first place and seems like a fair compromise to me.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10948.999s">All</a>  good, Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10950.16s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10950.681s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10952.642s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10954.204s">I</a>  apologize for not being there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10955.645s">I</a>  am sick and I did not want to get anyone all sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10960.392s">I</a>  want to encourage anyone who was not at our last meeting to read my blog post. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10965.637s">I</a>  have been interested in the nitty-gritty details of how democracies work, including different voting systems and wards versus districts versus at large and all that stuff for a long, long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10982.913s">So</a>  if you want to know my full thoughts, that's on my blog at annakalahan.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10988.114s">The</a>  short story is that both nationally and internationally, people who study democracy and democratic systems all are pretty much in consensus that single seat first past the post districts, which is what ward or district seats are, are known to be one of the worst at appropriately representing people's political views. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11011.248s">Now,</a>  I want to mention that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11014.509s">So</a>  I mean, I've been for 30 years, probably a person who believes that we that, you know, we're in a hybrid system, but one that is balanced, right, that does not have too many water district seats, and does not have too many at large seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11033.649s">I</a>  know the Charter Study Committee did do a survey, and a lot of people are talking about, you know, what came out of the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11038.99s">I</a>  want to remind us that there were 663 responses to that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11044.812s">So,</a>  you know, I really am happy that they did a survey, and I know how hard they worked to get those responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11055.658s">I</a>  will also comment that there never was a question asking how large the wards or district should be, whether we should have districts the same size as Somerville, which would be 4 or wards, which would be 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11068.124s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11070.785s">I'm</a>  unconvinced that the community, from that particular survey that we can read out of that survey, that what everybody who answered those questions is that they wanted to have eight wards rather than districts the same size as other cities near us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11087.189s">I</a>  will say one thing that we do know is that Medford voted strongly in favor of ranked choice voting in a statewide vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11094.91s">And</a>  I think that over 10,000 people voted in that election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11098.955s">So</a>  if we want to know what Medford actually thinks with confidence, we know that Medford wants rank-choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11106.477s">And</a>  my concern is that by passing this, we are locking ourselves into a charter that won't allow us to have rank-choice voting for these single-seat first-past-the-post districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11120.04s">So</a>  whether it's wards or districts, we will not be able to have rank-choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11124.941s">If</a>  we had rank-choice voting, I would be happy to have eight and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11130.063s">But</a>  the more districts that you have compared to at large, right, the greater percentage of awards you have, the more it is a problem when you have this first-past-the-post single-seat district. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11139.591s">And</a>  when I say locking in, my understanding is, and I really hope that we can get a definitive answer to this, that if we pass this charter, that we will not be able to get a home rule charter for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11152.444s">So</a>  I would like two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11155.166s">I</a>  would like, number one, if anyone among the city council can answer the question of who do we need to ask to get a definitive answer about whether passing this charter is locking us out of having a rank choice voting <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11174.284s">a</a>  home rule charter that allows for ranked choice voting within the next 10, 20, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11181.49s">I</a>  want to know who we can ask to definitively answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11185.994s">And</a>  then I would consider all of these amendments and things as long as we have one more week to work on this, as Vice President Collins suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11196.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11199.597s">Councilor</a>  Callahan is that a motion to amend the main motion to refer this to committee of the whole.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11206.82s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11207.1s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11216.504s">And</a>  your other question is, who can give a definitive answer on what powers the. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11222.977s">charter</a>  review committees established under the special act charter would have would they be home rule charter powers or just special act charter powers and it looks like we have anthony wilson from the collins center who's raised a hand who may have the answer to that question amazing i will unmute anthony anthony thanks for being here</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11247.286s">Thank</a>  thank you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11249.547s">Yes,</a>  Anthony Wilson with the call center. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11251.048s">I've</a>  worked with the, the committee, the mayor and members of this body as you sort of work through different permutations of this of this document with regard to the question about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11263.456s">I</a>  think the phrase was sort of locked in for several decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11267.297s">So</a>  the short answer is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11269.517s">In</a>  theory, if the body passed the document, assuming this was passed and then it was adopted at the legislature and came back and was ratified by the voters, the next year, the city of Medford could send up another special act to make these modifications to the election to address the concerns around <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11293.762s">first</a>  past the post-voting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11295.644s">So</a>  the short answer is no, you're not locked in for decades if this is adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11302.128s">The</a>  charter that's before you does have provisions for a review every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11308.612s">And</a>  I think the first one is five years out from the adoption date. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11313.155s">But</a>  those reviews do not preclude amendments to the charter before those designated times.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11320.476s">I</a>  don't want to speak for Councilor Callahan and Councilor Callahan if I get your question wrong please let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11325.499s">Anthony,</a>  I think the question Councilor Callahan is asking is, is the Charter Review Committee established under the Special Act Charter empowered to <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11338.861s">act</a>  as a home rule charter committee in the future, or would it only act as a special act charter committee, and therefore, if we wanted to do rank choice voting, would that have to be submitted to the legislature for their approval in a future amendment by the Charter Review Committee established under this charter, you know, the first one being five years and then 10 years after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11361.714s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, did I get your, is that the question you're asking?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11365.862s">No,</a>  I believe Anthony Wilson did answer my question, but I am interested in the answer, excuse me, to that question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11371.448s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11372.128s">OK,</a>  well, then that's just my question and I'm asking it.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11378.154s">Yes,</a>  so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11380.937s">Under</a>  the under the current charter, you'd have to submit a special act to make a modification to change it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11387.678s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11388.018s">So</a>  the charter review committee created under this would be another special act charter review committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11394.259s">And</a>  so it wouldn't be a home rule charter committee.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11398.08s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11398.44s">I</a>  mean, there's some, there's some sort of nuances here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11401.001s">If</a>  the question is purely around modifying elections, then yes, it would have to be a special act. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11405.322s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11406.662s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11407.722s">And,</a>  and when you say, you know, basically what you're, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11414.048s">we'd</a>  have to assume if we wanted to change to ranked choice voting that the legislature would approve such an amendment, that the mayor would set it up and that the legislature would approve it if the council were to put it forward.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11424.37s">Correct,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11425.85s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11426.79s">And,</a>  but you're also saying that if say in the future, they wanted to, their charter review wanted to happen under a home rule committee, that the signature collection process would still be a valid way to do that.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11441.071s">For</a>  each term for the creation of each of a charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11444.412s">Yes,</a>  you'd still have access to that provision under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11447.333s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11448.593s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11449.654s">Citizens</a>  gathering signatures and then having an election for a charter commission that route would still be available.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11456.016s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11456.596s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11456.856s">And</a>  that would be a home rule charter commission versus a special act charter commission.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11461.878s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11463.308s">uh...</a>  sort of and i'm sorry for sort of stumbling it i think the short answer sort of no like at home rule and i guess when i hear it it's sort of the community adopting something that it doesn't need the legislature to sort of adopt which in one case can be the charter commission but there are certain changes you can make to even this charter uh... that you wouldn't need the legislature to review uh... i'm just saying that elections would not be part of that group it's a it's a <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11492.666s">it's</a>  sort of smaller more uh ministerial changes that you could make that you wouldn't need um uh the legislature to review so it's as with sort of everything in this area it's a it's a it's a yes and got it composition and mode of election would require legislative approval correct got it thank you councillor Leming</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11518.73s">Yeah,</a>  just on that point, I don't think that anything we could do in this charter would affect our normal ability to initiate a home rule commission, which for clarity would be a group of people that are elected directly by voters who then draft another <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11540.333s">original</a>  charter and then that is then sent to voters again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11543.816s">I</a>  think that there are, there are kind of two different, and the, and the special, and the, the once every 10-year committee that's in this current draft of the charter would be, it would do things like update the charter if state law changed and the charter needed to be consistent with it or if there were normal things that we needed to change in the charter to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11565.837s">Like,</a>  you know, turned out that something wasn't working and they can make normal edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11571.243s">When</a>  it came to like when it comes to think when it comes to the Home Rule Commission, it is important to clarify that they do have generally have more authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11579.552s">So,</a>  I don't think that the state legislature would normally approve something like <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11586.653s">rank</a>  choice voting, but if the Home Rule Commission put forth something that wasn't explicitly illegal, they could end up implementing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11597.321s">So</a>  this doesn't take away the option explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11599.243s">I</a>  think that there is an argument to be made as to whether or not having this continuing process would sap motivation for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11607.442s">in</a>  the future, which there's kind of two different conversations to be had, but yeah.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11618.31s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11624.034s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11627.517s">We</a>  have three amendments containing five provisions that councillors have requested to amend the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11637.251s">This</a>  is the two from Councilor Collins one is to amend the number of appointees to future charter review committees under section nine dash four, be to three Mayor three Council three school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11650.224s">Under</a>  4-1, a motion to remove the mayor from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11653.847s">Now</a>  we have Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11658.07s">Under</a>  8-2, reverting the certification of petitions to the Board of Election Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11664.795s">And</a>  8-2E, a 12% threshold for the citizen initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11669.279s">Is</a>  that the citizen initiative or the repeal referendum? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11677.485s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11680.099s">And</a>  then Councilor Callahan to amend to refer to committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11688.507s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, you could accept those, you could accept some of them, or we could vote on each of the five to include them as an amendment to the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11700.537s">The</a>  main motion is by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Tseng to approve the draft as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11707.541s">with</a>  those amendments being under section 3-3A, adding back the word, the words or ordinance and under 2-1C, changing that to a word Councilor shall be a voter in which the office is sought or essentially just not having a additional residency requirement for that type of office where it doesn't exist for any other office.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11733.251s">I</a>  would like us to vote on each of those amendments, please.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11738.045s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11739.687s">So</a>  we'll start with the first one which is the amending the number of appointees to future Charter Review Committees to three Mayor, three Council, and three School Committee under section 9-4B. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11752.901s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11754.659s">Is</a>  this with taking the mayor's changes to move back to eight to three? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11760.742s">Is</a>  that what my fellow councilors would support with these changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11765.044s">Just</a>  to be clear.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11765.944s">Yeah,</a>  so the starting point of this is the mayor's amended draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11771.426s">No</a>  motion has been made to change back to the five-four model. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11776.349s">So</a>  the starting point for all of this is the mayor's draft, and these would be amendments to the mayor's draft that was returned to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11784.637s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11785.618s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11791.041s">On</a>  9-4B, that's amending the number of appointees to future charter review committees to three mayor, three council, three school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11800.386s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council and then we will open. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11803.187s">I</a>  want to get the main motion solidified and then we'll have discussion on the motion as amended by the council from members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11816.712s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council on changing to 333 for the future charter review committees under 9-4B? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11825.961s">Seeing</a>  none, Mr. Clerk, could you call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11829.545s">That's</a>  to amend the main motion to include that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11833.649s">There's</a>  a second from Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11846.672s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11847.873s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11850.334s">Vice</a>  President Collins? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11852.956s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11859.94s">To</a>  move to 8-3, I will say yes to this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11862.981s">No,</a>  this is a vote on... Okay, yep, just as long as I heard you correctly, Council President, so... Yeah, this is just on the specifically including the amendment to have the number of appointees on future charter review committees <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11877.297s">Three</a>  by the mayor, three by the council, three by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11879.799s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11881.021s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11881.261s">Is</a>  that a yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11882.863s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11883.343s">Yes.</a> </p>
