11
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:43,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa Kingsley.

12
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:51,320
[SPEAKER_02]: In just a few moments, the class of 2020 will be announced to mark their graduation from high school.

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,002
[SPEAKER_02]: These graduates represent years of hard work, commitment, dedication, and achievement.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:06,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that you recognize your place and your responsibility as a class and the legacy you inherit from previous graduates.

15
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:21,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You are now members of a long and distinguished list of alumni, men and women like yourselves, who've gone into the world and have brought with them the qualities which have historically marked a Medford High School education.

16
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:27,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a journey that started with tentative steps, but one that's taken us to remarkable heights.

17
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:31,876
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we encountered some trials and tribulations along the way.

18
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:36,641
[SPEAKER_02]: As students, you soldiered on and came out to be stronger in the end.

19
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:47,533
[SPEAKER_02]: During my time here with the Class of 2020, we've experienced exceptional moments, magical moments, and created memories that will be fondly remembered in the years ahead.

20
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:54,856
[SPEAKER_02]: But this group of seniors is much more than grade point averages, inspiring recitals, and championships.

21
00:01:55,636 --> 00:02:00,200
[SPEAKER_02]: This class is unique, not only because what it's accomplished, but how they accomplished it.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,481
[SPEAKER_02]: They took great care of each other.

23
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:07,385
[SPEAKER_02]: To me and many others, the class of 2020 will be known as the chosen ones.

24
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: The class of 2020 is the chosen class to begin the change the world needs, the change of focus on appreciation, gratitude,

25
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,476
[SPEAKER_02]: support, and collaboration.

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:29,881
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the class that began the movement that showed a heightened appreciation for teachers, healthcare professionals, and essential workers who risk their lives every day so we can stay healthy and safe.

27
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:42,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the chosen ones that had a parade in your honor, to have faculty and staff deliver signs for your lawn, to have the school administration prepare your caps and gowns, and we know you will miss more than you can ever imagine.

28
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:50,849
[SPEAKER_02]: You are learning that this country and the world needs to support one another to collaborate and advocate peacefully for social justice.

29
00:02:51,469 --> 00:03:02,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Although this pandemic has taken many things from you, it has also given the opportunity to highlight what is truly important, family, friends, health, and your community.

30
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you continue your journey to change the world, do so by acknowledging, respecting, and celebrating our differences.

31
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:15,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the opportunity to find out more about what you have in common with someone instead of focusing on what separates you.

32
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your voice and learn to use it.

33
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Speak, express, and let yourself be heard.

34
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:26,093
[SPEAKER_02]: But also take the time to listen and hear what people are saying.

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to understand another person's point of view, especially when it's different from yours.

36
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Always be kind and try to live with an open heart and open mind.

37
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You will forever be the chosen class.

38
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon you'll begin having conversations and hear yourself say statements like, those things happened before COVID-19, or that is what happened pre-pandemic times.

39
00:03:48,930 --> 00:04:00,820
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember when teachers and students were in the same room, and we used to fill the gym as many people as we could to enjoy the annual Thanksgiving Day pep rally, and we didn't even have to wear masks.

40
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:13,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So take all these lessons that you learned at your time at Medford High School, not just in the past, but your school career, and let them guide you, inspire you, and remind you that you are Medford Strong.

41
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:20,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I will be saying those things around when people complain and say things like, that's too hard, or we can't do it.

42
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:27,324
[SPEAKER_02]: My response will be, if you think those statements are true, first let me tell you about the Medford High School 2020.

43
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first class that was resilient, tenacious, creative, talented, and resourceful.

44
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:41,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the class that began the change in our world that could handle anything that was thrown their way, even a global pandemic.

45
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an interesting year without question.

46
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:48,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to not let the state of the world discourage you.

47
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:56,140
[SPEAKER_02]: The resilience that you have shown is why the class of 2020 graduates are not only the envy of the world, but the hope for our future.

48
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,061
[SPEAKER_02]: The spotlight is on you.

49
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:03,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that no matter what this is for this year, you can make it whatever you want.

50
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:07,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Every journey is different, and every journey is a new chance.

51
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this journey yours.

52
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Allow me to offer you a bit of advice going forward.

53
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:17,503
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where you are or what you're doing, take it with a positive attitude.

54
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to surround yourself with people who remind you how amazing you are.

55
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what you love, be inquisitive, and never stop learning.

56
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: In every speech I state this.

57
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Every morning in the MHS foyer that's posted in our school, it states, through these halls walk the best students in the nation.

58
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:41,177
[SPEAKER_02]: No truer statement represents the class of 2020.

59
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:43,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations to you all.

60
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:58,027
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, I'm delighted and proud to call to the podium the class of 2020's choice to give the faculty address, Mr. Jonathan Brown.

61
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, class of 2020.

62
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, I told Sherbie, a junior, that I was very worried that I wouldn't know what to say today.

63
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And she told me that all I had to do was keep it a buck.

64
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm going to do.

65
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:41,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You may remember way back when you were in the ninth grade, sitting in your ELA classroom, and your teacher stood before the class and mentioned those two words that many of you dread to hear.

66
00:06:42,643 --> 00:06:44,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Oral presentation.

67
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And those two words filled your soul with anxiety.

68
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two words made your stomach drop from your body and hit the floor.

69
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two words immediately made you break out in a cold sweat.

70
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, today you have your revenge.

71
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been teaching at Medford High School in the vocational school for 20 years.

72
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have no doubt in my mind

73
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: that I have the best job in the world.

74
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:21,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I get paid to spend a lot of time with some of the most creative, friendly, thoughtful, open-minded people in the world.

75
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I'm talking about you.

76
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,473
[SPEAKER_05]: You have made me smile.

77
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:28,073
[SPEAKER_05]: You have made me laugh.

78
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:33,574
[SPEAKER_05]: You have made me challenge myself in the way that I see the world around me.

79
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a father and a man.

80
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:40,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Without you, I would not be the person I am today.

81
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:54,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to know these things because I want every one of you to realize that you have the tremendous power within yourselves to have a profound impact every single day on the life of someone else.

82
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:59,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Every person you encounter every day is a chance for you to shine.

83
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:06,118
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter if this person is someone you know fairly well or someone who is a total stranger to you.

84
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: A smile, a nod, a greeting, a laugh,

85
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:15,490
[SPEAKER_05]: a compliment, a word of a gesture of goodwill.

86
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:22,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Small acts of kindness and humanity can make the world of difference in someone else's day.

87
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:32,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And I speak from experience that the investment you make with any small act of humanity will pay dividends tenfold down the road.

88
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:41,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I know in my heart that each of you has the awesome potential to bring light into the world and I exhort you today

89
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:42,736
[SPEAKER_05]: to act on this potential.

90
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:51,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardest part of my job is that every year I have to say farewell to so many great people, and this year is no exception.

91
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: While I do not know all of you by name, I know almost all of you by your faces.

92
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:07,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you were a student in my class, a Driver's Ed student, a student I walked by in the hallway, a student I watched in a pep rally, either as a participant

93
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:16,988
[SPEAKER_05]: A student playing on one of our teams, a student attending a sporting event, or a student I saw in any other capacity, I noticed you.

94
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:26,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way you conducted yourselves, both in and outside the school, always filled me with immense joy and pride.

95
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You are Medford's finest.

96
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:31,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I will miss you, every single one of you.

97
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,200
[SPEAKER_05]: We will miss you.

98
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:42,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though today you will officially be graduates of Medford High School, you will always be a part of our extended Mustang family.

99
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:48,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in touch and let us know of your successes, of which I'm sure there will be many.

100
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you will make us proud.

101
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:51,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

102
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:20,813
[SPEAKER_02]: For our address of welcome, it is my distinct pleasure to invite the class of 2020 president who will be attending Tufts University in the fall, Mark Allen Gene Mary.

103
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning, future leaders.

104
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: On behalf of the class of 2020, I want to thank all those who helped us reach where we are today.

105
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:58,547
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents, family members, friends, teachers, faculty, staff, Mayor Longo-Cohen, Superintendent Vincent, the school committee members, and those who live with us in spirit as well.

106
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: This speech was supposed to be the moment where I tell you all, right at the beginning of summer, goodbye and good luck.

107
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:09,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year has been a wild roller coaster ride.

108
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,005
[SPEAKER_04]: One Thursday, we woke up and went to our last day of high school without even knowing it.

109
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:33,572
[SPEAKER_04]: walked into our homeroom one last time, heard Eli and Catherine do the morning announcements one last time, and had lunch with our friends in the cafeteria one last time without even knowing it.

110
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:49,382
[SPEAKER_04]: These past couple months has also shown us that there are still inequalities, violence, and hatred in our world, to a degree which has shocked and even terrified many of us, especially here in America.

111
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:55,266
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line, as W.E.B.

112
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: DuBois puts it.

113
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:03,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That much of the push for equality that started centuries ago is still necessary nowadays, if not more crucial.

114
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: With everything that has happened during these past months, it has been hard to also appreciate the good that's persisted throughout our journey.

115
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an old Haitian proverb that says, beyond mountains, there are more mountains.

116
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is a constant climb, where we take on hill after hill, challenge after challenge.

117
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:40,165
[SPEAKER_04]: But every once in a while, we stand at the summit, realizing the climb was worth it, and appreciating the beauty around us.

118
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:50,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when we can't see the end when climbing, we should use these bright moments as reminders to motivate us through tough times.

119
00:12:52,038 --> 00:13:07,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Recall a moment like the excitement of our first football game, dressing our Mustang white and blue, our pep rally where we showed the other classes who the seniors were, or the soccer semifinals where we stood united behind our soccer players who fought to play.

120
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:18,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Through these moments, our class showed what it meant to be Mustangs, being motivated, resilient, and most importantly, united.

121
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we did not end our year as we hoped to, we have to remember the moments that made it were all worth it.

122
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:37,136
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first walked through the Medford High School as a new sophomore kid from Haiti, I never imagined that I would have the honor to represent and take on this journey with you all.

123
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Never imagined I would feel the passion, energy, and vigor that this class has.

124
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:57,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I have watched as this very energy and passion have driven the class officers, Ketley, Isabella, Elijah, Emily, our class advisors, Mr. Donlan and Mrs. Donlan.

125
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been an honor working with them.

126
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,623
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only the end of a single chapter in our story.

127
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:14,989
[SPEAKER_04]: When we reunite in 10, 20, 50 years, we'll do so as the future leaders, the future force of tomorrow.

128
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: As I celebrate with you here today, I can only ask you to get ready to face the world, and most importantly, leave your mark on it.

129
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, and congratulations, class of 2020.

130
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:52,378
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point to introduce to you the chairperson of the Medford School Committee and the mayor of the city of Medford, the Honorable Brianna Longo Kern.

131
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:09,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Dr. Edward Vincent, Principal DeLaver, staff, parents, teachers, and graduates.

132
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,114
[SPEAKER_00]: As I sat down to write a couple days ago, I wondered what I say.

133
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:23,339
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I say to a class of students that have been through so much in the last five months?

134
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,342
[SPEAKER_00]: A class that has been robbed of so much.

135
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:33,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I should ignore the bad, pretend it didn't happen, and talk about how wonderful everything is.

136
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I be honest and acknowledge your reality?

137
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:45,290
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unfair the amount of loss that you have suffered and the things that you've had to give up during your senior year.

138
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Events you have planned and hoped for throughout your high school career.

139
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:55,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish as your mayor and as a parent, I could fix that for you.

140
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:01,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could just wake up and pretend it was all a bad dream, but I can't.

141
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,937
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a world that is struggling right now, struggling on so many levels.

142
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:10,832
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what makes me stop?

143
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop and think and say, wait a minute.

144
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:18,495
[SPEAKER_00]: There is good here.

145
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:20,716
[SPEAKER_00]: There is good.

146
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,757
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there is great here because you are our future.

147
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:35,401
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have overcome so much, not just this past year, but throughout your lives and work so hard to reach this milestone.

148
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:45,464
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the will, the drive, and the work ethic to make this world a better place to live, learn, and grow in.

149
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,267
[SPEAKER_00]: You are our future doctors, engineers, and attorneys.

150
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:55,871
[SPEAKER_00]: You are our future lawmakers, activists, volunteers, and scientists.

151
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:59,894
[SPEAKER_00]: You are able to be whatever you put your mind to.

152
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:08,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your determination and your strength, and I've seen how talented this class of 2020 truly is.

153
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited to continue to hear and learn about all the amazing things you will do.

154
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:22,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're going to have tough days, tough moments, and in this case, tough months.

155
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,674
[SPEAKER_00]: But please choose to never give up.

156
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:38,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Fight for what you believe in, search deep for the positive, and use that as the energy you need to succeed and reach every additional milestone you choose to accomplish.

157
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,865
[SPEAKER_00]: You are smart and resilient.

158
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,947
[SPEAKER_00]: You are stronger because of what you have been through.

159
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:47,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that strength.

160
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,932
[SPEAKER_00]: To all of the parents and guardians, you have done an amazing job and you should be so proud.

161
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to all of the graduates.

162
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to the families who have supported them every step of the way.

163
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, congratulations to the teachers and everyone else who have helped our graduates reach this milestone.

164
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:15,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave you with this final quote from a great author with whom I imagine you are familiar, as my children are.

165
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:17,345
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Dr. Seuss.

166
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,607
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the brains in your head.

167
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You have feet in your shoes.

168
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,792
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stare yourself in any direction you choose.

169
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:28,175
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on your own, and you know what you know.

170
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:32,819
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the guy or the gal who'll decide where to go.

171
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.

172
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:53,842
[SPEAKER_02]: It is with great honor for me to introduce, at this time, the leader of the Medford Public Schools, the superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice Edward Vinson.

173
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, Mustang Nation.

174
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:12,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited to be here because we are celebrating you, the class of 2020.

175
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:16,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I have a few remarks to share.

176
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:33,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Please indulge me, but I want you to just enjoy this time, enjoy this celebration because we are celebrating you, whether you're in your living room or your kitchen, doesn't matter where you are, but we are there with you.

177
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:36,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm so glad to share this message.

178
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So good morning, Mustangs.

179
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:58,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as I said, although this is not the graduation ceremony you may have envisioned, the Medford Public Schools still wanted to provide you and your family with the means to celebrate your wonderful achievements.

180
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:09,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to COVID-19, your senior year was cut short and your graduation ceremony was canceled.

181
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You all learned an important lesson.

182
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:22,369
[SPEAKER_03]: How following the rules is paramount, critically important during this unprecedented time.

183
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID is alive and well and lurking everywhere.

184
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:33,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, the precautions of always lies on this issue.

185
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We must be vigilant and focused.

186
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,803
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do affects each person I come in contact with.

187
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:56,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I respectfully request that we all follow the directives put forth by the CDC, Governor Baker, and Medford's Board of Health.

188
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:02,818
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules and regulations are provided for everyone's well-being.

189
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, during this COVID crisis,

190
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us witnessed the horrible killing of Mr. George Floyd.

191
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:21,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, what it is like to grow up black and brown in America.

192
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I know so many of you have raised your voices in support of Black Lives Matter.

193
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:37,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about the late Congressman John Lewis who stated,

194
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If not us, then who?

195
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If not now, then when?

196
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:55,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue to work for social justice, equality, and remember that love always wins.

197
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:00,737
[SPEAKER_03]: You are at a crossroads right now in your lives.

198
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:10,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Our world is rapidly changing, and you will be presented with new challenges, new routines, and new situations.

199
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be asked to evolve and find the strength to explore your life outside the comfort zone of Medford High School.

200
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:26,029
[SPEAKER_03]: You will grow in ways you never imagined before.

201
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:45,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my hope that in true Mustang fashion, you will speak your truth, spread love unconditionally, stand up for what you believe in and treat people the way you want to be treated.

202
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:48,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Mistakes, we all do.

203
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:56,047
[SPEAKER_03]: But mistakes mean you are trying and you will learn from them.

204
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:01,218
[SPEAKER_03]: do not allow this current situation to define you.

205
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:13,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, look upon it as a bridge to opportunity, as a way to build your character and open the door to new possibilities.

206
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:25,490
[SPEAKER_03]: As President Obama said in his graduation remarks to the class of 2020, ground yourselves in values that last.

207
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:36,797
[SPEAKER_03]: like honesty, hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, and respect for others.

208
00:23:38,057 --> 00:23:49,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Commit to moving this world onto a day where sexism, greed, status, and racial prejudice no longer exist.

209
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:56,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, we come together and celebrate the class of 2020.

210
00:23:58,323 --> 00:24:10,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Please take the time to say thank you to your parents, to your grandparents, to your relatives, your caregivers, your teachers, your advisors, your coaches.

211
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a moment now, those of you on Zoom or on TV, give them a hug, embrace them, say thank you.

212
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,906
[SPEAKER_03]: They helped you get here today.

213
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,807
[SPEAKER_03]: They had your back the entire way.

214
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:37,693
[SPEAKER_03]: We wish you nothing but luck and happiness as you move forward with college, a career, or as you enter the military.

215
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID-19 may have stopped this class from seeing their usual senior graduation events.

216
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:51,206
[SPEAKER_03]: but I believe it has taught all of us something.

217
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:53,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Resilience.

218
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Never again will you take anything for granted.

219
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:05,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Never again will you think what you do does not affect others.

220
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,303
[SPEAKER_03]: More than ever, I am sure you now appreciate everything you have

221
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:19,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my belief that COVID-19 has made you wise beyond your years.

222
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:32,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Mustang roots, that the blue and white will forever run through your veins, and that the Mustang way is a way of life.

223
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Be well, be safe, be kind, and never stop reaching for the stars.

224
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:47,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck and do remember, you just can't tame the Mustangs.

225
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:51,177
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say Mustang, you say pride.

226
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:54,541
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say Mustang, you say pride.

227
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustang.

228
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:57,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustang.

229
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to the class of 2020.

230
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:18,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It is another great honor for me to introduce our guest speaker today.

231
00:26:19,364 --> 00:26:23,086
[SPEAKER_02]: This person began work in the City Laws Department in January of 1984.

232
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:32,517
[SPEAKER_02]: In June 2001, former Mayor Michael J. McGlynn appointed him to be the city solicitor after Robert Bloomsack retired.

233
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: He himself is now retired, but is still in a suit, running errands, and being busier than ever.

234
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:41,520
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes his duties as deacon at St.

235
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Raphael's Church.

236
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Please give a warm welcome to Mr. Mark Rumley.

237
00:26:57,678 --> 00:26:58,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good morning.

238
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of words are used.

239
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:03,541
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear a lot of them today.

240
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:07,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, if not all of them, are uplifting words.

241
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:12,086
[SPEAKER_01]: The words you've been waiting to hear, especially this year.

242
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:18,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Words like good luck, congratulations, you did it.

243
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And from your parents, grandparents,

244
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:31,082
[SPEAKER_01]: aunts, uncles, godparents, those who are closest to you, you'll hear the words that are the sweetest.

245
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:33,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

246
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:34,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud.

247
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:40,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my honor to join those voices today to congratulate you.

248
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:52,418
[SPEAKER_01]: But with my congratulations to you, I want to offer, very briefly, four observations that I'm confident will assist you, whether

249
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:06,508
[SPEAKER_01]: You are entering the workforce, going on to further education, enlisting in the military, or even if you have no idea what you're going to do next year.

250
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:15,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my first point is the simplest, but it's sometimes the most difficult, and it is this.

251
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:26,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge you to take every negative message that has ever been directed towards you and throw it away.

252
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:30,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Graduation is a time for reflection.

253
00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:39,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you look back on the past, try to recall every time that someone said to you, you can't do that.

254
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:42,003
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to try to do that?

255
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding?

256
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:43,925
[SPEAKER_01]: You?

257
00:28:46,141 --> 00:29:00,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, these can't-do messages are given by people who love you very much and care about you, but they may be afraid that either you'll fail or worse, you may get hurt.

258
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:13,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times, these can't-do messages are given by people that are just plain old flat-out negative, and negative people pass on their negativity to others.

259
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this time of your graduation, it's a time to stop listening to can't-do messages.

260
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:28,791
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a time to throw them out and to exile them into the trash bin of your entire life is ahead of you.

261
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:38,618
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no need and no point to being slowed down by negative statements, messages, or influences.

262
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,402
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing in front of life's possibilities

263
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings us to the second point.

264
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:54,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what it is that you love to do, and you'll excel at it.

265
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:57,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it that you love to do?

266
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:02,017
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your passion, your singular, unique passion?

267
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:05,178
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that speaks to your soul?

268
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:07,579
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that animates your heart?

269
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:12,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer to these questions will not come from your intellect.

270
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not come from some type of intellectual exercise.

271
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:17,982
[SPEAKER_01]: They will come from your heart.

272
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:22,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So embrace this effort and find your passion.

273
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:26,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do, you'll find your life.

274
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been an attorney for 41 years.

275
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:36,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave it to other people to say whether or not I excelled at it.

276
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:37,929
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know this.

277
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:56,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I have loved every one of these 41 years, and especially and first among them, the 36 years that I spent in the law department of the city of Medford, 20 of which I served as city solicitor, chief legal counsel for the city.

278
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:09,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the record will show that I worked for two city managers, John Galony and Richard Lee, and two mayors, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn and Mayor Stephanie Burke.

[SPEAKER_01]: But the record can never show the great pride and enjoyment that I felt for one simple reason.

280
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:25,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I represented the people of the city of Medford, the city where I was born,

281
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:33,398
[SPEAKER_01]: City where I met my wife, where we married, raised our family, and still live.

282
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:44,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be said that whatever your passion may be, whatever profession you choose, there will be times of difficulty.

283
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:56,122
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you love what you do, when you care about what you do, it will be much easier to ride out the rough patches of the tough times.

284
00:31:57,024 --> 00:32:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Your passion will allow you to persevere through any
