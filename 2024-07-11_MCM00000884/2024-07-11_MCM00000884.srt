[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we have

19
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:41,280
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 present, one absent, and we're ready to go.

20
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the first item on the agenda is the consent agenda and approval of minutes for the 513 full committee meeting and the 529 finance subcommittee meeting.

21
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:58,969
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two corrections that need to be made to member Morell's name.

22
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Branley was transposed for Nicole Morell, so we'll make those updates.

23
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:16,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there, before we take a motion to approve, just a reminder, the finance subcommittee in particular, if you were not present at the meeting, join us.

24
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: From a plan, but you can.

25
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear just like gobbledygook, but not words.

26
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:13,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can hear the mic is on, it's just not intelligible.

27
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle, so it's a little closer.

28
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,927
[SPEAKER_00]: It's talking to.

29
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear us now?

30
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:35,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's better.

31
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,651
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

32
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:36,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

33
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:37,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Still better?

34
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Marta, Marissa, how is it for you guys?

35
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds the same.

36
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:52,754
[SPEAKER_01]: In a good way or a bad way?

37
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:54,075
[SPEAKER_11]: In a bad way.

38
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

39
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:11,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're lighting up, so I'm just trying to figure it out.

40
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Libby, can you hear us now?

41
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:16,127
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better.

42
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I can at least understand you.

43
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:21,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, just take it.

44
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:21,585
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it.

45
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:24,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it.

46
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:25,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you, okay?

47
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:28,529
[SPEAKER_14]: My agility needs better.

48
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

49
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:56,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's it right here?

50
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:57,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

51
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,589
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that?

52
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,550
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good.

53
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:00,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

54
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:01,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

55
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:02,991
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

56
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:03,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Perfect.

57
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:16,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so as I was saying, I don't know what you all were able to hear, so I'm just going to repeat what I said.

58
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:24,683
[SPEAKER_10]: The finance subcommittee was streamed to YouTube, so if you weren't at the meeting, I would encourage you to watch.

59
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:30,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia Hunt from our planning office joined us, and we had a good conversation about

60
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: potential sites for the high school should this site not be the one that is desirable from a planner's perspective.

61
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:44,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just was a really interesting conversation.

62
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Particularly, we talked a little bit about transportation.

63
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:59,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And her planner's hat says that transportation should not be the reason we do or don't do something with the building, because transportation

64
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:07,190
[SPEAKER_10]: can be moved to align with where the building ultimately resides.

65
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:17,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So just like good information, more sort of like fact finding and starting to engage the right people that I would recommend everybody listen to if they have a minute.

66
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:27,338
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two amendments that do need to be made to correctly list Nicole Morell in both the minutes and in the motion.

67
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:34,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And then other than that, I will look for a motion to approve the consent agenda.

68
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,119
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no other objections.

69
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion approved by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

70
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, roll call.

71
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:50,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny Graham, yes.

72
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn, yes.

73
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, yes.

74
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne Galusi, yes.

75
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushion?

76
00:07:57,494 --> 00:07:57,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

77
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Marta Cabral?

78
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:00,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

79
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Libby Brown?

80
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:02,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

81
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:04,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa Desmond?

82
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:05,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

83
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:07,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Maria Dorsey?

84
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:07,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

85
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:08,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Brian Hilliard?

86
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:08,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

87
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy Keene?

88
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:10,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

89
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:11,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily Lazzaro?

90
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:12,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

91
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:13,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Morell?

92
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:14,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

93
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Erin Orapade?

94
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:15,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

95
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:18,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke Preissner?

96
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,446
[SPEAKER_10]: 14 in the affirmative, one absent.

97
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion, the minutes are approved.

98
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:33,279
[SPEAKER_10]: The next thing on our list is actually to take what I'm going to call a brief introductory tour of the building.

99
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's at least some number of people who have never done that before here.

100
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:45,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe you've seen bits and parts of the building, but I thought it would be a good time to sort of give everyone

101
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: some sort of helpful framework that says, what even all are we talking about that goes on in this building today?

102
00:08:52,764 --> 00:09:05,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we wanted to spend a little bit of time, and we're going to try to be back here by 7 to take you all on a little walking tour of the facility.

103
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:12,877
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those of you that are on the phone and have joined us remotely, we're going to

104
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:18,939
[SPEAKER_10]: not take you with us so that you don't feel like you're in the Blair Witch Project as we move around the building.

105
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:29,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will put up a note on the Zoom just so people know that we're on a walking tour of the building and we expect to be back about 7.

106
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:36,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those of you who have joined us remotely, we'll see you back here at 7.

107
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:39,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really starting to be sick and miss this.

108
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:43,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an opportunity in the future for like Marissa and I to take a look around?

109
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

110
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,236
[SPEAKER_01]: For another meeting or something?

111
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:53,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think we'll do this more than one time because right now, again, we're like in the middle of the paperwork phase.

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it might be helpful at a high level, but when we start talking about

113
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:04,244
[SPEAKER_10]: when we start getting into the place where we're talking about design and feasibility, there will be plenty of opportunities for us to do that again.

114
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:09,166
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be lots of opportunities even for the community to come in and do that as part of the communication plan.

115
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:10,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, absolutely.

116
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:22,171
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly, if you want to come in before then, just let me know and I'll arrange it with somebody to give you a personal tour.

117
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:22,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

118
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:23,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

119
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:24,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

120
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:32,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we're going to go on a little walking tour here.

121
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

122
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting worse.

123
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting worse.

124
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:43,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all gas.

125
00:10:56,592 --> 00:10:57,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I smelled it when I came in.

126
00:10:57,893 --> 00:10:58,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad.

127
00:10:58,473 --> 00:10:59,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad.

128
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:16,720
[SPEAKER_06]: We are back.

129
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

130
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,141
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

131
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:19,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, everyone.

132
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It should focus on this.

133
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:23,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's OK.

134
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:27,084
[SPEAKER_10]: that.

135
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:27,644
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

136
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:34,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, we just got back from a brief walking tour of the building.

137
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,774
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw just like a little bit of everything just to give people some perspective on what all this building is about.

138
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:46,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and you know, it's pluses and minuses, I guess I'll say, and we'll leave it at that.

139
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, plus we have lots of marble at our disposal, minus, um, you know, many minuses.

140
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:54,765
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um,

141
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:56,508
[SPEAKER_10]: having.

142
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:13,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the next item on our agenda is to take a look at our chapter 74 viability form, which we looked at last time.

143
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's in your packet.

144
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:14,859
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent it.

145
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We sent it out yesterday.

146
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

147
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:34,088
[SPEAKER_10]: We at our 520 school committee meeting, Chad and Dr. Cushing presented to the school committee about some things that they would like to see us study from an expansion perspective.

148
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:40,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are four programs, auto, electrical,

149
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:47,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Cosmetology and health assisting that are current programs here that are space constrained.

150
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:58,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are, we, the school committee unanimously approved that we study an expansion of those programs from a space perspective when we get to the feasibility study.

151
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:19,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And in addition, the school committee approved that we study dental assisting, veterinary science, criminal justice and protective services, plumbing and HVAC, and information systems, networking, cybersecurity, all as separate vocations.

152
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:26,507
[SPEAKER_10]: So five new vocational programs under study from a space perspective for the vocational school as well.

153
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:36,298
[SPEAKER_10]: MSBA requires that we follow all the rules and regs that DESE has around Chapter 74 programming.

154
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:37,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So they all require licensure.

155
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,381
[SPEAKER_10]: They all require, like, all the things that would normally have to happen.

156
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:46,444
[SPEAKER_10]: They also will ask DESE to weigh in on us studying these programs.

157
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:52,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a variety of criteria, including that there's demand in the area for those programs.

158
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:57,416
[SPEAKER_10]: And that the school committee is in support of studying those programs.

159
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:06,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've checked all of those boxes, that presentation and the vote and the minutes will be sent to MSBA with this form.

160
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,441
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wanted to bring this form back to you all.

161
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I did talk to our contact at MSBA this morning.

162
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:23,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We are not required to take votes on these eligibility program documents as the school building committee.

163
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:28,281
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important that this group provide their input and weigh in and take a vote.

164
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,282
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to see us do that.

165
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:40,229
[SPEAKER_10]: My hope is that if you all have any comments tonight, having reviewed this, we can take a vote to approve this document as amended.

166
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:42,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we will submit this document.

167
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to open the floor in case anybody had questions.

168
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:53,433
[SPEAKER_10]: comments, thoughts about what is here before we move any sort of approval.

169
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:54,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

170
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested in specialized spaces.

171
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:02,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to clarify, open night is not going to have an auditorium floor.

172
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:06,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a learning space that gathers students together as a community.

173
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a gym.

174
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a gym.

175
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:10,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's.

176
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Other forms.

177
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:16,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Other forms.

178
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:18,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, auditorium.

179
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:19,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Auditorium is bringing it up.

180
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:20,033
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

181
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:20,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

182
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,275
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the chapter 74 one.

183
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we reviewed it last week.

184
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:35,783
[SPEAKER_10]: And since then, or not last week, but at our last meeting, since then, all the information has been filled out.

185
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:40,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Our proposed capacity information has been fleshed out.

186
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:48,830
[SPEAKER_10]: We've noted the school committee's support for the new programs and finished filling out the rest of his form.

187
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other questions about this document.

188
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Chad.

189
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:15,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there is a waitlist.

190
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:56,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean if you ask me, my philosophy is that there's kids

191
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul?

192
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:37,116
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other issue with kids from other communities is we don't get to decide about paying for a spot.

193
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:41,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we don't function like a standalone vocational school, correct?

194
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the cheapest in the state.

195
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:43,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

196
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So he could bring a kid in and cost us

197
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:06,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say though, a few years ago, I was bringing in close to $200,000 a year, which is what's kept us afloat in tough times.

198
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:39,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think the other sort of thing because we had this actually this conversation like very early like back in February, the first time we met, where I was like, hey guys I need you to like really think about all these things and fill out these forms and like, we need to do a lickety split.

199
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So they haven't kicked me out of their office just yet, which is nice.

200
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,831
[SPEAKER_10]: But we had this conversation.

201
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:51,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think there's like the other variables are, yes, MSB is going to pay for a portion of the building.

202
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:56,174
[SPEAKER_10]: But we also, as a community, are going to pay for a portion of the building.

203
00:18:56,274 --> 00:19:03,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a much more complicated story to tell to say, we're going to make it bigger than our students need.

204
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:07,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to pay for that at 100% because our enrollment certification won't support

205
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:13,137
[SPEAKER_10]: to be enrollment from other districts, right?

206
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:16,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of the balance.

207
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:24,703
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we actually sort of stayed towards like the current model of if there's capacity, we would continue to take students like Chad does.

208
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:39,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the expansion, like the expansion that we're talking about and the new programming, I think we could see again that there's capacity across the programming, but it's a little bit hard to say, I think, but that was sort of the calculus as we were thinking about

209
00:19:41,170 --> 00:20:01,676
[SPEAKER_10]: the point of view to take to put this stuff together, which was we felt like it would be too hard of a sell to the community to say, let's pay 100% for the extra space for programming to tuition in, which may or may not ultimately get us where we need to go.

210
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:04,677
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was the conversation that we had, certainly.

211
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:12,283
[SPEAKER_10]: That is just like one point of view, but that was sort of where we landed as we put this together.

212
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions, comments, concerns?

213
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:20,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Maria?

214
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure how accurate this is supposed to be, where the library is concerned.

215
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:30,848
[SPEAKER_14]: It does just say that a library would... Oh, hold your thoughts just one second.

216
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,146
[SPEAKER_10]: The further this is the chapter seventy four form.

217
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:35,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

218
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:35,907
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, you're fine.

219
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,068
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get we'll get to you in just one second.

220
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,171
[SPEAKER_10]: So, are there any other chapter seventy four questions?

221
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought a lot of the connection.

222
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Miles is on the way.

223
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:59,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for a short period of time.

224
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so there's a motion on the floor to approve this document by Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

225
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Member Olapade.

226
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you just remember everybody's names?

227
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:21,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I could almost do it, but I wrote in my brand new notebook in the front, so I remember you all.

228
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,535
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, Jenny Graham, yes.

229
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary Lungo-Koehn, yes.

230
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, yes.

231
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:28,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Galussi, absent.

232
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:30,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Right behind you.

233
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:31,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Galussi.

234
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Just say yes.

235
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:34,399
[SPEAKER_09]: On the most that you can prove the chapter 74 form.

236
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Just say yes.

237
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:35,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

238
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing.

239
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

240
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Marta Cabral.

241
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:40,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

242
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:42,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Libby Brown.

243
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:43,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

244
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Maria Dorsey.

245
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:46,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

246
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Brian Hilliard.

247
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:47,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

248
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy Keene.

249
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:49,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

250
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:50,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily Lazzaro.

251
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:50,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

252
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:52,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Nicole Morell.

253
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:52,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

254
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:53,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Erin Olapade.

255
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:53,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

256
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Luke Kreitner.

257
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

258
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,873
[SPEAKER_10]: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

259
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,354
[SPEAKER_10]: The form is approved.

260
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:04,999
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, Karen.

261
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will submit that.

262
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:17,583
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be the third of five deliverables that we are on the hook for to be on our way out of this eligibility phase.

263
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,845
[SPEAKER_10]: So excellent work.

264
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:20,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, everyone.

265
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:30,592
[SPEAKER_10]: The other document that you have in front of you is item number five on the agenda, which is the educational profile.

266
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take a few minutes and just walk through this.

267
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:38,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's probably a lot of questions and this is still very much a work in progress.

268
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:45,052
[SPEAKER_10]: We are aiming to get this updated and completed as quickly as possible.

269
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:50,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping by next week, we'll have something that's pretty darn close for you all to approve.

270
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:53,200
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me walk you through what's here.

271
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe we can take questions like section by section.

272
00:22:56,813 --> 00:23:02,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So section one talks about district-wide facilities as they exist right now.

273
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:05,961
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is to say, this is what is in the building right now.

274
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:12,526
[SPEAKER_10]: The chart that you see was widely pre-populated by MSBA.

275
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:18,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're trying to get a view of the whole entire district and the square footage space.

276
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:24,176
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to make some updates and some adjustments, particularly to the square footage that they had on file.

277
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So those have been updated.

278
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:32,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Item B is a description of how students progress.

279
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, are there questions about?

280
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:37,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's fine.

281
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the science lab count?

282
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:46,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an addition, reno, or is that column last passed?

283
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,557
[SPEAKER_09]: We should actually, that's a good call.

284
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put the science labs in that field.

285
00:23:58,801 --> 00:23:59,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I can add that.

286
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:01,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Next one down.

287
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:02,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

288
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,826
[SPEAKER_03]: What is VNAHS?

289
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it their form of the pre-populated?

290
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

291
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

292
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm guessing it's, yeah, the vocational piece.

293
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:14,534
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

294
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:21,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it an agricultural school at any time?

295
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:25,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I can ask and we can clear that up.

296
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:44,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the 330 plus the 845.

297
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,213
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so everyone's aware, these were pre-populated by them.

298
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:08,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I did update, after reaching out to the architects of the five newer schools, those numbers to be in line with what those architects said.

299
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:14,120
[SPEAKER_00]: There were minor discrepancies up to about 10,000 square feet.

300
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:19,343
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so we can double check the square footage of Medford High and the vocational school.

301
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Question B really talks about how students move through the district.

302
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:34,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So this talks about, you know, they're wanting to know things like, is it a lottery?

303
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a neighborhood school?

304
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,272
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you move from fifth to sixth?

305
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:46,114
[SPEAKER_10]: So this narrative talks about our four elementary schools, you know, how many schools we have.

306
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:50,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And it talks about the transitions from five to six being a lottery for the two middle schools.

307
00:25:52,109 --> 00:26:08,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody comes to Medford High, and then it does talk a little bit about the Freshman Exploratory Program, as well as like how students pick into a CTE program if they're desired, and then it sort of references the wait list and references our Chapter 74 form.

308
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just really to give the folks that are trying to get a feel for our district, like how do students move about the district over time?

309
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:25,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a common linguistic term?

310
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:37,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very unique term from the public school day program.

311
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That's DESE's terminology.

312
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:39,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

313
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions about this section B?

314
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:53,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Section two, this is where you'll see sort of the, again, current state.

315
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:57,825
[SPEAKER_10]: How many classrooms are considered each of these things?

316
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:12,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you to Marta and her team, among others, who went through and counted all the spaces in the building to say, like, here are all the things that are happening in this building.

317
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:21,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We will do another review of this, but this is just to sort of tally up all of the spaces that exist in this building.

318
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:32,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in a related question, item B talks about like, how are these spaces currently used?

319
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:51,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is a narrative around, as the form requests, course spaces, specialized spaces, non-traditional spaces, and class policies, class five policies, all of which are requested in the question and the form.

320
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny, I have a question about special spaces.

321
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:55,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

322
00:27:56,183 --> 00:28:01,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I know that it's amazing how accommodating it starts.

323
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not listed as a specialized space.

324
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:10,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the theater, which is south of 400.

325
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:15,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But that might be the largest space, I guess.

326
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yep, we can add that.

327
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:29,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Maria?

328
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:31,504
[SPEAKER_14]: The medium of the library?

329
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:32,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

330
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:38,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So this only lists the library and the CCS library, but there are multiple spaces in the library.

331
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:38,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

332
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:43,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Classrooms, labs, major space, does that need to all be there?

333
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:45,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes it does.

334
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:51,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So can I send this to you and have you make some edits to it and send it back to us?

335
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:52,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

336
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:54,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Maria.

337
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:04,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions about the information in item B?

338
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:12,509
[SPEAKER_10]: We also talk a little bit on the top of page seven about

339
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:24,940
[SPEAKER_10]: some of the rentals that happen with our community partners, as well as the central office being housed here, and all of the administrative offices.

340
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:33,428
[SPEAKER_10]: The administrative offices, I believe, are another thing where they're not considered part of the school from a reimbursement perspective, but

341
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:40,432
[SPEAKER_10]: There obviously has to be an administrative space available to operate the school.

342
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:53,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, there's any number of questions about how that could happen in our new reconfigured space, whether they stay where they are, or they perhaps move to the Curtis Tufts.

343
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,422
[SPEAKER_10]: because we want to co-locate the Curtis Tufts program on this campus.

344
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:00,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's any number of things that the feasibility study will look at.

345
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:06,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the important thing for us is just to say, yes, the administrative offices are housed in this building.

346
00:30:06,248 --> 00:30:08,350
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the end of all of this, they need a home.

347
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions about B?

348
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:20,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Item C, again, current state.

349
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,020
[SPEAKER_10]: What is our current,

350
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,262
[SPEAKER_10]: teaching methodology, class size policies, et cetera.

351
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:29,464
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a description.

352
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:48,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to the administrative team who has taken a lot of time to try to be complete and comprehensive about both the teaching methodology and some of the specialized programming we have within the building, including the TLP program, the transitions program.

353
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,971
[SPEAKER_10]: our English learners, et cetera.

354
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:57,011
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have some conversation about technology in this section.

355
00:30:57,031 --> 00:31:05,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some of the things that are quite limiting around reliable connectivity, access to the internet, et cetera, at the bottom.

356
00:31:05,673 --> 00:31:09,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions about this so far?

357
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:18,456
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

358
00:31:20,274 --> 00:31:26,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Section three is about what are we proposing?

359
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,646
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it that we want to see in this building?

360
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I did have a conversation with our MSBA contact today and

361
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:58,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I did ask some questions about what sort of the finality of what is in this document and she assured me that this is like a jumping off point so that MSBA can get a feel for the kind of building we're envisioning and that whoever we ultimately bring on as an owners project manager or to do a feasibility study can start to learn about us through these documents that we've had to create.

362
00:31:59,847 --> 00:32:06,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason I was asking is because I did have a chance to go to Arlington and perhaps sometime this summer we'll try to schedule another tour with them.

363
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:24,672
[SPEAKER_10]: There were spaces in the high school that like if you asked us to fill out a document today to say what should be in this high school, like we couldn't envision that space because it's just not something any of us have ever like seen or considered as an option because it doesn't exist here.

364
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:27,112
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to make sure that

365
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:34,029
[SPEAKER_10]: What we put here doesn't limit the thinking of the people who are coming in who build school buildings for a living.

366
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and they assured me that no, this is a jumping off point very much.

367
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:42,797
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to know sort of where our head is at and what they're thinking about.

368
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:51,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we're thinking about, but also that all of that visioning will happen, led by the folks doing the feasibility study.

369
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:54,386
[SPEAKER_10]: So those designers will really sort of lead that charge.

370
00:32:55,648 --> 00:33:01,315
[SPEAKER_10]: The other conversation that I had today was with our 1 of our Medford high school nurses.

371
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:17,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And our district physician, and they reached out knowing that we were sort of in this pipeline and process to ask about whether we should be trying to provide space for in school health clinic.

372
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:36,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dr. Sabia talked about some of the programs that he is part of in Malden, in Everett, and in Revere, where they partner with Cambridge Health Alliance and they provide health services here that are over and above what happens in a nurse's office.

373
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:45,296
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they had some particular information and insights about the kind of space that they would need to be able to hold such a facility.

374
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:52,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Most often those programs start out as grant funded by the Department of Public Health, which sounds amazing.

375
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they just wanted to say like,

376
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, like, we just want to make sure, you know, that we're here and we're thinking about these things.

377
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:08,877
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something that I told her, like, we needed to, like, connect back with the district administration and talk about that and figure out, like, if and how it should go on this form.

378
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:12,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But you could you should maybe expect to see some change there on the form in the next.

379
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:21,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had like a 30 minute conversation with them and my wheels were turning and I was like, this is the time to say we're envisioning something like that as a possibility.

380
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,392
[SPEAKER_10]: We certainly want to study how to have and provide that kind of space.

381
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Questions about that, Luke?

382
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

383
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:36,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions about?

384
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:48,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just pointing out that, additionally, due to the structure and age of the building limits for occupancy.

385
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:49,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

386
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:56,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

387
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Luke, did you have a question?

388
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so maybe just sort of to keep as possible the key aspect of this.

389
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:11,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It is focused almost entirely on security reasons.

390
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:22,071
[SPEAKER_05]: and it does not seem, perhaps I missed that, any consideration of the environment, the natural environment that surrounds the school, right?

391
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:26,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you drop a school in the middle of the city, your surrounding environment looks a certain way.

392
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:30,235
[SPEAKER_05]: If you drop it on the edge of the fells, it looks different.

393
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:36,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly there's athletic fields that should have some aspect, some portion of the property.

394
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:40,219
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be a desire to have outdoor eating spaces

395
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:45,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't seem like any of that was written about.

396
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps this is a document for that.

397
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:50,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is, actually.

398
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, I think that's a great suggestion.

399
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,570
[SPEAKER_10]: We can add all of that in.

400
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:58,994
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if any of you

401
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:04,789
[SPEAKER_10]: The McGlynn Playground project is under construction right now.

402
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:11,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And it actually is an amazing use of outdoor space, and particularly for outdoor classrooms, et cetera.

403
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,451
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep your eyes on that project.

404
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be done sometime this summer, hopefully before school starts.

405
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is really stunning.

406
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And the outside space is very, very amazing.

407
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:28,410
[SPEAKER_10]: be thinking about that, too.

408
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:34,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And at one point, if I remember, we went after a big grant.

409
00:36:35,753 --> 00:36:39,435
[SPEAKER_10]: This was years ago, because it was before Chad's time.

410
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:42,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne was at the Brooks.

411
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:43,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan, you were here.

412
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:50,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And the entire grant was written to become a very Fells-centric

413
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:56,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Educational program, does that ring a bell to you all here?

414
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,238
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a high school grant.

415
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:06,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was through Bloomberg foundations, or it was some big, big, big brand where it, like, it would have re envision this building and it was.

416
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:08,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Architected by Heidi and.

417
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:18,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget, Edward, no, Perrella, thank you, Mr. Perrella.

418
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:30,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And they submitted this very significant grant that had a lot to do with sort of being anchored to the fells as like a central like teaching point.

419
00:37:30,828 --> 00:37:34,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that ring any bells to anybody who's been around for a long time?

420
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to the structure, but I know that there was work done to create like

421
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:47,418
[SPEAKER_11]: trails within the fells and to create some outdoor space within the fells, but I don't know.

422
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:50,319
[SPEAKER_10]: This was just a grant application like we didn't get it.

423
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,261
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a grant application and we didn't get the grants, but there was something submitted.

424
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:07,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just I wonder if there is something in there if we can locate it that would be worth.

425
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:13,504
[SPEAKER_10]: thinking about in terms of inclusion from an outdoor space perspective.

426
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:26,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if I remember correctly, the whole entire genesis of the program they were proposing had to do with being very anchored to the fact that the fell sat right here.

427
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:28,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Nicole?

428
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

429
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:30,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

430
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:31,418
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go first.

431
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:33,820
[SPEAKER_13]: You changed that thread.

432
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the building itself, I guess, or the design, it's going to be

433
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:40,299
[SPEAKER_13]: sustainable, resilient, blah, blah, blah.

434
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:50,368
[SPEAKER_13]: How much of the outdoor space do we have to come up with and ask for as far as like resiliency and mitigation, or is that being tangible?

435
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:56,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it can't hurt for us to describe our intentions, right?

436
00:38:56,233 --> 00:39:01,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that we, you know, that we do have climate concerns on this,

437
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,632
[SPEAKER_10]: on this physical site, right?

438
00:39:04,672 --> 00:39:09,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we have had issues because we sit right by the belt and every now and again the water pours in.

439
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:18,806
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think to your point and to Luke's point, like we certainly need to make some space in this document to talk about the fields that are up high.

440
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,669
[SPEAKER_10]: They are at their end of life.

441
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:25,032
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like more rubber than grass at this point.

442
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:28,295
[SPEAKER_10]: So those fields need to be taken care of.

443
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:32,999
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a football practice field that's very much in disrepair.

444
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:39,905
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another practice field up there that I'm sure somebody will tell me has a name and I don't know what it is.

445
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:45,530
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are all these other little things all over the campus.

446
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if we were dreaming really big,

447
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:54,190
[SPEAKER_10]: you wouldn't have to go across town to get to the football stadium.

448
00:39:54,230 --> 00:40:00,736
[SPEAKER_10]: You wouldn't have to go somewhere else to get to a softball field or a baseball field or a track, right?

449
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:15,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe some sort of, like, maybe we can add something that talks about, like, a more cohesive vision for, like, our athletics properties as part of this project that service the students here.

450
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:16,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul?

451
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:19,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, I feel like

452
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:30,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if it was the Oklahoma school that we saw the video for, some of us saw, but I've been to Arlington.

453
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:38,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive by Watertown's high school being built right now, and I drove by Winchester's when they were being built.

454
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:45,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these schools seem to have something in common, that school is the walls,

455
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no integration in nature at all.

456
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:57,596
[SPEAKER_04]: We have probably more than most of those places because we have those corridors.

457
00:40:58,317 --> 00:41:15,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just feel like while intentional spaces for the classroom really do seem important, I just feel like students should walk through the doors of a school building and then get completely encapsulated and start to walk out the doors.

458
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:23,318
[SPEAKER_04]: The climate's getting hotter, but there's no integration with nature at all.

459
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:31,903
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no intention that the students are in and out of the building in any way in any of those schools that I described.

460
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:36,506
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very much in the clinical field.

461
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:38,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if we have any good examples.

462
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:59,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally when high school was open, open campus, open, you know, I don't know how to... I think there's a lot of security concerns now.

463
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

464
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:03,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we were going to have an orchard.

465
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Shooters behind trees.

466
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:07,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to build a facility that's present?

467
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,410
[SPEAKER_04]: share it and say, are we going to build a place?

468
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,451
[SPEAKER_09]: We already have that.

469
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:17,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

470
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:19,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been called a discussion.

471
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:19,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

472
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:27,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this could be an opportunity to perhaps establish finding at least exterior character for the school.

473
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:27,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.

474
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:28,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You had me about the fowls.

475
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:29,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

476
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:31,204
[SPEAKER_05]: We're surrounded by natural beauty.

477
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:38,770
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a rare sort of promontory where you can see downtown from bedroom.

478
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

479
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,511
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of special.

480
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:41,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare.

481
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:52,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville's Healy Middle School has it, and granted, they're not surrounded by nature, but they really did a wonderful job in making that front and center.

482
00:42:52,274 --> 00:42:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have a school, you could do something like that too.

483
00:42:55,876 --> 00:43:03,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Our surroundings could be a sort of defining aspect of at least the exterior of the school's care.

484
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:04,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

485
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:05,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily?

486
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a comment sort of similar to

487
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:17,294
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about the possibility of greater openness and leaning into the assets of the school.

488
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:28,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Something I'd like to mention that we could maybe integrate into section four if we're, I don't know if we're here yet, but community engagement.

489
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,503
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not quite there.

490
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:31,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to wait?

491
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:31,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

492
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:35,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter?

493
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:48,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenfield Community College has a unique outdoor leadership program where students can earn an associate's degree in orienteering, canoeing, hiking, and being leaders of those types of things.

494
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:57,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Those programs really dovetail well with environmental science classes, and your imagination can run wild.

495
00:43:58,092 --> 00:44:03,073
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning ropes, all these types of things that I think would dovetail nicely.

496
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:30,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an opportunity for us to talk with Bunker Hill Community College as we look at our pathways for dual enrollment and other things along those lines to see if that would be a partnership that they would be interested in forging over the next couple of years because it is only in Greenfield and I think that type of a program here would offer a tremendous draw

497
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:38,472
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would be a great opportunity for our students here and as well as that connection with Ontario.

498
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:57,920
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I've heard like a million good ideas so far and I'm wondering if there are any volunteers who might take a shot at like a paragraph or some sort of narrative about any of the topics that we've talked about so far to sort of help

499
00:44:59,037 --> 00:45:25,898
[SPEAKER_10]: make light work of what is like otherwise a really heavy lift for the administration at this time of year when graduation is tomorrow and all the other things are happening before between now and the end of the year so is there i will see if i can't talk to some folks who might know where that grant application is and and you guys can go um in the can hop in howard's way back machine and um

500
00:45:27,223 --> 00:45:30,746
[SPEAKER_10]: get in the time machine and see what you can come up with from that perspective.

501
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:34,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know that at the time I was like, wow, this is so amazing.

502
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just really well done.

503
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:42,778
[SPEAKER_10]: So there just might be something there that helps sort of draw that like anchoring to the outside space.

504
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,442
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll take a look for that to see if there isn't something that we can pull in and integrate.

505
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:47,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy?

506
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:57,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Ginny, you've said that the Finance Committee talked about other locations, and it seems based on what Luke is talking about, it's this space.

507
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:09,145
[SPEAKER_15]: But when we talk about these other spaces that are, what Alisha's talked about, are we envisioning that in those spaces?

508
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:17,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Can this, what Luke is referencing, the green and the courtyards, are those also ideal in that situation where

509
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:29,258
[SPEAKER_15]: we get so fixated on this space, and then find out this is not a feasible space because of what about a lot, and even to an urban space, and you find out.

510
00:46:29,478 --> 00:46:32,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Your concept changes and goes back to what Paul was saying.

511
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:40,505
[SPEAKER_15]: These other schools are almost feeling downtown, that we are limited to our broader thinking.

512
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:45,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess my thought is there's a way for us in this document to say,

513
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:48,679
[SPEAKER_10]: We are not tied to this location.

514
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:54,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have identified others that potentially are worthy of discussion.

515
00:46:54,681 --> 00:47:02,403
[SPEAKER_10]: But as it relates to this location, here are some things that we would think are important if we are planning to stay here.

516
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:06,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's perfectly rational and reasonable.

517
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:25,715
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there is somebody who would like to take a crack at like the athletic spaces or the outdoor classroom spaces or the sort of anchoring to the bells, like if anyone wants to just take a shot at writing a paragraph or something and sending it to me, like I'm happy to do the integration if there are any volunteers.

518
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:28,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to write something.

519
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:34,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a particular topic Libby?

520
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:44,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a good point that whether we're on this site or any other site that the integration of nature or access to views and connection to the exterior is important.

521
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:48,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be a civil engineer and a landscape architect on the design team.

522
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to acknowledge the work that they would be doing.

523
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be happy to write.

524
00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:01,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the athletic fields, I don't know as much about specifically, but I could mention that prioritizing them being close by and refurbished is important.

525
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:03,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

526
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:03,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

527
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to write about athletic fields, integrated design concept that amplifies the superheated environment.

528
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:14,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

529
00:48:18,448 --> 00:48:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what your conversation is about.

530
00:48:39,435 --> 00:48:48,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, in all reality, I mean, a horticulture program using shipping container growing is being done at other schools.

531
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so we didn't present horticulture at the school committee.

532
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I mean, I think there's a piece of that science to provide.

533
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:57,445
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, sure.

534
00:48:57,525 --> 00:48:57,625
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

535
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:26,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Tracy, the other thing that I'm thinking about is the very active conversation about the arts that we are having in the community at this very moment, and wondering if there isn't something that we should be adding about how we're envisioning the artistic spaces, and if you might think about writing something about that.

536
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody else?

537
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:32,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Maria?

538
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:36,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to circle back to when you were talking about health care.

539
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: You brought up Papers to Health Alliance as possibly being a partner and needing space.

540
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:48,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that we are also contracting with Elliot Services for mental health and counseling.

541
00:49:48,877 --> 00:49:49,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Would they also?

542
00:49:50,178 --> 00:49:53,700
[SPEAKER_10]: That came up as well, is like having space for that as well.

543
00:49:55,153 --> 00:49:58,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was like a really exciting conversation.

544
00:49:58,574 --> 00:50:00,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, what about all the other schools?

545
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:03,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, slow down.

546
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:06,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

547
00:50:06,777 --> 00:50:14,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So Maria, I think the other space that like could require or like do with a little bit of love would be the library space.

548
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you take a crack at that?

549
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:17,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

550
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:32,377
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing too is a few years ago during COVID, an organization out of Boston Architectural College called the TIDAVAL, Trauma Informed Design Evaluation.

551
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:39,184
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed a tool to really evaluate schools, and this group is doing a lot of work with the Uvalde School District.

552
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:49,718
[SPEAKER_00]: to really work on that school district and to really understand space and how a space may impact students' trauma.

553
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,421
[SPEAKER_00]: I think throughout this process, it's a Boston-based group.

554
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:58,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be wise for us to at least reach out and see.

555
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:04,868
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an analysis of the Andrews School as part of their developing the tool itself.

556
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:16,380
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing, Lori, that's going to need to be sort of flushed in here is some conversation about the co-location of Curtis Tufts.

557
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So we might do with a paragraph from you about that vision, if you could work on that.

558
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:23,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan?

559
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:23,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, OK.

560
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:23,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

561
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:26,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you saying in terms of space or velocity?

562
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:26,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Both.

563
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:26,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Both.

564
00:51:26,805 --> 00:51:26,885
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

565
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:40,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions about this section so far?

566
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:42,382
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got 10 minutes to go.

567
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:45,844
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

568
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:46,965
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great question.

569
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:51,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're scheduled to meet next Wednesday, June 12.

570
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Tuesday?

571
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:54,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesday.

572
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Wednesday.

573
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:55,851
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

574
00:51:56,731 --> 00:52:03,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you all could, by any means, get it to me by Friday, I can then do some integrating.

575
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:06,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can't, it's OK.

576
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:08,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it to me when you can.

577
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:12,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, yeah.

578
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Midnight Friday.

579
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna I'll work on it over the weekend.

580
00:52:17,728 --> 00:52:17,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

581
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:21,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Item C is.

582
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Still a work in progress.

583
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:33,888
[SPEAKER_10]: The administrative team has some work to do to be able to describe that piece of it so that there's nothing for you all to review there.

584
00:52:33,908 --> 00:52:46,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And then section four is about community engagement and it talks about some of the community engagement we have already done about Curtis Tufts and whether to co-locate that.

585
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:57,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It also talks about some of the communications and community engagement subcommittee work in terms of how we plan to engage the community in this project.

586
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:02,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And it closes by saying that, certainly, we will need a debt exclusion to fully fund this project.

587
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:08,332
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think Maria had some questions about this, right, this section for community engagement?

588
00:53:10,534 --> 00:53:11,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Emily?

589
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:11,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

590
00:53:11,794 --> 00:53:12,615
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

591
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:14,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily, sorry.

592
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:30,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so what triggered my thoughts on this was what somebody said about what John was saying about the idea of the school being kind of an open campus.

593
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:43,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that I would like to see something in this section that's a little bit about the idea of the space being also kind of a community hub outside of just the high schoolers.

594
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:57,388
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of community things that happen here, the community schools, the pool, the micro-family network, a lot of things happen here.

595
00:53:57,988 --> 00:54:04,071
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, and I obviously, and unfortunately for myself, volunteering too, right?

596
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:05,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you are.

597
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:10,595
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd be happy to put that in and integrate a little bit.

598
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:11,736
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be great.

599
00:54:11,836 --> 00:54:12,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

600
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:16,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think that we have so much space here.

601
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:43,970
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that in the early days of this building, there were more students, and now there are fewer, but that if we do end up changing locations and having a smaller building, that we sacrifice one of the perks of this large space, which is that there are a lot of opportunities to use it for a lot of different community, a lot of potential for community good.

602
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,891
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something I'd like to highlight.

603
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:49,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is doing that now, and it can continue to do it, and it can do even more.

604
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:50,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

605
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:51,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul?

606
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:55,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for bringing that up.

607
00:54:55,755 --> 00:55:02,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where it's at best, but it's really a design phase kind of a thing.

608
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:11,219
[SPEAKER_04]: But Medford does lack a lot of community spaces, and we're not going to be buying up any of them.

609
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about how we segregate portions of this building,

610
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:19,209
[SPEAKER_04]: many different segments, even at a time.

611
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:27,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, those girls got here, and we find a place to put our group, but you can't do it at home.

612
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:31,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's just one.

613
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:37,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm sure that the library is book solid.

614
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can turn this into, you know, that open campus idea.

615
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:45,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know much about it, because it's a lot.

616
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:59,042
[SPEAKER_04]: for education, community education, that probably does not get this so important.

617
00:56:17,852 --> 00:56:21,294
No, it was at a middle school, but that's how they used their spaces.

618
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:26,676
[SPEAKER_12]: It was in a science lab, but that's one of the things they do there.

619
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:34,119
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a lot of potential, and really just in a city council path.

620
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:39,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a revenue generator to have more of these programs to bring in funds to the city.

621
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:42,943
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are all good things for us.

622
00:56:43,543 --> 00:56:43,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

623
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:46,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, did you have your hand in the air?

624
00:56:46,304 --> 00:56:46,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly.

625
00:56:48,123 --> 00:57:00,892
[SPEAKER_02]: She thought maybe to add the after-school programming piece of the community, it doesn't have to be a full paragraph, but somewhere, state, Alina, how desperately we are in need of space.

626
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:01,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

627
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:04,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Devils and space and stuff.

628
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:06,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

629
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:22,195
[SPEAKER_05]: that the answer is given.

630
00:57:22,715 --> 00:57:24,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little confusing.

631
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,176
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, it seems like you're answering the question.

632
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not until you get to the third paragraph that you answer it.

633
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's a place for it in the Curtis-Thompson Peaceful, but I think it follows the more direct, the establishment of the communication.

634
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:48,583
[SPEAKER_05]: In the adjudicating subcommittees,

635
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:55,612
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of grammar there, but for indication of fraud, that's an answer to the question.

636
00:57:55,652 --> 00:58:03,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first point of feedback is the sequence of information is not a sequence.

637
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But it can be re-sequenced to make sense.

638
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:12,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second part is the stakeholders aren't really identified.

639
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:14,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But Emily sort of touches on it.

640
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:17,311
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of external organizations

641
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:26,944
[SPEAKER_05]: The residents are one stakeholder group, but a Japanese school that comes on Saturdays is another large stakeholder group.

642
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The lacrosse league that runs the field during the spring and fall, that's another stakeholder group.

643
00:58:32,988 --> 00:58:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of these stakeholder groups.

644
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:45,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can necessarily list them all out, but you should identify that there are non-resident strong stakeholders that we would have to communicate with and engage with.

645
00:58:48,201 --> 00:58:48,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other reasons?

646
00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:51,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think one knows something's happened.

647
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:52,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

648
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:53,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's missing.

649
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:56,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are the two items.

650
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:58,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

651
00:58:59,468 --> 00:58:59,828
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

652
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to play this on the table.

653
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, this is just a draft review.

654
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:08,854
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we're on it.

655
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:08,914
[SPEAKER_16]: So

656
00:59:11,313 --> 00:59:18,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so everybody who has been found told to write something, please go ahead and send that to me.

657
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:26,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I will do the integration of that information and then we will take another look at it next Wednesday and we'll decide.

658
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:26,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we like.

659
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:28,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Feeling good about it.

660
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:29,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we need more time?

661
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:35,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, how do we, you know, how do we sort of balance, you know, speed and completeness?

662
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:38,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, that's always sort of the challenge, but.

663
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:41,575
[SPEAKER_10]: We're we're on a good track and.

664
00:59:43,605 --> 00:59:45,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I think all the feedback today was really great.

665
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:50,230
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you all for, thank you for your feedback and your input.

666
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:59,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Next time we'll review this document and hopefully we'll take a first, maybe last look at the maintenance submission that has to go in.

667
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:06,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, doesn't require this committee's review, but I think it's important that you all know what those questions and answers are.

668
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:13,908
[SPEAKER_10]: we'll see how far we can get in the drafting of those answers and then look at that as well.

669
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:20,570
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing I wanted to do before everyone leaves, sorry, where's my schedule?

670
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:32,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We have scheduled, still we have a meeting on the 12th.

671
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we had a subcommittee meeting that was a TBD on the 20th.

672
01:00:40,715 --> 01:00:45,197
[SPEAKER_10]: We then decided we would use that for the communications and community engagement subcommittee.

673
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:52,660
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I have a date with my 11-year-old nephews to take them to see the Michael Jackson musical that evening, so I cannot attend.

674
01:00:56,901 --> 01:01:01,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, all 5th grade boys go through that phase and we are there.

675
01:01:01,663 --> 01:01:05,044
[SPEAKER_10]: So I need to move that that meeting time.

676
01:01:05,124 --> 01:01:10,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will reach out to the communication subcommittee and we'll find another time where we can have another meeting.

677
01:01:11,487 --> 01:01:13,648
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 2 meetings on the books.

678
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:18,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It won in July, won in August.

679
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:20,979
[SPEAKER_10]: We may or may not need those.

680
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can use those as like a tour date to go see Arlington or something like that.

681
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:38,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we, depending on how far we are able to get through the other documents, like we may do a Zoom only meeting at some point before the end of June to finish our deliverables.

682
01:01:39,344 --> 01:01:45,265
[SPEAKER_10]: The last deliverable is actually not an action for this group to take, but it's a vote for the city council to take.

683
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:48,827
[SPEAKER_10]: to authorize the funding for the feasibility study.

684
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:50,287
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor and I are working on that.

685
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:57,811
[SPEAKER_10]: MSBA is reviewing the proposed language that will go up on the council agenda probably the week of the 25th, but that

686
01:02:00,775 --> 01:02:02,716
[SPEAKER_10]: but we'll keep you all posted on when that is.

687
01:02:02,776 --> 01:02:10,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a really, the MSBA has to approve the language, the City Council has to vote it very specifically, but we're all on track for that.

688
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:22,169
[SPEAKER_10]: So the last piece of what we have to do in eligibility is information that we'll work with Director Hunt's office around community growth projections.

689
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:23,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are working on that.

690
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:27,213
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's an enrollment piece on the school side and then there's a city piece

691
01:02:28,014 --> 01:02:39,287
[SPEAKER_10]: That has to get submitted so I am actively working with director hunt on that and hopefully we'll be able to get all that stuff like organized and and got and put into the system in short order.

692
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:40,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're on track.

693
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

694
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:43,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

695
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:47,230
[SPEAKER_10]: That is everything that I have for all of you.

696
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a note to say, like, bear with us as we get through the rest of the scheduling of all of this.

697
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:56,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I think we're at the end of our agenda.

698
01:02:57,516 --> 01:02:59,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next meeting is on June 12th.

699
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:07,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my goal is to set our calendar for the fall once the school committee calendar is set.

700
01:03:07,877 --> 01:03:11,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll do that and then we'll set this calendar so you all can put it in your calendars.

701
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

702
01:03:14,321 --> 01:03:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn.

703
01:03:15,402 --> 01:03:16,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn by Luke.

704
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:18,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Tracy.

705
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:21,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, roll calls.

706
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:23,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny Graham, yes.

707
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:24,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary Lungo-Koehn, yes.

708
01:03:24,949 --> 01:03:26,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, yes.

709
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:27,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Galussi, yes.

710
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:28,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Cushing, yes.

711
01:03:28,773 --> 01:03:30,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Marta Cabral, yes.

712
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:32,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Libby Brown, yes.

713
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa Desmond.

714
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:35,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she left.

715
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:38,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

716
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:39,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Maria Dorsey, yes.

717
