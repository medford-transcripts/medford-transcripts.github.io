7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

40
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:34,927
Vice President Knight.

41
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:41,497
Mr. President, I believe there's a resolution to be ready for the record.

42
00:02:41,517 --> 00:03:00,074
21187 offered by Vice President Knight, whereas Governor Baker has declared March 21st or April 30th, 2021 motorcycle awareness period, and whereas the city of Bedford has over 900 motorcycles registered in the city, and whereas motorcycle crash fatalities in the Commonwealth have increased,

43
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:21,652
in each of the past three years, and whereas the city of Memphis was the site of a motorcycle crash fatality in 2020, be it resolved at the request of the Memphis City Council and on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association and the Memphis Motorcycle Community that the mayor of the city of Memphis issue the following proclamation.

44
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:30,128
A proclamation naming March 21 through April 30th motorcycle awareness period in the city of Medford.

45
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:36,111
Whereas the motorcycle is a popular means of transportation for commuting as well as touring and recreation.

46
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:48,818
Whereas there was a growing need for cooperation among drivers of automobiles and trucks, motorcycles and bicycles and pedestrians who use our streets and the highways to reduce injuries and fatality.

47
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,519
And whereas,

48
00:03:51,782 --> 00:04:00,070
Whereas, it is critical for all Massachusetts citizens to increase their knowledge of the rules of the road and the rights and the responsibility of roadway use.

49
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,894
And whereas, the numerous organizations that are committed to making our streets

50
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:26,608
and highways safe for all motor vehicle related transportation, including the Highway Safety Division of the Massachusetts Rider Education Program, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, the American Motorcycle Association, Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association, the Metro Malden Elk Riders, and many other motorcycle businesses and clubs in the Commonwealth.

51
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,309
Now, I hereby, I,

52
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:42,373
Honorable Mayor, Brianna Longo Kern, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim March 21 to April 30th to be Motorcycle Awareness Period.

53
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:43,594
Vice President Knight.

54
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,796
Mr. President, thank you very much.

55
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:50,480
This resolution has been put on the agenda on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association.

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,166
The Massachusetts Motorcycle Association is the premier organization that lobbies for motorcycle safety.

57
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:57,887
Many of us

58
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,150
around town will see the signs on their coordinated campaigns across the state.

59
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,951
Motorcycles are everywhere.

60
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,032
Big yellow signs with black writing.

61
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,934
I think look twice and save lives.

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:14,218
Mr. President, the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association has been at the forefront of motorcycle safety initiatives for as long as I can remember.

63
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:24,165
Tonight we have with us Mr. Paul Cote from the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association, who I met some 15 years ago while he was lobbying up the statehouse for motorcycle safety initiatives.

64
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:33,249
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm offering this resolution on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association and the motorcycle community here in the city of Medford to promote safety.

65
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:39,212
It's an unfortunate and tragic fact that Medford was the site of a motorcycle fatality last year.

66
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,792
A Malden resident was killed in an accident.

67
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:49,076
And it's initiatives like this that help us bring awareness to the safety on the roadways and what's necessary and to be sure that we share them with the motorcycles, Mr. President.

68
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,638
So with that being said, I'd like to ask Mr. Cote.

69
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,739
We do have a couple of councils with the hands up.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,220
Excellent.

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,981
Thank you.

72
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:56,982
Councilor Morocco.

73
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:58,863
Thank you, Mr. President.

74
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:04,828
I would love to hear from the people in attendance, but I do just want to know, I thank vice president Knight for bringing this forward.

75
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:13,174
My cousin Ashley, a few years back was actually riding on the back of her fiance's motorcycle and was clipped by a motorist on 93.

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:25,471
She almost died and after a lengthy recovery, she has a traumatic brain injury that she will live with for the rest of her life, simply because a negligent motorist nearly took her life.

77
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:31,858
So this is an important proclamation and I really thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

78
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:32,379
Thank you.

79
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:37,429
Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:53,773
I also wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward for the exact reason that Councilor Morrell just noted, which is I think many of us know friends or family members who have been injured because of negligent operation by motorists and not looking twice and seeing motorcyclists.

81
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:54,774
So thank you, Councilor Knight.

82
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,954
And I hope this proclamation is declared.

83
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:58,735
Thank you.

84
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,135
Councilor Scarpelli.

85
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,155
Thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,776
Thank you, Councilor and Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

87
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,393
I want to applaud Mr. Cote and Ms.

88
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:19,285
Lister for all the work that they've done to make sure this is in the forefront of our state, making sure that motorcycle safety is something that's not falling from the wayside.

89
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:25,332
God, I can remember Betsy riding her bike through Medford for

90
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:35,836
a long time now, and she was the first person that would hop off her bike and make sure that if people didn't follow the rules, make sure they got a lesson.

91
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,378
And that's a scary lesson to learn, let me tell you.

92
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,180
So I appreciate what you do do in keeping this going.

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,504
I think that it can't be forgotten because like Councilor Morrell said, I'm sorry, something personal happened to her life.

94
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:55,247
I think that when you think about it, we've all had someone affected.

95
00:07:55,834 --> 00:08:03,538
negatively because of negligent driving with motorcycles and not taking their safety as a priority.

96
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:08,881
So I thank Councilor Knight again for bringing this forward and I appreciate your effort, all your work.

97
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:09,161
Thank you.

98
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,001
Thank you.

99
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:10,782
Councilor Palacios.

100
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,302
Thank you, Mr. President.

101
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:15,024
And I also want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

102
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:23,648
I too, I actually, one of my probably earliest memories is losing my cousin to a motorcycle accident.

103
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:33,042
And it's something that's always, you know, affected me personally, that she lost her life in a motorcycle accident.

104
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:34,462
And it's something you never forget.

105
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:40,324
And Councilor Knight, I wanna thank you for bringing this forward and thank Ms.

106
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,485
Lister and Mr. Cote for raising awareness.

107
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,065
And, you know, we can't speak enough about this.

108
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,646
I appreciate you being here tonight.

109
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,506
Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward.

110
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:53,747
And I would second the motion, thank you.

111
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:54,578
Thank you.

112
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,180
Councilor Max.

113
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,422
Thank you, Mr. President.

114
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:03,206
And I want to thank again, Vice President Knight for putting this on.

115
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:10,472
You know, every year we try to raise motorcycle awareness in this community through a number of initiatives.

116
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:16,316
This is probably one of the most popular initiatives where we have the rally on Mystic Ave.

117
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:21,741
Hopefully we can get back to that, Mr. President, when this COVID bypasses us

118
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:31,564
However, Mr. President, I think it's important that we make this aware because many people think the streets are owned by cars.

119
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:39,129
And there are other vehicles, including motorcycles, bicycles, that are on the roadway as well.

120
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,412
And I think drivers have to be mindful that they don't own the streets.

121
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,374
They share them with other vehicles.

122
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,037
And it's important, Mr. President, that we spread that around.

123
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,058
It's also important as a community

124
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:57,966
that we create safe spaces for motorcycles as well, Mr. President.

125
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:03,630
Many communities have motorcycle parking spots, which I'm not aware of any in this community.

126
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:18,140
And these are the initiatives I think that will bring public awareness out there so people understand that there are other means of modes of transportation other than cars that are out there that are safe.

127
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,962
And, you know, in my opinion,

128
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:24,806
You know, I think motorcycle drivers get a bad rap.

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,528
You know, when I see motorcycle drivers, they're always paying attention to the road.

130
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,349
They're always using their singles.

131
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:35,071
They're always driving accordingly to the rules and regulations.

132
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:43,374
And I think it's only important, Mr. President, that we bring this awareness forward.

133
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:49,197
You know, riding a motorcycle, you know, two gallons of gas, three gallons of gas, you can go 50, 70, 80 miles.

134
00:10:51,257 --> 00:11:03,361
And, you know, in this time of trying to conserve and so forth, I think it's a mode of transportation that we really need to get out there, Mr. President, and support.

135
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,521
So, I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.

136
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:06,721
Thank you.

137
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:11,343
And myself, I want to thank Vice President Knight and Mr. Coté and Ms.

138
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,643
Lister for being here this evening.

139
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,784
Mostly, like I say, Council Member Marks made a point.

140
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:23,387
The roads are owned by everybody, not just cars, so we need to make sure that people pay attention when they drive.

141
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:29,932
As someone who drives for a living, I see the importance of safety on the road.

142
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:36,618
So, again, I want to thank Councillor Naik for bringing this forward, and we'll open discussion for public.

143
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,635
Mr. President, if you'll indulge me, I'm a firm believer that the city clerk should be seen at these meetings, but not heard.

144
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:52,301
But I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this resolution on and putting this proclamation on.

145
00:11:54,403 --> 00:12:00,468
Almost 41 years ago, not too far from here, I lost my own father in a motorcycle accident.

146
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:04,212
And it's something I think about every day.

147
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,194
It's something that's seared in my brain.

148
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:11,945
And there is no such thing as enough safety awareness around motorcycles.

149
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,066
And so from the bottom of my heart, thank you for putting this on tonight.

150
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,708
Thank you.

151
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,229
Do we have any discussion from the public?

152
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:21,669
Mr. Coté?

153
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,491
Good evening.

154
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,251
Name and address of the record, please.

155
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:31,213
Paul Coté, One Birchwood Point, Amesbury, Massachusetts.

156
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,996
Just first of all, thank you.

157
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,213
for your loss, the other councilors' loss, and your dad, Mr. Burke.

158
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:58,560
20 years ago, we started the Motorcycle Survivors Fund, bikers helping bikers, riders helping riders, where we do events to raise money to help families of riders killed or seriously injured in accidents, and to promote motorcycle safety and awareness.

159
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,641
Hopefully, we don't have to give anyway.

160
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,302
That would be the best thing.

161
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:05,164
But we know it's not a perfect world,

162
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,666
And it's not all road users.

163
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,427
It's not just motorcyclists.

164
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:15,169
It's, as you said, it's pedestrians, bicyclists.

165
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,292
With spring coming, you're going to be baby carriers and stuff out there.

166
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:21,833
So everybody should be aware.

167
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,094
And it takes three seconds to check twice.

168
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:31,598
And Betsy and I, Adam was there at the time at the State House with Charlie Shannon.

169
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,140
And we used to have to beg the governor at the time

170
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,249
to issue the proclamation.

171
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,870
And they would issue it, but then they wouldn't do anything with it.

172
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,933
So we had a bill passed.

173
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,114
Well, it was in OHAPA.

174
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:52,317
The rest of the country celebrates May as Motorcycle Safety Awareness Period.

175
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,999
May being an acronym for Motorcycle and You.

176
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,800
Motorcycles and You.

177
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:05,165
And geographically in the country, but the American Motorcycle Association, the weather is good.

178
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,121
all across the North, usually in May.

179
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:13,104
We looked at the 98, 99, and 2000 fatalities.

180
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:18,286
We found 27% happened in February, March, and April.

181
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,327
We said, why May?

182
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,549
Somebody smarter than us will come up with an acronym for March.

183
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,630
Took about 30 seconds.

184
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,773
Motorcycle awareness really can help, dot, dot, dot, save lives.

185
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,514
We believe it does.

186
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,863
Proclamation was changed, or the bill was changed.

187
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,665
It was enacted in June 4th, 2002.

188
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:44,328
So this is the 19th year, very much appreciated.

189
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:48,350
We try to go to cities and towns to get local government.

190
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,512
You have over 900 registered motorcycles in Manhattan.

191
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,155
They all got families, just like we all do.

192
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:00,317
And everybody that rides a motorcycle does something else.

193
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,683
Again, thank you very much.

194
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:03,363
Thank you very much.

195
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,604
Betsy was there throughout it all.

196
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:05,984
Awesome.

197
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:06,484
Thank you.

198
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:07,384
Thank you.

199
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:07,824
Good evening.

200
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,325
Name and address of the record, please.

201
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,405
Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street, Method Mass.

202
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:14,046
May I from here?

203
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:14,886
No.

204
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:15,986
Please keep your mask on.

205
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:16,486
I appreciate it.

206
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:24,728
So first of all, I feel horrible for all of you who have been affected by motorcycle accidents and fatalities.

207
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,769
I've had one or more myself.

208
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:35,382
that involved broken bones by the driver being respectful of my space.

209
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,767
I've been a proponent along with Paul for many, many years.

210
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:47,593
I did a video with Ben Abbott book and the Method Police back in the day.

211
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,716
I cannot remember the year right this minute.

212
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:58,320
but I believe it was played on local television about motorcycle safety, education, and awareness.

213
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:19,511
And just to let you know how hard we've been fighting throughout the Commonwealth for safety, as Paul was mentioning, when we first started this, the motorcycles were a two paragraph situation in the driver's manual.

214
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,526
and from Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

215
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:28,571
In the whole driver's manual, there was a whole two-paragraph section about motorcycles.

216
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:46,988
We got that changed, and I, along with our motorcycle rep, Gene Caribbean, of the Massachusetts Registry, rewrote the whole manual, and now motorcycles have their very own manual.

217
00:16:47,703 --> 00:17:03,309
Also, Paul and I have worked together to get motorcycle safety education and awareness involved in the safety, the driver class, the driver education class.

218
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:03,829
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,609
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

220
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,910
I'm usually very good speaker.

221
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:10,551
And so that got done.

222
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,592
It's a lot.

223
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,333
Mostly, usually it's the full month.

224
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:26,935
February, March through April, the whole month of March through April to August, but we'll take a week.

225
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,555
We'll take whatever we can get.

226
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,176
And I just want to thank you.

227
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:37,619
I'm also involved with the Crystal Chamberlain ride with Johnny Joyce.

228
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:45,422
And I'm the person who is the lead road captain and actually leads the rides and will give the safety talk to everybody.

229
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:52,175
So these are important matters and we love Method.

230
00:17:52,416 --> 00:18:00,321
We just adore Method and it would be so great, the idea of having motorcycle parking spaces is awesome.

231
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:07,286
Motorcyclists have money, just in case you didn't know, and they like to spend it in the community that welcomes them.

232
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:15,312
So just a little hint, if there was something like that happening at a place that would welcome us,

233
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,155
bring money to town.

234
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:24,598
Again, I want to thank you very much for this consideration, and we're not done.

235
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:30,060
We're going to keep on promoting motorcycle safety education and awareness for as long as we can.

236
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,981
Thank you all again for this opportunity.

237
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:32,601
Thank you very much.

238
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:37,223
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councillor Falco.

239
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,023
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

240
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:42,745
Councillor Bares.

241
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,425
Yes.

242
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:45,406
Councillor Falco.

243
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:45,866
Yes.

244
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:47,333
for that night.

245
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:48,754
Yes.

246
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,375
Yes.

247
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:50,956
Yes.

248
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,117
Yes.

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,718
Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

250
00:18:55,738 --> 00:19:03,723
Well, while we're on the special week, we can take Mariana O'Connor for her brief update on the on the vaccine area.

251
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,492
Hi, how are you?

252
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,474
Good to see you all.

253
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:24,979
So, um, are there any questions I could take up front, or do you want me to just go on a little update as we're at.

254
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,421
It's been some really.

255
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:30,884
Sorry, we thought they would be great.

256
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:47,612
Okay, so interestingly enough, in the last 10 minutes, I received an email from the state saying that tomorrow, they are gonna announce the schedule for all remaining groups in Massachusetts for the vaccine plan.

257
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:52,195
So that's news to me, and that just came out.

258
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:57,138
But again, at the same time, we're being told by the state that they are still getting

259
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:06,639
The same level of vaccine distribution from the feds, there has really been a very slight increase, if any.

260
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:13,681
They are expecting more within the next several weeks, and hopefully by April.

261
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:19,622
But still again, locals are not included in their plans at this point.

262
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:26,264
We've only gotten housing authority doses that we were able to distribute last week.

263
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:39,442
We're hoping that that loosens up a bit, but we also received encouraging news today that we are in a coalition, it's called the Metro North Coalition.

264
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:52,553
We submitted a plan to the state in partnership with the Cambridge Health Alliance to be able to establish a regional site, and here in Medford, actually, with the Gansher Center.

265
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,935
Tufts University is off at the Gansher Center.

266
00:20:55,642 --> 00:21:04,906
as a place for a regional site with a little hesitant at first because you open one of these sites you're approved by the state.

267
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:08,087
That means everyone in the state is allowed

268
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,324
to sign up for vaccines.

269
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:11,445
It's a public clinic.

270
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:22,894
But now there's also a caveat that 25% of the vaccines have to be allotted for local communities.

271
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,015
So that's a good thing.

272
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:28,779
So there will be access right here in Medford, which is amazing.

273
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:37,566
But again, with the vaccine being distributed minimally as it is, we're not looking at that happening till probably April.

274
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:56,051
What we've done so far though, and I want people to be aware that as of last Thursday, the state did stop publishing on their website, Thursday evenings, a vaccine distribution report, which is by community.

275
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:58,271
We had been asking for that and now it's here.

276
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:07,433
So you can look by community at the vaccine distribution by race, by age, and by overall distribution.

277
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,692
And we're looking pretty good at this point.

278
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:17,036
51% of our 65 to 74 year olds have received at least one dose.

279
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:28,165
And this was prior to our 75 plus second dose clinic, which we held on Saturday at the Andrews, which was extremely rewarding.

280
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,646
We did about 350, 75 plus.

281
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,917
uh, folks for their second dose.

282
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:35,818
Um, so that was great.

283
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,381
We've done additional homebound folks last weekend this week.

284
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:42,723
We're doing the housing authority folks.

285
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:50,528
We did 10 pond walking court and Walden, um, last week we'll be doing Riverside F on Friday.

286
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:54,170
So to date we've done about 3100 doses

287
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:01,967
to the community in about 18 clinics.

288
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:15,777
So between the Cambridge Health Alliance partnership coming in and what we're able to still do, we are going to be continuing to do homebound with what we have.

289
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:20,500
And hopefully going forward, the state's going to allow us more to do the homebound anyways.

290
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:24,322
So that's the vaccine update.

291
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:26,264
Questions.

292
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,213
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Marianne, for being here.

293
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,734
If I could ask just two questions through the chair.

294
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:43,078
So for those, the coalition, what will be at the Ginger Center at Tufts, is that confirmed?

295
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:53,803
Because I know there's been times when I work for an employer that didn't get all set up to be able to give out vaccines as an employer, and then the state kind of took that back.

296
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:57,405
So is that coalition, is that something that's like, even though we don't know the dates, is that something

297
00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,506
definitely going to happen?

298
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,028
Or is there a possibility the state could change their minds still?

299
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:03,750
I hope not.

300
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:09,655
But no, we just actually got the official approval today.

301
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:17,201
So we are set up as but but it came with, we don't know when we'll have the vaccines for you, but you're approved.

302
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:19,103
So yeah.

303
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:23,587
And then following up on that with the registration or the sign up for that, is that something that

304
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:27,701
we would have to build or that would be all through the state, they would handle that?

305
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:30,124
That would be, it would be a public website.

306
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:34,287
So part of the agreement with doing this is that you have to be open to the entire state.

307
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,129
So you're on a public website.

308
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:37,090
So you'd be part of that.

309
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:47,199
Now the new pre-registration system that they have with Google and the PrepMod system, which was the prior system, where you go on and register.

310
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,541
So it's a statewide,

311
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,703
But they did say, and again, the details haven't worked out.

312
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:58,905
So I don't know how they do that as far as allowing us to have 25%, you know, for local communities.

313
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:03,347
I'm not sure how that what the details are and how they're going to do that.

314
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:15,873
But okay, so yeah, just the follow up would be, so if someone's, you know, they're, they're already pre registered, or they go and pre register, this may just be an option that comes up for them when it's available.

315
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:16,713
Exactly.

316
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:17,413
Great.

317
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:18,474
Okay, thank you.

318
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:18,954
That's all I have.

319
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,059
Any further questions, Marianne.

320
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,780
Councilor Falco.

321
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

322
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,441
Marianne, thank you very much for your report.

323
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:29,383
You had mentioned before that they have a vaccination distribution report.

324
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,304
Was it by city?

325
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:32,966
Yes, now it's by city.

326
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:39,509
It started last Thursday and I believe it's going to be every Thursday evening with their typical state metrics report.

327
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,830
Okay, great.

328
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,872
Do you know where, do you know which website, we could find that information?

329
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:48,175
So yeah, it's it's the mass.gov COVID website.

330
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:53,899
And you look at that now they have a whole nother vaccination report line.

331
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,343
And you look at it's by municipality will say municipality vaccination report line.

332
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:07,047
It I just extrapolated methods and and it's very interesting.

333
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,930
We have a ways to go it looks like with messaging and

334
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:29,112
access for our Hispanic and Black and multiracial and Asian folks, because you can see by this report that disproportionately they are not receiving vaccines.

335
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,393
So we need to do better at that.

336
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:32,333
We're working on that.

337
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:42,636
We have a program in place and we're trying to do some outreach, but it's kind of encouraging when you look at the numbers that have been vaccinated, at least with one dose so far.

338
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:48,811
Mass.gov COVID-19 reports.

339
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,954
You'll see the weekly now vaccination reports.

340
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,696
Okay, perfect.

341
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:55,416
Thank you very much.

342
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:56,417
Appreciate it.

343
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:56,818
Mr. President.

344
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:57,979
Councilor Marks.

345
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:10,629
I just want to personally thank Director O'Connor for the update and I appreciate her appearing before the city council to not only notify this council, but also the viewing audience.

346
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,651
And I find it very helpful.

347
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:13,612
Just want to thank her.

348
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:17,382
Thank you, Marianne, and look forward to seeing you next week for a few minutes.

349
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:19,485
Thanks, guys.

350
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,025
Take care.

351
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,067
Be safe.

352
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:21,427
2-1-1-8-9.

353
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:26,514
Chief of Staff Rodriguez did have his hand raised about the vaccine.

354
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:27,435
I apologize.

355
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:28,036
Dave Rodriguez.

356
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,359
No, I just gonna jump on one of Marianne's points.

357
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:40,382
The spreadsheet that we're downloading from the state website's a little cumbersome.

358
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:45,386
So we are gonna distill that, it will be on the city website in kind of a more palatable form.

359
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:49,790
Usually it'll take us a day or two to kind of distill that information, but it will be on the city website as well.

360
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:51,571
Thank you very much.

361
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:52,512
Mr. President.

362
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:53,553
Council Members.

363
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:59,498
While we're under suspension, last week myself and Councilor Scott Kelly brought up paper 21-094,

364
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:13,694
which was a resolve requesting the police, fire and DPW department heads appear before the city council on March 16th to provide us department updates.

365
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:20,038
I was just wondering if anyone of the chiefs or the DPW commissioner was on the call today.

366
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:24,181
Councilor Marks, I do not see any one of them on there.

367
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,162
I could be mistaken.

368
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:30,425
If you are on the line, please let me know, but I do not see them on the,

369
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,746
the chat, Mr. Councilman.

370
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:39,988
So, Mr. President, were the three duly notified by the city clerk?

371
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:47,511
The clerk has notified the chief of staff with the normal procedure.

372
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:48,932
I don't know.

373
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:54,414
Mr. Dave Rodriguez, could you address Councilor Mox's question?

374
00:28:56,812 --> 00:29:05,357
or we received the resolution yesterday in the normal course, which was a quick turnaround for us to get everybody organized for this evening, but we can work out a schedule.

375
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:13,082
Mr. President, if you want to give us a call, we're happy to work out a schedule for these departments to appear before the council and provide a general update.

376
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:26,330
Okay, just for my own edification, what's the typical turnaround time then for once the council approves the resolution, voted on by the council on a Tuesday night,

377
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,879
when will that paper be received by the city administration?

378
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,761
They typically go Friday morning or Monday morning, depending on when I finish the records.

379
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:36,601
Friday or Monday.

380
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:46,245
So for a particular request like this, where it's time sensitive, is there any way we can get a quicker response?

381
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:53,589
I mean, I know Jen in our office did talk to Daria and the mayor's office to let her know that that specific request was coming.

382
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:55,589
Okay.

383
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,592
So are we being told that they're coming next week?

384
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:00,252
Is that what it is?

385
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:01,413
I don't know.

386
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:05,096
I have not, I have not received that information that they're coming next week.

387
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,041
I think the chief of staff wants me to get in touch with him and set up a time.

388
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:16,404
I had given them a couple of times also in an email.

389
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:19,807
So I don't know if those times work either.

390
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm talking about the budget before the city council.

391
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,532
I had also given them time for pre-budget meetings

392
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,101
No, no, no, no.

393
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,182
This was something different.

394
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:29,482
Yes.

395
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:34,946
This was something I saw Councilor Scott Kelly put on just for an update from the three department heads.

396
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:37,969
This has nothing to do with budget.

397
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,253
So we have, I believe the chief of staff on now.

398
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,314
He is on now.

399
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,115
Are they coming up next week?

400
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:52,661
Because the paper was, I guess, received yesterday and that doesn't give ample time, which I understand.

401
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:55,123
But are they coming next week?

402
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,553
We can make arrangements for them to come next week.

403
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:01,054
I'll consult with the chiefs and make sure that they're available at that time.

404
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,435
If they are not, I will transmit that information to the council forthwith.

405
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:14,639
Okay, I just would like you to know that I will be extremely displeased if they're not able to attend next week's meeting.

406
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,680
Sure, I just don't want to make commitments on their behalf.

407
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,621
So I want to make sure- I understand that.

408
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:23,182
I understand that.

409
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:24,523
Councilor Baez had his hand up first.

410
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:26,830
Thank you, Mr. President.

411
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:34,556
And just through the chair, I think when we are doing this, it's important that the item appears on the agenda just for open meeting law.

412
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:42,843
So, you know, if they are coming next week, I think the paper should be on the agenda next week so that the public is adequately informed that this will be discussed.

413
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:45,446
Thank you.

414
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:46,887
Councilor Falco.

415
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:47,908
Thank you.

416
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:53,833
Through you to the chief of staff, I think, so we're gonna have pre-budget meetings as well or no?

417
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,205
I, we had requested that.

418
00:31:56,225 --> 00:32:00,666
I think that's an ongoing conversation with the council president.

419
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:03,867
Okay.

420
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:08,048
Let's say I did, I did send the chief of staff some requested dates.

421
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:13,789
I don't know where they've gone since then, but I will send some more dates out tomorrow.

422
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,851
Councilor Taoko, you're done.

423
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:24,632
So if I may, to the chief of staff, so is it just a matter of finding the time?

424
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:34,562
It was a matter of finding a time as well as kind of mapping out exactly what the expectations were from the council so that we can adequately prepare for the meetings.

425
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,104
We wanted to make sure that we had the appropriate staff lined up.

426
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,466
So the budget team was available, so the departments were available.

427
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:46,931
If we want to, the expectation is that the budget will be presented to the council no later than the second week of May.

428
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:50,534
So the budget team is working pretty hard to make sure that is accomplished.

429
00:32:51,294 --> 00:33:04,238
So, so we're happy to try to work, work out a schedule with the with the council president that works for both the council and the administration.

430
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:05,958
Thank you.

431
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:12,180
A resolution has already been on the council agenda so we don't need to put another one on again.

432
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,361
Actually, we can't, we can't because that we get up to resolutions for the same thing within that within a 90 day period.

433
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:26,456
I think that's an open meeting law violation if it's not posted on the agenda and we're having an update.

434
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:31,018
If we're gonna ask questions and deliberate on items, it has to be on the agenda.

435
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:33,620
Okay, I'll check with that.

436
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,781
Mr. President, point of information.

437
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,682
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

438
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:42,525
The request last week was to have three department heads appear before the council.

439
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:50,349
The council has every right to ask whether those that we invited are here, Mr. President, to discuss

440
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,138
what we asked them to the previous week.

441
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,539
This is nothing new, Mr President.

442
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:57,059
Right.

443
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,020
And Mr President, I'm not disputing that at all.

444
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,441
I'm just saying that same paper that was on last week should be on.

445
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:09,902
You know, we if we have a paper on the agenda, sometimes it comes back up on the agenda when we're discussing it again.

446
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:12,682
I'm saying that same paper should appear on the agenda.

447
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:19,384
Uh, because if not, then there's no publicly posted item that they're going to be providing an update.

448
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:20,184
And I think

449
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,487
that means that we can't deliberate on the matter.

450
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:27,929
If I may really quick, I think that's true.

451
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:33,212
I think I know from, I think I know kind of what a council appears is trying to say.

452
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:43,496
And I think that's kind of like when we had the Lawrence Memorial update meetings, we passed the original resolution, but that same resolution would come up every time that they were going to be on the agenda.

453
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,297
So I'm thinking that

454
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,379
You know, I mean.

455
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,420
Right, because that's the way we voted on it.

456
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,901
We voted on it at 16.

457
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:52,422
That's what the agenda writer said at 16.

458
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,424
This was a date certain that we asked the parliaments to come up.

459
00:34:56,664 --> 00:35:00,526
We're not asking every week, every other week, you know, this is a date certain.

460
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:06,209
But I guess through what Councilor Pierce is saying is how would the general public know that they're going to be here?

461
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:12,992
They would know if they were tuning in last week, which the request was last week, that they appear this week.

462
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:15,144
I understand that, right?

463
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:20,266
But when they get this agenda on Friday, they get everything that's going to be on this current week.

464
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:25,549
If that information is not on this agenda, no one would know that they were ever going to be here to present.

465
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,230
That's all I'm saying.

466
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,030
I mean, I agree with you.

467
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,371
I want them here, believe me, and I want them to present.

468
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:33,013
But the general public wouldn't know they're going to be here if it's not on here again.

469
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:35,895
That's all I'm saying.

470
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:36,996
I think we're all in agreement.

471
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:41,138
It's just... Mr. President, all we have to do is put the paper from last week on the agenda.

472
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,289
Exactly.

473
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,031
We'll take care.

474
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,451
Councilor Scarponi.

475
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,372
Again, thank you.

476
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:54,896
I, too, I'm glad to hear that there's a legitimate reason why department heads on here.

477
00:35:54,936 --> 00:36:00,298
And I think that what's important is, again, it's not really the pre-budget discussions.

478
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:08,943
It's making sure that this council hears from our major department heads moving into the budget season, which is, it's,

479
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:17,332
I hope the council president and city administration iron that out and get a schedule on what we have.

480
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:21,675
I personally thought we were pretty clear on what we were asking for in the budget.

481
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:38,926
I think that, so I'm a little confused with that, but I think that it's important that we meet with these department heads and our department heads to make sure that as they step up to that, the pre-budget meetings and the budget meetings that we have all the information we need as a council

482
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:43,330
to make educated decisions on fiscal affairs of this community.

483
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:50,454
Because I think if you look at it, that's truly our number one priority, if I'm not correct.

484
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:56,257
So this is truly the most important thing we do now as our rule.

485
00:36:56,518 --> 00:37:02,781
So I think it's important that we get the assistance and the cooperation from everybody involved so we can make this happen.

486
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:07,384
So we can make educated decisions when it comes to our budget.

487
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:19,943
I know that just maybe the chief of staff can dispel some rumors, but the rumor out there is I got a phone call today saying, we're getting $39 million, we're getting $50 million.

488
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:27,588
What people don't really understand is what the true number is and how it's divided or where that can be spent.

489
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:33,732
So, they're already talking, just put it to a new fire station, put it to a new building, it's in the schools.

490
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:37,634
So we just gotta make sure the community knows when these numbers come out.

491
00:37:38,179 --> 00:38:00,052
that if we can get, Mr. Clerk, if we can get just a report just so maybe from the city administration, just so that people can understand what these monies that the state is releasing right now, that it isn't free cash that we can plug in anytime we want for the next six months, because I think that's the rumor that needs to be dispelled.

492
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:00,873
So thank you.

493
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:02,114
Councilor Morrell.

494
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,356
Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:07,437
My point was addressed earlier, so I'm all set, thank you.

496
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:13,475
Okay, next week we'll have them on, this will be placed on the agenda on the reports due.

497
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:17,597

498
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,718
That's how you'll be, the people will be notified.

499
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,299

I see Dunkin' Donuts is on the line here.

00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,471
I don't know who is on there.

508
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:58,734
Someone from Dunkin' Donuts?

509
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,235
I see Dunkin' Donuts on the line here.

510
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,637

This is the actual, there's really, it looks like just a change of ownership, is that correct?

523
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:41,063
Yes.

524
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:45,365
And the hours of operations, can you expound on that?

Yep.

528
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:58,109
Okay, so it sounds like it stays the same.

529
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:02,469

Yes.

569

Mr. Bente.

573
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:26,642
Yes.

574
00:41:28,537 --> 00:41:28,877
Good evening.

575
00:41:28,897 --> 00:41:29,898
Name and address for the record, please.

576
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,424
My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest.

577
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:47,710
And I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program.

578
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:57,017
And I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report

579
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,667
and we really haven't gotten a report.

580
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:01,207
I don't know if you can hear me on this.

581
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:02,588
Is this coming through?

582
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:04,208
We can hear you.

583
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,409
You can hear me, okay.

584
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:23,256
Okay, I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city.

585
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:26,577
At that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee

586
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:34,174
And one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city.

587
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,895
Now that was in 2009.

588
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:48,343
And it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford.

589
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:54,347
And as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through

590
00:42:56,884 --> 00:43:03,027
an arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Method.

591
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:20,955
So what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S.

592
00:43:20,995 --> 00:43:25,437
councillors, but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in.

593
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:33,842
Asking for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford.

594
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:38,545
And at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold.

595
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:53,113
And it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details

596
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:58,144
of citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues.

597
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:07,209
And this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford.

598
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,152
So I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now.

599
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:18,836
But the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report

600
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:25,034
that the then city council asked for.

601
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,456
And subsequent to that, nothing has come forward.

602
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:36,421
I believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do.

603
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:38,903
So we're not asking for anything that's outrageous.

604
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,004
It's in this building somewhere, somehow.

605
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:52,952
Now, another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year.

606
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:55,946
So right now we're into the end of the seventh year.

607
00:44:56,586 --> 00:45:04,894
So that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be.

608
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:21,388
But if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford

609
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:22,434
since 2015.

610
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:25,297
In 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449.

611
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:25,597
In 2016, it's $368,140.

612
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:26,117
In 2017, it's $375,611.

613
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:26,478
2018, it's $351,470.

614
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:26,818
2019, it's $339,449.

615
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:56,881
$148 and past year 2020 was $163,875.

616
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,503
Again, if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong.

617
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:10,586
But from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693.

618
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:12,947
That's outstanding.

619
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:14,848
That's still owed here to the city of Method.

620
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:15,988
Point of information, Mr. President?

621
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,709
Point of information, Vice President Knight.

622
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,570
Are those totals cumulative or are they annual?

623
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,112
He's a random.

624
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:27,274
So are you saying that in 2015, there was 300,000 now in 2016, there's 300,000 plus an additional 300,000?

625
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:27,894
Yeah.

626
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:29,715
Are you saying that there's just $300,000?

627
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:35,237
These amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.

628
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:37,498
I question the account.

629
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:44,320
Well, I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage.

630
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,581
But again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected.

631
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:49,842
Plus the fact, plus the fact I believe

632
00:46:51,574 --> 00:47:02,159
the $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014.

633
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:10,323
So if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon.

634
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:15,246
But therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million.

635
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:20,253
years eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet.

636
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,314
So I really don't know if the city's renegotiating.

637
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:27,516
I know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going.

638
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,957
And I think you guys and Ms.

639
00:47:30,997 --> 00:47:35,598
Morrell, you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that.

640
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:41,981
Another thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President.

641
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,442
It was an October- What information council members?

642
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,370
Thank you.

643
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:53,112
I just wanted to make a point of information that we did discuss this with the representatives from Park Medford a few weeks ago.

644
00:47:53,572 --> 00:48:00,934
And that's one of the reasons that councilor Scarpelli put on the agenda, the amnesty program to try to collect some of the uncollected funds.

645
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:05,355
So we are aware of the problem and there have been resolutions to address it.

646
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:07,715
Thank you councilor Best.

647
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:09,376
Being aware of the problem.

648
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:11,936
So if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015.

649
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:19,634
there's something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue.

650
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:32,784
Taking that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Meffitt Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000.

651
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:38,688
And that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Meffitt, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn.

652
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:43,752
But toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached

653
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:56,748
There was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked.

654
00:48:57,188 --> 00:49:00,309
$250,000 would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square.

655
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:13,355
They put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement.

656
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,236
That's the five districts here in the city of Metro.

657
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:31,473
I know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen.

658
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:42,655
Again, the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know.

659
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:48,744
So if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up?

660
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:55,245
I'm asking on this particular issue here.

661
00:49:57,525 --> 00:50:12,788
I think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract

662
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:27,577
that this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?

663
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,599
From what I understand, we're on the one year contract now.

664
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,160
You're on a one year contract.

665
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,300
Yes.

666
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:42,027
So for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.

667
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,355
That would be up to the administration whether they want to.

668
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,616
So it's up to the administration that that be the case.

669
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:57,642
I would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed.

670
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:04,466
Something's not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not

671
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:10,478
How do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate?

672
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:11,178
I don't know.

673
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:15,460
It's unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters.

674
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,322
And it's unfair as to the contract as it's written.

675
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:27,926
So it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent.

676
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:33,729
What you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract.

677
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,611
The contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for.

678
00:51:39,571 --> 00:51:44,432
That, as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going.

679
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:57,135
The key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities.

680
00:51:57,755 --> 00:51:59,896
And you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one.

681
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:06,600
It just doesn't make any sense.

682
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:15,504
So I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method.

683
00:52:15,544 --> 00:52:18,346
I mean, what the contract says does for the city.

684
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:20,487
Thank you.

685
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:23,388
You're approaching your 10 minute time, Mr. Penta.

686
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:23,789
Say it again.

687
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:25,450
I said, you're approaching your 10 minutes.

688
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,911
Well, that's what I'm asking.

689
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:32,053
If a council wants to make that recommendation that they're more than welcome.

690
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:41,491
Thank you, Mr. Benton.

691
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:42,591
Nobody's going to do it?

692
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,213
What are you asking for?

693
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:53,594
What I gave you right there is a sample of what's on page six, section, I believe.

694
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:54,695
Exactly.

695
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:56,935
What are you asking us to ask Parkman?

696
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:06,738
For five years, since inception, from 2015, coming forward, how you got to your revenues, how did you get to your receipts, how did you get to your expenses?

697
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,451
You've only done it twice.

698
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:16,997
When this is a public participation item, I believe the proper procedure would be that the council would take it up and place it on the agenda next week.

699
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:18,818
It will be correct.

700
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:20,720
Say it again.

701
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:27,725
If you, uh, I say that can, uh, if they have a council, well, we can put that on next week's agenda, um, for a motion.

702
00:53:29,746 --> 00:53:32,248
So, uh, because this is public participation, we changed the rules.

703
00:53:32,996 --> 00:54:02,073
last year we said that public participation doesn't get a board number it doesn't need to be voted on by the council any councillor wants to address an issue in front of a public participation don't do so on the next week's agenda as a sponsor of the resolution thank you thank you i didn't hear what do you say thanks i didn't hear because i like as you explain that it's up to one of us to offer next week next week one of us can offer it they can do it now no not under the rules that we have there

704
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:06,018
Motion to revert to regular business.

705
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:10,980
Motion by Councilor Behrs to revert them back to regular business.

706
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,041
Seconded by Vice President Knight.

707
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:15,261
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

708
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:20,542
Councilor Behrs.

709
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:21,303
Yes.

710
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:22,803
Councilor Falco.

711
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:23,123
Yes.

712
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:24,204
Vice President Knight.

713
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:24,584
Yes.

714
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:25,504
Councilor Marks.

715
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:26,064
Yes.

716
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:26,884
Councilor Morrell.

717
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:27,564
Yes.

718
00:54:28,425 --> 00:54:29,145
Councilor Scarpelli.

719
00:54:29,205 --> 00:54:29,465
Yes.

720
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:30,425
President Caravaglia.

721
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:31,406
Yes, seven in the affirmative.

722
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:32,566
Motion passes.

723
00:54:34,577 --> 00:54:48,839
Motions, orders, and resolutions offered by President Cabrillo be it resolved that the Memphis City Council ask the administration what its plans are for outdoor dining for the restaurants for the upcoming spring, summer, and fall season.

724
00:54:51,160 --> 00:55:00,301
Mr. Rodriguez, can you, as the city, come up with a plan yet for the outdoor dining for the restaurants for the spring and summer season?

725
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,742
Well, I hope Councilor Scarpa is OK.

726
00:55:03,827 --> 00:55:06,049
Um, I don't know.

727
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,231
Is he covered in the city's insurance?

728
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:10,593
We'll make a resolution to get new chairs.

729
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:14,377
Hopefully you won't Incredible Hulk after I give my answer.

730
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:19,321
Yes, the city administration has been working pretty hard on this in advance of the spring season.

731
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:23,826
We do know that the outdoor dining, unfortunately, had to happen.

732
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:25,227
It was kind of a necessity.

733
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:26,208
It was the mother of invention.

734
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:31,653
we're going to be rolling out the program very shortly in the next couple of weeks on this, but it was a great success for the restaurants that participated.

735
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:34,195
The city was awarded a shared streets grant through the Mass Department of Transportation.

736
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:43,844
Governor Governor Baker actually came to use some of the stuff that we had going on in West Medford Square, so we will be rolling out the program very shortly in the next couple weeks.

737
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:44,905
It will be the

738
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:54,011
who's done some great business resiliency work up at OCD.

739
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:57,393
So it will be a rolling application period.

740
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,155
So applications will be available.

741
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:01,296
They'll be due on April 5th.

742
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:04,678
And then we'll start the deployment of some of the Jersey barriers and other

743
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:08,459
infrastructure that that's in place by hopefully by April 15th.

744
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:10,819
That's of course, weather permitting.

745
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,121
So we are very hopeful to do that and we'll continue to roll that throughout the spring and summer season.

746
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:24,803
Meanwhile, we will be because of the success of the program, and because of kind of the feedback that we got from restaurants, that the law department is working

747
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:36,692
with the mayor's office in order to present a streamlined ordinance for outdoor dining so that we can continue to do this year over year based upon the great success that we had and the feedback that we received from some restaurants.

748
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:38,473
So we're really excited to roll this out.

749
00:56:38,493 --> 00:56:39,414
It was such a great program.

750
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:43,157
We appreciate all the support from the restaurants and all the cooperation.

751
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,338
So we're excited to roll it back out.

752
00:56:45,479 --> 00:56:49,422
I'm sorry, you said you have a tentative date of April 15th.

753
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:50,683
We're looking for a weather permitting?

754
00:56:51,595 --> 00:56:57,399
whether that's a loose date, we can get to as soon as everything's available to get to the application period.

755
00:56:57,479 --> 00:57:00,541
So, but it is, we designed it as a rolling application period.

756
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:05,465
So we'll have April 5th will be the date to apply, buy, so that we can get our stuff together.

757
00:57:05,485 --> 00:57:08,067
Then we'll open up another period, another period, another period.

758
00:57:08,727 --> 00:57:13,430
So we did hear back from some restaurants who are doing some outdoor improvements because they are excited about the program.

759
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:15,792
So we wanna be able to accommodate them as well.

760
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:19,995
We're expecting a larger, we were expecting more folks to participate than last year.

761
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:21,626
Thank you.

762
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:28,352
Vice President Knight, this current program's being offered under the governor's executive order, is that correct?

763
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:33,897
Correct, that extends out to, I believe, 90 days after the declared state of emergency ends.

764
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:47,728
So in anticipation of the state of emergency ending at some point, it's gotta end at some point, we will present a more formalized process to the council for their consideration to be codified to replace the existing outdoor dining policy that exists.

765
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:56,596
And David, if you can reach out to the Chamber of Commerce and send something to them to make sure they kept in the loop so they can notify their members, it would be appreciated.

766
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:57,316
Sure thing.

767
00:57:57,357 --> 00:58:00,378
Miranda Briseño has been working pretty closely with them, so I'll make sure she touches base.

768
00:58:00,718 --> 00:58:01,058
Thank you.

769
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,419
Do we have any further discussion?

770
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,541
On the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco.

771
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:09,222
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

772
00:58:15,324 --> 00:58:15,924
Councilor Behrs.

773
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:16,745
Yes.

774
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,310
Councilor Falco.

775
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:19,691
Yes.

776

Vice President Knight.

777
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:21,692
Yes.

778
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:22,832
Councilor Marks.

779
00:58:23,272 --> 00:58:23,592
Yes.

780
00:58:24,013 --> 00:58:24,693
Councilor Morrell.

781
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:25,293
Yes.

782
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:27,294
Councilor Scarpelli.

783
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:27,695
Yes.

784
00:58:28,235 --> 00:58:28,995
President Caravaglia.

785
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:30,756
Yes, Assembly Member the motion passes.

786
00:58:30,776 --> 00:58:39,520
2-1, 1-8-4 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Memphis City Council wish Mary Paradiso a very happy 93rd birthday.

787
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,341
Vice President Knight.

788
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:42,182
Mr. President, thank you very much.

789
00:58:42,262 --> 00:58:44,643
Mary's a long time resident over on Grove Street.

790
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,574
She's the proud grandmother of Preston Holt, one of Medford's finest firefighters, Mr. President.

791
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:52,456
And just recently, she celebrated her 93rd birthday.

792
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:57,340
And if you know Mary, you know she's someone who's full of life, who enjoys her time down the beach in Cape Cod.

793
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,282
But more importantly, she's someone that enjoys her family and loves the city of Medford.

794
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:07,167
And with that being said, Mr. President, I'm hoping that this council will join me in extending a warm and sincere happy birthday to her on this momentous occasion.

795
00:59:07,888 --> 00:59:08,328
Thank you.

796
00:59:08,348 --> 00:59:14,353
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Bacow, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

797
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,000
Councilor Bears.

798
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,021
Yes.

799
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:20,101
Councilor Falcone.

800
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:20,421
Yes.

801
00:59:21,102 --> 00:59:21,602
Vice President.

802
00:59:21,922 --> 00:59:22,262
Yes.

803
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:23,062
Yes.

804
00:59:23,302 --> 00:59:23,622
Yes.

805
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:25,123
Yes.

806
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:28,684
Yes.

807
00:59:28,824 --> 00:59:45,750
Yes, 70 the permanent motion passes to one 185 offered by Vice President night, we have so resolved that the method DPW before probable maintenance along freedom way in preparation for the state mandate deadline for in person learning at our public schools Vice President night.

808
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:53,398
Yes, Mr. President, it's with great anticipation that many of us await the opening of our schools for in-person learning on a full-time basis.

809
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:59,362
And with that being said, we're going to see an influx of vehicles driving to middle schools and schools.

810
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:05,947
I mean, you look at Freedom Way and the condition that the roadway is in, I think it's an area that needs some attention, Mr. President, before the schools open back up.

811
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:13,532
So I'm asking that DPW go down there and take a look and do some patchwork to ensure that when school does open, that it's safe and also

812
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,703
If I can just amend the resolution, also take a look at the crosswalks to be sure that they're properly striped and not school districts.

813
01:00:22,305 --> 01:00:23,426
Any further discussion on this?

814
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:25,268
Okay.

815
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:33,735
On the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

816
01:00:44,035 --> 01:00:44,675
Councilor Bears.

817
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:45,415
Yes.

818
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,156
Councilor Caput.

819
01:00:47,316 --> 01:00:47,536
Yes.

820
01:00:48,236 --> 01:00:48,936
Vice President Knight.

821
01:00:49,176 --> 01:00:49,416
Yes.

822
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:50,496
Councilor Marks.

823
01:00:51,136 --> 01:00:51,436
Yes.

824
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:52,536
Councilor Morrell.

825
01:00:52,897 --> 01:00:53,137
Yes.

826
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:54,697
Councilor Scarpelli.

827
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:55,177
Yes.

828
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,037
President Caraballo.

829
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:59,378
Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

830
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:06,679
21186, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for lifelong resident, Helen Apples, on her recent passing.

831
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:11,660
Be it further resolved that the council meeting be dedicated in her memory.

832
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,580
Councilor Marks.

833
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:14,503
Thank you, Mr. President.

834
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:20,087
Helen Alpers was a terrific woman, a lifelong Method resident.

835
01:01:20,907 --> 01:01:24,430
Her and her husband, Henry, loved spending time with each other.

836
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:35,497
Helen, a little known fact, was a big Red Sox and Patriot fan for many decades, even during the drought of the 50s, 60s, and 70s.

837
01:01:35,577 --> 01:01:36,918
Helen was a devoted fan.

838
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:42,522
She was devoted to her family, loving mother, wife, grandmother, sister.

839
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:49,420
aunt, and one of her big things that she liked to do was spend time.

840
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,821
And her husband, Henry, had a beautiful garden.

841
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:55,682
I've never seen it, but I was told it was like an oasis.

842
01:01:56,762 --> 01:02:02,264
And she loved spending time in the garden that Henry put in the yard.

843
01:02:02,324 --> 01:02:12,367
So I would like to just say on behalf of this council, Mr. President, we wish the family well in their sorrow on the loss of Helen.

844
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:14,491
Thank you, Councillor Mox.

845
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:20,676
And if I could say, I didn't know Helen, but I do know Helen's daughters and they're friends of mine.

846
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:24,980
And I wanna wish them condolences on the passing of their mother.

847
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,104
On the motion by Councillor Mox, seconded by Councillor Falco.

848
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:33,847
Please take a moment of silence.

849
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:46,423
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

850
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:48,104
Councilor Behrs.

851
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:48,924
Yes.

852
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:50,684
Councilor Fevella.

853
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:51,184
Yes.

854
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:52,545
Vice President Knight.

855
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:52,905
Yes.

856
01:02:53,525 --> 01:02:54,085
Councilor Marks.

857
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:54,705
Yes.

858
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:55,685
Councilor Morrell.

859
01:02:58,106 --> 01:02:58,326
Yes.

860
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:00,507
Councilor Scarpelli.

861
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:00,767
Yes.

862
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:01,807
President Kerrio.

863
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,687
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

864
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:14,950
21188 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide the city council with requirements and criteria for establishing a ghost kitchen

865
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,491
in the city of Medford.

866
01:03:17,312 --> 01:03:18,092
Vice President Knight.

867
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:21,014
Mr. President, thank you very much.

868
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:31,282
Ghost Kitchens are an interesting new business model that's been popping up around the city, and it's something that's sparked my curiosity more than anything else.

869
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,266
You know, I've noticed we have Kiki's Barbecue.

870
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,248
We have Mr. Beast Burger.

871
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:44,868
We have Guy Fiori's Flavortown Kitchen, all ghost kitchens that are operating out of the city of Metchen.

872
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:53,335
I was just wondering what the regulatory criteria was, whether or not the Board of Health had some sort of filing process that was necessary, Mr. President.

873
01:03:53,355 --> 01:04:02,783
The reason that I ask is because, God forbid, somebody ordered delivery from one of these places and got sick and then wanted to call the establishment or reach out to the establishment for whatever reason they may have to.

874
01:04:03,763 --> 01:04:04,544
They won't be able to find them.

875
01:04:05,192 --> 01:04:10,114
So I just wanted to be sure, Mr. President, that there was some sort of process or what that process wants in place right now.

876
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:17,496
So I'm just asking the question from our Director of the Board of Health and the city administration as to what the process is for applying for a ghost kitchen, if there even is one.

877
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,277
It's as simple as that.

878
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:29,561
Vice President Knight, if you wouldn't mind if I amend that to find out if they pay meals taxes.

879
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,781
I certainly wouldn't have a problem with that.

880
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,082
And the city of Bedford, I don't know

881
01:04:34,394 --> 01:04:36,916
if they do or they do not, I'd like to know if they do collect that.

882
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:41,059
Any other further discussion on this?

883
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,760
Councilor Mox.

884
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:58,493
Just if I could, Mr. President, I think it would be interesting to find out, but it's my understanding that this is an agreement between whatever the ghost kitchen is, like Guy Fieri, and the establishment, and everything's prepared on site at that establishment.

885
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:02,416
So they're preparing it on behalf of, actually, Guy Fieri can't be at

886
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,381
500 ghost kitchens throughout the country.

887
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:06,941
So that's my understanding.

888
01:05:06,981 --> 01:05:10,402
I assume everything would apply, but I think it would be interesting to find out.

889
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:15,903
Yeah, again, I'm kind of curious myself to see where they go with this.

890
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,964
In essence, it's the subletting of your license, right?

891
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:19,284
I'm sorry?

892
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:22,125
In essence, it's subleasing your existing license.

893
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:22,465
Yes.

894
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:25,386
That's exactly what they're doing, the subletting.

895
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:29,791
And so I don't know if subletting of a license is illegal.

896
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:34,614
I'm not opposed to it, Mr. President, quite frankly, I think it brings a lot of options and opportunity to the community.

897
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:37,155
I just want to be sure that we're doing it right and we're protected.

898
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:37,855
Thank you.

899
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:47,319
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by President Carabiello, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

900
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,920
Any further discussion?

901
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,821
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

902
01:05:53,802 --> 01:05:54,483
Councilor Bears.

903
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:55,083
Yes.

904
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:57,112
Councilor Falco?

905
01:05:57,232 --> 01:05:57,472
Yes.

906
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:58,433
Vice President Knight?

907
01:05:58,533 --> 01:05:58,733
Yes.

908
01:06:11,578 --> 01:06:13,058
Sorry, I think we lost chamber audio.

909
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,240
We've got you.

910
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:22,542
We have you back now.

911
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:23,782
OK.

912
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:25,523
Councilor Morrell, we're asking for your vote.

913
01:06:25,923 --> 01:06:26,083
Yes.

914
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:28,458
Okay.

915
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,401
Councilor Scarpelli.

916
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:31,721
Yes.

917
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,702
President Kerrio.

918
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:32,902
Yes.

919
01:06:32,982 --> 01:06:34,664
I mean, the affirmative motion passes.

920
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,086
Communications from the mayor.

921
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:37,086
21190.

922
01:06:39,888 --> 01:06:40,589
Yeah, Mr. President.

923
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:49,582
I hereby propose the following amendment to the revised ordinances of the city of Bedford.

924
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:57,889
Section 94-35A of the revised ordinance of the city of Bedford, Massachusetts is hereby amended to read as follows.

925
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:09,680
A, a board of appeals provided under Mass General Law chapter 48 section 12 is hereby established consisting of five members who shall be appointed by the mayor.

926
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,681
The members shall serve a term of three years.

927
01:07:13,182 --> 01:07:14,783
The members shall be residents of the city.

928
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:20,987
The board shall annually elect a chairman among its own members and a clerk.

929
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:25,430
The mayor shall also annually appoint two associate members

930
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:43,068
of such Board of Appeals who shall each be appointed for a one-year term and who shall sit on the Board upon the designation of the Chairman to act in the event of a vacancy, or the absence or inability to act, or an interest on the part of a member thereof.

931
01:07:43,808 --> 01:07:50,809
Members and the associate members shall serve until a successor is appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed.

932
01:07:51,389 --> 01:07:53,650
Submitted by Her Honor the Mayor, Brianna Lundgren.

933
01:07:54,854 --> 01:08:00,117
Mr. President, motion to refer to a committee of the whole with our zoning consultant, Mark Wrobroski.

934
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:11,083
The motion by vice president Knight to refer this to a committee of the whole and discuss it with our zoning consultant, Mark Wrobroski.

935
01:08:11,103 --> 01:08:11,884
Seconded.

936
01:08:12,564 --> 01:08:14,045
Seconded by councilor Scott Kelly.

937
01:08:14,866 --> 01:08:15,806
Any discussion on this?

938
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:16,807
Mr. President.

939
01:08:17,773 --> 01:08:18,473
Councilor Knox.

940
01:08:19,193 --> 01:08:20,154
Thank you, Mr. President.

941
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:27,876
I do have a question and a request that they may provide us with an explanation on the reason for the change.

942
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:44,920
And also, Mr. President, I'm under the opinion that the ordinance requires that the term of each of the three members that currently sit on the Board of Appeals expire every one year.

943
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:48,739
meaning none of the members will be up all at once.

944
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:54,501
And currently, I believe we have a situation where all the members are currently expired.

945
01:08:55,022 --> 01:08:57,583
So I'm kind of concerned how that happened.

946
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:00,584
And secondly, Mr. President, it's important that

947
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,585
We have continuity on that board.

948
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,826
It's a very important board.

949
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:05,447
It's a very technical board.

950
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:08,529
And it's a very important board in this community.

951
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:17,654
And it's extremely important that we have always a consistent experience knowledge base on that board.

952
01:09:18,014 --> 01:09:20,736
And that's the reason for the staggered terms.

953
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:30,062
So I'm just wondering if the mayor can answer the reason for the change and why are all three appointments currently expired from my understanding.

954
01:09:31,976 --> 01:09:35,900
Mr. Rodriguez, can you answer Council Mark's questions?

955
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:40,624
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:54,016
Councilor Marks makes a really important point about continuity and kind of that institutional knowledge that board members that have, although there is, and there's also the balance that exists with new voices and diversity of voices across the community.

957
01:09:54,456 --> 01:10:05,460
This for a board of this importance, and again, to Councilor Marks' point, this is one of the most influential policymaking boards that the city has, and it's only three members, three voting members.

958
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,641
So expanding it to five members,

959
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:21,953
would allow for a greater diversity of voices that represents the entire community a little bit more equitably, as well as expanding it to two associate members to be able to have it be a seven total participating member board, a five member voting board.

960
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:27,038
To answer the question about the staggered terms, it is an issue that we are well aware of.

961
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:29,420
We are working to rectify.

962
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,163
It's not exactly, it isn't limited to the Board of Appeals.

963
01:10:33,704 --> 01:10:34,785
And it's something that we have to do

964
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:56,589
that we're working on in order to find a way to move forward on to make sure that we do have those staggered terms that they do, that we have one member falling off every year or one member, two member, one member falling off every year so that we're able to have both that institutional knowledge as well as that fresh organic turnover that happens on boards and commissions that allow for the greater diversity of voices and kind of the fresh ideas.

965
01:10:57,249 --> 01:11:01,311
So there are points extremely well taken, Councilor Marks, and appreciated as well.

966
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:06,033
But that's the general reasoning behind the policy change from the mayor.

967
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:16,058
And we're happy to discuss that with the zoning consultant or with the CD board as part of the 40A section five process, which requires that referral.

968
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:24,002
So if I could, Mr. President, just to follow up, and I appreciate the chief of staff's response.

969
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:38,785
So Dave, based on the terms that are supposed to expire every year, is it the fact that there's been at least two of these positions that have been expired for the past two years?

970
01:11:39,665 --> 01:11:43,727
And if so, were they eligible to vote during the past two years?

971
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:49,428
According to the ordinance, holdovers can vote, can move and participate, they serve until they're replaced.

972
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:57,418
So yeah, so the votes, and I'll defer to legal as to the legality of the votes that they took, but it is our understanding that that is the case.

973
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,943
How it happened was, it appears to be

974
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:10,846
not a problem that we can pinpoint the exact genesis of, but it looks to be something that folks were getting year-over-year appointments, folks were leaving, and they weren't filling out appointments.

975
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:17,208
They were getting new one-year appointments, so everything got kind of clumped and clustered together over time.

976
01:12:17,248 --> 01:12:27,551
Some folks were getting 18-month appointments, some folks were getting one-year appointments, so we're untangling it to try to figure out why, but we want to move forward with it to be able to make sure that they are staggered.

977
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:39,400
And did your office get any input from the public or local attorneys that currently use the board on this change?

978
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,304
Have you solicited any responses at all?

979
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:45,936
We haven't asked local attorneys for further input.

980
01:12:46,316 --> 01:12:54,099
When we did do the call for committee membership, we did have some really robust feedback from the public on folks that want to serve on this board.

981
01:12:54,859 --> 01:13:01,682
It was one of the reasons, this was something that we kind of developed pretty early on in the administration that got shelved over time.

982
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:07,984
It's something that we reignited in the last couple of months as a discussion internally to present before the council.

983
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,965
So it's something that we've been thinking about doing for a long time.

984
01:13:10,405 --> 01:13:18,051
to reflect that greater diversity of voices as well as the robust feedback that we got from the general public with our call for board and commission membership.

985
01:13:20,512 --> 01:13:26,317
And the holdover that you refer to, are you saying that's part of a current ordinance?

986
01:13:28,498 --> 01:13:31,861
Yeah, I'm just reading the ordinance that's presented.

987
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:35,864
The only two words that change are five and two, they change from three

988
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:43,824
And one, the last sentence, members and associate members shall serve until a successor is appointed and qualified and less sooner removed.

989
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:51,551
So that's the holdover provision inside the language to prevent, to allow the board to keep working if there is a reason for a holdover.

990
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:58,377
All right, so under that particular section, then there would never be a need to ever appoint anyone ever again.

991
01:14:00,163 --> 01:14:03,886
In theory, yes, but that won't be the practice now.

992
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:06,048
It seems that's what's been working out.

993
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:09,931
Yeah, we are trying to understand that, but in theory, yeah.

994
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:13,033
That's something we have to review, Mr. President, as well.

995
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:20,719
And I appreciate the response, and I would ask that that be put in the form of an amendment so we can get a response in writing.

996
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,281
Any further discussion?

997
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:27,625
Okay, on the motion by

998
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:35,402
by Vice President Knight, sentence to a committee of whole, as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

Yes.

1012
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:58,698
President Kerrio.

Yes.

1014
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:10,163
Motion passes.

1015
01:15:10,223 --> 01:15:11,264
We've got a whole bunch of them here.

1016
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:12,884
We'll do them all at once.

1017
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:17,146
We'll do the reports and then say, I got like four or five of them here to do.

1018
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:18,747
We'll do them all at once.

1019
01:15:19,528 --> 01:15:20,748
After we do our report to the committee.

1020
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:22,629
If that's okay with you.

1021
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:27,700
Yes.

1022
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,421
Yeah, we'll do it.

1023
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:30,442
I've got four of them here.

1024
01:15:30,462 --> 01:15:33,124
We'll do individually after the reports on the committee.

1025
01:15:33,944 --> 01:15:36,466
Reports of committee.

1026
01:15:36,486 --> 01:15:47,793
2-0-3-0-0, 2-1-0-5-3, and 2-1-0-7-0, March 18th, Subcommittee on Elderly and Housing Affairs, which is Councilor Bares.

1027
01:15:47,853 --> 01:15:49,874
Councilor Bares, would you like to give a report?

1028
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:51,655
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1029
01:15:52,055 --> 01:15:55,217
We met last, well, yes, last Monday.

1030
01:15:56,847 --> 01:15:58,668
And we met regarding a few different papers.

1031
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:08,013
We had some updates on the local housing stability initiatives that have been undertaken by this council, by the administration, by the community preservation committee.

1032
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:22,940
And we will be having a future meeting on that item discussing eligibility for the rental assistance program and inviting some members of the health department to figure out how we can incorporate housing work into the permanent social work planning that they are conducting.

1033
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:33,517
Councilor Falco's housing stability notification ordinance proposal was sent to the solicitor and the director of community development for drafting of an ordinance.

1034
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:47,904
And we also will be having a future meeting regarding the health and safety inspections for housing units in the city with health department and building department staff who are responsible for those items.

1035
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:50,085
Thank you.

1036
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:54,679
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1037
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,880
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1038
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:58,501
Councilor Behrs.

1039
01:16:59,322 --> 01:16:59,542
Yes.

1040
01:17:00,402 --> 01:17:01,062
Councilor Falco.

1041

Yes.

1042
01:17:01,723 --> 01:17:02,463
Vice President Knight.

1043
01:17:03,003 --> 01:17:03,283
Yes.

1044
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:03,964
Councilor Marks.

1045
01:17:04,364 --> 01:17:04,624
Yes.

1046
01:17:04,784 --> 01:17:05,485
Councilor Morrell.

1047
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:06,065
Yes.

1048
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:07,566
Councilor Scarpelli.

1049
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:07,686
Yes.

1050
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:08,826
President Caraballo.

1051
01:17:08,926 --> 01:17:12,728
Yes, seven in favor of the motion passes.

1052
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:15,289
20573 March 8, 2021, Public Works Subcommittee.

1053
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:17,810
Before the follow, Councilor Behrs, you are the chairman of that committee.

1054
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,011
Do you have any questions?

1055
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,379
Thank you, Mr President.

1056
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:25,483
And again, Councilor Falcone, Councilor Marks, my committee members on public works.

1057
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:40,336
We discussed the snow shoveling ordinance, and we currently have a request in with the DPW commissioner regarding priority sidewalks, as well as a request to the city solicitor to review proposed language in the paper regarding a few items.

1058
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:45,700
And we will be having a future meeting with members of the administration to continue moving the process forward.

1059
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,241
Thank you.

1060
01:17:47,398 --> 01:17:47,778
Thank you.

1061
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:51,980
On the motion by Councillor Bailey, seconded by Councillor Maxx.

1062
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,741
If I could just add to what Councillor Bailey has just stated.

1063
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:59,723
We've met several times with the Public Works Subcommittee.

1064
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:16,970
Just recently, we got a response back from Brian Kerins, the BPW Commissioner, at the request of the subcommittee to look at priority sidewalks throughout the city and create connectivity with the schools, with public transportation,

1065
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:29,260
with bus shelters and access on sidewalks that would create roughly probably 30 to 40 to 50 miles of connectivity throughout the community.

1066
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:39,303
And I was really surprised, and I think some of my colleagues were surprised as well, to hear the amount of money that this would cost.

1067
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:46,905
And it was very, very reasonable, Mr. President, to do this connectivity during any storm that's greater than

1068
01:18:47,262 --> 01:18:47,882
three inches.

1069
01:18:48,642 --> 01:19:09,307
And I look forward to making a recommendation out of this subcommittee eventually that will work hand in hand with the new ordinance, as well as the connectivity that would open up access to walkways and crosswalks and really create a safe environment for pedestrians.

1070
01:19:09,347 --> 01:19:15,749
So I think this is pretty exciting and I look forward to the next several meetings where we can make recommendations

1071
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:22,904
to this council because eventually it's going to come to funding, but I don't think you can put a dollar amount on public safety.

1072
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:23,584
Thank you.

1073
01:19:24,105 --> 01:19:24,485
Thank you.

1074
01:19:24,525 --> 01:19:25,305
Any further discussion?

1075
01:19:25,885 --> 01:19:28,766
Now on the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1076
01:19:29,426 --> 01:19:30,587
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1077
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:33,608

1080
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:36,489

Vice President Knight?

1082
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:37,969

Yes.

1087
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:42,331
Councilor Scarpelli?

1088
01:19:42,451 --> 01:19:42,671

President Caraballo?

1090
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:43,971
Yes.

1091
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:50,013
2-0-5-6-8, March 9th, Committee of the Whole on 4th of Fall.

1092
01:19:50,573 --> 01:20:02,257
This was a report, a continuing committee on the zoning recartification with Mark Hrabowski, and there will be another meeting on Thursday night.

1093
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:06,298
So again, this is a continual work in progress.

1094
01:20:06,358 --> 01:20:09,218
So on the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1095
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:11,619
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1096
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:14,100

Let's see.

Seconded by Councilor Max.

Councilor Bears.

1100
01:20:26,508 --> 01:20:26,749
Yes.

1101
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:28,350
Councilor Felco.

1102
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:28,931
Yes.

1103
01:20:29,471 --> 01:20:30,212
Vice President Knight.

1104
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:31,033
Yes.

1105
01:20:31,533 --> 01:20:32,094
Councilor Marks.

Thank you, Mr. President.

1159
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:54,302
I know it's mentioned that the paper was signed off by the building commissioner.

1160
01:22:54,322 --> 01:23:01,068
Does that actually mean that these signs have already been installed and are up and functioning?

1161
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,730
I do not think the hotel is actually open yet.

1162
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:09,871
I could be wrong, but I don't think the hotel is actually open yet.

1163
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:12,433
Right, I don't think so either.

1164
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,115
Do you want to leave this on the table?

1165
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:18,359
And we'll also leave 20563 on the table.

1166
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:20,841
Yeah, same thing.

1167
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:26,045
So on the motion to leave- It's already on the table.

1168
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:27,146
Okay, yeah, just keep the table.

1169
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:28,848
Mr. President.

1170
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:31,270
Council Members.

1171
01:23:31,572 --> 01:23:45,416
Just maybe moving forward when we go over these reviews, whether it's 30, 60, or 90, we should always put language in that states from the day of opening or the day of sign installation.

1172
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:58,560
So that way we have an understanding that we're viewing this process that the whole intent of this is to make sure that these signs weren't glaring in residents' eyes at station landing and so forth.

1173
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:01,973
You know, we just wanna make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1174
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:06,115
Thank you.

1175
01:24:06,235 --> 01:24:19,724
Okay, 20639, 90 day review on last type tattoo studio for a special permit to conduct a body out established granted by the council required 90 day.

1176
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:26,048
On the motion by, I think they're already open.

1177
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:28,009
They're open, yeah.

1178
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:32,505
The motion by Councilor Scott Beally, seconded by.

1179
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:34,046
Have they been open for 90 days?

1180
01:24:34,906 --> 01:24:36,507
I know they are open.

1181
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:39,209
I don't know if they're open.

1182
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:41,891
You want to hold this one up too?

1183
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:42,452
Yeah.

1184
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:44,713
We'll keep that on the table.

1185
01:24:46,134 --> 01:24:50,677
With the pandemic guidelines and restrictions that are in place, I don't think we're going to get a true picture.

1186
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:54,840
Is there anything else that I forgot on here?

1187
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:58,784
I think we've got them all for the moment.

1188
01:24:59,564 --> 01:25:01,886
I believe we did have the 7-11 in our packet.

1189
01:25:01,906 --> 01:25:02,046
7-11.

1190
01:25:02,066 --> 01:25:02,166
7-11.

1191
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:02,266

1197
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:40,480
Do we have a motion on this?

1198
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,721
Yes, Mr. President, Mr. President.

1199
01:25:44,142 --> 01:25:53,847
If you recall, there were a number of residents that came up to speak not in opposition, but concerned about the additional traffic and lights and so forth.

1200
01:25:54,371 --> 01:26:03,373
I have not heard from anyone in the neighborhood, so I would say it's safe to say that they are abiding by the request of this council.

1201
01:26:04,273 --> 01:26:08,394
