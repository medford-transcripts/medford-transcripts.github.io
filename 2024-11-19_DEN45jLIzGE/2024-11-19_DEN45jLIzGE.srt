[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

41
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I believe there's a resolution to be ready for the record.

42
00:02:41,517 --> 00:03:00,074
[SPEAKER_07]: 21187 offered by Vice President Knight, whereas Governor Baker has declared March 21st or April 30th, 2021 motorcycle awareness period, and whereas the city of Bedford has over 900 motorcycles registered in the city, and whereas motorcycle crash fatalities in the Commonwealth have increased,

43
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:21,652
[SPEAKER_07]: in each of the past three years, and whereas the city of Medford was the site of a motorcycle crash fatality in 2020, be it resolved at the request of the Medford City Council and on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association and the Medford Motorcycle Community that the mayor of the city of Medford issue the following proclamation.

44
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:30,128
[SPEAKER_07]: A proclamation naming March 21 through April 30th motorcycle awareness period in the city of Medford.

45
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:36,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the motorcycle is a popular means of transportation for commuting as well as touring and recreation.

46
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:48,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas there was a growing need for cooperation among drivers of automobiles and trucks, motorcycles and bicycles and pedestrians who use our streets and the highways to reduce injuries and fatality.

47
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:49,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas,

48
00:03:51,782 --> 00:04:00,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas, it is critical for all Massachusetts citizens to increase their knowledge of the rules of the road and the rights and the responsibility of roadway use.

49
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas, the numerous organizations that are committed to making our streets

50
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: and highways safe for all motor vehicle related transportation, including the Highway Safety Division of the Massachusetts Rider Education Program, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, the American Motorcycle Association, Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association, the Metro Malden Elk Riders, and many other motorcycle businesses and clubs in the Commonwealth.

51
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I hereby, I,

52
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:42,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Honorable Mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor of the City of Medford, do hereby proclaim March 21 to April 30th to be Motorcycle Awareness Period.

53
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:43,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

54
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

55
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:50,480
[SPEAKER_11]: This resolution has been put on the agenda on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association.

56
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,166
[SPEAKER_11]: The Massachusetts Motorcycle Association is the premier organization that lobbies for motorcycle safety.

57
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:57,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of us

58
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,150
[SPEAKER_11]: around town will see the signs on their coordinated campaigns across the state.

59
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Motorcycles are everywhere.

60
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Big yellow signs with black writing.

61
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I think look twice and save lives.

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:14,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association has been at the forefront of motorcycle safety initiatives for as long as I can remember.

63
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:24,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight we have with us Mr. Paul Cote from the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association, who I met some 15 years ago while he was lobbying up the statehouse for motorcycle safety initiatives.

64
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:33,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm offering this resolution on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association and the motorcycle community here in the city of Medford to promote safety.

65
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:39,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an unfortunate and tragic fact that Medford was the site of a motorcycle fatality last year.

66
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,792
[SPEAKER_11]: A Malden resident was killed in an accident.

67
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:49,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's initiatives like this that help us bring awareness to the safety on the roadways and what's necessary and to be sure that we share them with the motorcycles, Mr. President.

68
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I'd like to ask Mr. Cote.

69
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:53,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a couple of councils with the hands up.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

72
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:56,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morocco.

73
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:58,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

74
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:04,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear from the people in attendance, but I do just want to know, I thank vice president Knight for bringing this forward.

75
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:13,174
[SPEAKER_10]: My cousin Ashley, a few years back was actually riding on the back of her fiance's motorcycle and was clipped by a motorist on 93.

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:25,471
[SPEAKER_10]: She almost died and after a lengthy recovery, she has a traumatic brain injury that she will live with for the rest of her life, simply because a negligent motorist nearly took her life.

77
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:31,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is an important proclamation and I really thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

78
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:32,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

79
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:37,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:53,773
[SPEAKER_13]: I also wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward for the exact reason that Councilor Morell just noted, which is I think many of us know friends or family members who have been injured because of negligent operation by motorists and not looking twice and seeing motorcyclists.

81
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:54,774
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Councilor Knight.

82
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,954
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope this proclamation is declared.

83
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:58,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

84
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

85
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor and Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

87
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to applaud Mr. Cote and Ms.

88
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:19,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Lister for all the work that they've done to make sure this is in the forefront of our state, making sure that motorcycle safety is something that's not falling from the wayside.

89
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:25,332
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I can remember Betsy riding her bike through Medford for

90
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: a long time now, and she was the first person that would hop off her bike and make sure that if people didn't follow the rules, make sure they got a lesson.

91
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:39,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a scary lesson to learn, let me tell you.

92
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate what you do do in keeping this going.

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it can't be forgotten because like Councilor Morell said, I'm sorry, something personal happened to her life.

94
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:55,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that when you think about it, we've all had someone affected.

95
00:07:55,834 --> 00:08:03,538
[SPEAKER_04]: negatively because of negligent driving with motorcycles and not taking their safety as a priority.

96
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:08,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank Councilor Knight again for bringing this forward and I appreciate your effort, all your work.

97
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

98
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

99
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:10,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Palacios.

100
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:12,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

101
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:15,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

102
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:23,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I too, I actually, one of my probably earliest memories is losing my cousin to a motorcycle accident.

103
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:33,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that's always, you know, affected me personally, that she lost her life in a motorcycle accident.

104
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:34,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something you never forget.

105
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:40,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor Knight, I wanna thank you for bringing this forward and thank Ms.

106
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Lister and Mr. Cote for raising awareness.

107
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we can't speak enough about this.

108
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you being here tonight.

109
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight, thank you for bringing this forward.

110
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:53,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would second the motion, thank you.

111
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

112
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

113
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

114
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:03,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank again, Vice President Knight for putting this on.

115
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:10,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every year we try to raise motorcycle awareness in this community through a number of initiatives.

116
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:16,316
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably one of the most popular initiatives where we have the rally on Mystic Ave.

117
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:21,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we can get back to that, Mr. President, when this COVID bypasses us

118
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:31,564
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Mr. President, I think it's important that we make this aware because many people think the streets are owned by cars.

119
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:39,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are other vehicles, including motorcycles, bicycles, that are on the roadway as well.

120
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think drivers have to be mindful that they don't own the streets.

121
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,374
[SPEAKER_04]: They share them with other vehicles.

122
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's important, Mr. President, that we spread that around.

123
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also important as a community

124
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:57,966
[SPEAKER_04]: that we create safe spaces for motorcycles as well, Mr. President.

125
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:03,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Many communities have motorcycle parking spots, which I'm not aware of any in this community.

126
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:18,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the initiatives I think that will bring public awareness out there so people understand that there are other means of modes of transportation other than cars that are out there that are safe.

127
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in my opinion,

128
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:24,806
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think motorcycle drivers get a bad rap.

129
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I see motorcycle drivers, they're always paying attention to the road.

130
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,349
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always using their singles.

131
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:35,071
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always driving accordingly to the rules and regulations.

132
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's only important, Mr. President, that we bring this awareness forward.

133
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:49,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, riding a motorcycle, you know, two gallons of gas, three gallons of gas, you can go 50, 70, 80 miles.

134
00:10:51,257 --> 00:11:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in this time of trying to conserve and so forth, I think it's a mode of transportation that we really need to get out there, Mr. President, and support.

135
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I want to thank my colleague for putting this on.

136
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:06,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

137
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:11,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, I want to thank Vice President Knight and Mr. Coté and Ms.

138
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Lister for being here this evening.

139
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:15,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly, like I say, Council Member Marks made a point.

140
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:23,387
[SPEAKER_07]: The roads are owned by everybody, not just cars, so we need to make sure that people pay attention when they drive.

141
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:29,932
[SPEAKER_07]: As someone who drives for a living, I see the importance of safety on the road.

142
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:36,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, I want to thank Councilor Naik for bringing this forward, and we'll open discussion for public.

143
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:46,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if you'll indulge me, I'm a firm believer that the city clerk should be seen at these meetings, but not heard.

144
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:52,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this resolution on and putting this proclamation on.

145
00:11:54,403 --> 00:12:00,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost 41 years ago, not too far from here, I lost my own father in a motorcycle accident.

146
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something I think about every day.

147
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that's seared in my brain.

148
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:11,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is no such thing as enough safety awareness around motorcycles.

149
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from the bottom of my heart, thank you for putting this on tonight.

150
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

151
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:20,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any discussion from the public?

152
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:21,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Coté?

153
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

154
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

155
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:31,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul Coté, One Birchwood Point, Amesbury, Massachusetts.

156
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Just first of all, thank you.

157
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,213
[SPEAKER_14]: for your loss, the other councilors' loss, and your dad, Mr. Burke.

158
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:58,560
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 years ago, we started the Motorcycle Survivors Fund, bikers helping bikers, riders helping riders, where we do events to raise money to help families of riders killed or seriously injured in accidents, and to promote motorcycle safety and awareness.

159
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, we don't have to give anyway.

160
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,302
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be the best thing.

161
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:05,164
[SPEAKER_14]: But we know it's not a perfect world,

162
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,666
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not all road users.

163
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,427
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not just motorcyclists.

164
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:15,169
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, as you said, it's pedestrians, bicyclists.

165
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,292
[SPEAKER_14]: With spring coming, you're going to be baby carriers and stuff out there.

166
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:21,833
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody should be aware.

167
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,094
[SPEAKER_14]: And it takes three seconds to check twice.

168
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:31,598
[SPEAKER_14]: And Betsy and I, Adam was there at the time at the State House with Charlie Shannon.

169
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:36,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And we used to have to beg the governor at the time

170
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,249
[SPEAKER_14]: to issue the proclamation.

171
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And they would issue it, but then they wouldn't do anything with it.

172
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,933
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had a bill passed.

173
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was in OHAPA.

174
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:52,317
[SPEAKER_14]: The rest of the country celebrates May as Motorcycle Safety Awareness Period.

175
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,999
[SPEAKER_14]: May being an acronym for Motorcycle and You.

176
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Motorcycles and You.

177
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:05,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And geographically in the country, but the American Motorcycle Association, the weather is good.

178
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,121
[SPEAKER_14]: all across the North, usually in May.

179
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:13,104
[SPEAKER_14]: We looked at the 98, 99, and 2000 fatalities.

180
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:18,286
[SPEAKER_14]: We found 27% happened in February, March, and April.

181
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,327
[SPEAKER_14]: We said, why May?

182
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody smarter than us will come up with an acronym for March.

183
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Took about 30 seconds.

184
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Motorcycle awareness really can help, dot, dot, dot, save lives.

185
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,514
[SPEAKER_14]: We believe it does.

186
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:36,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Proclamation was changed, or the bill was changed.

187
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,665
[SPEAKER_14]: It was enacted in June 4th, 2002.

188
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:44,328
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the 19th year, very much appreciated.

189
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:48,350
[SPEAKER_14]: We try to go to cities and towns to get local government.

190
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,512
[SPEAKER_14]: You have over 900 registered motorcycles in Manhattan.

191
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,155
[SPEAKER_14]: They all got families, just like we all do.

192
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:00,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And everybody that rides a motorcycle does something else.

193
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:02,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, thank you very much.

194
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:03,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

195
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Betsy was there throughout it all.

196
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:05,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

197
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:06,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

198
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:07,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

199
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:07,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

200
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

201
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street, Method Mass.

202
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:14,046
[SPEAKER_03]: May I from here?

203
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:14,886
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

204
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:15,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Please keep your mask on.

205
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:16,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

206
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:24,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, I feel horrible for all of you who have been affected by motorcycle accidents and fatalities.

207
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had one or more myself.

208
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:35,382
[SPEAKER_03]: that involved broken bones by the driver being respectful of my space.

209
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a proponent along with Paul for many, many years.

210
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:47,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a video with Ben Abbott book and the Method Police back in the day.

211
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot remember the year right this minute.

212
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:58,320
[SPEAKER_03]: but I believe it was played on local television about motorcycle safety, education, and awareness.

213
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:19,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to let you know how hard we've been fighting throughout the Commonwealth for safety, as Paul was mentioning, when we first started this, the motorcycles were a two paragraph situation in the driver's manual.

214
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,526
[SPEAKER_03]: and from Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

215
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: In the whole driver's manual, there was a whole two-paragraph section about motorcycles.

216
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:46,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that changed, and I, along with our motorcycle rep, Gene Caribbean, of the Massachusetts Registry, rewrote the whole manual, and now motorcycles have their very own manual.

217
00:16:47,703 --> 00:17:03,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Paul and I have worked together to get motorcycle safety education and awareness involved in the safety, the driver class, the driver education class.

218
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:03,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

219
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm so nervous.

220
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm usually very good speaker.

221
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:10,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that got done.

222
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:11,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot.

223
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly, usually it's the full month.

224
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:26,935
[SPEAKER_03]: February, March through April, the whole month of March through April to August, but we'll take a week.

225
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,555
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take whatever we can get.

226
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to thank you.

227
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:37,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also involved with the Crystal Chamberlain ride with Johnny Joyce.

228
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:45,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm the person who is the lead road captain and actually leads the rides and will give the safety talk to everybody.

229
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:52,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are important matters and we love Method.

230
00:17:52,416 --> 00:18:00,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We just adore Method and it would be so great, the idea of having motorcycle parking spaces is awesome.

231
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:07,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Motorcyclists have money, just in case you didn't know, and they like to spend it in the community that welcomes them.

232
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:15,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little hint, if there was something like that happening at a place that would welcome us,

233
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,155
[SPEAKER_03]: bring money to town.

234
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:24,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to thank you very much for this consideration, and we're not done.

235
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:30,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to keep on promoting motorcycle safety education and awareness for as long as we can.

236
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all again for this opportunity.

237
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:32,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

238
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:37,223
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

239
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

240
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:42,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

241
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

242
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:45,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

243
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

244
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:47,333
[SPEAKER_05]: for that night.

245
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:48,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

246
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

247
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:50,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

248
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

250
00:18:55,738 --> 00:19:03,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, while we're on the special week, we can take Mariana O'Connor for her brief update on the on the vaccine area.

251
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, how are you?

252
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you all.

253
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:24,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, are there any questions I could take up front, or do you want me to just go on a little update as we're at.

254
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,421
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been some really.

255
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:30,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we thought they would be great.

256
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:47,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so interestingly enough, in the last 10 minutes, I received an email from the state saying that tomorrow, they are gonna announce the schedule for all remaining groups in Massachusetts for the vaccine plan.

257
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:52,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's news to me, and that just came out.

258
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:57,138
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, at the same time, we're being told by the state that they are still getting

259
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:06,639
[SPEAKER_00]: The same level of vaccine distribution from the feds, there has really been a very slight increase, if any.

260
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:13,681
[SPEAKER_00]: They are expecting more within the next several weeks, and hopefully by April.

261
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:19,622
[SPEAKER_00]: But still again, locals are not included in their plans at this point.

262
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:26,264
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only gotten housing authority doses that we were able to distribute last week.

263
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:39,442
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping that that loosens up a bit, but we also received encouraging news today that we are in a coalition, it's called the Metro North Coalition.

264
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:52,553
[SPEAKER_00]: We submitted a plan to the state in partnership with the Cambridge Health Alliance to be able to establish a regional site, and here in Medford, actually, with the Gansher Center.

265
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Tufts University is off at the Gansher Center.

266
00:20:55,642 --> 00:21:04,906
[SPEAKER_00]: as a place for a regional site with a little hesitant at first because you open one of these sites you're approved by the state.

267
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:08,087
[SPEAKER_00]: That means everyone in the state is allowed

268
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,324
[SPEAKER_00]: to sign up for vaccines.

269
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:11,445
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a public clinic.

270
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:22,894
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's also a caveat that 25% of the vaccines have to be allotted for local communities.

271
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.

272
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:28,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be access right here in Medford, which is amazing.

273
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:37,566
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with the vaccine being distributed minimally as it is, we're not looking at that happening till probably April.

274
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:56,051
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done so far though, and I want people to be aware that as of last Thursday, the state did stop publishing on their website, Thursday evenings, a vaccine distribution report, which is by community.

275
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:58,271
[SPEAKER_00]: We had been asking for that and now it's here.

276
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:07,433
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look by community at the vaccine distribution by race, by age, and by overall distribution.

277
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking pretty good at this point.

278
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:17,036
[SPEAKER_00]: 51% of our 65 to 74 year olds have received at least one dose.

279
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:28,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was prior to our 75 plus second dose clinic, which we held on Saturday at the Andrews, which was extremely rewarding.

280
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,646
[SPEAKER_00]: We did about 350, 75 plus.

281
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,917
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, folks for their second dose.

282
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:35,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that was great.

283
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,381
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done additional homebound folks last weekend this week.

284
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:42,723
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the housing authority folks.

285
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:50,528
[SPEAKER_00]: We did 10 pond walking court and Walden, um, last week we'll be doing Riverside F on Friday.

286
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:54,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So to date we've done about 3100 doses

287
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:01,967
[SPEAKER_00]: to the community in about 18 clinics.

288
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:15,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the Cambridge Health Alliance partnership coming in and what we're able to still do, we are going to be continuing to do homebound with what we have.

289
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:20,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully going forward, the state's going to allow us more to do the homebound anyways.

290
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:24,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the vaccine update.

291
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:26,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions.

292
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Marianne, for being here.

293
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,734
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could ask just two questions through the chair.

294
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:43,078
[SPEAKER_10]: So for those, the coalition, what will be at the Ginger Center at Tufts, is that confirmed?

295
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:53,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know there's been times when I work for an employer that didn't get all set up to be able to give out vaccines as an employer, and then the state kind of took that back.

296
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:57,405
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that coalition, is that something that's like, even though we don't know the dates, is that something

297
00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,506
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely going to happen?

298
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is there a possibility the state could change their minds still?

299
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:03,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope not.

300
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:09,655
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we just actually got the official approval today.

301
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:17,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are set up as but but it came with, we don't know when we'll have the vaccines for you, but you're approved.

302
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:19,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.

303
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:23,587
[SPEAKER_10]: And then following up on that with the registration or the sign up for that, is that something that

304
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:27,701
[SPEAKER_10]: we would have to build or that would be all through the state, they would handle that?

305
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:30,124
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be, it would be a public website.

306
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:34,287
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the agreement with doing this is that you have to be open to the entire state.

307
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're on a public website.

308
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:37,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be part of that.

309
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:47,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the new pre-registration system that they have with Google and the PrepMod system, which was the prior system, where you go on and register.

310
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a statewide,

311
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,703
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did say, and again, the details haven't worked out.

312
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:58,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how they do that as far as allowing us to have 25%, you know, for local communities.

313
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:03,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how that what the details are and how they're going to do that.

314
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:15,873
[SPEAKER_10]: But okay, so yeah, just the follow up would be, so if someone's, you know, they're, they're already pre registered, or they go and pre register, this may just be an option that comes up for them when it's available.

315
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:16,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

316
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:17,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

317
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:18,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

318
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:18,954
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I have.

319
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions, Marianne.

320
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

321
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

322
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Marianne, thank you very much for your report.

323
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You had mentioned before that they have a vaccination distribution report.

324
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it by city?

325
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:32,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, now it's by city.

326
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:39,509
[SPEAKER_00]: It started last Thursday and I believe it's going to be every Thursday evening with their typical state metrics report.

327
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

328
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know where, do you know which website, we could find that information?

329
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:48,175
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's it's the mass.gov COVID website.

330
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:53,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at that now they have a whole nother vaccination report line.

331
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at it's by municipality will say municipality vaccination report line.

332
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:07,047
[SPEAKER_00]: It I just extrapolated methods and and it's very interesting.

333
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,930
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ways to go it looks like with messaging and

334
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:29,112
[SPEAKER_00]: access for our Hispanic and Black and multiracial and Asian folks, because you can see by this report that disproportionately they are not receiving vaccines.

335
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to do better at that.

336
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:32,333
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on that.

337
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:42,636
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program in place and we're trying to do some outreach, but it's kind of encouraging when you look at the numbers that have been vaccinated, at least with one dose so far.

338
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:48,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass.gov COVID-19 reports.

339
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:52,954
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the weekly now vaccination reports.

340
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.

341
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:55,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

342
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:56,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

343
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:56,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

344
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:57,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

345
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to personally thank Director O'Connor for the update and I appreciate her appearing before the city council to not only notify this council, but also the viewing audience.

346
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find it very helpful.

347
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:13,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want to thank her.

348
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:17,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Marianne, and look forward to seeing you next week for a few minutes.

349
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:19,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.

350
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.

351
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.

352
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:21,427
[SPEAKER_07]: 2-1-1-8-9.

353
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:26,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief of Staff Rodriguez did have his hand raised about the vaccine.

354
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:27,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

355
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:28,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave Rodriguez.

356
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,359
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just gonna jump on one of Marianne's points.

357
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:40,382
[SPEAKER_09]: The spreadsheet that we're downloading from the state website's a little cumbersome.

358
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:45,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are gonna distill that, it will be on the city website in kind of a more palatable form.

359
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:49,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually it'll take us a day or two to kind of distill that information, but it will be on the city website as well.

360
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:51,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

361
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:52,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

362
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:53,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Members.

363
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:59,498
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're under suspension, last week myself and Councilor Scarpelli brought up paper 21-094,

364
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:13,694
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a resolve requesting the police, fire and DPW department heads appear before the city council on March 16th to provide us department updates.

365
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:20,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering if anyone of the chiefs or the DPW commissioner was on the call today.

366
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:24,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, I do not see any one of them on there.

367
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be mistaken.

368
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:30,425
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are on the line, please let me know, but I do not see them on the,

369
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,746
[SPEAKER_07]: the chat, Mr. Councilman.

370
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:39,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Mr. President, were the three duly notified by the city clerk?

371
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:47,511
[SPEAKER_07]: The clerk has notified the chief of staff with the normal procedure.

372
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:48,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

373
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:54,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Dave Rodriguez, could you address Councilor Marks's question?

374
00:28:56,812 --> 00:29:05,357
[SPEAKER_09]: or we received the resolution yesterday in the normal course, which was a quick turnaround for us to get everybody organized for this evening, but we can work out a schedule.

375
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:13,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if you want to give us a call, we're happy to work out a schedule for these departments to appear before the council and provide a general update.

376
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:26,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just for my own edification, what's the typical turnaround time then for once the council approves the resolution, voted on by the council on a Tuesday night,

377
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,879
[SPEAKER_04]: when will that paper be received by the city administration?

378
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,761
[SPEAKER_04]: They typically go Friday morning or Monday morning, depending on when I finish the records.

379
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:36,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday or Monday.

380
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:46,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a particular request like this, where it's time sensitive, is there any way we can get a quicker response?

381
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:53,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know Jen in our office did talk to Daria and the mayor's office to let her know that that specific request was coming.

382
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:55,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

383
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we being told that they're coming next week?

384
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:00,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it is?

385
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:01,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

386
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:05,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not, I have not received that information that they're coming next week.

387
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the chief of staff wants me to get in touch with him and set up a time.

388
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:16,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I had given them a couple of times also in an email.

389
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:19,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if those times work either.

390
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:23,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the budget before the city council.

391
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I had also given them time for pre-budget meetings

392
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,101
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

393
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,182
[SPEAKER_04]: This was something different.

394
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:29,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

395
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:34,946
[SPEAKER_04]: This was something I saw Councilor Scarpelli put on just for an update from the three department heads.

396
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:37,969
[SPEAKER_04]: This has nothing to do with budget.

397
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, I believe the chief of staff on now.

398
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,314
[SPEAKER_04]: He is on now.

399
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they coming up next week?

400
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:52,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the paper was, I guess, received yesterday and that doesn't give ample time, which I understand.

401
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But are they coming next week?

402
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,553
[SPEAKER_09]: We can make arrangements for them to come next week.

403
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:01,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll consult with the chiefs and make sure that they're available at that time.

404
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,435
[SPEAKER_09]: If they are not, I will transmit that information to the council forthwith.

405
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:14,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I just would like you to know that I will be extremely displeased if they're not able to attend next week's meeting.

406
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, I just don't want to make commitments on their behalf.

407
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to make sure- I understand that.

408
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:23,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

409
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:24,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears had his hand up first.

410
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:26,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

411
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:34,556
[SPEAKER_13]: And just through the chair, I think when we are doing this, it's important that the item appears on the agenda just for open meeting law.

412
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:42,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, if they are coming next week, I think the paper should be on the agenda next week so that the public is adequately informed that this will be discussed.

413
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:45,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

414
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:46,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

415
00:31:47,147 --> 00:31:47,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

416
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:53,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Through you to the chief of staff, I think, so we're gonna have pre-budget meetings as well or no?

417
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I, we had requested that.

418
00:31:56,225 --> 00:32:00,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's an ongoing conversation with the council president.

419
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:03,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

420
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:08,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say I did, I did send the chief of staff some requested dates.

421
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where they've gone since then, but I will send some more dates out tomorrow.

422
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Taoko, you're done.

423
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:24,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I may, to the chief of staff, so is it just a matter of finding the time?

424
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:34,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a matter of finding a time as well as kind of mapping out exactly what the expectations were from the council so that we can adequately prepare for the meetings.

425
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,104
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to make sure that we had the appropriate staff lined up.

426
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So the budget team was available, so the departments were available.

427
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:46,931
[SPEAKER_09]: If we want to, the expectation is that the budget will be presented to the council no later than the second week of May.

428
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:50,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So the budget team is working pretty hard to make sure that is accomplished.

429
00:32:51,294 --> 00:33:04,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so we're happy to try to work, work out a schedule with the with the council president that works for both the council and the administration.

430
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:05,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

431
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:12,180
[SPEAKER_07]: A resolution has already been on the council agenda so we don't need to put another one on again.

432
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we can't, we can't because that we get up to resolutions for the same thing within that within a 90 day period.

433
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:26,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's an open meeting law violation if it's not posted on the agenda and we're having an update.

434
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:31,018
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're gonna ask questions and deliberate on items, it has to be on the agenda.

435
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:33,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll check with that.

436
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, point of information.

437
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

438
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:42,525
[SPEAKER_04]: The request last week was to have three department heads appear before the council.

439
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: The council has every right to ask whether those that we invited are here, Mr. President, to discuss

440
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,138
[SPEAKER_04]: what we asked them to the previous week.

441
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,539
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nothing new, Mr. President.

442
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:57,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

443
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. President, I'm not disputing that at all.

444
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,441
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying that same paper that was on last week should be on.

445
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:09,902
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we if we have a paper on the agenda, sometimes it comes back up on the agenda when we're discussing it again.

446
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:12,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm saying that same paper should appear on the agenda.

447
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:19,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, because if not, then there's no publicly posted item that they're going to be providing an update.

448
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:20,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think

449
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,487
[SPEAKER_13]: that means that we can't deliberate on the matter.

450
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may really quick, I think that's true.

451
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:33,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know from, I think I know kind of what a council appears is trying to say.

452
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of like when we had the Lawrence Memorial update meetings, we passed the original resolution, but that same resolution would come up every time that they were going to be on the agenda.

453
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,297
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking that

454
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,379
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean.

455
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, because that's the way we voted on it.

456
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: We voted on it at 16.

457
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:52,422
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the agenda writer said at 16.

458
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a date certain that we asked the parliaments to come up.

459
00:34:56,664 --> 00:35:00,526
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not asking every week, every other week, you know, this is a date certain.

460
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:06,209
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess through what Councilor Bears is saying is how would the general public know that they're going to be here?

461
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:12,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They would know if they were tuning in last week, which the request was last week, that they appear this week.

462
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:15,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, right?

463
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:20,266
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they get this agenda on Friday, they get everything that's going to be on this current week.

464
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:25,549
[SPEAKER_02]: If that information is not on this agenda, no one would know that they were ever going to be here to present.

465
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying.

466
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I agree with you.

467
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them here, believe me, and I want them to present.

468
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: But the general public wouldn't know they're going to be here if it's not on here again.

469
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:35,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying.

470
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:36,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all in agreement.

471
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:41,138
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just... Mr. President, all we have to do is put the paper from last week on the agenda.

472
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

473
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,031
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll take care.

474
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:46,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarponi.

475
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:47,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, thank you.

476
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:54,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, I'm glad to hear that there's a legitimate reason why department heads on here.

477
00:35:54,936 --> 00:36:00,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what's important is, again, it's not really the pre-budget discussions.

478
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:08,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It's making sure that this council hears from our major department heads moving into the budget season, which is, it's,

479
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the council president and city administration iron that out and get a schedule on what we have.

480
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:21,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally thought we were pretty clear on what we were asking for in the budget.

481
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, so I'm a little confused with that, but I think that it's important that we meet with these department heads and our department heads to make sure that as they step up to that, the pre-budget meetings and the budget meetings that we have all the information we need as a council

482
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:43,330
[SPEAKER_04]: to make educated decisions on fiscal affairs of this community.

483
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:50,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think if you look at it, that's truly our number one priority, if I'm not correct.

484
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is truly the most important thing we do now as our rule.

485
00:36:56,518 --> 00:37:02,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important that we get the assistance and the cooperation from everybody involved so we can make this happen.

486
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:07,384
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can make educated decisions when it comes to our budget.

487
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:19,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that just maybe the chief of staff can dispel some rumors, but the rumor out there is I got a phone call today saying, we're getting $39 million, we're getting $50 million.

488
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: What people don't really understand is what the true number is and how it's divided or where that can be spent.

489
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:33,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're already talking, just put it to a new fire station, put it to a new building, it's in the schools.

490
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:37,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just gotta make sure the community knows when these numbers come out.

491
00:37:38,179 --> 00:38:00,052
[SPEAKER_04]: that if we can get, Mr. Clerk, if we can get just a report just so maybe from the city administration, just so that people can understand what these monies that the state is releasing right now, that it isn't free cash that we can plug in anytime we want for the next six months, because I think that's the rumor that needs to be dispelled.

492
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:00,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

493
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:02,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

494
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:07,437
[SPEAKER_10]: My point was addressed earlier, so I'm all set, thank you.

496
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:13,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next week we'll have them on, this will be placed on the agenda on the reports due.

497
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:17,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone will have, it'll be on there.

498
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,718
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you'll be, the people will be notified.

499
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

500
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're on suspension, 21819, petition for a common victor's license.

[SPEAKER_07]: 189 petition for common victor's by Mark Kafua.

502

503
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:46,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll refer this to the Chairman of Licensing, Councilor Scarpelli.

504
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:47,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

505
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:49,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Kapoor here this evening.

506
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:52,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Dunkin' Donuts is on the line here.

[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who is on there.

508
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:58,734

522
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:39,483
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the actual, there's really, it looks like just a change of ownership, is that correct?

523
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:41,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

524
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:45,365

00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,424
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Method Nest.

577
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:47,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what I have on the agenda is a discussion of Method's pay to park program.

578
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:57,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe you gave me the catalyst to do this, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, because for some years you've asked for a report

579
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,667
[SPEAKER_06]: and we really haven't gotten a report.

580
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:01,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can hear me on this.

581
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:02,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this coming through?

582
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:04,208
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hear you.

583
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hear me, okay.

584
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:23,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'd like to go back to, as a quick side note, to September of 2009, when then Mayor McGlynn had a commission set up as it relates to how was parking going to be addressed in the city because it was a revenue item here in the city.

585
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:26,577
[SPEAKER_06]: At that point in time, Councilor Marks served on that committee

586
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:34,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of their recommendations was to possibly look into having a civilian parking commission in the city.

587
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that was in 2009.

588
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:48,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And it didn't take place until I believe it started in May of 2014, when then Mayor McGlynn decided we were going to do something about parking here in the city of Medford.

589
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:54,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a result of that, from the months of May through the months of December of 2014, we went through

590
00:42:56,884 --> 00:43:03,027
[SPEAKER_06]: an arduous task of reviewing how and what packing was going to be here in the city of Medford.

591
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:20,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm asking for is that a complete breakdown from inception, starting from calendar year 2015, right up to date, be brought forward, and I'm going to pass out something for all you councillors at the end, that we get so not only the U.S.

592
00:43:20,995 --> 00:43:25,437
[SPEAKER_06]: councillors, but we as citizens have an idea of just how much money that's coming in.

593
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:33,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Asking for a complete itemized detail is found in the contract that was signed by the city of Medford.

594
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that point in time, the public parking point, I believe has been resold.

595
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:53,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And it states on page five on section six on the gross revenue, it says within 20 days after the end of each month, the operator shall provide to the city a statement showing all revenue, including details

596
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:58,144
[SPEAKER_06]: of citation revenue, meter revenue, permit revenue, and other revenues.

597
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:07,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And this statement must include a copy of the monthly statement from the separate bank accounts utilized by the operator for the payments and received by the city of Medford.

598
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really not asking for anything other than what should be in this building right now.

599
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: But the only thing that this building has been able to afford was in the calendar year 2015 and the calendar year 2016, the first report

600
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:25,034
[SPEAKER_06]: that the then city council asked for.

601
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:28,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And subsequent to that, nothing has come forward.

602
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:36,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you have asked three times, Mr. President for a report, an itemized report for which the contract says they were obligated to do.

603
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:38,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not asking for anything that's outrageous.

604
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in this building somewhere, somehow.

605
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:52,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, another thing you need to remember is they said, they meaning Republic at the time, they said that the revenues coming into the city of Medford would be approximately $2 million per year.

606
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:55,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now we're into the end of the seventh year.

607
00:44:56,586 --> 00:45:04,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be approximately $14 million thereabouts to be accounted for according to their terms as it relates to what the revenues would be.

608
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:21,388
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you go on the Medford Parking Commission, they have a Google page here from the city of Medford and they extrapolated from Park Medford, a list of outstanding monies that have owned this old, the city of Medford

609
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: since 2015.

610
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:25,297
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2015, still owed, if I'm reading it correctly, it's $339,449.

611
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:25,597
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2016, it's $368,140.

612
00:45:25,697 --> 00:45:26,117
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2017, it's $375,611.

613
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:26,478
[SPEAKER_06]: 2018, it's $351,470.

614
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:26,818
[SPEAKER_06]: 2019, it's $339,449.

615
00:45:51,378 --> 00:45:56,881
[SPEAKER_06]: $148 and past year 2020 was $163,875.

616
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if I'm reading this correctly, but I'm standing here tonight to be corrected if I'm wrong.

617
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:10,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But from reading what Park Method has submitted and what the Method Parking Commission is saying, that's $1,937,693.

618
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:12,947
[SPEAKER_06]: That's outstanding.

619
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still owed here to the city of Medford.

620
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:15,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. President?

621
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Vice President Knight.

622
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Are those totals cumulative or are they annual?

623
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,112
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a random.

624
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:27,274
[SPEAKER_16]: So are you saying that in 2015, there was 300,000 now in 2016, there's 300,000 plus an additional 300,000?

625
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:27,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

626
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:29,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you saying that there's just $300,000?

627
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:35,237
[SPEAKER_06]: These amounts have yet to be accounted for as being satisfied.

628
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:37,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I question the account.

629
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:44,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just telling you with the traffic commission, parking commission, excuse me, it's put on their webpage.

630
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, as I said, I stand here to be corrected.

631
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:49,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus the fact, plus the fact I believe

632
00:46:51,574 --> 00:47:02,159
[SPEAKER_06]: the $2 million per year that was indicated was part of what park, I mean, Republic Parking said on October, 2014.

633
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:10,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we look and if these numbers are true, there's a little bit of a problem there, why they haven't been collected upon.

634
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:15,246
[SPEAKER_06]: But therefore, if we're getting $2 million a year for the last seven years, that's $14 million.

635
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:20,253
[SPEAKER_06]: years eight, nine, and 10, I believe are they're renegotiating yet.

636
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really don't know if the city's renegotiating.

637
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:27,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they have a new traffic commission, a group of people looking at where you should go and how you're going.

638
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you guys and Ms.

639
00:47:30,997 --> 00:47:35,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Morell, you should be up to date as it relates to, you know, what the city is doing with that.

640
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:41,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing is there is, and I believe- Mr. President.

641
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an October- What information council members?

642
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

643
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:53,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to make a point of information that we did discuss this with the representatives from Park Medford a few weeks ago.

644
00:47:53,572 --> 00:48:00,934
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one of the reasons that councilor Scarpelli put on the agenda, the amnesty program to try to collect some of the uncollected funds.

645
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:05,355
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are aware of the problem and there have been resolutions to address it.

646
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:07,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you councilor Best.

647
00:48:08,475 --> 00:48:09,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Being aware of the problem.

648
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:11,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So if in fact these numbers are any way correct, that's $1,937,000 takes back to 2015.

649
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:19,634
[SPEAKER_06]: there's something wrong with the city not being able to get that money, separate issue.

650
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:32,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking that one step forward, in October of 2014, for those of you that might remember, there was the argument of the five squares, Medford Square being one, would get on an annual basis $50,000.

651
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:38,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a ball of contention, especially here in the city of Medford, Chamber of Commerce, and then Mayor Mike McGlynn.

652
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:43,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But toward the end of the year, I believe it was in December of 2014, there was an agreement reached

653
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:56,748
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an agreement reached with Park Method as it relates to, they now, they would be willing to submit $250,000 would be earmarked.

654
00:48:57,188 --> 00:49:00,309
[SPEAKER_06]: $250,000 would be earmarked on an annual basis, 50,000 for each square.

655
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: They put that in their folder, in their folder that they passed out, which specifically states that $250,000 annually be subject to appropriation for the district improvement.

656
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:15,236
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the five districts here in the city of Metro.

657
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's been some conversation with the chamber, and I know it's been asked a couple of times, but if that'd be the case, that $50,000 a year going forward for four of the last five years would be approximately $200,000 each square that they haven't seen.

658
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:42,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the accounting of the money, this goes back to like last week on the water money, on the fees, there has to be an accounting where it's going, how it's being spent, I don't know.

659
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:48,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you take that, put that all together, Mr. President, Mr. Messenger, could you please pass this up?

660
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:55,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking on this particular issue here.

661
00:49:57,525 --> 00:50:12,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to know that while you might be having a commission or a committee to be looking at the parking revenues, there doesn't seem to be anything going forward because it states on page six, I believe, of the contract

662
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:27,577
[SPEAKER_06]: that this has to be a renegotiating year with the people that we have in the city right now, years eight, nine, and 10, is the city in fact in a negotiation with the parking company?

663
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,599
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, we're on the one year contract now.

664
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on a one year contract.

665
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

666
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:42,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, if we're on a one year contract, which is year eight, which we're on right now, it's possible at any point in time, this contract ends at the end of this year.

667
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be up to the administration whether they want to.

668
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's up to the administration that that be the case.

669
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I would thank Mr. President if in fact that the two million dollars was the estimated amount that we would be getting on an annual basis and we're looking at 1.9 million plus and monies that are owed.

670
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:04,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's not jiving here because those monies whether they're making the two million dollars a year or not

671
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:10,478
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you let each and every year, how do you let that just continue to escalate and escalate and escalate?

672
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:11,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

673
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:15,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unfair to the people who pay every single day to use the meters.

674
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's unfair as to the contract as it's written.

675
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:27,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's either a lack of enforcement or I'm reading these numbers wrong, or there's something wrong on the adding and subtracting of how this money's being spent.

676
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: What you have here, what I gave you comes right out of the contract.

677
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The contract is even more specific and more definitive as to what you're looking for.

678
00:51:39,571 --> 00:51:44,432
[SPEAKER_06]: That, as it's written, tells you basically how much money is coming in and where's the majority of it going.

679
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:57,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The key point to all of this is whether you stay with the company you have now or you go with a new company, you have an in-house, something has to be considered as it relates to outstanding liabilities.

680
00:51:57,755 --> 00:51:59,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't run $1,900,000 in an ongoing liability that started from day one.

681
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:06,600
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't make any sense.

682
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:15,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would hope that somebody would make a resolution and ask for an annual breakdown of Park Method.

683
00:52:15,544 --> 00:52:18,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what the contract says does for the city.

684
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:20,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

685
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:23,388
[SPEAKER_07]: You're approaching your 10 minute time, Mr. Penta.

686
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:23,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it again.

687
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:25,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, you're approaching your 10 minutes.

688
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what I'm asking.

689
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: If a council wants to make that recommendation that they're more than welcome.

690
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:41,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Benton.

691
00:52:41,711 --> 00:52:42,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's going to do it?

692
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,213
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you asking for?

693
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:53,594
[SPEAKER_06]: What I gave you right there is a sample of what's on page six, section, I believe.

694
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:54,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

695
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:56,935
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you asking us to ask Parkman?

696
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:06,738
[SPEAKER_06]: For five years, since inception, from 2015, coming forward, how you got to your revenues, how did you get to your receipts, how did you get to your expenses?

697
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You've only done it twice.

698
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:16,997
[SPEAKER_16]: When this is a public participation item, I believe the proper procedure would be that the council would take it up and place it on the agenda next week.

699
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:18,818
[SPEAKER_16]: It will be correct.

700
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it again.

701
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:27,725
[SPEAKER_07]: If you, uh, I say that can, uh, if they have a council, well, we can put that on next week's agenda, um, for a motion.

702
00:53:29,746 --> 00:53:32,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, because this is public participation, we changed the rules.

[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rodriguez, can you, as the city, come up with a plan yet for the outdoor dining for the restaurants for the spring and summer season?

725
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I hope Councilor Scarpelli is OK.

726
00:55:03,827 --> 00:55:06,049

00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:10,593
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make a resolution to get new chairs.

729
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:14,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully you won't Incredible Hulk after I give my answer.

730
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:19,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the city administration has been working pretty hard on this in advance of the spring season.

731
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:23,826
[SPEAKER_09]: We do know that the outdoor dining, unfortunately, had to happen.

732
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:25,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of a necessity.

733
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:26,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the mother of invention.

734
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:31,653
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to be rolling out the program very shortly in the next couple of weeks on this, but it was a great success for the restaurants that participated.

735
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:34,195
[SPEAKER_09]: The city was awarded a shared streets grant through the Mass Department of Transportation.

736
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:43,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Governor Governor Baker actually came to use some of the stuff that we had going on in West Medford Square, so we will be rolling out the program very shortly in the next couple weeks.

737
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:44,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be the

738
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:54,011
[SPEAKER_09]: who's done some great business resiliency work up at OCD.

739
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:57,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will be a rolling application period.

740
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So applications will be available.

741
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:01,296
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be due on April 5th.

742
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:04,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll start the deployment of some of the Jersey barriers and other

743
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:08,459
[SPEAKER_09]: infrastructure that that's in place by hopefully by April 15th.

744
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:10,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That's of course, weather permitting.

745
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are very hopeful to do that and we'll continue to roll that throughout the spring and summer season.

746
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:24,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, we will be because of the success of the program, and because of kind of the feedback that we got from restaurants, that the law department is working

747
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:36,692
[SPEAKER_09]: with the mayor's office in order to present a streamlined ordinance for outdoor dining so that we can continue to do this year over year based upon the great success that we had and the feedback that we received from some restaurants.

748
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:38,473
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really excited to roll this out.

749
00:56:38,493 --> 00:56:39,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It was such a great program.

750
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:43,157
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate all the support from the restaurants and all the cooperation.

751
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're excited to roll it back out.

752
00:56:45,479 --> 00:56:49,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you said you have a tentative date of April 15th.

753
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:50,683
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking for a weather permitting?

754
00:56:51,595 --> 00:56:57,399
[SPEAKER_09]: whether that's a loose date, we can get to as soon as everything's available to get to the application period.

755
00:56:57,479 --> 00:57:00,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it is, we designed it as a rolling application period.

756
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:05,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll have April 5th will be the date to apply, buy, so that we can get our stuff together.

757
00:57:05,485 --> 00:57:08,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll open up another period, another period, another period.

758
00:57:08,727 --> 00:57:13,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did hear back from some restaurants who are doing some outdoor improvements because they are excited about the program.

759
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:15,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So we wanna be able to accommodate them as well.

760
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:19,995
[SPEAKER_09]: We're expecting a larger, we were expecting more folks to participate than last year.

761
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:21,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

762
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:28,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Knight, this current program's being offered under the governor's executive order, is that correct?

763
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:33,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, that extends out to, I believe, 90 days after the declared state of emergency ends.

764
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:47,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So in anticipation of the state of emergency ending at some point, it's gotta end at some point, we will present a more formalized process to the council for their consideration to be codified to replace the existing outdoor dining policy that exists.

765
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:56,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And David, if you can reach out to the Chamber of Commerce and send something to them to make sure they kept in the loop so they can notify their members, it would be appreciated.

766
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:57,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure thing.

767
00:57:57,357 --> 00:58:00,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Miranda Briseño has been working pretty closely with them, so I'll make sure she touches base.

768
00:58:00,718 --> 00:58:01,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

769
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any further discussion?

770
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,541
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco.

771

[SPEAKER_16]: And just recently, she celebrated her 93rd birthday.

792
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:57,340
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you know Mary, you know she's someone who's full of life, who enjoys her time down the beach in Cape Cod.

793
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,282

808
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:53,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President, it's with great anticipation that many of us await the opening of our schools for in-person learning on a full-time basis.

809
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:59,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And with that being said, we're going to see an influx of vehicles driving to middle schools and schools.

810
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:05,947
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you look at Freedom Way and the condition that the roadway is in, I think it's an area that needs some attention, Mr. President, before the schools open back up.

811
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:13,532
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm asking that DPW go down there and take a look and do some patchwork to ensure that when school does open, that it's safe and also

812
01:00:14,338 --> 01:00:19,703
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can just amend the resolution, also take a look at the crosswalks to be sure that they're properly striped and not school districts.

[SPEAKER_07]: Please take a moment of silence.

849
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:46,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

850
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:48,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

851
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:48,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

852
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:50,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

853
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:51,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

854
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:52,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

855
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:52,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

856
01:02:53,525 --> 01:02:54,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

857
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:54,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

858
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

859
01:02:58,106 --> 01:02:58,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

860
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

861
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:00,767
Yes.

862
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraviello.

863
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

864
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:14,950
[SPEAKER_07]: 21188 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide the city council with requirements and criteria for establishing a ghost kitchen

865
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,491
[SPEAKER_07]: in the city of Medford.

866
01:03:17,312 --> 01:03:18,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

867
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:21,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

868
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:31,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Ghost Kitchens are an interesting new business model that's been popping up around the city, and it's something that's sparked my curiosity more than anything else.

869
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,266
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I've noticed we have Kiki's Barbecue.

870
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,248
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Mr. Beast Burger.

871
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:44,868
[SPEAKER_16]: We have Guy Fiori's Flavortown Kitchen, all ghost kitchens that are operating out of the city of Metchen.

872
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:53,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just wondering what the regulatory criteria was, whether or not the Board of Health had some sort of filing process that was necessary, Mr. President.

873
01:03:53,355 --> 01:04:02,783
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason that I ask is because, God forbid, somebody ordered delivery from one of these places and got sick and then wanted to call the establishment or reach out to the establishment for whatever reason they may have to.

874
01:04:03,763 --> 01:04:04,544
[SPEAKER_16]: They won't be able to find them.

875
01:04:05,192 --> 01:04:10,114
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to be sure, Mr. President, that there was some sort of process or what that process wants in place right now.

876
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:17,496
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just asking the question from our Director of the Board of Health and the city administration as to what the process is for applying for a ghost kitchen, if there even is one.

877
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,277
[SPEAKER_16]: It's as simple as that.

878
01:04:20,597 --> 01:04:29,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight, if you wouldn't mind if I amend that to find out if they pay meals taxes.

879
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,781
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly wouldn't have a problem with that.

880
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city of Bedford, I don't know

881
01:04:34,394 --> 01:04:36,916
[SPEAKER_07]: if they do or they do not, I'd like to know if they do collect that.

882
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:41,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other further discussion on this?

883
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

884
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if I could, Mr. President, I think it would be interesting to find out, but it's my understanding that this is an agreement between whatever the ghost kitchen is, like Guy Fieri, and the establishment, and everything's prepared on site at that establishment.

885
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're preparing it on behalf of, actually, Guy Fieri can't be at

886
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,381
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 ghost kitchens throughout the country.

887
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:06,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my understanding.

888
01:05:06,981 --> 01:05:10,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume everything would apply, but I think it would be interesting to find out.

889
01:05:11,422 --> 01:05:15,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, I'm kind of curious myself to see where they go with this.

890
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,964
[SPEAKER_16]: In essence, it's the subletting of your license, right?

891
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:19,284
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

892
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:22,125
[SPEAKER_16]: In essence, it's subleasing your existing license.

893
01:05:22,225 --> 01:05:22,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

894
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:25,386
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what they're doing, the subletting.

895
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:29,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I don't know if subletting of a license is illegal.

896
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:34,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not opposed to it, Mr. President, quite frankly, I think it brings a lot of options and opportunity to the community.

897
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:37,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to be sure that we're doing it right and we're protected.

898
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:37,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

899
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:47,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

900
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

901
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

902
01:05:53,802 --> 01:05:54,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

903
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:55,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

904
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:57,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

905
01:05:57,232 --> 01:05:57,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

906
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:58,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight?

907
01:05:58,533 --> 01:05:58,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

908
01:06:11,578 --> 01:06:13,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I think we lost chamber audio.

909
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,240
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got you.

910
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:22,542
[SPEAKER_15]: We have you back now.

911
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:23,782
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

912
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:25,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell, we're asking for your vote.

913
01:06:25,923 --> 01:06:26,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

914
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:28,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

915
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

916
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:31,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

917
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,702
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caraviello.

918
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:32,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

919
01:06:32,982 --> 01:06:34,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the affirmative motion passes.

920
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Communications from the mayor.

921
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:37,086
21190.

922
01:06:39,888 --> 01:06:40,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. President.

923
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:49,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I hereby propose the following amendment to the revised ordinances of the city of Bedford.

924
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:57,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Section 94-35A of the revised ordinance of the city of Bedford, Massachusetts is hereby amended to read as follows.

925
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:09,680
[SPEAKER_07]: A, a board of appeals provided under Mass General Law chapter 48 section 12 is hereby established consisting of five members who shall be appointed by the mayor.

926
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,681
[SPEAKER_07]: The members shall serve a term of three years.

927
01:07:13,182 --> 01:07:14,783
[SPEAKER_07]: The members shall be residents of the city.

928
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:20,987
[SPEAKER_07]: The board shall annually elect a chairman among its own members and a clerk.

929
01:07:21,227 --> 01:07:25,430
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor shall also annually appoint two associate members

930
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:43,068
[SPEAKER_07]: of such Board of Appeals who shall each be appointed for a one-year term and who shall sit on the Board upon the designation of the Chairman to act in the event of a vacancy, or the absence or inability to act, or an interest on the part of a member thereof.

931
01:07:43,808 --> 01:07:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Members and the associate members shall serve until a successor is appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed.

932
01:07:51,389 --> 01:07:53,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Submitted by Her Honor the Mayor, Brianna Lundgren.

933
01:07:54,854 --> 01:08:00,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, motion to refer to a committee of the whole with our zoning consultant, Mark Wrobroski.

934
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:11,083
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion by vice president Knight to refer this to a committee of the whole and discuss it with our zoning consultant, Mark Wrobroski.

935
01:08:11,103 --> 01:08:11,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded.

936
01:08:12,564 --> 01:08:14,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by councilor Scarpelli.

937
01:08:14,866 --> 01:08:15,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion on this?

938
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:16,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

939
01:08:17,773 --> 01:08:18,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knox.

940
01:08:19,193 --> 01:08:20,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

941
01:08:20,274 --> 01:08:27,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a question and a request that they may provide us with an explanation on the reason for the change.

942
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Mr. President, I'm under the opinion that the ordinance requires that the term of each of the three members that currently sit on the Board of Appeals expire every one year.

943
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:48,739
[SPEAKER_04]: meaning none of the members will be up all at once.

944
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:54,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And currently, I believe we have a situation where all the members are currently expired.

945
01:08:55,022 --> 01:08:57,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of concerned how that happened.

946
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:00,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, Mr. President, it's important that

947
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We have continuity on that board.

948
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very important board.

949
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:05,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very technical board.

950
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:08,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very important board in this community.

951
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:17,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's extremely important that we have always a consistent experience knowledge base on that board.

952
01:09:18,014 --> 01:09:20,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason for the staggered terms.

953
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:30,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering if the mayor can answer the reason for the change and why are all three appointments currently expired from my understanding.

954
01:09:31,976 --> 01:09:35,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rodriguez, can you answer Council Mark's questions?

955
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:40,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:54,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks makes a really important point about continuity and kind of that institutional knowledge that board members that have, although there is, and there's also the balance that exists with new voices and diversity of voices across the community.

957
01:09:54,456 --> 01:10:05,460
[SPEAKER_09]: This for a board of this importance, and again, to Councilor Marks' point, this is one of the most influential policymaking boards that the city has, and it's only three members, three voting members.

958
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So expanding it to five members,

959
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:21,953
[SPEAKER_09]: would allow for a greater diversity of voices that represents the entire community a little bit more equitably, as well as expanding it to two associate members to be able to have it be a seven total participating member board, a five member voting board.

960
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:27,038
[SPEAKER_09]: To answer the question about the staggered terms, it is an issue that we are well aware of.

961
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:29,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working to rectify.

962
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,163
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not exactly, it isn't limited to the Board of Appeals.

963
01:10:33,704 --> 01:10:34,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that we have to do

964
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:56,589
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're working on in order to find a way to move forward on to make sure that we do have those staggered terms that they do, that we have one member falling off every year or one member, two member, one member falling off every year so that we're able to have both that institutional knowledge as well as that fresh organic turnover that happens on boards and commissions that allow for the greater diversity of voices and kind of the fresh ideas.

965
01:10:57,249 --> 01:11:01,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are points extremely well taken, Councilor Marks, and appreciated as well.

966
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:06,033
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the general reasoning behind the policy change from the mayor.

967
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:16,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're happy to discuss that with the zoning consultant or with the CD board as part of the 40A section five process, which requires that referral.

968
01:11:18,299 --> 01:11:24,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I could, Mr. President, just to follow up, and I appreciate the chief of staff's response.

969
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dave, based on the terms that are supposed to expire every year, is it the fact that there's been at least two of these positions that have been expired for the past two years?

970
01:11:39,665 --> 01:11:43,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, were they eligible to vote during the past two years?

971
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:49,428
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the ordinance, holdovers can vote, can move and participate, they serve until they're replaced.

972
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:57,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so the votes, and I'll defer to legal as to the legality of the votes that they took, but it is our understanding that that is the case.

973
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,943
[SPEAKER_09]: How it happened was, it appears to be

974
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:10,846
[SPEAKER_09]: not a problem that we can pinpoint the exact genesis of, but it looks to be something that folks were getting year-over-year appointments, folks were leaving, and they weren't filling out appointments.

975
01:12:11,466 --> 01:12:17,208
[SPEAKER_09]: They were getting new one-year appointments, so everything got kind of clumped and clustered together over time.

976
01:12:17,248 --> 01:12:27,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks were getting 18-month appointments, some folks were getting one-year appointments, so we're untangling it to try to figure out why, but we want to move forward with it to be able to make sure that they are staggered.

977
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:39,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And did your office get any input from the public or local attorneys that currently use the board on this change?

978
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you solicited any responses at all?

979
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:45,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't asked local attorneys for further input.

980
01:12:46,316 --> 01:12:54,099
[SPEAKER_09]: When we did do the call for committee membership, we did have some really robust feedback from the public on folks that want to serve on this board.

981
01:12:54,859 --> 01:13:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of the reasons, this was something that we kind of developed pretty early on in the administration that got shelved over time.

982
01:13:02,202 --> 01:13:07,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that we reignited in the last couple of months as a discussion internally to present before the council.

983
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's something that we've been thinking about doing for a long time.

984
01:13:10,405 --> 01:13:18,051
[SPEAKER_09]: to reflect that greater diversity of voices as well as the robust feedback that we got from the general public with our call for board and commission membership.

985
01:13:20,512 --> 01:13:26,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And the holdover that you refer to, are you saying that's part of a current ordinance?

986
01:13:28,498 --> 01:13:31,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm just reading the ordinance that's presented.

987
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:35,864
[SPEAKER_09]: The only two words that change are five and two, they change from three

988
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:43,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And one, the last sentence, members and associate members shall serve until a successor is appointed and qualified and less sooner removed.

989
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:51,551
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the holdover provision inside the language to prevent, to allow the board to keep working if there is a reason for a holdover.

990
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:58,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so under that particular section, then there would never be a need to ever appoint anyone ever again.

991
01:14:00,163 --> 01:14:03,886
[SPEAKER_09]: In theory, yes, but that won't be the practice now.

992
01:14:04,026 --> 01:14:06,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that's what's been working out.

993
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:09,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we are trying to understand that, but in theory, yeah.

994
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we have to review, Mr. President, as well.

995
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate the response, and I would ask that that be put in the form of an amendment so we can get a response in writing.

996
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

997
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:27,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by

998
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:35,402

1028
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:51,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

1029
01:15:52,055 --> 01:15:55,217
[SPEAKER_13]: We met last, well, yes, last Monday.

1030
01:15:56,847 --> 01:15:58,668
[SPEAKER_13]: And we met regarding a few different papers.

1031
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:08,013
[SPEAKER_13]: We had some updates on the local housing stability initiatives that have been undertaken by this council, by the administration, by the community preservation committee.

1032
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:22,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will be having a future meeting on that item discussing eligibility for the rental assistance program and inviting some members of the health department to figure out how we can incorporate housing work into the permanent social work planning that they are conducting.

1033
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:33,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco's housing stability notification ordinance proposal was sent to the solicitor and the director of community development for drafting of an ordinance.

1034
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:47,904
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also will be having a future meeting regarding the health and safety inspections for housing units in the city with health department and building department staff who are responsible for those items.

1035
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1054
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have any questions?

1055
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:20,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1056
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:25,483
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, Councilor Falco, Councilor Marks, my committee members on public works.

1057
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:40,336
[SPEAKER_13]: We discussed the snow shoveling ordinance, and we currently have a request in with the DPW commissioner regarding priority sidewalks, as well as a request to the city solicitor to review proposed language in the paper regarding a few items.

1058
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:45,700
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will be having a future meeting with members of the administration to continue moving the process forward.

1059
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:46,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1060
01:17:47,398 --> 01:17:47,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1061
01:17:47,878 --> 01:17:51,980
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Bailey, seconded by Councilor Marksx.

1062
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,741
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could just add to what Councilor Bailey has just stated.

1063
01:17:56,682 --> 01:17:59,723
[SPEAKER_05]: We've met several times with the Public Works Subcommittee.

1064
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:16,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Just recently, we got a response back from Brian Kerins, the BPW Commissioner, at the request of the subcommittee to look at priority sidewalks throughout the city and create connectivity with the schools, with public transportation,

1065
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: with bus shelters and access on sidewalks that would create roughly probably 30 to 40 to 50 miles of connectivity throughout the community.

1066
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:39,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really surprised, and I think some of my colleagues were surprised as well, to hear the amount of money that this would cost.

1067
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:46,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very, very reasonable, Mr. President, to do this connectivity during any storm that's greater than

1068
01:18:47,262 --> 01:18:47,882
[SPEAKER_04]: three inches.

1069
01:18:48,642 --> 01:19:09,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look forward to making a recommendation out of this subcommittee eventually that will work hand in hand with the new ordinance, as well as the connectivity that would open up access to walkways and crosswalks and really create a safe environment for pedestrians.

1070
01:19:09,347 --> 01:19:15,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is pretty exciting and I look forward to the next several meetings where we can make recommendations

1071
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:22,904
[SPEAKER_04]: to this council because eventually it's going to come to funding, but I don't think you can put a dollar amount on public safety.

1072
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:23,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1073
01:19:24,105 --> 01:19:24,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1074
01:19:24,525 --> 01:19:25,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

1075
01:19:25,885 --> 01:19:28,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Now on the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1092
01:19:50,573 --> 01:20:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a report, a continuing committee on the zoning recartification with Mark Hrabowski, and there will be another meeting on Thursday night.

1093
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:06,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, this is a continual work in progress.

1094
01:20:06,358 --> 01:20:09,218

1160
01:22:54,322 --> 01:23:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that actually mean that these signs have already been installed and are up and functioning?

1161
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not think the hotel is actually open yet.

1162
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:09,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be wrong, but I don't think the hotel is actually open yet.

1163
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:12,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I don't think so either.

1164
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to leave this on the table?

1165
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:18,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll also leave 20563 on the table.

1166
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:20,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, same thing.

1167
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:26,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion to leave- It's already on the table.

1168
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, just keep the table.

1169
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:28,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1170
01:23:30,869 --> 01:23:31,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Members.

1171
01:23:31,572 --> 01:23:45,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Just maybe moving forward when we go over these reviews, whether it's 30, 60, or 90, we should always put language in that states from the day of opening or the day of sign installation.

1172
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:58,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way we have an understanding that we're viewing this process that the whole intent of this is to make sure that these signs weren't glaring in residents' eyes at station landing and so forth.

1173
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:01,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we just wanna make sure that we're doing the right thing.

1174
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:06,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by, I think they're already open.

[SPEAKER_07]: We'll keep that on the table.

1185
01:24:46,134 --> 01:24:50,677
[SPEAKER_16]: With the pandemic guidelines and restrictions that are in place, I don't think we're going to get a true picture.

1186
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:54,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else that I forgot on here?

1187
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:58,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've got them all for the moment.

1200
01:25:54,371 --> 01:26:03,373
