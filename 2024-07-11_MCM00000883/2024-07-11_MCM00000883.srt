[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

58
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

59
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:58,336
[SPEAKER_08]: The first item on the agenda for tonight is just the approval of the minutes from our last full meeting.

60
00:01:58,757 --> 00:01:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: They are in your packet.

61
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:04,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So as part of the consent agenda, is there a motion to approve the consent agenda?

62
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

80
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:31,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

81
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:32,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy Keene, absent.

82
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:34,276

85
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:37,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

86
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:38,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke Preissner.

87
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

88
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,092
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, nine in the affirmative, zero in the negative, six absent.

89
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:46,893
[SPEAKER_08]: The minutes are approved.

90
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:53,636
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so I just wanted to give you all a deliverable status overall.

91
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, we have five.

92
00:02:55,497 --> 00:03:00,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll call it six things, but with five official things that have to be done in the eligibility phase.

93
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,100
[SPEAKER_08]: The MSBA let us know that our

94
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,382
[SPEAKER_08]: ICC, which is the legal agreement, has been approved.

95
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:11,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is complete and approved.

96
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:16,044
[SPEAKER_08]: We have submitted our SBC form, our school building committee form.

97
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:18,405
[SPEAKER_08]: They reviewed it, and they have approved it.

98
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:21,186
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are done and approved on item number two.

99
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:26,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Last meeting, we approved the chapter 74 form as amended.

100
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:33,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That one has not been submitted yet, but that is just a matter of collecting up all the paperwork and doing some final editing, and that will be submitted.

101
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:42,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number four is the educational profile, which I am hopeful that we will get to today.

102
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:58,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the final pieces include the maintenance plan profile, which we will talk about today and potentially provide an approval by this group to go ahead and submit that as soon as it's complete.

103
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:03,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the final big thing that we will have to do, well, there's two more things.

104
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:08,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's data about enrollment that has to be submitted that is in process.

105
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:19,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not require approval of this body, but we are working with Alicia Hunt, as well as Gerry McCue, who's our CFO here and are on track to get that completed.

106
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:25,994
[SPEAKER_08]: The very last thing that we will have to do is earmark funds for the feasibility study.

107
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:34,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to let you all know that you can expect to see that on the city council agenda on the 25th, which is a Tuesday evening.

108
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:44,421
[SPEAKER_08]: The request will come from the mayor to use free cash to set aside funds for the feasibility study.

109
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,462
[SPEAKER_08]: The exact amount is still

110
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:55,728
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit of a TBD because there's a little bit more legwork to do to make sure that we get the right number, but we know what that range needs to be.

111
00:04:55,869 --> 00:05:00,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a couple more conversations to have and then the mayor will make that request to the council.

112
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:04,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully the council will approve that on the 25th.

113
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:09,800
[SPEAKER_08]: MSBA has already signed off on the language that will go before the council to be approved.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,143
[SPEAKER_08]: They are fine with it and they are ready to watch and hear that that's approved.

115
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:20,028
[SPEAKER_08]: They did say that they will schedule our enrollment meeting like once that happens.

116
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:36,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the fact that we're going to do that in June is good because then we can accelerate that piece of it, which really would position us for a much earlier view by the board than next February, which is when we would sort of be scheduled if we take full time.

117
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just a quick update.

118
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:41,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions?

119
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:52,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

120
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,834
[SPEAKER_08]: The other announcement related is that we have finished the first draft of the website.

121
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:05,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask Tom to send that out to everybody after this evening.

122
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:15,604
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to take a look, if you have any questions or comments or suggestions, please, by all means, let Tom know what they are, and he will work on integrating any of those things.

123
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:26,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We are on our way there and positioned for being able to use that to start to talk to the community when we are ready for that.

124
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:38,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the last thing, we did have a subcommittee meeting earmarked for June 20th for the communication subcommittee, and that meeting will be canceled.

125
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:53,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will reach out to the communications team to find another Zoom time for us so we can move forward on some of the preparation things that we were talking about at our last meeting.

126
00:06:53,976 --> 00:07:00,439
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will tell you for sure it will not happen probably until the beginning of July.

127
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,752
[SPEAKER_08]: because I don't have any minutes left in the day.

128
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sure that's true of everybody.

129
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,936
[SPEAKER_08]: It's June and it's just sort of a full court press.

130
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:12,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll spend some time in the summer to do that.

131
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:21,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And our summer meetings will be on the schedule unless we are in a true holding pattern and in which case I will let you know and we'll cancel those meetings.

132
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:25,749
[SPEAKER_08]: But my plan is for the summer meetings to be Zoom only so everyone can be where they are.

133
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make sense?

134
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everybody okay with that?

135
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:34,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

136
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so on to the next item.

137
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,361
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a look at the ed profile again.

138
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: What I did since we last spoke is integrate feedback that I got from lots of people.

139
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:51,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Maria.

140
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:53,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Libby.

141
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:54,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Luke.

142
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Tracy.

143
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,171
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys really crushed it in the performing arts.

144
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:04,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I wanted to do, what I'm hoping that we can do tonight.

145
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Paul.

146
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:11,416
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm hoping we can do tonight is sort of collect any additional feedback that you have.

147
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:18,338
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some placeholders in here that are contingent on the staff having some time to meet with all the district administrators.

148
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I'm hoping that we can do is,

149
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:47,725
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about what we see here, talk about any additional suggestions, agree on the things that are listed here as placeholders, and provide an approval as amended and to be completed so that, you know, and we'll share the final copy with you all, but if you do that, that will give me the leeway to sort of collect up all the last pieces and get this submitted as well, which I would like to do before June 30th.

150
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:55,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple of big changes that I made, let's see, are start on page.

151
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The one big change that I made starts on page eight, which provides a deeper description of the library in its current form.

152
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:14,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Maria.

153
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is one change that has been made.

154
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:27,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there is reference to the library as well down in the non-traditional and other spaces section.

155
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:47,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Then if we fast forward to page 12, this is the section that got

156
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:57,795
[SPEAKER_08]: a really substantive overhaul based on all the things that were provided to me.

157
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:11,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the top of page 13 in course spaces, still to be added to this document, just for sort of everybody to sort of shake their head and say yes, those are the things.

158
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: There is some discussion about Curtis Tufts that has to go into this section.

159
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:27,921
[SPEAKER_08]: There is discussion about early EEC, early education and childcare, so that is both our Chapter 74 program as well as our NEAP programs.

160
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:37,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Kids Corner, which is our daycare program for Medford Public Schools employees, and certainly they are at capacity.

161
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:50,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there would be no shortage of people interested in that service if there was space to increase enrollment and open that up to the public.

162
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:59,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the final thing that is on the to-be-added list in core spaces is that felt integration project that we talked about.

163
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:09,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Susanne was looking for some information about what that said so that we can sort of paint some broad strokes about that as well in terms of this is our sort of goal.

164
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,799
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll stop talking.

165
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:17,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions, thoughts, changes about the course basis section?

166
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:22,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

167
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:22,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

168
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:22,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

169
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,482
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're volunteering, I will sign you up to do that.

170
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:27,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

171
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:28,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

172
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:29,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

173
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:45,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe some of these suggestions based on this piece of property.

174
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:50,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you foresee what you will make for the location?

175
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,059
[SPEAKER_08]: That will all happen in the feasibility study.

176
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is some time from now.

177
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, in some places, try to

178
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of describe that and it's probably buried in one of these sections and so what the other thing I'll do is find it and put it at the top of this section as well.

179
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:16,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I hinted it in the site section.

180
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:18,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think that danced around it but yeah.

181
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:25,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I will, I am making a note that we will add that.

182
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:28,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

183
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:49,831
[SPEAKER_05]: current spaces, and any discussion of proposed changes to current spaces.

184
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:57,815
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sort of constrained by thinking and applying to this as the current space.

185
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:10,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't interpret this as involved in a design concept, because logically, they arise and arrive in details.

186
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:24,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I read some of this, especially on page 13, it seems like it's a design vision suit, a multi-part design vision that's being proposed.

187
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:36,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm asking the committee at large, is that appropriate statement to include in this document

188
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:48,771
[SPEAKER_08]: So I asked a similar question of MSBA when I spoke with them.

189
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:57,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they said was they use the information in this section to get a feel for the kind of building we're trying to create.

190
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:02,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that is like an answer and a non-answer.

191
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:10,026
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought about that, too, as I was pulling in some of Tracy's content.

192
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:21,519
[SPEAKER_08]: to bring that to this group because I read it and I was like, I can see what he's talking about.

193
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I can visualize

194
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:30,282
[SPEAKER_08]: what he's saying when he talks about the performing arts space in this building.

195
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:37,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I found it very helpful to read that to get a sense of, do I agree with this, yes or no?

196
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:40,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I did for the by and large.

197
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:43,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not an expert in space.

198
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:46,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, Tracy thinks we probably do.

199
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:50,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put it in here with that in mind, which is to say,

200
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:59,982
[SPEAKER_08]: designer or MSBA is trying to understand where our head is at.

201
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:05,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this sufficiently describes how we're currently feeling about the performing arts.

202
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:17,791
[SPEAKER_08]: So Libby and Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of your experience in this space and whether you feel strongly about what's here.

203
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:18,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it too much?

204
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it not enough, et cetera?

205
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can get a huge amount

206
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:23,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

207
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:23,643
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

208
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:31,947
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm saying is, I took this question as being scopely written.

209
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't disagree with any of what Patrice is proposing here.

210
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:38,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that the question doesn't belong in this document.

211
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,877
I think it does.

212
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:57,398
I would take this as an outline and a chance to show them the vision.

213
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,119
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I wouldn't limit it.

214
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:02,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they penalize anybody for adding too much information.

215
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we propose a vision for other activities?

216
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:08,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

217
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do that for Curtis Tufts too.

218
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:10,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

219
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:14,345
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, because I wasn't sure in terms of

220
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:23,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because it's very different.

221
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I like what Joan and I wrote in the back.

222
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:37,117
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we're looking at core spaces and what we need out of space, I would want to move what we have currently inside the building.

223
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Just flatten it, you know what I mean?

224
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Or make it round or something.

225
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just would like to take the philosophy, like shoot for the moon, like we said.

226
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we're going to have time during

227
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:50,786
[SPEAKER_09]: our admin meetings to work on it, which will be great.

228
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:51,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

229
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,127
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're signing up for that, that's great.

230
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll sign up for it with Joan.

231
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:06,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, Luke, I think as you read this, if there are changes in that vein that paint a bigger picture, I think that's great.

232
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:17,356
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I think we can use this document for is when we went to Arlington and we walked around a brand new building,

233
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:21,349
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing you saw was like a student-run cafe.

234
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:29,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody in this building is like dreaming about a student-run cafe because

235
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:36,764
[SPEAKER_08]: It's beyond the scope of what, by and large, we know to be about high school.

236
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have a student-run cafe.

237
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:40,387
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't have a student-run cafe.

238
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:43,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Those weren't things back when we were kids going to high school.

239
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know what's in this building.

240
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people probably know what those options are.

241
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:52,959
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think this is also a nice opportunity for us to say to the community,

242
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:58,013
[SPEAKER_08]: here's this big vision, like, here's where we're at right now.

243
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:05,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the beginning, because I think it could get juices flowing, which will like feed into the feasibility study.

244
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:07,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke.

245
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:20,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say, okay, by allowing us to make strong statements, and have it

246
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:27,248
captured in this document, which is the official record.

247
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:36,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I worry that we drown out the voices that we've not heard from yet, that we haven't engaged with yet.

248
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost like we're taking a hold of the headline, and we're driving in the directions that we want, without even doing an initial read.

249
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to happen.

250
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that could be a process problem.

251
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:59,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to bring it up.

252
00:18:59,082 --> 00:18:59,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

253
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:05,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I think also just remember that this is a great time to be visionary and think of big ideas, but also it will not limit what goes in the building.

254
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:10,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's still going to be a programming process where you'll go through with every space that needs to be in the building.

255
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:17,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will include big, great ideas, new spaces that no one's even thought of yet, but also down to offices and admissions spaces.

256
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:22,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yes, we should make sure we're not overlooking anybody that feels like they're being left out of the vision.

257
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, we're not limited to this space.

258
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:30,172
[SPEAKER_11]: So if another great idea comes up later, or just important space that hasn't been mentioned, I'll still use it.

259
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:35,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the other thing that is important to remember is that

260
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:41,717
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no requirement even that the school building committee is involved in the creation of this document.

261
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:45,059
[SPEAKER_08]: The requirement is that it is submitted by the district.

262
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's appropriate for this team to start to paint a picture for people to react to.

263
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'm OK with that.

264
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm personally OK with that.

265
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I think to the point of engaging the community,

266
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:08,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to engage the community when there's experts in the room who can do that well.

267
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:24,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want us to be too far out ahead of that process because I think none of us, particularly, is equipped to do that kind of visioning process with the community in a way that's going to be consistent with what has to happen during feasibility.

268
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want to create a situation where we are

269
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,714
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of out over our skis essentially.

270
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:53,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think like what I would use this document when we sort of get to the point of publishing this to the community, I mean, they can, it's in the meeting documents and everything, but to say like, this is our, this is like the jumping off point that the committee accelerated to get us to the place where like,

271
00:20:54,365 --> 00:21:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: the door, we can open the doors to this bigger vision, but we want you to read this and start to think creatively about these spaces.

272
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:12,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The important thing is like programming, like Curtis Tufts, Curtis Tufts has to sort of say, this is our, this is like, you know, this is our place to

273
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,104
[SPEAKER_08]: to describe all of that so and start that process.

274
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:29,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think I'm okay with us being sort of visionary in terms of what we know, because as MSBA describes the requirement here is like, this is so that we can start to hear what's important to you and I can tell you.

275
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:37,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel good that the things that we hear about on the school committee all the time are well represented here.

276
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:49,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Athletics, performing arts, Curtis Tufts, the alternative space for the high school, like all of those things are the heavy hitter topics for us, generally speaking.

277
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:50,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter?

278
00:21:51,690 --> 00:22:00,235
[SPEAKER_00]: My one takeaway from this is having worked in schools that had been through MSBA projects or school building projects, however you want to look at it,

279
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:09,343
[SPEAKER_00]: people often talk about the visionary hopes that they had and that they wish they'd done more.

280
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:18,185
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'd wish they'd put in more of it because that way the voters could have seen, the people could have seen what it could have been.

281
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:24,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, they almost felt hemmed in by worrying about like, oh, will it pass?

282
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it not pass?

283
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:34,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And my suggestion, having been through this a few times in various things, is to make the building as visionary as possible.

284
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:42,400
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you inspire the community around it, and that you really wrap them into the possibilities and the potential.

285
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, Larry?

286
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:52,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that statement 100%.

287
00:22:52,624 --> 00:23:00,888
[SPEAKER_05]: With regards to the student-run food service, when we are the students built this,

288
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:06,425
[SPEAKER_05]: doors, the acoustical ceiling, electricity, wiring, everything.

289
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:07,786
[SPEAKER_05]: This was some time back.

290
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,008
[SPEAKER_05]: The students were clamoring for that.

291
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: But we couldn't do it because the word at that time was, like, hide and kill.

292
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're frustrated with that.

293
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:29,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of issues of fairness and so forth, that not all students, understandably, could afford it for sale.

294
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:32,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think going into that, now most of the regional schools I've been to,

295
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:35,823
[SPEAKER_05]: have food service.

296
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:36,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really good.

297
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Good quality.

298
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:38,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves it.

299
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:39,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Works.

300
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:40,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how they're getting around that.

301
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they have meal tickets or something.

302
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:46,609
[SPEAKER_08]: The one in Arlington is like a cafe.

303
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So the one in Arlington is like limited, because you can't interfere with the food service program.

304
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,614
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a whole other problem.

305
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:59,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But what was in Arlington was like a cafe, essentially, like coffee, bar.

306
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the students, to this day,

307
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:05,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year, they, Mr. Brown attended Pierce.

308
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:06,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:08,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that.

310
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, in terms of vision for the shot.

311
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:17,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all in the chapter 74 piece in that other form.

312
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't make a huge appearance here for that reason.

313
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:24,067
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

314
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:30,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we, I did put something in there just so it doesn't get lost.

315
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:39,972
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Chapter 74 form talks about all of those programs that we're trying to explore and the proposed capacity.

316
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:45,256
[SPEAKER_05]: The space itself, Essex has an institute up there.

317
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:51,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Their shops are in actual, more like warehouse-type buildings adjacent to the main structure of the building.

318
00:24:52,562 --> 00:25:00,668
[SPEAKER_05]: What we really need is space and metal buildings that are well insulated with all the power and stuff are fine.

319
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,335
We just need space.

320
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on how the layout was, as a concept, we would find the sort of the top wing that was a little more industrial.

321
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, that might also give us more square footage, which is what we would need.

322
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:21,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, we have good money for that.

323
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:22,187
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

324
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:24,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I can add something about that in.

325
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:26,329
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

326
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul?

327
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, so it's only the two of them.

328
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:42,653
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were walking around the Arlington building, two things that were noticed to me just like through my experience of it, I think what we were told is that there were multiple iterations of what the building was going to look like.

329
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:52,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that as they kind of continue creating that profile and creating that image of what Arlington needed as a community, they started to say, well, what more can we add to this?

330
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:59,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have a basic idea of what we can add more to it because their needs are starting to grow as we start envisioning what we want.

331
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:02,125
So I think that I feel also comfortable

332
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:11,994
[SPEAKER_01]: this as a starting point or as a jumping off point because it doesn't, I don't think it limits us in that we can't continue to grow or consider what the community actually needs.

333
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're only a select few people.

334
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:20,200
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a community of 60,000 people who all probably have an opinion in some capacity on some program the high school could offer.

335
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:28,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that shooting for the stars or really considering what's possible is also difficult because we don't know what's possible.

336
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were walking around in Arlington, I mean, more than half the tour, I was just like,

337
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:41,027
[SPEAKER_01]: at what they had to offer their students, what the faculty were experiencing, what the HFMA or the design firm were offering.

338
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:43,829
I think there was just so much that they had envisioned.

339
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:51,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It took many years, of course, but they didn't know what they wanted when they started, because they had their old building, and they were like, we start from scratch.

340
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:56,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's similar is true now, where we don't even really understand what we can do, because it's never happened before.

341
00:26:56,998 --> 00:26:59,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, a student cafe, we've never had that before.

342
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have it here, and I'm sure many of you

343
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:23,500
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to other communities that do have that, which I think is why I shouldn't really push to go to like other programs that have done MSPA, or it's other programs in general that are offering things that we can't have as of right now, we could consider the program.

344
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm okay with it in its current wording, just as a starting, as a limiting, like.

345
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:31,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul?

346
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I want to feed everything into privacy.

347
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:40,609
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I think about the community involvement,

348
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:48,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Several people have mentioned that we are somewhat limited by our own experiences and knowledge.

349
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are completely limited by our own experiences and knowledge.

350
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:58,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And so unlike the community, we're going to go around and look at lots of schools.

351
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:00,844
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole method is not limited.

352
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:12,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's both to be expected and reasonable to think we have an outsized impact on what's possible.

353
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:29,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, I've not surveyed the community, and I look forward to the professionals for trying to do that, doing that, because, like, I don't envision them providing us with a list of things to do with this building, this room.

354
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:39,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they're going to be providing, in my mind, a set of values, what's important to them, and that we work from there to create a vision.

355
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: But to ask the community will be self-selected.

356
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It will absolutely be not representative of the community.

357
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:50,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 100% not an option.

358
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:58,015
[SPEAKER_04]: To somehow generate a vision, I think it will be great.

359
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see that as something that's happened.

360
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:08,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of, in my mind, I mean, I'm on this committee because I have a certain few things that I need to make sure

361
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:21,177
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, stop talking about, stop thinking about, and I assume everybody here was not here for, are here for a reason, other than who would like to do high school.

362
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that describes half of Medford or more, but they're not investing in five to seven years of their lives getting it.

363
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:38,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really do care very much about what Medford has to say, but like me, I mean,

364
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: one level school in rural New Hampshire, it was a regional school, built in 1970 or so.

365
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, that's what high school is.

366
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I sure hope we don't do that here.

367
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:57,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But until we start visiting other places, I don't think it's possible.

368
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:01,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look forward to that opportunity.

369
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:06,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sharing what we're experiencing on those tours.

370
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:09,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we saw this thing, like the Harlem Demand

371
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:21,046
[SPEAKER_04]: tunnels that are like as big as this, from the ceiling to the first floor, going to the library to provide light, natural light everywhere in the library.

372
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:31,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird to be honest, but also like never seen such a thing and thought it was cool to go there, but I'm excited for

373
00:30:46,693 --> 00:31:00,206
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess for me and maybe Peter knows since he's on the cutting edge of kind of the research, I feel like some of the research is missing around this around at the educational underpinning.

374
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,707
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we going to deliver instruction?

375
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel, you know, been listening, and I happen to love school architecture, but I'm also thinking there's a school in San Diego that I know we've all talked about it.

376
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:16,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's the vision for Curtis Tufts that we get to project-based learning.

377
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:19,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not looking at the typical classroom.

378
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at collaboration stations, collaboration areas, that the hub is probably the library, and we're calling it something else.

379
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:38,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to make sure that we're not losing that because this building is, I'm sure in 1970, when this building was being built, we were like, this is cutting edge for 1970.

380
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no one expected that it was going to look the way that it did.

381
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:53,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say for the 1900 building that is Curtis Tufts, which I love and I'd love to replicate in different ways, but I just think, I don't want to miss the research on this.

382
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I think going to high schools is really important.

383
00:31:55,232 --> 00:31:57,213
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a school in San Diego that does,

384
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:02,167
[SPEAKER_09]: project-based learning, and it's how they structure their day, but it feels like a warehouse.

385
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:14,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like this, and kids come together like they're doing a project, and they leave into different rooms to go do their part of the project or meet with their facilitator.

386
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:21,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to make sure that, because I think we have to be light years ahead of everyone,

387
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:25,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also going to need to be budgeting for how a teacher is going to teach differently.

388
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to lose that.

389
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:32,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can have a building and not do what you said you were going to do with the building.

390
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:42,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, Mosconomet went through and created this round building so that kids would never have a place to go anywhere but around the building.

391
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:43,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It's round.

392
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't economically feasible when it came to it.

393
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:52,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you get to the third floor, educationally, there was no air conditioning because they ran out of money.

394
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,163
[SPEAKER_09]: You shouldn't have had a third floor.

395
00:32:54,243 --> 00:33:03,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make, I'm just thinking curriculum instruction and assessment 15 years from now, because that's typically when probably the building will be built.

396
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:10,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want our plans or what our vision, you just have to be five years ahead of everything.

397
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:15,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if you know that school in San Diego, Peter, but it's like cutting edge.

398
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:21,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, it's, and their achievement is through the roof and it's attached to a vocational school.

399
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:25,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And so kids are going to and from and creating and design.

400
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:26,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really about design.

401
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:37,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that's what we engage my students, but I want to start even younger with middle schoolers, because I think in terms of Curtis Tufts, it's too late for our kids.

402
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:40,129
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have been engaged a long time ago.

403
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just don't want to lose the research.

404
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to do some research and get some articles.

405
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:59,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the work that the administrative team has signed up to do, because they will have to describe the curriculum, the 2B curriculum section of this, which is not complete yet.

406
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:03,732
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to have an innovative building and then do the same things you've already done.

407
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:04,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

408
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's our work for next week.

409
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:08,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you know more than I do.

410
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:08,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

411
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:17,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just, you know, I don't want that to be lost because we might as well have the same development.

412
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

413
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:18,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

414
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that makes sense.

415
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:21,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

416
00:34:21,712 --> 00:34:22,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple of points.

417
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:26,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a few of our responses here is delinquent.

418
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:26,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

419
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the question was still limited.

420
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:30,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a presentation inside.

421
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:31,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

422
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So about this vertical development, expanding things like growth.

423
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:40,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is a mistake not to engage with them.

424
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:52,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think deferring until professionals are involved is possibly too severe an instinct.

425
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:57,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there should be some formal engagement, probably this summer.

426
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:00,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about it in the survey and the education committee.

427
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:02,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a wise idea.

428
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a, what do you want?

429
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree.

430
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Their responses probably won't be very detailed terms with long explanations about how different elements are integrated, how they support learning.

431
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not expecting that, but I am expecting to get an understanding of what the community views as important and what they want to see.

432
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:30,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, we kind of, you know, know that first and document it.

433
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll use that as part of our vision

434
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly, a lot of the imaginary is discussed.

435
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:40,752
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a place for that in the process.

436
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:41,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's feasibility.

437
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:52,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we have money earmarked, and we are committed to feasibility, that money will be deployed on consultants.

438
00:35:52,535 --> 00:36:02,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of feasibility, we should have, judging by all the schools that are studying, which is 2.7, we'll have three to five options.

439
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will have significant detail.

440
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:10,199
[SPEAKER_05]: They will spur a lot of community conversation.

441
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to get messy.

442
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:14,561
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of opinions and so on.

443
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:21,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to refer that to feasibility and focus on executing eligibility.

444
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the reason it's not here is because I've seen through many sources.

445
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:30,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spoken to people in these.

446
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:40,563
[SPEAKER_05]: when it goes well.

447
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happens when it doesn't go well?

448
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And when there's significant disagreement over particular things, Paul is a great example, right?

449
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:54,353
[SPEAKER_05]: If you pitch a perfect game, and nobody in high school, you're done in six years.

450
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't, you might be on your 14th account, right?

451
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to keep this thing on track.

452
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to voice that.

453
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:18,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I guess a couple things.

454
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I am also here to keep this on track.

455
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It is like my mission in life to keep this thing on track.

456
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:31,726
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that, so I agree with you that we can start to ask those questions in the summer.

457
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:36,788
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm unclear about is are you saying we should not submit this until we've done that?

458
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:45,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you suggesting that we submit this and then we use that sort of body of information to also feed the consultants that are going to come on?

459
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:10,970
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of describing you and also sort of outlining the deficiency.

460
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:15,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And so is there something in here that you want to not be in here?

461
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:26,015
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're introducing new things that we want, I think that material belongs in these buildings.

462
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:32,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that this question is asking us is to tell us currently

463
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:55,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It is asking for core spaces, specialty spaces, and non-traditional spaces that are described above are proposed to be used if known at this time.

464
00:38:56,046 --> 00:39:04,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, if there are proposed changes indicate how they will impact space needs and what training to support staff will or may be provided.

465
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:06,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the question.

466
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:12,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so that table is a listing of what we currently have, right?

467
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Those classrooms, those current buildings.

468
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

469
00:39:16,122 --> 00:39:29,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just bringing this up because, again, I'm just looking at the subtracts, but scoping is a requirence of a fee for one of the things that I tend to think of the language products.

470
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it, OK, bear with me.

471
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:36,465
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain short-circuited several hours back.

472
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:39,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there something you're proposing to take out?

473
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there words on the page that you want to take out?

474
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say anything that doesn't exist today.

475
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:44,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is?

476
00:39:44,973 --> 00:39:52,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an auditorium which has lighting and acoustics and a sound system.

477
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Anesthesia, all of these things exist, they just exist poorly.

478
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:12,070
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're a wish list for book one tomorrow, I would say book one.

479
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:16,532
[SPEAKER_05]: However, that conversation has to be had.

480
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:24,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you concerned that the MSBA will trip up that process, or that people are still concerned that they haven't had a chance to get feedback?

481
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:27,277
[SPEAKER_11]: At least in this document, without reaching out to the community.

482
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So my concern is, so that's the last one.

483
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:46,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm concerned that we're disenfranchising the community by allowing our kids to link into this saying, well, we want the school to be, without ever having the age of the community to ask what it wants.

484
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's disenfranchising.

485
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:55,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think the community wants to talk and I think what the community wants is to talk and feasibility study.

486
00:40:55,115 --> 00:41:02,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And and we have, we can't get there and agree on how we are going to get this document submitted.

487
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:03,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

488
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is why I'm just trying to be really concrete.

489
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:06,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what is it?

490
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:15,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what you're saying is there's too much information in items 1 through 11 on page 14.

491
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:21,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead, we should maybe be more broad about what we are thinking.

492
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:22,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're saying?

493
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:26,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying if there's anything that doesn't exist today, it's here.

494
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:29,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right there.

495
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:34,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, other than the mini stage, all of those things exist poorly.

496
00:41:44,112 --> 00:41:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes in our front of the bracket, right?

497
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:49,773
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of our official eligibility-based schedule.

498
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:57,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be viewed by anyone who answers the ROI and makes proposals in our community for feasibility study.

499
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:06,077
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are certain things that the size don't rob, then that contractor will see that and really think about that, possibly to the depths of other things.

500
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:09,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is kind of it.

501
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: disenfranchised now.

502
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:12,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

503
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:17,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I also would encourage this group to choose their words carefully.

504
00:42:17,812 --> 00:42:22,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if we start telling people we're disenfranchising them, they will feel that way.

505
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:25,136
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think the community thinks of us that way.

506
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,699
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we shouldn't talk that way.

507
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:35,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this stuff does find its own legs in the community.

508
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:39,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So the school committee, under its authority,

509
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:47,754
[SPEAKER_08]: appointed you all, and we're here to make sure we don't mess this up, right?

510
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:51,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everyone in the city is definitely afraid we are going to mess this up.

511
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:56,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the truth.

512
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:59,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can strike item 11.

513
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,101
[SPEAKER_08]: All those other things are there.

514
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go through and make it a little bit less specific, which I think is totally fine and reasonable.

515
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:11,861
[SPEAKER_08]: so that it does not sound so specific.

516
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:25,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think to your point, like when we put out a press release that says these documents are complete, there needs to be some framing of this document as like a starting point by this committee.

517
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:30,314
[SPEAKER_08]: In meetings open to the public, it's tough.

518
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,634
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like May and June.

519
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:35,055
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a whole lot of time in the community for people to be with us.

520
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:47,277
[SPEAKER_08]: But the entire point of this was to collect all the feedback that we've heard all along the way, pair it up with the teaching and learning methodology, and get us sort of off to the races.

521
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:50,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, that is what we're here to do in eligibility.

522
00:43:52,118 --> 00:43:55,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're still on track to do that.

523
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:04,105
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think the other place where there is some real description here is around the library media space.

524
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:13,971
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would also say, I don't see anything in here that doesn't sort of match the description of current in some way, shape, or form.

525
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:20,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some description of what the current state is that Maria put in, and then there is the description of the like,

526
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:29,595
[SPEAKER_08]: the ideal space, other than a restroom close by.

527
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Movable walls.

528
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:32,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And movable walls.

529
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:48,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I think other than that, we are fairly saying something about how we're envisioning, and actually with the luxury of our head librarian doing that for us, that this is what we're envisioning that space to become.

530
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:52,754
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the other place where I thought it was very detailed.

531
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:59,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't know if anybody saw anything else that they thought was maybe too detailed.

532
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:03,660
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some items in the library section that's really good information.

533
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,302
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably more necessary like a little farther down the road.

534
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:12,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Needs a sink and like boxes for the cabinets, like that's all great, maybe like a little too granular for this document.

535
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:16,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if it hurts us to have it in there, but it may be

536
00:45:17,391 --> 00:45:21,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And to Luke's point, it's focusing on one area of the project more than others.

537
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:26,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could, I mean, I wouldn't rid of any of it, or I would maybe hold onto it for later.

538
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:27,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sure, sure.

539
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:27,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

540
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:33,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could just save it for the visioning and programming part.

541
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, give me that.

542
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

543
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:46,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one way to kind of address some of the concerns that I raised and perhaps others can share is to have more consistent formatting.

544
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:50,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, different formatting.

545
00:45:50,899 --> 00:45:53,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you're emphasizing something over another thing.

546
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That will all be cleaned up before this starts.

547
00:45:55,581 --> 00:46:01,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So perhaps if that were standardized, things would pop out more than other things.

548
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:02,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

549
00:46:02,404 --> 00:46:11,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also we could adjust wording here and there where something needs to be designed to strike that.

550
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:14,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, current scenes are this and

551
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: different it'll land okay yeah all of that the sort of a wacky template to work in and it has like all kinds of different bullets so all of that would be cleaned up before we're done to make sure that it's consistent I think that as for those of us that did have some writing to

552
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,542
[SPEAKER_11]: The assumption was that you would be reformatting.

553
00:46:53,822 --> 00:46:56,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just, I don't suffer from remedy.

554
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:58,725
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's totally fine.

555
00:46:59,085 --> 00:47:00,786
[SPEAKER_11]: It's totally fine.

556
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: That's totally fine.

557
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:10,293
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did want to say before that, Laurie, if you do look at some of the ideas for the library, I had project-based learning in mind.

558
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:11,073
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

559
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I also thought, yeah.

560
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:14,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

561
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions about section three?

562
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron?

563
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:34,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, like you mentioned, for example, some of the more specific items, like on the library, the library media space, we're suggesting that certain ones are more specific than others.

564
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:36,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we taking them out?

565
00:47:36,142 --> 00:47:44,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the previous section about the State of the Art and the Performing Arts Facility, we're going to strike 11, but then we're not going to strike others.

566
00:47:44,585 --> 00:47:48,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't really know if it makes sense to strike certain ones, not other ones.

567
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:53,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think we're just I think what I'm hearing is to just bring everything up to the same level of detail.

568
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:54,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

569
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:55,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

570
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:56,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

571
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:57,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I prefer that.

572
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,145
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we're going to really.

573
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:05,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it makes a lot of sense to strike certain things and not other ones if we're going to be specific about certain areas that not.

574
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think one or the other shows up.

575
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:10,514
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, perfect.

576
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:14,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Larry, did I see your hand a minute ago?

577
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:15,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

578
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:20,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Essex Tech on the list of schools to visit?

579
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:22,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be.

580
00:48:22,977 --> 00:48:24,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that that should be.

581
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:39,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd like to propose, if you're interested, NELTA, the New England Lakers Training Academy, is just completing, as you speak, a brand new campus, which would be suitable for vocational courses.

582
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:43,991
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has loose clusters of classrooms,

583
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:47,953
[SPEAKER_05]: as does Essex.

584
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:53,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So conceptually, it goes to different schools, and you can take a picture if you want to.

585
00:48:54,436 --> 00:48:59,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean downstairs at Media Tech does a very good job with the students.

586
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:03,659
[SPEAKER_05]: By that point in the fall, or maybe beforehand, get logged in or something.

587
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:12,603
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's put together a nice little montage with music, and it kind of explains things that get us excited.

588
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can spend maybe going to the theater sometime and show

589
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:17,723
[SPEAKER_05]: interested.

590
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:19,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of what got us going.

591
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:21,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't like set the table a little bit.

592
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:22,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

593
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:25,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think it's it's good.

594
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:29,986
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, we're kind of paying with broad brush.

595
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:41,249
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's good to give the panel and and I personally, I guess, I think it's okay to say not all what is, but just to sort of play them a little bit.

596
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:44,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you know, we would like to stay in New York theater.

597
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really nice spot.

598
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: We want those two things.

599
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:50,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Classrooms are classrooms.

600
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:51,307
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be nice.

601
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:52,208
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be functional.

602
00:49:52,628 --> 00:49:54,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Book, they just need space.

603
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tear it up anyway.

604
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:57,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what I'm saying?

605
00:49:57,852 --> 00:50:10,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But saying what we want in a broad sense and putting that out, show the pictures of what we have liked, all these other tours and visits, and then we start the process of when it's everybody going to the community.

606
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And your Councilor was talking earlier about the connection with the films.

607
00:50:14,543 --> 00:50:15,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, that is really big.

608
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:16,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

609
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:27,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And Suzanne was working on that, tracking down that application that went in some years ago now to do something.

610
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:42,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very project-based learning integration with the outdoors oriented for another grant that we did not get, but she was going to go through the files and bring that information to figure out if there's anything that really should be put in.

611
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a rock climbing baseball out here.

612
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:55,041
[SPEAKER_05]: winter, you know, groom cross-country ski course up there with some yurts you can enjoy.

613
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:57,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is so undeveloped and it's a gem for the entire city.

614
00:50:57,082 --> 00:50:57,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

615
00:50:57,282 --> 00:51:01,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to be capitalistic, but there's plenty in terms of parking fees and concessions and stuff.

616
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:03,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is such a beautiful

617
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:27,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So how that integrates with the cross-country needs in that area.

618
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:43,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So to whet the appetite of it, to me, I think it's fair to point out what is here, some of the deficiencies, what we feel like we're lacking for the sake of students, and then sort of shoot them with some options of kind of what we're thinking.

619
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:44,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

620
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:45,042
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

621
00:51:46,623 --> 00:51:49,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions, comments?

622
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria, I just want to mention one thing.

623
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:57,742
[SPEAKER_11]: You're probably already where PVD High School is in process right now.

624
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:00,043
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about to begin the design phase.

625
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:04,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So I spoke with the librarian at PVD High School.

626
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:06,286
[SPEAKER_11]: She gave me some of her notes, which I incorporated.

627
00:52:06,946 --> 00:52:07,426
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

628
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:09,187
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're just a few steps ahead.

629
00:52:09,407 --> 00:52:09,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

630
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:10,768
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be a resource.

631
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:11,928
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

632
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:13,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

633
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:13,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian?

634
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:18,731
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your list of potential students who are unable to attend?

635
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:20,372
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is on there?

636
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:22,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So we talked about Arlington.

637
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:26,712
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about Somerville, Belmont.

638
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:27,432
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

639
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:44,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, the thing we may want to do is sort of reformat our summer meetings to be like tours instead so that we have some time in summer to do various tours.

640
00:52:47,040 --> 00:53:04,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be a great use of summer if we can get all of these documents, if we can get through all of these documents so that we really can sort of take the summer to put all of our like communication plans together, start to tell the community what we're saying, start to look at all those other schools and sort of get ready.

641
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:07,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might just be nice timing to do all of that.

642
00:53:07,915 --> 00:53:11,217
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to go to Nelton, I think I can do this at home.

643
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:11,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

644
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So and I think that's what you should do out there, especially with the vocational

645
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, okay.

646
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:18,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

647
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:23,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, what school is that?

648
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:24,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Quincy.

649
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:24,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

650
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That was all incorporated into the campaign.

651
00:53:57,722 --> 00:53:58,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

652
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:05,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

653
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:09,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be great.

654
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:10,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Section four, community engagement.

655
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:18,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the last time we talked, people talked about like the sequencing of the information in there.

656
00:54:22,153 --> 00:54:35,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tried to, although I'm finding the typos because I was doing this in my lap at the council meeting last night, but I did try to like re-sequence this to better flow with the information that we have in here.

657
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:49,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So talking about the communications and community engagement subcommittee first, I think it was last, and then talking about some of the things specifically that they asked about around what kinds of things are we considering doing.

658
00:54:52,109 --> 00:55:12,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, in addition, doing a little bit of sort of just framing that last paragraph a little bit better about the engagement that we've already done around the co-location of Curtis Tufts, because that is a program that we are proposing to bring on here, and the school committee has done some very helpful, useful work to sort of move that forward.

659
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:16,296
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is...

660
00:55:19,495 --> 00:55:21,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is everything in this document.

661
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?

662
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:41,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to approve this document as amended and to be completed as noted?

663
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:45,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve as amended and completed as noted.

664
00:55:45,937 --> 00:55:46,077
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

665
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by your president.

666
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:53,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

667
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, I put your name on the list.

668
00:55:57,382 --> 00:56:00,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

669
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:06,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so a motion by Dr. Cushing and Aaron, seconded by Aaron.

670
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:16,332
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our voting members are in person, so all those in favor?

671
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:19,253
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

672
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,355
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

673
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:22,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

674
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:30,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So will you let me know if you'd like to talk to Jill about it?

675
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:30,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yeah.

676
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:31,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that.

677
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:46,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the last item on our agenda for this evening is just to give you an update on the maintenance practices information.

678
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:53,597
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Dr. Cushing, so let me pass this out and then I'll explain what it is.

679
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, does everyone have a coffee?

680
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:31,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're almost there.

681
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:33,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

682
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:48,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so just as framing, the MSBA has an online portal where they require us to upload a whole variety of documents around our maintenance and capital planning practices.

683
00:57:50,082 --> 00:57:56,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier in this process, Tom and I sat down with that

684
00:57:57,245 --> 00:58:04,277
[SPEAKER_08]: system and we went through and we created this document to just try to provide like a working place for all of that information.

685
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,063
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll see all the questions listed.

686
00:58:11,185 --> 00:58:18,430
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout this document and what you'll see is the questions, the answer format.

687
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:27,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So many of these things are like yes, no type questions and then any comments, which would be comments that we need to put into the system to answer the question, et cetera.

688
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:43,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if we start at the top, what I think you'll see is that the vast majority of this information has to be completed by Dr. Cushing, who's our representative on the committee in terms of

689
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:54,730
[SPEAKER_08]: his work as the overseer of the facilities department for Medford Public Schools, among other 45 other jobs that he does.

690
00:58:54,810 --> 00:59:14,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I just wanted to run through the questions here as a sort of jumping off point and talk a little bit about, you know, give you all a chance to review all the information that is populated in here already and talk about next steps for this document.

691
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:20,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if we start at the top, the 1st, series of questions is really around staffing.

692
00:59:20,149 --> 00:59:22,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So it asks about question.

693
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:29,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 1 is, is the facility maintenance performed by the municipality or the district in our, in our situation?

694
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a combination of both.

695
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:39,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So the districts largely has the responsibility for sort of all things maintenance until something gets too big and becomes a capital project.

696
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:48,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the city, the city does step in our buildings and grounds department clears snow and they do other projects like paving and things like that.

697
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:50,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is truly a group effort.

698
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:56,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number two, are vendors used for any aspect of facilities maintenance?

699
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:57,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer to that is yes.

700
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:08,616
[SPEAKER_08]: For all of these things, plumbing, pest management, elevator inspections, asbestos testing, et cetera, fire alarm systems, all of that good stuff.

701
01:00:09,056 --> 01:00:11,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting on the name of our pest management company.

702
01:00:12,878 --> 01:00:20,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three, full-time equivalent to help them understand how many custodians we have across the district.

703
01:00:21,614 --> 01:00:23,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is there a director of facilities?

704
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:25,017
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

705
01:00:25,637 --> 01:00:30,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And does the district have defined job descriptions for our custodial staff?

706
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:31,842
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is yes.

707
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:33,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll have to attach those.

708
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:36,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, item number six.

709
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:40,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a system of performance evaluations of the district's custodial and maintenance staff?

710
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:49,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that is a work in progress, but we are, uh, pending contract negotiations around that.

711
01:00:50,858 --> 01:00:56,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And number seven, is training required or provided for the district's custodial and maintenance staff?

712
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

713
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And we cover some of the things that we have trained our staff in starting in 2023.

714
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:13,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And then number eight, is there a written maintenance plan for the district that details minimum custodial maintenance standards and governs day-to-day operations?

715
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:14,726
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

716
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we will have to attach those documents.

717
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:19,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the staffing section.

718
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:26,357
[SPEAKER_08]: The planning is their preventive or predictive maintenance plan for the district's facilities.

719
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:28,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

720
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, there's an attachment that we'll have to provide.

721
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:33,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district have a work order system?

722
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:34,944
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is yes.

723
01:01:35,064 --> 01:01:36,825
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually recently converted from.

724
01:01:37,546 --> 01:01:40,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Email work order system, which is.

725
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:46,287
[SPEAKER_08]: problematic, as you might mention, to a system called Operations Hero.

726
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:47,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right?

727
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a true work order ticketing system.

728
01:01:51,508 --> 01:02:02,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And the district is sort of rolling folks onto that, both on the custodial staff and then also in the school buildings over the course they're working on that implementation.

729
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:04,933
[SPEAKER_08]: The facilities condition index.

730
01:02:06,567 --> 01:02:11,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number one, does the district conduct periodic inspections of school facilities to ascertain their conditions?

731
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,932
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

732
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:26,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number two is, do we have a facilities condition index, which keeps track of school systems, identifies major system components, and tracks information?

733
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:30,643
[SPEAKER_08]: We purchased some software to begin doing that in February of 2024.

734
01:02:30,743 --> 01:02:31,363
[SPEAKER_08]: That's operation zero.

735
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:44,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number three, please describe how the district analyzes facility condition information and how that analysis impacts decisions on budget capital improvements and staff performance.

736
01:02:46,617 --> 01:02:52,683
[SPEAKER_08]: So, up until recently, the condition facility conditions and repairs were done on an as needed basis.

737
01:02:55,052 --> 01:03:09,194
[SPEAKER_08]: The district, so beginning in FY 24, we've really begun to shift to a recommissioning model where we are looking at each of our schools on a periodic basis to understand their budgetary needs, et cetera.

738
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:15,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number four is, do we have a protocol around commissioning and recommissioning?

739
01:03:16,236 --> 01:03:18,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That is starting in FY 25.

740
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And that process is essentially on a periodic basis.

741
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:34,771
[SPEAKER_08]: You do sort of a soup to nuts assessment of what is happening in the building so that you can identify what it would take to bring the building back to its original condition in terms of its intention.

742
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what that does is it sort of highlights any maintenance.

743
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:41,904
[SPEAKER_08]: practices that need to change.

744
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:46,246
[SPEAKER_08]: HVAC can, you know, the big systems there are like HVAC oriented.

745
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: You may or may not know this, but we have a project going on right now in our middle schools that will replace HVAC systems in the Andrews Middle School and then in the entire McGlynn complex.

746
01:03:57,591 --> 01:04:06,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So those buildings are like in effect being reconditioned because of that substantive work, which is scheduled to be done.

747
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:07,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully by next summer.

748
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:08,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Next summer.

749
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:08,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

750
01:04:10,396 --> 01:04:19,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other schools, Brooks, Roberts, Missittuck, will get on to the reconditioning cycle with this next rehab.

751
01:04:19,758 --> 01:04:25,019
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the expectation would be the high school would go on to a five-year loop with the other schools as well.

752
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:25,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria?

753
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:30,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question, because those buildings are only 20-plus years old.

754
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what I'm going to say?

755
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:33,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

756
01:04:33,963 --> 01:04:38,628
[SPEAKER_11]: because of not being kept up or is that just aging out?

757
01:04:39,329 --> 01:04:41,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's actually a really good question.

758
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:41,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Both?

759
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:43,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is both.

760
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:57,387
[SPEAKER_00]: In all honesty, and with any of our architects and others who have a lot more experience than I do, the reality is as these buildings approach 25 years old, they're at midlife expectancy for their structure.

761
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:01,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, roofs last about 30 years.

762
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:08,596
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC equipment, you know, some pieces of the equipment are expected to last 10 years.

763
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:11,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are expected to last 15.

764
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:19,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, your bigger equipment, your rooftop chillers, your compressors, things like that, with proper maintenance, will make it to that 25-year mark.

765
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:30,991
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially at that point, I mean, everybody we have talked to in our process for OPM and designers is, oh yeah, they're at the end of their life.

766
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:33,331
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the Rolls Royce.

767
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:44,776
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is how I described it to someone like, you know, we're not going to put more money into fixing these because it's not a classic Mustang or classic car.

768
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:45,916
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 1975 Pinto.

769
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:54,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, yes to both of those things, right?

770
01:05:54,981 --> 01:06:04,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Proactive maintenance extends the life of these systems, but there is a life of the system that you tap out.

771
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:09,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what you see, particularly when you start to think about that kind of

772
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:14,735
[SPEAKER_08]: system programming that's going to go into this new high school.

773
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:29,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Arlington talked a lot about how they don't know how to use their building just yet, because it is so highly technical and so very different than how their building used to operate, that they said often they are like, this thing is broken.

774
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:31,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not broken at all.

775
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:33,122
[SPEAKER_08]: They just don't know how to use it yet.

776
01:06:33,922 --> 01:06:38,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's this huge learning curve that goes into these new buildings in particular.

777
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,882
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, for the same reason that like...

778
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:46,180
[SPEAKER_08]: when your car is like fully electrified inside, right?

779
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's more parts, there's more things that can go wrong, right?

780
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:54,963
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more, there's more, well, if you're completely electric, that's different.

781
01:06:54,983 --> 01:07:03,425
[SPEAKER_08]: But like you start talking about like even the advancement of anything else that's going on in your home, like you're, you know, the refrigerator from the 70s lasted for 30 years.

782
01:07:05,426 --> 01:07:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still, maybe it's still running in avocado green, but

783
01:07:09,627 --> 01:07:15,752
[SPEAKER_08]: If you buy a refrigerator 10 years ago, you're probably thinking about it's time for a new refrigerator.

784
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:21,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So the entire way we maintain our buildings will change with this new building.

785
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:25,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what they're trying to understand is, how do we do it today?

786
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So how big of a climb is this going to be for us to take good care of this building?

787
01:07:31,004 --> 01:07:35,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is, we have work to do in that department, for sure.

788
01:07:37,165 --> 01:07:46,692
[SPEAKER_08]: we are trying to get there proactively so that we have arrived by the time this building comes on, because that's going to be its own challenge.

789
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:52,457
[SPEAKER_08]: The environment question, does the district routinely monitor air quality?

790
01:07:52,477 --> 01:07:53,578
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to that is yes.

791
01:07:55,419 --> 01:08:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district implement practices in the EPA's Tools for Schools program?

792
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:01,204
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is yes.

793
01:08:02,104 --> 01:08:03,906
[SPEAKER_08]: More information forthcoming.

794
01:08:04,106 --> 01:08:05,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do have more work to do on that.

795
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:13,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district have a protocol to eliminate toxic chemicals and use green products for cleaning and repairs?

796
01:08:15,017 --> 01:08:22,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Best practices for building operators typically include regular inspecting, testing, balancing, and cleaning of HVAC components in order to make them most efficient.

797
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we do that?

798
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's like maybe a working yes.

799
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:31,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the district monitor energy consumption and spending?

800
01:08:31,363 --> 01:08:32,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

801
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:33,923
[SPEAKER_00]: We've started that this year.

802
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:38,718
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a very interesting analysis.

803
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you right now.

804
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one word.

805
01:08:42,481 --> 01:08:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

806
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:43,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

807
01:08:43,382 --> 01:08:44,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Since COVID, yes.

808
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:04,397
[SPEAKER_08]: With outside testing, yeah.

809
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:06,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

810
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,760
[SPEAKER_06]: There's technology now.

811
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Meters.

812
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:24,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Across a number of EPA metrics, a number of international metrics.

813
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want.

814
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there is a problem, you can go that way.

815
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:38,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's once a year or if a concern is raised.

816
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:48,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we had flooding, I forget when that was, December, January, whenever we were hit at the high school with a heavy flood.

817
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:55,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we had everything cleaned up, we brought in UEC consultants and they did air testing.

818
01:09:56,993 --> 01:10:06,636
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found to be fine at the Brooks and other schools, the Mississippi in particular, where there's been some buildup of land or the land is just up against the foundation.

819
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,637
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been some concern of moisture.

820
01:10:09,177 --> 01:10:11,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will do testing in those spaces.

821
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:16,660
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing too is across our

822
01:10:17,598 --> 01:10:32,016
[SPEAKER_00]: District right now we're doing a district mapping project to know every single space to get pictures of every space to really understand every space for us to be able to have a device like you mentioned would probably have a significant ramp up cost.

823
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:37,341
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think we should really look at when we go for a new high school.

824
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:51,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what Member Graham is saying about the things that we need to learn as part of this HVAC project with the Enders and the McGlynn, that's been one of my key questions is, okay, this is great, but once we commission these

825
01:10:51,591 --> 01:11:01,999
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to know that our maintenance staff are well trained to be able to monitor and then not just like know what to monitor, but know when you want to know something.

826
01:11:02,019 --> 01:11:03,281
[SPEAKER_00]: This is outside of my scope.

827
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:05,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't try to fix this.

828
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to call someone in.

829
01:11:07,724 --> 01:11:17,932
[SPEAKER_00]: So those types of things like know what you know and then also know what you don't know so that the system can be maintained by truly trained HVAC professionals.

830
01:11:18,453 --> 01:11:19,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And our maintenance staff does a great job.

831
01:11:20,932 --> 01:11:31,216
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, we're getting into an area with these building systems that require extraordinarily high training and high skill.

832
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:35,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I give a quick example?

833
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:39,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the maintenance guy's fault.

834
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:48,684
[SPEAKER_05]: There are times when everybody over here goes and does a winter with a distinct class about kids over at C building.

835
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And simple, but good quality to me.

836
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:06,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Another quick example.

837
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:09,090
[SPEAKER_05]: The lights we had in the shops were terrible.

838
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Those fluorescents, a lot of juice, they didn't shine very brightly.

839
01:12:13,953 --> 01:12:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got this rant of getting new LEDs.

840
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:19,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's like, not very literally in the shops.

841
01:12:19,237 --> 01:12:19,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing.

842
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:23,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Except that whoever sold the bill of goods

843
01:12:23,963 --> 01:12:28,827
[SPEAKER_05]: got all this technological stuff to try to help us to save money, of course.

844
01:12:28,907 --> 01:12:29,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

845
01:12:29,548 --> 01:12:30,308
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem there.

846
01:12:31,049 --> 01:12:33,551
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was all programmed via cell phone.

847
01:12:34,032 --> 01:12:35,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no control over it.

848
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't go over the internet.

849
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:38,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And cell phone reception is terrible.

850
01:12:38,836 --> 01:12:42,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So this goes pre-pandemic days, for about three years.

851
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I would come over here to walk in the bell on the weekend, and the lights were on in my shop.

852
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:49,064
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on?

853
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:52,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was supposed to stop that.

854
01:12:53,027 --> 01:12:55,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just asked, can we just put in switches?

855
01:12:55,428 --> 01:12:58,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we didn't think, well, how long does it take to turn on the switches?

856
01:12:58,369 --> 01:13:01,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just took, like, until two years.

857
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:05,711
[SPEAKER_05]: After we got back to schools, about a year and a half ago, we finally solved it.

858
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:07,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't had a bunch of problems since.

859
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:11,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they did, but they had a bunch of the guys from Georgia come out and figured it all out.

860
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:18,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But just sometimes we run into old bills and things that are so high-tech.

861
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:21,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like software that is, it has all these whistles and bells.

862
01:13:21,642 --> 01:13:23,804
[SPEAKER_05]: But you only need this 5%, you know what I'm saying?

863
01:13:23,824 --> 01:13:25,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need all this other stuff.

864
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:27,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You only need 12 ways to do the same thing.

865
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:29,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Just think of the best way and let's go with that.

866
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:32,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't have the mental capacity to do it.

867
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:40,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think that this is something we're going to have to deal with throughout this whole process and review by our management.

868
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:48,703
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing with regards to, I would like to see as part of this vision thing, is I would really, really like, I think, John would back me 100%.

869
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: is to have that having maintenance department.

870
01:13:53,235 --> 01:14:07,049
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a maintenance department that has a space, a little shop, a little warehouse, a place where they can take their lawnmowers in so we don't have to build these sheds all over the place, store them, work on them.

871
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:12,054
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy probably needs a pickup because they're always borrowing.

872
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:15,386
[SPEAKER_05]: other shops, trucks when it snows.

873
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:22,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our own snowplow and we have tried to form a relationship with maintenance because they need help.

874
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: They need the facilities.

875
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:28,432
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to always borrow tools, ladders, scaffolds.

876
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:33,874
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a vehicle and they need space to work and to do stuff.

877
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:37,456
[SPEAKER_05]: They need their own staging, scaffolding.

878
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:40,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the kids, the cooperation,

879
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:48,179
[SPEAKER_05]: They rake leaves, they prune trees, they do the landscape.

880
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:51,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The kids have done all this gardening stuff out in front.

881
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:56,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year they were all out in the fields in these pulling weeds out of the break out of the center courtyard.

882
01:14:56,865 --> 01:15:00,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do stuff about paint.

883
01:15:01,008 --> 01:15:05,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So every year we work with all the potholes and parking lots.

884
01:15:05,992 --> 01:15:12,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids have resurfaced seal coated parking lots and painted all the stripes.

885
01:15:12,702 --> 01:15:16,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So since they do that, I would like the kids to get a little recognition.

886
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:25,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, maybe that can be part of the new plan, which is collaboration, where the vocational students can take on some of that stuff.

887
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:28,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And we try and try to get some of these kids co-op jobs.

888
01:15:29,431 --> 01:15:31,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But in construction, you have to be 18.

889
01:15:32,052 --> 01:15:36,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But they could work with school for a little bit here and there, maybe do some more merging.

890
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Regarding the last thing I'll say, the warehouse thing,

891
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the guys at CCW would like this at all.

892
01:15:44,857 --> 01:15:47,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But that could be a stopgap thing.

893
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:48,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever been in that facility?

894
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:49,440
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

895
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is.

896
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's everything constructed for a stream.

897
01:15:53,523 --> 01:15:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It is nice.

898
01:15:54,223 --> 01:15:54,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It's big.

899
01:15:54,864 --> 01:15:55,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It has everything in it.

900
01:15:56,865 --> 01:16:01,288
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can get a corner, maybe for the school district, if things run out of that for a while.

901
01:16:02,402 --> 01:16:04,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, you know, you didn't hear that.

902
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,266
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

903
01:16:05,286 --> 01:16:06,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, you're being recorded, right?

904
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:08,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

905
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:11,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So also in this document is a series of questions about budget.

906
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:24,731
[SPEAKER_08]: So does the facility maintenance person have a role in establishing the budget?

907
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:31,237
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the amounts that have been requested in the budget over a series of years?

908
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:34,859
[SPEAKER_08]: What was allocated in the budget over a series of years?

909
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,322
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a variance, why was there a variance?

910
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:40,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Expended budget.

911
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,471
[SPEAKER_08]: over a series of years, is there a variance?

912
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:55,053
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a variance of 20% or greater between consecutive years and the district's total expended amounts, please provide the details on the reason for the difference.

913
01:16:55,834 --> 01:17:00,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Projected budget, I think we're actually on a better track there, so that is nice.

914
01:17:01,226 --> 01:17:10,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what does the district believe that, uh, the appropriate amount of spending on operations maintenance should be, um, to allow for routine maintenance of those facilities and how close are we?

915
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:26,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had lots of conversation at the council meeting last night, um, in particular because, um, that, uh, there are potential Proposition 2.5 overrides on the, um,

916
01:17:27,547 --> 01:17:30,209
[SPEAKER_08]: ballot in November, voted in last night.

917
01:17:31,129 --> 01:17:41,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of all of that money, $7.5 million across the two ballot measures, other than $500,000, would be directed towards schools.

918
01:17:42,016 --> 01:17:50,821
[SPEAKER_08]: A big part of the planning that went into those numbers was things like making sure that we are able to provide routine maintenance that supports the district.

919
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:51,701
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a big deal.

920
01:17:53,412 --> 01:17:58,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And then any other comments on your budget history, so we will talk about those upcoming items.

921
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:01,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's a capital program piece.

922
01:18:01,655 --> 01:18:11,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in good shape from a capital program perspective because the city, we had a capital program for several years when Mayor Lungo-Koehn took the reins of the city.

923
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,902
[SPEAKER_08]: She created an integrated capital plan that included the schools and they used the

924
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,101
[SPEAKER_08]: calling center to help establish that.

925
01:18:22,002 --> 01:18:31,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we are in the midst of a policy change on the school committee side to sort of codify our annual capital planning review process for schools.

926
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:39,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the capital budget history asks about tax overrides, capital exclusions, debt exclusions.

927
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:45,960
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer to all of those is we have not done that before, but we're about to do it in November.

928
01:18:46,995 --> 01:18:51,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And then any other capital projects that were deferred due to funding constraints.

929
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:54,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sure that we will have one or two items in there.

930
01:18:56,818 --> 01:18:59,679
[SPEAKER_08]: The final section is the capital improvement plan and budget.

931
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:04,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is our capital improvement plan and budget?

932
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:15,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will attach the city's capital improvement plan and some of the other documents that we have internally, and then provide any information about availability of non-public funds for school facility purposes.

933
01:19:16,307 --> 01:19:20,170
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about our rentals and some other things there.

934
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:30,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And then provide information from the Treasurer Finance Committee or Capital Planning Committee regarding the outstanding debt and future bond capacity inside the debt limit for municipalities.

935
01:19:30,758 --> 01:19:33,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that will come from the bankers office.

936
01:19:34,548 --> 01:19:40,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this last table was just a table, one of the tables that have to be sort of filled out and completed.

937
01:19:40,912 --> 01:19:51,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So all this document is really just to allow us to start to collect the information where that ultimately then has to be keyed into the system in a very particular way.

938
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,782
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to share this with you.

939
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Find out if you have questions or comments.

940
01:19:58,935 --> 01:20:04,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Our working goal is, again, that by June 30th, this will be done and we will be able to submit it.

941
01:20:06,296 --> 01:20:11,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have until, I think, October to do this, but we can't go to that next phase of the process until we're done.

942
01:20:11,697 --> 01:20:17,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So our goal is to get all of this documentation pulled together and buttoned up between now and then.

943
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:19,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So questions?

944
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:36,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Would anybody like to make a motion to authorize Dr. Cushing and I to complete and submit the questionnaire?

945
01:20:36,362 --> 01:20:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so motion for myself and Dr. Cushing to complete this questionnaire as requested by Nicole Morell, seconded by Emily.

946
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:50,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Emily.

947
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:54,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all those in favor.

948
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:56,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

949
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:57,107
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

950
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,951
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

951
01:20:58,971 --> 01:20:59,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

952
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:07,790
[SPEAKER_08]: We are at the end of our agenda, a few minutes early.

953
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:14,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next full meeting is scheduled at six o'clock on July 17th via Zoom.

954
01:21:14,812 --> 01:21:19,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be in touch with the communications committee so that we can find another date hopefully in July.

955
01:21:19,934 --> 01:21:31,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the next steps are to finish up these forms and get everything submitted and look forward to that feasibility study vote by the council on the 25th.

956
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: so that we are sort of off to the races, and then use the summer to do our community engagement planning and do some touring.

957
01:21:42,484 --> 01:21:52,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So between now and July 1, I'm going to say I will be back in touch with you if I am able to sort of shift things around and schedule some dates and times.

958
01:21:53,251 --> 01:22:00,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So those two meetings may not stay on the calendar exactly as they are, but I will let you know as soon as I have ideas and plans.

959
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:14,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally speaking, if we're going to go to a school in the summer, I think folks are going to lean toward wanting to host us not in the evenings.

960
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:20,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a time frame that works better for you all than others?

961
01:22:22,332 --> 01:22:23,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming it's summer.

962
01:22:23,412 --> 01:22:26,914
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be sort of a Monday to Friday-ish thing.

963
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:34,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably they're going to ask for us not to come from 6 to 8, but I will certainly ask if that's a possibility.

964
01:22:34,176 --> 01:22:41,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So are there other times, like generally speaking, that like is morning better than afternoon?

965
01:22:41,099 --> 01:22:42,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Is afternoon better than lunchtime?

966
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:43,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Is lunchtime the best?

967
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Like any feedback about scheduling?

968
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's all impossible.

969
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:50,122
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

970
01:22:50,182 --> 01:22:50,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Emily?

971
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: flexible, but I assume we're not going to get a critical loss of our feedback.

972
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:58,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just probably going to be something.

973
01:22:58,804 --> 01:23:04,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Some school, that's a great example, just offers themselves and we take it where we don't, right?

974
01:23:04,469 --> 01:23:04,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

975
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:08,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're going to have more conversations.

976
01:23:08,473 --> 01:23:12,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we should prioritize whatever school is the best example for us to see.

977
01:23:13,217 --> 01:23:14,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my take.

978
01:23:14,318 --> 01:23:15,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Nicole?

979
01:23:15,739 --> 01:23:19,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be nice to just not be Derek Overshoe or Cam Tinker.

980
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:22,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, yeah.

981
01:23:23,095 --> 01:23:24,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

982
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:29,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions comments about timing and scheduling.

983
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:31,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's all tough.

984
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:36,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I said, I will ask if there are people willing to host us on an evening.

985
01:23:36,883 --> 01:23:42,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe there's evening programming going on in the building where somebody would be willing to do that, or the architects would be willing.

986
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:46,705
[SPEAKER_08]: The designers often are willing to sort of help make those things happen.

987
01:23:46,765 --> 01:23:51,626
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will do some outreach and be in touch.

988
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:56,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure the HMFH would be very happy to take a group back to Arlington.

989
01:23:57,207 --> 01:23:58,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of you got to see Arlington.

990
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:04,868
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just right next door, which is amazing and was very cool.

991
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:07,610
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will be in touch on that.

992
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:11,994
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as I have dates, I will have Lisa send them out to you all so that you have them on your calendar.

993
01:24:12,934 --> 01:24:17,058
[SPEAKER_08]: And you all should have district email now.

994
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:19,340
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have questions about that, you can see Dr. Cushing.

995
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:23,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a motion to adjourn?
