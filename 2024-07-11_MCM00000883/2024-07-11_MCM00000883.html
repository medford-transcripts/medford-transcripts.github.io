    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=126.265">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=127.566">Motion</a>  to approve the consent agenda by Aaron Olapade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=131.147">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=132.247">Seconded</a>  by Maria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=135.349">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=136.289">Jenny</a>  Graham, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=137.269">Mary</a>  Lungu-Kern, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=138.61">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=139.891">Suzanne</a>  Galussi, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=141.511">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=143.472">Marta</a>  Cabral. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=144.592">Libby</a>  Brown. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=145.253">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=146.113">Marissa</a>  Desmond, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=149.014">Maria</a>  Dorsey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=150.275">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=150.815">Brian</a>  Hilliard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=151.455">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=151.975">Tracy</a>  Keene, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=153.056">Emily</a>  Lazzaro, absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=154.877">Nicole</a>  Morell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=156.508">Aaron</a>  Lopate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=157.268">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=158.289">Luke</a>  Preissner.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=159.449">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=160.35">OK,</a>  nine in the affirmative, zero in the negative, six absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=166.132">The</a>  minutes are approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=168.814">OK,</a>  so I just wanted to give you all a deliverable status overall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=173.676">So</a>  again, we have five. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=175.497">We'll</a>  call it six things, but with five official things that have to be done in the eligibility phase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=181.079">The</a>  MSBA let us know that our <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=185.321">ICC,</a>  which is the legal agreement, has been approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=189.562">So</a>  that is complete and approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=192.283">We</a>  have submitted our SBC form, our school building committee form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=196.104">They</a>  reviewed it, and they have approved it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=198.485">So</a>  we are done and approved on item number two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=202.526">Last</a>  meeting, we approved the chapter 74 form as amended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=206.848">That</a>  one has not been submitted yet, but that is just a matter of collecting up all the paperwork and doing some final editing, and that will be submitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=216.491">Item</a>  number four is the educational profile, which I am hopeful that we will get to today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=222.773">And</a>  then the final pieces include the maintenance plan profile, which we will talk about today and potentially provide an approval by this group to go ahead and submit that as soon as it's complete. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=239.526">And</a>  then the final big thing that we will have to do, well, there's two more things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=243.408">So</a>  there's data about enrollment that has to be submitted that is in process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=248.591">It</a>  does not require approval of this body, but we are working with Alicia Hunt, as well as Gerry McCue, who's our CFO here and are on track to get that completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=261.272">The</a>  very last thing that we will have to do is earmark funds for the feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=266.074">So</a>  I just wanted to let you all know that you can expect to see that on the city council agenda on the 25th, which is a Tuesday evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=275.938">The</a>  request will come from the mayor to use free cash to set aside funds for the feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=285.101">The</a>  exact amount is still <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=287.842">a</a>  little bit of a TBD because there's a little bit more legwork to do to make sure that we get the right number, but we know what that range needs to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=295.869">So</a>  we have a couple more conversations to have and then the mayor will make that request to the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=301.193">Hopefully</a>  the council will approve that on the 25th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=304.776">MSBA</a>  has already signed off on the language that will go before the council to be approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=309.84">They</a>  are fine with it and they are ready to watch and hear that that's approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=314.323">They</a>  did say that they will schedule our enrollment meeting like once that happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=320.188">And</a>  so the fact that we're going to do that in June is good because then we can accelerate that piece of it, which really would position us for a much earlier view by the board than next February, which is when we would sort of be scheduled if we take full time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=336.541">So</a>  that's just a quick update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=340.324">Are</a>  there any questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=351.648">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=353.449">The</a>  other announcement related is that we have finished the first draft of the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=360.654">I'm</a>  going to ask Tom to send that out to everybody after this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=365.618">So</a>  if you want to take a look, if you have any questions or comments or suggestions, please, by all means, let Tom know what they are, and he will work on integrating any of those things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=377.245">We</a>  are on our way there and positioned for being able to use that to start to talk to the community when we are ready for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=388.171">Then</a>  the last thing, we did have a subcommittee meeting earmarked for June 20th for the communication subcommittee, and that meeting will be canceled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=402.192">And</a>  I will reach out to the communications team to find another Zoom time for us so we can move forward on some of the preparation things that we were talking about at our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=413.976">But</a>  I will tell you for sure it will not happen probably until the beginning of July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=422.25">because</a>  I don't have any minutes left in the day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=424.772">So</a>  I'm sure that's true of everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=427.054">It's</a>  June and it's just sort of a full court press. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=429.956">So</a>  we'll spend some time in the summer to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=433.018">And</a>  our summer meetings will be on the schedule unless we are in a true holding pattern and in which case I will let you know and we'll cancel those meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=441.065">But</a>  my plan is for the summer meetings to be Zoom only so everyone can be where they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=447.93">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=448.791">Is</a>  everybody okay with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=450.673">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=454.816">Okay,</a>  so on to the next item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=459.059">We're</a>  going to take a look at the ed profile again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=461.942">What</a>  I did since we last spoke is integrate feedback that I got from lots of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=471.069">Thank</a>  you, Maria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=472.868">Thank</a>  you, Libby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=474.088">Thank</a>  you, Luke. <a

crushed it in the performing arts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=480.991">And</a>  what I wanted to do, what I'm hoping that we can do tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=485.533">Hey,</a>  Paul. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=486.934">What</a>  I'm hoping we can do tonight is sort of collect any additional feedback that you have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=491.856">There</a>  are some placeholders in here that are contingent on the staff having some time to meet with all the district administrators. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=499.859">And</a>  so what I'm hoping that we can do is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=502.776">talk</a>  about what we see here, talk about any additional suggestions, agree on the things that are listed here as placeholders, and provide an approval as amended and to be completed so that, you know, and we'll share the final copy with you all, but if you do that, that will give me the leeway to sort of collect up all the last pieces and get this submitted as well, which I would like to do before June 30th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=529.866">So</a>  a couple of big changes that I made, let's see, are start on page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=539.513">The</a>  one big change that I made starts on page eight, which provides a deeper description of the library in its current form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=553.724">Thank</a>  you, Maria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=555.985">So</a>  that is one change that has been made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=559.724">Then</a>  there is reference to the library as well down in the non-traditional and other spaces section.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=574.949">Then</a>  if we fast forward to page 12, this is the section that got</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=588.808">a</a>  really substantive overhaul based on all the things that were provided to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=597.895">So</a>  at the top of page 13 in course spaces, still to be added to this document, just for sort of everybody to sort of shake their head and say yes, those are the things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=612.966">There</a>  is some discussion about Curtis Tufts that has to go into this section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=618.418">There</a>  is discussion about early EEC, early education and childcare, so that is both our Chapter 74 program as well as our NEAP programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=629.341">Kids</a>  Corner, which is our daycare program for Medford Public Schools employees, and certainly they are at capacity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=644.025">I</a>  think there would be no shortage of people interested in that service if there was space to increase enrollment and open that up to the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=651.63">And</a>  then the final thing that is on the to-be-added list in core spaces is that felt integration project that we talked about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=659.535">I</a>  know Susanne was looking for some information about what that said so that we can sort of paint some broad strokes about that as well in terms of this is our sort of goal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=671.899">So</a>  I'll stop talking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=672.859">Are</a>  there any questions, thoughts, changes about the course basis section?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=681.921">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=682.101">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=682.361">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=682.581">If</a>  you're volunteering, I will sign you up to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=687.322">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=688.623">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=688.883">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=701.427">Maybe</a>  some of these suggestions based on this piece of property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=705.331">Do</a>  you foresee what you will make for the location?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=711.077">That</a>  will all happen in the feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=713.119">So</a>  that is some time from now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=715.801">I</a>  did, in some places, try to <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=725.297">sort</a>  of describe that and it's probably buried in one of these sections and so what the other thing I'll do is find it and put it at the top of this section as well.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=734.023">I</a>  hinted it in the site section.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=736.184">Yes,</a>  I think that danced around it but yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=739.506">Okay,</a>  so I will, I am making a note that we will add that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=748.452">Luke?</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=762.308">current</a>  spaces, and any discussion of proposed changes to current spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=770.372">So</a>  I'm sort of constrained by thinking and applying to this as the current space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=777.975">I</a>  didn't interpret this as involved in a design concept, because logically, they arise and arrive in details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=792.223">So</a>  when I read some of this, especially on page 13, it seems like it's a design vision suit, a multi-part design vision that's being proposed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=804.566">And</a>  so I'm asking the committee at large, is that appropriate statement to include in this document</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=824.248">So</a>  I asked a similar question of MSBA when I spoke with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=829.452">And</a>  what they said was they use the information in this section to get a feel for the kind of building we're trying to create. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=838.498">So</a>  I think that is like an answer and a non-answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=845.123">And</a>  I thought about that, too, as I was pulling in some of Tracy's content. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=852.887">to</a>  bring that to this group because I read it and I was like, I can see what he's talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=861.58">Like</a>  I can visualize <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=864.421">what</a>  he's saying when he talks about the performing arts space in this building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=870.882">And</a>  so I found it very helpful to read that to get a sense of, do I agree with this, yes or no? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=877.183">I</a>  think I did for the by and large. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=880.064">And</a>  I'm not an expert in space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=883.144">So</a>  I was like, Tracy thinks we probably do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=886.665">So</a>  I put it in here with that in mind, which is to say, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=893.538">designer</a>  or MSBA is trying to understand where our head is at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=900.462">I</a>  think this sufficiently describes how we're currently feeling about the performing arts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=905.685">So</a>  Libby and Brian, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of your experience in this space and whether you feel strongly about what's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=917.951">Is</a>  it too much? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=918.512">Is</a>  it not enough, et cetera?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=920.273">I</a>  don't think you can get a huge amount</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=923.383">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=923.583">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=924.063">What</a>  I'm saying is, I took this question as being scopely written. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=931.967">And</a>  I don't disagree with any of what Patrice is proposing here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=934.608">I'm</a>  just saying that the question doesn't belong in this document.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=957.839">You</a>  know, I wouldn't limit it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=959.219">I</a>  don't think they penalize anybody for adding too much information.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=964.121">Could</a>  we propose a vision for other activities? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=968.463">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=968.623">I</a>  could do that for Curtis Tufts too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=970.524">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=970.864">OK,</a>  because I wasn't sure in terms of</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=981.085">I</a>  mean, because it's very different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=983.147">I</a>  mean, I like what Joan and I wrote in the back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=986.409">But</a>  if we're looking at core spaces and what we need out of space, I would want to move what we have currently inside the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=997.137">Just</a>  flatten it, you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=999.238">Or</a>  make it round or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1001.62">But</a>  I just would like to take the philosophy, like shoot for the moon, like we said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1005.383">And</a>  I know we're going to have time during <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1008.445">our</a>  admin meetings to work on it, which will be great.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1010.946">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1011.706">So</a>  if you're signing up for that, that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1014.147">I'll</a>  sign up for it with Joan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1018.269">And</a>  so, Luke, I think as you read this, if there are changes in that vein that paint a bigger picture, I think that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1027.192">The</a>  other thing I think we can use this document for is when we went to Arlington and we walked around a brand new building, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1038.565">The</a>  first thing you saw was like a student-run cafe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1044.192">Nobody</a>  in this building is like dreaming about a student-run cafe because <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1050.117">It's</a>  beyond the scope of what, by and large, we know to be about high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1057.004">I</a>  didn't have a student-run cafe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1058.846">You</a>  didn't have a student-run cafe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1060.687">Those</a>  weren't things back when we were kids going to high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1063.951">And</a>  we know what's in this building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1065.332">And</a>  some people probably know what those options are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1067.654">But</a>  I think this is also a nice opportunity for us to say to the community, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1073.972">here's</a>  this big vision, like, here's where we're at right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1078.433">And</a>  this is the beginning, because I think it could get juices flowing, which will like feed into the feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1086.716">Luke.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1087.996">So</a>  let's say, okay, by allowing us to make strong statements, and have it <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1107.268">I</a>  worry that we drown out the voices that we've not heard from yet, that we haven't engaged with yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1116.512">And</a>  it's almost like we're taking a hold of the headline, and we're driving in the directions that we want, without even doing an initial read. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1129.737">It's</a>  got to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1133.02">I</a>  think that could be a process problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1136.121">So</a>  I want to bring it up.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1139.082">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1139.242">I</a>  think also just remember that this is a great time to be visionary and think of big ideas, but also it will not limit what goes in the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1145.303">Because</a>  there's still going to be a programming process where you'll go through with every space that needs to be in the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1150.305">And</a>  it will include big, great ideas, new spaces that no one's even thought of yet, but also down to offices and admissions spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1158.428">I</a>  mean, yes, we should make sure we're not overlooking anybody that feels like they're being left out of the vision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1163.13">But</a>  also, we're not limited to this space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1165.711">So</a>  if another great idea comes up later, or just important space that hasn't been mentioned, I'll still use it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1171.112">And</a>  I think the other thing that is important to remember is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1176.433">There's</a>  no requirement even that the school building committee is involved in the creation of this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1182.117">The</a>  requirement is that it is submitted by the district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1185.62">So</a>  I think it's appropriate for this team to start to paint a picture for people to react to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1192.484">So</a>  I think I'm OK with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1193.805">I'm</a>  personally OK with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1197.008">I</a>  think to the point of engaging the community, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1201.382">I</a>  do want to engage the community when there's experts in the room who can do that well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1208.808">I</a>  don't want us to be too far out ahead of that process because I think none of us, particularly, is equipped to do that kind of visioning process with the community in a way that's going to be consistent with what has to happen during feasibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1225.5">So</a>  I don't want to create a situation where we are <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1231.271">sort</a>  of out over our skis essentially. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1233.814">So</a>  I think like what I would use this document when we sort of get to the point of publishing this to the community, I mean, they can, it's in the meeting documents and everything, but to say like, this is our, this is like the jumping off point that the committee accelerated to get us to the place where like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1254.365">the</a>  door, we can open the doors to this bigger vision, but we want you to read this and start to think creatively about these spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1261.168">The</a>  important thing is like programming, like Curtis Tufts, Curtis Tufts has to sort of say, this is our, this is like, you know, this is our place to <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1273.319">to</a>  describe all of that so and start that process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1277.184">So</a>  I think I'm okay with us being sort of visionary in terms of what we know, because as MSBA describes the requirement here is like, this is so that we can start to hear what's important to you and I can tell you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1290.837">I</a>  feel good that the things that we hear about on the school committee all the time are well represented here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1297.641">Athletics,</a>  performing arts, Curtis Tufts, the alternative space for the high school, like all of those things are the heavy hitter topics for us, generally speaking.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1309.969">Peter?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1311.69">My</a>  one takeaway from this is having worked in schools that had been through MSBA projects or school building projects, however you want to look at it, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1322.972">people</a>  often talk about the visionary hopes that they had and that they wish they'd done more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1329.959">that</a>  they'd wish they'd put in more of it because that way the voters could have seen, the people could have seen what it could have been. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1338.425">And</a>  instead, they almost felt hemmed in by worrying about like, oh, will it pass? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1344.309">Will</a>  it not pass? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1346.151">And</a>  my suggestion, having been through this a few times in various things, is to make the building as visionary as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1355.357">so</a>  that you inspire the community around it, and that you really wrap them into the possibilities and the potential.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1365.641">Oh,</a>  sorry, Larry?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1368.383">I</a>  agree with that statement 100%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1372.624">With</a>  regards to the student-run food service, when we are the students built this, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1383.163">doors,</a>  the acoustical ceiling, electricity, wiring, everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1386.545">This</a>  was some time back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1389.487">The</a>  students were clamoring for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1391.928">But</a>  we couldn't do it because the word at that time was, like, hide and kill. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1397.551">You</a>  know, we're frustrated with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1400.353">But</a>  because of issues of fairness and so forth, that not all students, understandably, could afford it for sale. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1409.338">So</a>  I just think going into that, now most of the regional schools I've been to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1413.262">have</a>  food service. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1415.903">And</a>  it's really good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1417.064">Good</a>  quality. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1418.085">Everybody</a>  loves it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1419.145">Works.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1419.546">I</a>  don't know how they're getting around that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1420.866">Maybe</a>  they have meal tickets or something.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1424.248">The</a>  one in Arlington is like a cafe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1426.93">So</a>  the one in Arlington is like limited, because you can't interfere with the food service program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1432.933">That's</a>  a whole other problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1434.674">But</a>  what was in Arlington was like a cafe, essentially, like coffee, bar.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1439.897">Well,</a>  the students, to this day, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1442.597">So</a>  last year, they, Mr. Brown attended Pierce.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1445.758">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1447.499">So</a>  there's that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1448.14">Number</a>  two, in terms of vision for the shot.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1452.562">So</a>  that's all in the chapter 74 piece in that other form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1457.524">So</a>  it doesn't make a huge appearance here for that reason.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1460.845">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1467.608">Yeah,</a>  so we, I did put something in there just so it doesn't get lost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1471.665">But</a>  the Chapter 74 form talks about all of those programs that we're trying to explore and the proposed capacity.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1480.372">The</a>  space itself, Essex has an institute up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1485.756">Their</a>  shops are in actual, more like warehouse-type buildings adjacent to the main structure of the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1492.562">What</a>  we really need is space and metal buildings that are well insulated with all the power and stuff are fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1502.375">So</a>  depending on how the layout was, as a concept, we would find the sort of the top wing that was a little more industrial. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1511.64">And</a>  that way, that might also give us more square footage, which is what we would need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1516.303">And</a>  also, we have good money for that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1521.627">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1522.867">I</a>  can add something about that in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1526.209">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1527.01">Paul?</a> </p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1528.811">Yeah,</a>  well, so it's only the two of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1532.467">when</a>  we were walking around the Arlington building, two things that were noticed to me just like through my experience of it, I think what we were told is that there were multiple iterations of what the building was going to look like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1542.773">I</a>  think that as they kind of continue creating that profile and creating that image of what Arlington needed as a community, they started to say, well, what more can we add to this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1552.339">Because</a>  we have a basic idea of what we can add more to it because their needs are starting to grow as we start envisioning what we want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1562.507">this</a>  as a starting point or as a jumping off point because it doesn't, I don't think it limits us in that we can't continue to grow or consider what the community actually needs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1572.034">I</a>  mean, we're only a select few people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1573.555">There's</a>  a community of 60,000 people who all probably have an opinion in some capacity on some program the high school could offer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1580.58">So</a>  I think that shooting for the stars or really considering what's possible is also difficult because we don't know what's possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1588.446">When</a>  we were walking around in Arlington, I mean, more than half the tour, I was just like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1592.582">at</a>  what they had to offer their students, what the faculty were experiencing, what the HFMA or the design firm were offering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1604.109">It</a>  took many years, of course, but they didn't know what they wanted when they started, because they had their old building, and they were like, we start from scratch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1611.034">And</a>  I think it's similar is true now, where we don't even really understand what we can do, because it's never happened before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1616.998">So</a>  ideally, a student cafe, we've never had that before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1620.02">I</a>  didn't have it here, and I'm sure many of you <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1631.373">we're</a>  going to other communities that do have that, which I think is why I shouldn't really push to go to like other programs that have done MSPA, or it's other programs in general that are offering things that we can't have as of right now, we could consider the program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1643.52">So</a>  I'm okay with it in its current wording, just as a starting, as a limiting, like.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1650.884">Paul?</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1651.764">Yes,</a>  I want to feed everything into privacy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1656.067">But</a>  when I think about the community involvement, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1663.332">Several</a>  people have mentioned that we are somewhat limited by our own experiences and knowledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1668.636">Well,</a>  we are completely limited by our own experiences and knowledge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1673.179">And</a>  so unlike the community, we're going to go around and look at lots of schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1679.103">The</a>  whole method is not limited. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1682.045">And</a>  so I think it's both to be expected and reasonable to think we have an outsized impact on what's possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1693.913">I</a>  mean, obviously, I've not surveyed the community, and I look forward to the professionals for trying to do that, doing that, because, like, I don't envision them providing us with a list of things to do with this building, this room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1710.24">Like,</a>  they're going to be providing, in my mind, a set of values, what's important to them, and that we work from there to create a vision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1719.883">But</a>  to ask the community will be self-selected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1723.345">It</a>  will absolutely be not representative of the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1727.368">That's</a>  100% not an option. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1730.51">To</a>  somehow generate a vision, I think it will be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1738.035">I</a>  just don't see that as something that's happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1740.977">And</a>  that's sort of, in my mind, I mean, I'm on this committee because I have a certain few things that I need to make sure <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1749.395">you</a>  know, stop talking about, stop thinking about, and I assume everybody here was not here for, are here for a reason, other than who would like to do high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1761.497">Well,</a>  that describes half of Medford or more, but they're not investing in five to seven years of their lives getting it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1772.339">And</a>  so I really do care very much about what Medford has to say, but like me, I mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1779.448">one</a>  level school in rural New Hampshire, it was a regional school, built in 1970 or so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1786.09">And</a>  to me, that's what high school is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1789.09">I</a>  sure hope we don't do that here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1791.611">But</a>  until we start visiting other places, I don't think it's possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1799.053">So</a>  I look forward to that opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1801.533">And</a>  then sharing what we're experiencing on those tours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1806.274">Like,</a>  we saw this thing, like the Harlem Demand <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1810.174">tunnels</a>  that are like as big as this, from the ceiling to the first floor, going to the library to provide light, natural light everywhere in the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1822.107">That's</a>  kind of weird to be honest, but also like never seen such a thing and thought it was cool to go there, but I'm excited for</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1846.693">I</a>  guess for me and maybe Peter knows since he's on the cutting edge of kind of the research, I feel like some of the research is missing around this around at the educational underpinning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1860.266">How</a>  are we going to deliver instruction? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1863.195">And</a>  I feel, you know, been listening, and I happen to love school architecture, but I'm also thinking there's a school in San Diego that I know we've all talked about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1872.678">I</a>  know it's the vision for Curtis Tufts that we get to project-based learning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1877.019">So</a>  we're not looking at the typical classroom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1879.96">We're</a>  looking at collaboration stations, collaboration areas, that the hub is probably the library, and we're calling it something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1888.417">And</a>  I want to make sure that we're not losing that because this building is, I'm sure in 1970, when this building was being built, we were like, this is cutting edge for 1970. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1899.083">Okay,</a>  no one expected that it was going to look the way that it did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1901.924">And</a>  I would say for the 1900 building that is Curtis Tufts, which I love and I'd love to replicate in different ways, but I just think, I don't want to miss the research on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1913.291">I</a>  think going to high schools is really important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1915.232">There's</a>  a school in San Diego that does, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1917.844">project-based</a>  learning, and it's how they structure their day, but it feels like a warehouse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1922.768">It</a>  looks like this, and kids come together like they're doing a project, and they leave into different rooms to go do their part of the project or meet with their facilitator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1935.437">So</a>  I want to make sure that, because I think we have to be light years ahead of everyone, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1942.363">We're</a>  also going to need to be budgeting for how a teacher is going to teach differently. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1946.625">And</a>  I don't want to lose that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1948.366">I</a>  mean, you can have a building and not do what you said you were going to do with the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1953.368">So</a>  for example, Mosconomet went through and created this round building so that kids would never have a place to go anywhere but around the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1963.393">It's</a>  round. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1964.533">It</a>  wasn't economically feasible when it came to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1966.815">So</a>  when you get to the third floor, educationally, there was no air conditioning because they ran out of money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1972.722">You</a>  shouldn't have had a third floor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1974.243">So</a>  I just want to make, I'm just thinking curriculum instruction and assessment 15 years from now, because that's typically when probably the building will be built. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1983.788">And</a>  I don't want our plans or what our vision, you just have to be five years ahead of everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1990.972">And</a>  I don't know if you know that school in San Diego, Peter, but it's like cutting edge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=1995.335">It's,</a>  you know, it's, and their achievement is through the roof and it's attached to a vocational school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2002.228">And</a>  so kids are going to and from and creating and design. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2005.192">It's</a>  really about design. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2006.974">So</a>  I know that's what we engage my students, but I want to start even younger with middle schoolers, because I think in terms of Curtis Tufts, it's too late for our kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2017.786">They</a>  should have been engaged a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2020.667">So</a>  I just don't want to lose the research. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2023.208">I'm</a>  happy to do some research and get some articles.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2025.768">So</a>  that's the work that the administrative team has signed up to do, because they will have to describe the curriculum, the 2B curriculum section of this, which is not complete yet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2040.131">You</a>  don't want to have an innovative building and then do the same things you've already done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2043.832">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2044.432">I</a>  believe that's our work for next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2046.773">Oh,</a>  so you know more than I do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2048.533">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2049.546">But</a>  I just, you know, I don't want that to be lost because we might as well have the same development.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2057.87">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2058.631">Luke?</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2059.351">I</a>  hope that makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2060.732">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2061.712">Just</a>  a couple of points. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2063.373">I</a>  think a few of our responses here is delinquent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2066.455">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2066.775">I</a>  thought the question was still limited. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2069.156">I</a>  got a presentation inside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2070.797">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2071.177">So</a>  about this vertical development, expanding things like growth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2077.505">I</a>  think it is a mistake not to engage with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2081.107">I</a>  think deferring until professionals are involved is possibly too severe an instinct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2093.033">I</a>  think there should be some formal engagement, probably this summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2097.436">We</a>  talked about it in the survey and the education committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2100.617">I</a>  thought that was a wise idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2102.978">It's</a>  just a, what do you want? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2105.18">And</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2106.343">Their</a>  responses probably won't be very detailed terms with long explanations about how different elements are integrated, how they support learning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2116.948">I'm</a>  not expecting that, but I am expecting to get an understanding of what the community views as important and what they want to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2124.592">And</a>  from that, we kind of, you know, know that first and document it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2130.475">And</a>  then we'll use that as part of our vision <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2134.89">And</a>  certainly, a lot of the imaginary is discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2139.151">There's</a>  a place for that in the process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2140.832">It's</a>  feasibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2142.452">Once</a>  we have money earmarked, and we are committed to feasibility, that money will be deployed on consultants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2152.535">And</a>  at the end of feasibility, we should have, judging by all the schools that are studying, which is 2.7, we'll have three to five options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2163.615">And</a>  they will have significant detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2166.217">They</a>  will spur a lot of community conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2170.539">And</a>  it's probably going to get messy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2171.999">There's</a>  going to be a lot of opinions and so on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2174.941">And</a>  I also want to refer that to feasibility and focus on executing eligibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2181.744">Because</a>  the reason it's not here is because I've seen through many sources. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2188.808">I've</a>  spoken to people in these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2199.923">when</a>  it goes well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2200.984">And</a>  what happens when it doesn't go well? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2202.825">And</a>  when there's significant disagreement over particular things, Paul is a great example, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2209.429">If</a>  you pitch a perfect game, and nobody in high school, you're done in six years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2214.793">If</a>  you don't, you might be on your 14th account, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2217.355">So</a>  I'm here to keep this thing on track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2219.396">I</a>  just want to voice that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2232.939">Yeah,</a>  so I guess a couple things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2239.541">I</a>  am also here to keep this on track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2241.362">It</a>  is like my mission in life to keep this thing on track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2247.004">One</a>  of the things that, so I agree with you that we can start to ask those questions in the summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2252.704">What</a>  I'm unclear about is are you saying we should not submit this until we've done that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2256.929">Or</a>  are you suggesting that we submit this and then we use that sort of body of information to also feed the consultants that are going to come on?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2286.009">So</a>  it's sort of describing you and also sort of outlining the deficiency.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2292.511">And</a>  so is there something in here that you want to not be in here?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2297.032">If</a>  you're introducing new things that we want, I think that material belongs in these buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2307.395">I</a>  think that this question is asking us is to tell us currently</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2322.583">It</a>  is asking for core spaces, specialty spaces, and non-traditional spaces that are described above are proposed to be used if known at this time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2336.046">Additionally,</a>  if there are proposed changes indicate how they will impact space needs and what training to support staff will or may be provided. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2345.696">That</a>  is the question.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2347.757">Yeah,</a>  and so that table is a listing of what we currently have, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2352.92">Those</a>  classrooms, those current buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2355.761">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2356.122">And</a>  I'm just bringing this up because, again, I'm just looking at the subtracts, but scoping is a requirence of a fee for one of the things that I tend to think of the language products.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2370.95">So</a>  is it, OK, bear with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2373.923">My</a>  brain short-circuited several hours back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2376.826">Is</a>  there something you're proposing to take out? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2379.508">Are</a>  there words on the page that you want to take out?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2382.15">I</a>  would say anything that doesn't exist today.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2384.553">Which</a>  is?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2384.973">We</a>  have an auditorium which has lighting and acoustics and a sound system.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2401.565">Anesthesia,</a>  all of these things exist, they just exist poorly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2406.207">If</a>  they're a wish list for book one tomorrow, I would say book one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2413.091">However,</a>  that conversation has to be had.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2416.712">Are</a>  you concerned that the MSBA will trip up that process, or that people are still concerned that they haven't had a chance to get feedback? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2424.816">At</a>  least in this document, without reaching out to the community.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2429.109">So</a>  my concern is, so that's the last one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2431.832">I'm</a>  concerned that we're disenfranchising the community by allowing our kids to link into this saying, well, we want the school to be, without ever having the age of the community to ask what it wants. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2446.77">I</a>  think it's disenfranchising.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2448.608">Yeah,</a>  I think the community wants to talk and I think what the community wants is to talk and feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2455.115">And</a>  and we have, we can't get there and agree on how we are going to get this document submitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2462.903">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2463.303">So</a>  that is why I'm just trying to be really concrete. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2466.046">Like,</a>  what is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2468.928">I</a>  think what you're saying is there's too much information in items 1 through 11 on page 14. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2475.991">And</a>  instead, we should maybe be more broad about what we are thinking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2481.473">Is</a>  that what you're saying?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2482.454">I'm</a>  saying if there's anything that doesn't exist today, it's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2486.696">It's</a>  right there.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2489.777">I</a>  mean, other than the mini stage, all of those things exist poorly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2504.112">This</a>  goes in our front of the bracket, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2505.872">This</a>  is part of our official eligibility-based schedule. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2509.813">It's</a>  going to be viewed by anyone who answers the ROI and makes proposals in our community for feasibility study. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2517.595">If</a>  there are certain things that the size don't rob, then that contractor will see that and really think about that, possibly to the depths of other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2526.797">And</a>  that is kind of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2530.707">disenfranchised</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2531.868">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2532.828">I</a>  also would encourage this group to choose their words carefully. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2537.812">Like,</a>  if we start telling people we're disenfranchising them, they will feel that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2542.515">And</a>  I don't think the community thinks of us that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2546.157">And</a>  so we shouldn't talk that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2550.059">So</a>  I think this stuff does find its own legs in the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2555.263">So</a>  the school committee, under its authority, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2562.532">appointed</a>  you all, and we're here to make sure we don't mess this up, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2567.814">Because</a>  everyone in the city is definitely afraid we are going to mess this up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2572.637">So</a>  it's the truth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2576.758">So</a>  we can strike item 11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2580.76">All</a>  those other things are there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2582.121">I</a>  will go through and make it a little bit less specific, which I think is totally fine and reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2589.718">so</a>  that it does not sound so specific. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2592.021">And</a>  I think to your point, like when we put out a press release that says these documents are complete, there needs to be some framing of this document as like a starting point by this committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2607.493">In</a>  meetings open to the public, it's tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2610.474">It's</a>  like May and June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2611.674">There's</a>  not a whole lot of time in the community for people to be with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2615.515">But</a>  the entire point of this was to collect all the feedback that we've heard all along the way, pair it up with the teaching and learning methodology, and get us sort of off to the races. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2627.337">And</a>  to me, that is what we're here to do in eligibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2632.118">So</a>  I think we're still on track to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2635.8">And</a>  so I think the other place where there is some real description here is around the library media space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2644.605">But</a>  I would also say, I don't see anything in here that doesn't sort of match the description of current in some way, shape, or form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2654.011">So</a>  there's some description of what the current state is that Maria put in, and then there is the description of the like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2662.49">the</a>  ideal space, other than a restroom close by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2669.615">Movable</a>  walls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2671.857">And</a>  movable walls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2673.058">I</a>  think other than that, we are fairly saying something about how we're envisioning, and actually with the luxury of our head librarian doing that for us, that this is what we're envisioning that space to become. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2689.692">So</a>  that was the other place where I thought it was very detailed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2694.895">And</a>  so I don't know if anybody saw anything else that they thought was maybe too detailed.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2700.679">There</a>  are some items in the library section that's really good information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2703.7">It's</a>  probably more necessary like a little farther down the road. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2707.062">Needs</a>  a sink and like boxes for the cabinets, like that's all great, maybe like a little too granular for this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2712.986">So</a>  I don't know if it hurts us to have it in there, but it may be <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2717.391">And</a>  to Luke's point, it's focusing on one area of the project more than others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2721.273">So</a>  we could, I mean, I wouldn't rid of any of it, or I would maybe hold onto it for later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2726.735">Oh,</a>  sure, sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2727.356">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2727.816">Maybe</a>  we could just save it for the visioning and programming part.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2733.939">Yeah,</a>  give me that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2736.66">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2738.061">Maybe</a>  one way to kind of address some of the concerns that I raised and perhaps others can share is to have more consistent formatting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2748.618">So,</a>  you know, different formatting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2750.899">It</a>  looks like you're emphasizing something over another thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2753.72">That</a>  will all be cleaned up before this starts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2755.581">So</a>  perhaps if that were standardized, things would pop out more than other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2761.644">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2762.404">And</a>  then also we could adjust wording here and there where something needs to be designed to strike that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2771.909">Say,</a>  current scenes are this and</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2784.793">different</a>  it'll land okay yeah all of that the sort of a wacky template to work in and it has like all kinds of different bullets so all of that would be cleaned up before we're done to make sure that it's consistent I think that as for those of us that did have some writing to</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2810.68">The</a>  assumption was that you would be reformatting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2813.822">And</a>  I just, I don't suffer from remedy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2816.524">No,</a>  it's totally fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2819.085">It's</a>  totally fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2820.807">That's</a>  totally fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2821.967">But</a>  I did want to say before that, Laurie, if you do look at some of the ideas for the library, I had project-based learning in mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2830.313">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2831.553">Because</a>  I also thought, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2833.855">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2836.757">Other</a>  questions about section three?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2841.255">Aaron?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2844.356">So</a>  I think, like you mentioned, for example, some of the more specific items, like on the library, the library media space, we're suggesting that certain ones are more specific than others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2854.501">So</a>  are we taking them out? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2856.142">Because</a>  the previous section about the State of the Art and the Performing Arts Facility, we're going to strike 11, but then we're not going to strike others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2864.585">I</a>  just don't really know if it makes sense to strike certain ones, not other ones.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2869.037">Like</a>  I think we're just I think what I'm hearing is to just bring everything up to the same level of detail.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2874.381">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2875.322">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2876.423">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2876.763">I</a>  mean, I prefer that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2877.724">OK,</a>  we're going to really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2880.366">I</a>  don't think it makes a lot of sense to strike certain things and not other ones if we're going to be specific about certain areas that not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2885.61">Yeah,</a>  I think one or the other shows up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2888.612">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2892.195">Sorry,</a>  Larry, did I see your hand a minute ago?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2894.797">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2898.314">Is</a>  Essex Tech on the list of schools to visit? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2901.637">It</a>  can be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2902.977">I</a>  would say that that should be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2904.498">Also,</a>  I'd like to propose, if you're interested, NELTA, the New England Lakers Training Academy, is just completing, as you speak, a brand new campus, which would be suitable for vocational courses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2920.669">But</a>  it has loose clusters of classrooms, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2927.133">as</a>  does Essex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2928.374">So</a>  conceptually, it goes to different schools, and you can take a picture if you want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2934.436">Sean</a>  downstairs at Media Tech does a very good job with the students. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2939.198">By</a>  that point in the fall, or maybe beforehand, get logged in or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2943.699">But</a>  he's put together a nice little montage with music, and it kind of explains things that get us excited. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2952.703">So</a>  we can spend maybe going to the theater sometime and show <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2957.303">interested.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2957.743">So</a>  this is kind of what got us going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2959.784">So</a>  we didn't like set the table a little bit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2962.124">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2963.184">But</a>  I do think it's it's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2965.145">At</a>  this point, we're kind of paying with broad brush. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2970.566">But</a>  I think it's good to give the panel and and I personally, I guess, I think it's okay to say not all what is, but just to sort of play them a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2981.569">Also,</a>  you know, we would like to stay in New York theater. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2984.81">It's</a>  really, really nice spot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2987.685">We</a>  want those two things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2989.466">Classrooms</a>  are classrooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2990.627">They</a>  should be nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2991.347">They</a>  should be functional. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2992.628">Book,</a>  they just need space. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2994.67">I'll</a>  tear it up anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2996.731">So</a>  you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=2997.852">But</a>  saying what we want in a broad sense and putting that out, show the pictures of what we have liked, all these other tours and visits, and then we start the process of when it's everybody going to the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3010.5">And</a>  your Councilor was talking earlier about the connection with the films. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3014.543">Me,</a>  that is really big.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3016.52">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3017.34">And</a>  Suzanne was working on that, tracking down that application that went in some years ago now to do something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3027.465">It</a>  was very project-based learning integration with the outdoors oriented for another grant that we did not get, but she was going to go through the files and bring that information to figure out if there's anything that really should be put in.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3042.691">There</a>  was a rock climbing baseball out here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3050.359">winter,</a>  you know, groom cross-country ski course up there with some yurts you can enjoy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3055.061">I</a>  mean, that is so undeveloped and it's a gem for the entire city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3057.082">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3057.282">And</a>  not to be capitalistic, but there's plenty in terms of parking fees and concessions and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3062.023">I</a>  mean, that is such a beautiful <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3080.763">So</a>  how that integrates with the cross-country needs in that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3087.168">So</a>  to whet the appetite of it, to me, I think it's fair to point out what is here, some of the deficiencies, what we feel like we're lacking for the sake of students, and then sort of shoot them with some options of kind of what we're thinking.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3103.921">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3104.862">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3106.623">Any</a>  other questions, comments?</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3112.24">Maria,</a>  I just want to mention one thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3114.561">You're</a>  probably already where PVD High School is in process right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3117.762">They're</a>  about to begin the design phase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3120.544">So</a>  I spoke with the librarian at PVD High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3124.085">She</a>  gave me some of her notes, which I incorporated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3126.946">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3127.547">But</a>  they're just a few steps ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3129.407">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3129.727">It</a>  might be a resource. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3131.728">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3133.049">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3133.429">Brian?</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3133.989">What's</a>  your list of potential students who are unable to attend? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3138.851">What</a>  else is on there?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3141.749">So</a>  we talked about Arlington. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3143.009">We</a>  talked about Somerville, Belmont.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3147.132">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3149.533">And</a>  you know, the thing we may want to do is sort of reformat our summer meetings to be like tours instead so that we have some time in summer to do various tours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3167.04">I</a>  think that would be a great use of summer if we can get all of these documents, if we can get through all of these documents so that we really can sort of take the summer to put all of our like communication plans together, start to tell the community what we're saying, start to look at all those other schools and sort of get ready. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3184.512">So</a>  it might just be nice timing to do all of that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3187.915">If</a>  you want to go to Nelton, I think I can do this at home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3191.317">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3192.098">So</a>  and I think that's what you should do out there, especially with the vocational <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3197.124">Great,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3198.605">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3198.966">I'm</a>  sorry, what school is that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3203.91">Quincy.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3204.67">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3229.4">That</a>  was all incorporated into the campaign.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3237.722">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3245.264">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3246.544">Yeah,</a>  that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3249.485">Section</a>  four, community engagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3251.005">I</a>  think the last time we talked, people talked about like the sequencing of the information in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3262.153">And</a>  I tried to, although I'm finding the typos because I was doing this in my lap at the council meeting last night, but I did try to like re-sequence this to better flow with the information that we have in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3275.556">So</a>  talking about the communications and community engagement subcommittee first, I think it was last, and then talking about some of the things specifically that they asked about around what kinds of things are we considering doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3292.109">And</a>  then, in addition, doing a little bit of sort of just framing that last paragraph a little bit better about the engagement that we've already done around the co-location of Curtis Tufts, because that is a program that we are proposing to bring on here, and the school committee has done some very helpful, useful work to sort of move that forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3312.315">So</a>  that is... <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3319.495">I</a>  think that is everything in this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3326.22">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3333.967">Is</a>  there a motion to approve this document as amended and to be completed as noted?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3341.033">Motion</a>  to approve as amended and completed as noted.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3345.937">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3347.077">Second</a>  by your president.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3350.298">Yeah,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3353.14">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I put your name on the list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3357.382">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3360.944">Okay,</a>  so a motion by Dr. Cushing and Aaron, seconded by Aaron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3372.109">All</a>  of our voting members are in person, so all those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3378.532">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3380.794">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3382.336">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3386.399">So</a>  will you let me know if you'd like to talk to Jill about it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3390.163">Yes,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3390.443">I</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3398.249">Okay,</a>  the last item on our agenda for this evening is just to give you an update on the maintenance practices information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3409.255">So,</a>  Dr. Cushing, so let me pass this out and then I'll explain what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3448.95">Okay,</a>  does everyone have a coffee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3450.531">Oh,</a>  we're almost there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3452.792">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3455.034">Okay,</a>  so just as framing, the MSBA has an online portal where they require us to upload a whole variety of documents around our maintenance and capital planning practices. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3470.082">Earlier</a>  in this process, Tom and I sat down with that <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3477.245">system</a>  and we went through and we created this document to just try to provide like a working place for all of that information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3486.24">So</a>  you'll see all the questions listed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3491.185">throughout</a>  this document and what you'll see is the questions, the answer format. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3498.45">So</a>  many of these things are like yes, no type questions and then any comments, which would be comments that we need to put into the system to answer the question, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3510.269">So,</a>  if we start at the top, what I think you'll see is that the vast majority of this information has to be completed by Dr. Cushing, who's our representative on the committee in terms of <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3525.363">his</a>  work as the overseer of the facilities department for Medford Public Schools, among other 45 other jobs that he does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3534.81">But</a>  I think I just wanted to run through the questions here as a sort of jumping off point and talk a little bit about, you know, give you all a chance to review all the information that is populated in here already and talk about next steps for this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3556.224">So,</a>  if we start at the top, the 1st, series of questions is really around staffing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3560.149">So</a>  it asks about question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3562.733">Number</a>  1 is, is the facility maintenance performed by the municipality or the district in our, in our situation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3569.121">It's</a>  a combination of both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3571.238">So</a>  the districts largely has the responsibility for sort of all things maintenance until something gets too big and becomes a capital project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3579.983">And</a>  then the city, the city does step in our buildings and grounds department clears snow and they do other projects like paving and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3589.648">So</a>  it is truly a group effort. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3592.264">Item</a>  number two, are vendors used for any aspect of facilities maintenance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3596.567">And</a>  the answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3598.749">For</a>  all of these things, plumbing, pest management, elevator inspections, asbestos testing, et cetera, fire alarm systems, all of that good stuff.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3609.056">I'm</a>  just waiting on the name of our pest management company.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3612.878">Number</a>  three, full-time equivalent to help them understand how many custodians we have across the district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3621.614">Um,</a>  is there a director of facilities? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3623.936">The</a>  answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3625.637">And</a>  does the district have defined job descriptions for our custodial staff? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3631.002">And</a>  the answer is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3631.882">So</a>  we'll have to attach those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3634.584">Um,</a>  item number six. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3636.406">Is</a>  there a system of performance evaluations of the district's custodial and maintenance staff? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3641.47">Um,</a>  that is a work in progress, but we are, uh, pending contract negotiations around that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3650.858">And</a>  number seven, is training required or provided for the district's custodial and maintenance staff? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3656.78">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3657.24">And</a>  we cover some of the things that we have trained our staff in starting in 2023. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3662.662">And</a>  then number eight, is there a written maintenance plan for the district that details minimum custodial maintenance standards and governs day-to-day operations? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3673.686">The</a>  answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3675.647">And</a>  so we will have to attach those documents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3677.727">So</a>  that's the staffing section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3680.733">The</a>  planning is their preventive or predictive maintenance plan for the district's facilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3686.818">The</a>  answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3689.019">And</a>  we, there's an attachment that we'll have to provide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3692.042">Does</a>  the district have a work order system? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3694.003">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3695.064">We</a>  actually recently converted from. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3697.546">Email</a>  work order system, which is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3701.285">problematic,</a>  as you might mention, to a system called Operations Hero. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3706.307">Is</a>  that right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3708.287">And</a>  it is a true work order ticketing system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3711.508">And</a>  the district is sort of rolling folks onto that, both on the custodial staff and then also in the school buildings over the course they're working on that implementation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3723.532">The</a>  facilities condition index. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3726.567">Question</a>  number one, does the district conduct periodic inspections of school facilities to ascertain their conditions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3731.69">The</a>  answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3735.933">Item</a>  number two is, do we have a facilities condition index, which keeps track of school systems, identifies major system components, and tracks information? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3747.721">We</a>  purchased some software to begin doing that in February of 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3750.743">That's</a>  operation zero. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3755.886">Item</a>  number three, please describe how the district analyzes facility condition information and how that analysis impacts decisions on budget capital improvements and staff performance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3766.617">So,</a>  up until recently, the condition facility conditions and repairs were done on an as needed basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3775.052">The</a>  district, so beginning in FY 24, we've really begun to shift to a recommissioning model where we are looking at each of our schools on a periodic basis to understand their budgetary needs, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3790.675">Item</a>  number four is, do we have a protocol around commissioning and recommissioning? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3796.236">That</a>  is starting in FY 25. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3799.996">And</a>  that process is essentially on a periodic basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3804.197">You</a>  do sort of a soup to nuts assessment of what is happening in the building so that you can identify what it would take to bring the building back to its original condition in terms of its intention. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3815.452">And</a>  then what that does is it sort of highlights any maintenance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3820.323">practices</a>  that need to change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3822.784">HVAC</a>  can, you know, the big systems there are like HVAC oriented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3827.446">You</a>  may or may not know this, but we have a project going on right now in our middle schools that will replace HVAC systems in the Andrews Middle School and then in the entire McGlynn complex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3837.591">So</a>  those buildings are like in effect being reconditioned because of that substantive work, which is scheduled to be done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3846.094">Hopefully</a>  by next summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3847.615">Next</a>  summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3848.135">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3850.396">And</a>  the other schools, Brooks, Roberts, Missittuck, will get on to the reconditioning cycle with this next rehab. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3859.758">And</a>  then the expectation would be the high school would go on to a five-year loop with the other schools as well.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3865.779">Maria?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3865.899">I</a>  have a question, because those buildings are only 20-plus years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3870.02">Do</a>  you know what I'm going to say? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3872.181">Go</a>  for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3873.963">because</a>  of not being kept up or is that just aging out?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3879.329">I</a>  think that's actually a really good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3881.511">Both?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3881.871">Yeah,</a>  it really is both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3883.253">In</a>  all honesty, and with any of our architects and others who have a lot more experience than I do, the reality is as these buildings approach 25 years old, they're at midlife expectancy for their structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3898.487">So,</a>  you know, roofs last about 30 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3902.57">HVAC</a>  equipment, you know, some pieces of the equipment are expected to last 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3909.296">Some</a>  are expected to last 15. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3912.199">And,</a>  you know, your bigger equipment, your rooftop chillers, your compressors, things like that, with proper maintenance, will make it to that 25-year mark. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3921.127">But</a>  essentially at that point, I mean, everybody we have talked to in our process for OPM and designers is, oh yeah, they're at the end of their life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3931.911">They</a>  could be the Rolls Royce. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3933.752">And</a>  I think this is how I described it to someone like, you know, we're not going to put more money into fixing these because it's not a classic Mustang or classic car. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3944.936">It's</a>  a 1975 Pinto.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3950.879">So</a>  yes, yes to both of those things, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3954.981">Proactive</a>  maintenance extends the life of these systems, but there is a life of the system that you tap out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3965.026">And</a>  I think what you see, particularly when you start to think about that kind of <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3970.973">system</a>  programming that's going to go into this new high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3974.835">Arlington</a>  talked a lot about how they don't know how to use their building just yet, because it is so highly technical and so very different than how their building used to operate, that they said often they are like, this thing is broken. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3990.221">And</a>  it's not broken at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3991.681">They</a>  just don't know how to use it yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3993.922">And</a>  so there's this huge learning curve that goes into these new buildings in particular. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=3998.746">But,</a>  you know, for the same reason that like... <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4001.919">when</a>  your car is like fully electrified inside, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4006.24">Like</a>  there's more parts, there's more things that can go wrong, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4010.882">There's</a>  more, there's more, well, if you're completely electric, that's different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4014.983">But</a>  like you start talking about like even the advancement of anything else that's going on in your home, like you're, you know, the refrigerator from the 70s lasted for 30 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4025.426">And</a>  it's still, maybe it's still running in avocado green, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4029.627">If</a>  you buy a refrigerator 10 years ago, you're probably thinking about it's time for a new refrigerator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4035.792">So</a>  the entire way we maintain our buildings will change with this new building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4041.837">And</a>  I think what they're trying to understand is, how do we do it today? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4045.92">So</a>  how big of a climb is this going to be for us to take good care of this building? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4051.004">And</a>  the answer is, we have work to do in that department, for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4057.165">we</a>  are trying to get there proactively so that we have arrived by the time this building comes on, because that's going to be its own challenge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4067.353">The</a>  environment question, does the district routinely monitor air quality? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4072.477">The</a>  answer to that is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4075.419">Does</a>  the district implement practices in the EPA's Tools for Schools program? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4080.363">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4082.104">More</a>  information forthcoming.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4084.106">Yeah,</a>  we do have more work to do on that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4087.995">Does</a>  the district have a protocol to eliminate toxic chemicals and use green products for cleaning and repairs? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4095.017">Best</a>  practices for building operators typically include regular inspecting, testing, balancing, and cleaning of HVAC components in order to make them most efficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4102.7">Do</a>  we do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4104.5">I</a>  think that's like maybe a working yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4108.462">Does</a>  the district monitor energy consumption and spending? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4111.363">We</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4112.143">We've</a>  started that this year.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4116.817">It</a>  is a very interesting analysis.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4119.199">I</a>  can tell you right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4121.32">I</a>  think it's one word. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4122.481">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4122.841">Luke?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4123.382">Since</a>  COVID, yes.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4142.276">With</a>  outside testing, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4145.238">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4146.458">There's</a>  technology now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4149.72">Meters.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4150.561">Across</a>  a number of EPA metrics, a number of international metrics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4165.569">Anything</a>  you want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4167.37">And</a>  if there is a problem, you can go that way.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4175.353">Yeah,</a>  it's once a year or if a concern is raised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4179.197">So</a>  when we had flooding, I forget when that was, December, January, whenever we were hit at the high school with a heavy flood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4189.19">Once</a>  we had everything cleaned up, we brought in UEC consultants and they did air testing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4196.993">It</a>  was found to be fine at the Brooks and other schools, the Mississippi in particular, where there's been some buildup of land or the land is just up against the foundation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4206.716">There's</a>  always been some concern of moisture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4209.177">So</a>  we will do testing in those spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4212.618">But</a>  the other thing too is across our <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4217.598">District</a>  right now we're doing a district mapping project to know every single space to get pictures of every space to really understand every space for us to be able to have a device like you mentioned would probably have a significant ramp up cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4233.238">that</a>  I think we should really look at when we go for a new high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4237.881">And</a>  I think what Member Graham is saying about the things that we need to learn as part of this HVAC project with the Enders and the McGlynn, that's been one of my key questions is, okay, this is great, but once we commission these <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4251.591">How</a>  are we going to know that our maintenance staff are well trained to be able to monitor and then not just like know what to monitor, but know when you want to know something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4262.019">This</a>  is outside of my scope. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4264.121">I</a>  can't try to fix this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4265.302">I</a>  need to call someone in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4267.724">So</a>  those types of things like know what you know and then also know what you don't know so that the system can be maintained by truly trained HVAC professionals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4278.453">And</a>  our maintenance staff does a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4280.932">It's</a>  just, you know, we're getting into an area with these building systems that require extraordinarily high training and high skill.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4294.078">Can</a>  I give a quick example? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4296.399">It's</a>  not the maintenance guy's fault. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4299.56">There</a>  are times when everybody over here goes and does a winter with a distinct class about kids over at C building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4315.6">And</a>  simple, but good quality to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4322.265">Another</a>  quick example. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4326.448">The</a>  lights we had in the shops were terrible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4329.15">Those</a>  fluorescents, a lot of juice, they didn't shine very brightly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4333.953">So</a>  we got this rant of getting new LEDs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4336.715">And</a>  so it's like, not very literally in the shops. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4339.237">It's</a>  one thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4340.358">Except</a>  that whoever sold the bill of goods <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4343.963">got</a>  all this technological stuff to try to help us to save money, of course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4348.907">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4349.548">No</a>  problem there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4351.049">But</a>  it was all programmed via cell phone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4354.032">We</a>  had no control over it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4355.393">It</a>  doesn't go over the internet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4356.854">And</a>  cell phone reception is terrible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4358.836">So</a>  this goes pre-pandemic days, for about three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4363.42">I</a>  would come over here to walk in the bell on the weekend, and the lights were on in my shop.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4368.064">What</a>  is going on?</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4369.585">And</a>  it was supposed to stop that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4373.027">And</a>  we just asked, can we just put in switches? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4375.428">Well,</a>  we didn't think, well, how long does it take to turn on the switches? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4378.369">So</a>  it just took, like, until two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4381.83">After</a>  we got back to schools, about a year and a half ago, we finally solved it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4385.831">And</a>  we haven't had a bunch of problems since. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4387.531">I</a>  don't know what they did, but they had a bunch of the guys from Georgia come out and figured it all out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4392.292">But</a>  just sometimes we run into old bills and things that are so high-tech. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4398.094">It's</a>  like software that is, it has all these whistles and bells. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4401.642">But</a>  you only need this 5%, you know what I'm saying? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4403.824">You</a>  don't need all this other stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4405.085">You</a>  only need 12 ways to do the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4407.106">Just</a>  think of the best way and let's go with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4409.949">Because</a>  I don't have the mental capacity to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4413.351">So</a>  I just think that this is something we're going to have to deal with throughout this whole process and review by our management. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4420.857">The</a>  other thing with regards to, I would like to see as part of this vision thing, is I would really, really like, I think, John would back me 100%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4429.731">is</a>  to have that having maintenance department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4433.235">We</a>  have a maintenance department that has a space, a little shop, a little warehouse, a place where they can take their lawnmowers in so we don't have to build these sheds all over the place, store them, work on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4447.95">The</a>  guy probably needs a pickup because they're always borrowing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4453.725">other</a>  shops, trucks when it snows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4455.886">We</a>  have our own snowplow and we have tried to form a relationship with maintenance because they need help. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4463.289">They</a>  need the facilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4464.61">They</a>  used to always borrow tools, ladders, scaffolds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4469.332">They</a>  need a vehicle and they need space to work and to do stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4474.114">They</a>  need their own staging, scaffolding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4477.536">So</a>  we have the kids, the cooperation, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4482.675">They</a>  rake leaves, they prune trees, they do the landscape. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4488.199">The</a>  kids have done all this gardening stuff out in front. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4491.702">Last</a>  year they were all out in the fields in these pulling weeds out of the break out of the center courtyard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4496.865">So</a>  we do stuff about paint. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4501.008">So</a>  every year we work with all the potholes and parking lots. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4505.992">Kids</a>  have resurfaced seal coated parking lots and painted all the stripes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4512.702">So</a>  since they do that, I would like the kids to get a little recognition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4517.244">And</a>  also, maybe that can be part of the new plan, which is collaboration, where the vocational students can take on some of that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4525.529">And</a>  we try and try to get some of these kids co-op jobs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4529.431">But</a>  in construction, you have to be 18. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4532.052">But</a>  they could work with school for a little bit here and there, maybe do some more merging. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4537.955">Regarding</a>  the last thing I'll say, the warehouse thing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4541.775">I</a>  just think the guys at CCW would like this at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4544.857">But</a>  that could be a stopgap thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4547.098">Have</a>  you ever been in that facility? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4549.26">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4549.52">I</a>  mean, it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4550.801">That's</a>  everything constructed for a stream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4553.523">It</a>  is nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4554.223">It's</a>  big. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4554.864">It</a>  has everything in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4556.865">If</a>  they can get a corner, maybe for the school district, if things run out of that for a while. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4562.402">I'm</a>  just, you know, you didn't hear that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4564.625">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4565.286">Well,</a>  you know, you're being recorded, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4567.629">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4568.109">So</a>  also in this document is a series of questions about budget.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4581.449">So</a>  does the facility maintenance person have a role in establishing the budget? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4585.772">What</a>  are the amounts that have been requested in the budget over a series of years? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4591.917">What</a>  was allocated in the budget over a series of years? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4595.06">If</a>  there is a variance, why was there a variance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4599.263">Expended</a>  budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4602.79">over</a>  a series of years, is there a variance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4607.811">If</a>  there's a variance of 20% or greater between consecutive years and the district's total expended amounts, please provide the details on the reason for the difference. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4615.834">Projected</a>  budget, I think we're actually on a better track there, so that is nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4621.226">Um,</a>  what does the district believe that, uh, the appropriate amount of spending on operations maintenance should be, um, to allow for routine maintenance of those facilities and how close are we? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4630.973">So</a>  we had lots of conversation at the council meeting last night, um, in particular because, um, that, uh, there are potential Proposition 2.5 overrides on the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4647.547">ballot</a>  in November, voted in last night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4651.129">And</a>  part of all of that money, $7.5 million across the two ballot measures, other than $500,000, would be directed towards schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4662.016">A</a>  big part of the planning that went into those numbers was things like making sure that we are able to provide routine maintenance that supports the district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4670.841">So</a>  that's a big deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4673.412">And</a>  then any other comments on your budget history, so we will talk about those upcoming items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4679.194">Then</a>  there's a capital program piece. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4681.655">We're</a>  in good shape from a capital program perspective because the city, we had a capital program for several years when Mayor Lungo-Koehn took the reins of the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4691.96">She</a>  created an integrated capital plan that included the schools and they used the <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4698.84">calling</a>  center to help establish that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4702.002">And</a>  then we are in the midst of a policy change on the school committee side to sort of codify our annual capital planning review process for schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4713.711">And</a>  then the capital budget history asks about tax overrides, capital exclusions, debt exclusions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4721.236">The</a>  answer to all of those is we have not done that before, but we're about to do it in November. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4726.995">And</a>  then any other capital projects that were deferred due to funding constraints. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4732.037">So</a>  I'm sure that we will have one or two items in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4736.818">The</a>  final section is the capital improvement plan and budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4741.22">So</a>  what is our capital improvement plan and budget? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4744.661">So</a>  we will attach the city's capital improvement plan and some of the other documents that we have internally, and then provide any information about availability of non-public funds for school facility purposes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4756.307">We'll</a>  talk about our rentals and some other things there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4760.73">And</a>  then provide information from the Treasurer Finance Committee or Capital Planning Committee regarding the outstanding debt and future bond capacity inside the debt limit for municipalities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4770.758">And</a>  so that will come from the bankers office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4774.548">And</a>  then this last table was just a table, one of the tables that have to be sort of filled out and completed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4780.912">So</a>  all this document is really just to allow us to start to collect the information where that ultimately then has to be keyed into the system in a very particular way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4791.84">So</a>  I wanted to share this with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4795.834">Find</a>  out if you have questions or comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4798.935">Our</a>  working goal is, again, that by June 30th, this will be done and we will be able to submit it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4806.296">We</a>  actually have until, I think, October to do this, but we can't go to that next phase of the process until we're done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4811.697">So</a>  our goal is to get all of this documentation pulled together and buttoned up between now and then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4817.859">So</a>  questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4823.957">Would</a>  anybody like to make a motion to authorize Dr. Cushing and I to complete and submit the questionnaire? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4836.362">Okay,</a>  so motion for myself and Dr. Cushing to complete this questionnaire as requested by Nicole Morell, seconded by Emily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4849.327">Thank</a>  you, Emily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4853.439">Okay,</a>  all those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4855.504">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4856.385">All</a>  those opposed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4858.39">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4858.971">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4865.089">We</a>  are at the end of our agenda, a few minutes early. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4868.93">Our</a>  next full meeting is scheduled at six o'clock on July 17th via Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4874.812">I</a>  will be in touch with the communications committee so that we can find another date hopefully in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4879.934">And</a>  I think the next steps are to finish up these forms and get everything submitted and look forward to that feasibility study vote by the council on the 25th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4893.939">so</a>  that we are sort of off to the races, and then use the summer to do our community engagement planning and do some touring. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4902.484">So</a>  between now and July 1, I'm going to say I will be back in touch with you if I am able to sort of shift things around and schedule some dates and times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4913.251">So</a>  those two meetings may not stay on the calendar exactly as they are, but I will let you know as soon as I have ideas and plans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4922.289">Generally</a>  speaking, if we're going to go to a school in the summer, I think folks are going to lean toward wanting to host us not in the evenings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4934.281">Is</a>  there a time frame that works better for you all than others? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4942.332">I'm</a>  assuming it's summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4943.412">It's</a>  going to be sort of a Monday to Friday-ish thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4947.654">And</a>  probably they're going to ask for us not to come from 6 to 8, but I will certainly ask if that's a possibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4954.176">So</a>  are there other times, like generally speaking, that like is morning better than afternoon? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4961.099">Is</a>  afternoon better than lunchtime? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4962.799">Is</a>  lunchtime the best? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4963.96">Like</a>  any feedback about scheduling? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4966.48">I</a>  know it's all impossible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4969.481">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4970.182">Emily?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4971.718">flexible,</a>  but I assume we're not going to get a critical loss of our feedback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4976.743">It's</a>  just probably going to be something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4978.804">Some</a>  school, that's a great example, just offers themselves and we take it where we don't, right?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4984.469">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4984.89">Yeah,</a>  we're going to have more conversations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4988.473">I</a>  think that we should prioritize whatever school is the best example for us to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4993.217">That's</a>  my take. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4994.318">Okay,</a>  Nicole? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=4995.739">I</a>  think it'd be nice to just not be Derek Overshoe or Cam Tinker.</p>

    <p>[Libby Brown]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5000.069">So,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5003.095">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5005.38">Any</a>  other questions comments about timing and scheduling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5010.501">I</a>  know it's all tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5011.961">So</a>  like I said, I will ask if there are people willing to host us on an evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5016.883">And</a>  maybe there's evening programming going on in the building where somebody would be willing to do that, or the architects would be willing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5022.664">The</a>  designers often are willing to sort of help make those things happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5026.765">So</a>  I will do some outreach and be in touch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5031.666">I'm</a>  sure the HMFH would be very happy to take a group back to Arlington. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5037.207">I</a>  know some of you got to see Arlington. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5040.244">It</a>  was just right next door, which is amazing and was very cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5046.549">So</a>  I will be in touch on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5047.65">And</a>  as soon as I have dates, I will have Lisa send them out to you all so that you have them on your calendar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5052.934">And</a>  you all should have district email now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5057.158">If</a>  you have questions about that, you can see Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5062.282">And</a>  is there a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5065.625">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Luke. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5067.887">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5069.235">by</a>  Libby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5069.895">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5071.717">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5072.757">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5074.658">Meeting</a>  is adjourned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-06-12-24&start=5075.299">Thank</a>  you guys.</p>
